When McDonald's (MCD) told employees at company-owned restaurants three years ago that they were getting a raise, workers cheered. CEO Steve Easterbrook said at the time that the enhanced compensation package, including better benefits, would make a real difference in workers' lives.\n\nThree years later, McDonald's efforts haven't kept pace with increasing minimum wages.\n\nMcDonald's move to boost pay came in April of 2015, as union-led protests that came to be known as the Fight for $15 were sweeping the nation. Under pressure from activists, the company said that it would set the starting pay for 90,000 workers at company-owned restaurants in the U.S. at one dollar over the local minimum wage. The announcement generated a raft of generally positive headlines, with Easterbrook touting his desire to build a progressive burger company.\n\nWorkers say McDonald's hasn't delivered.\n\nMcDonald's publicity stunt has turned out to be a sham, Kuper, an employee at a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago, said in a statement emailed by Fight for $15.\n\nMost McDonald's restaurants are independently operated as franchises, with the owner setting the wage structure rather than leaders at the company.\n\nFor its part, McDonald's doesn't dispute that pay at its restaurants hasn't kept pace with local wages. Instead, it contends that the company never intended to continuously keep raising wages so that it remained at least $1 above the minimum wage.\n\nThe increase announced in 2015 was applicable to the local wages on July 1, 2015, and was not a policy thereafter, Terri Hickey, a spokesperson for McDonald's said in an email.\n\nMcDonald's never promised that it would always keep wages $1 above the minimum, but executives did indicate a commitment to higher wages.\n\nShortly after the sweetened pay package was announced in April 2015, for example, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan told analysts in an earnings call that boosting worker pay would enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace by helping McDondald's attract and retain the best employees.\n\nThat same month, Easterbrook echoed that theme in an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune. I believe the time is right to take a first step in rewarding our team members who work so hard every day, he said. Wage is just one part of the equation. Getting people started on the road to success by providing the skills, training and opportunities they need to continuously improve is also important.\n\nThe Fight for $15 campaign provided to CBS MoneyWatch recent pay stubs for 16 McDonald's workers in three major metropolitan areas showing cooks and cashiers earning hourly wages significantly below a dollar above the minimum.\n\nIn Los Angeles, where the minimum hourly wage is $12, workers at McDonald's corporate-owned stores make as little as $12.62 an hour. In San Jose, California, where the minimum wage is $13.50, workers at corporate-run McDonald's make as little as $14.10.\n\nKuper earns $11.40 an hour in Chicago, where the minimum wage is $11. That would mean an hourly rate of $12, or just under $25,000 a year working full-time, if McDonald's was to keep a buck ahead of the local wage mandate.\n\nProtests over wages were planned Tuesday at McDonald's stores in metro areas including Chicago, Los Angeles and San Jose, California, Fight for $15 said.
SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco's buses, trains and transit shelters will no longer display advertising that includes political messages, CBS San Francisco reports.\n\nThe San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency board voted unanimously -- and without discussion -- to approve a new advertising policy that prohibits ads concerning public or political issues.\n\nThe revised policy also prohibits ads that include profanity, violent images and descriptions, and ads that are insulting, disparaging, degrading, demeaning or otherwise offensive, as well as those that are viewed as potentially harmful or disruptive.\n\nPolitical ads have caused controversy for Muni -- the transportation agency -- in the past. Most notably, a series of anti-Muslim ads posted by the American Freedom Defense Initiative in recent years have been denounced by city officials.\n\nThese ads have generated complaints from our customers and our operators and have distracted from our ability to run the transit system, Muni Finance Manager Gail Stein said Wednesday in a presentation to the board.\n\nMuni officials have in the past said they could not turn down political ads based on content, without risking First Amendment lawsuits.\n\nThe changes adopted, however, are based similar policies adopted successfully by other transit agencies around the country.\n\nStein said advertising provides around $20 million in annual revenue for Muni.
Philip Scheffler, CBS News' first television street reporter, a documentary producer and the executive editor at 60 Minutes for many years, died Thursday in New York-Presbyterian/Cornell Weill Medical Center. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan. Until recently he also spent much of his time in Essex, Connecticut, where he had a home for decades.\n\nPhil Scheffler, 2013 CBS News\n\nScheffler retired from 60 Minutes in June of 2003 and had served as a consultant to CBS News up until a few years ago. He was a friend and mentor to Jeff Fager, executive producer of 60 Minutes. Phil was a guiding force behind the success of 60 Minutes for more than two decades, said Fager. Don Hewitt often said he couldn't have done it without him. He was a first-class journalist, an admirable human being, and a great friend to many of us. We will miss him very much.\n\nScheffler was a reporter and producer for CBS News for the first half of his 52-year career. He became the senior producer at 60 Minutes in 1980, handling the day-to-day responsibilities - essentially the right hand of the broadcast's executive producer Don Hewitt. Hewitt named him executive editor later. In this capacity, Scheffler had a direct hand in producing every 60 Minutes report broadcast from 1980 to 2003 - a period during which 60 Minutes was the number-one program in America five times.\n\nScheffler oversaw the reporting from the field and handled most of the producers' journalistic issues, enabling Hewitt to focus almost exclusively on shaping the newsmagazine's stories. When tempers flared in the screening room between Hewitt and one of his correspondents, such as Mike Wallace or Morley Safer, it was the professorial Scheffler, sporting a bow tie and close-cropped beard, who played referee.\n\nPhil Scheffler, 1964 CBS Photo Archive\n\nBefore his senior positions, Scheffler produced 60 Minutes stories over nine seasons for Wallace, Safer, Harry Reasoner and Dan Rather. His first story with Safer was After Attica, a look inside a maximum security prison in Colorado broadcast after the horrible riots in the New York prison in 1971.\n\nHewitt hired him in March of 1951 as a copy boy for Douglas Edwards with the News, which Hewitt directed and produced. Debuting in May 1948, that broadcast was the first network television news program, and in 1951, Scheffler became its first street reporter.\n\nHis first field assignment was to ask people whether they thought Gen. Dwight Eisenhower should enter politics and run for the Republican presidential nomination. But reporting was only one of the hats worn by early television news people like Scheffler. Out of necessity, he also invented a makeshift news teleprompter.\n\nHewitt wanted his anchor, Edwards, to look at the camera instead of his script when reading the news, so he had Scheffler make cue cards. My first job at CBS Television News, recalls Scheffler, was to hand print Douglas Edwards' copy on two-by-three-foot cue cards. Then, when we were on the air, I would hold them up next to the camera lens and move them up a line at a time for Doug to read. My arms were always tired and sore, so I asked Don if the camera could move in closer. He put on a wide-angle lens and moved the camera to within 10 feet of Doug, and I started typing the copy using wide adding-machine paper and a huge-type typewriter. It was the first crude teleprompter, but I didn't have the wit to develop it! said Scheffler in 2001.\n\nPhilip Scheffler, 1981 CBS Photo Archive\n\nIn 1953, Scheffler was drafted into the Army and served his two years. During this period, he convinced his superior officer that he could put the Army on television - as long as he could get a few weekends off to film the piece! The result was a feature series in weekly installments he helped produce and write for CBS in which a Korean War recruit was followed through basic training at New Jersey's Fort Dix. Scheffler returned to CBS and continued working as writer, reporter and producer for the nightly network news and other regularly scheduled CBS News programs through the 1950s.\n\nThe news program, Eyewitness, was Scheffler's next stop, where he served as associate producer and on-air reporter for the half-hour weekly from 1960 to 1963. He briefly served as an associate producer on The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, where he covered the Kennedy assassination, before joining the documentary unit in 1964. There, Scheffler became a producer of documentary and special news broadcasts, including CBS Special Reports and CBS Reports. He produced more than 100 of them, including: After 10 Years: The Court and the Schools (1964), on school integration; CBS Reports: Robert F. Kennedy (1967), on Sen. Kennedy and his political ambitions; and The Cities (1968), about the nation's urban crisis.\n\nPhilip Scheffler, 1981 CBS Photo Archive\n\nScheffler's assignments took him to 47 states and to 50 foreign countries, including Vietnam. He traveled there for six assignments during the war; his output included three two-hour specials on American policy in Southeast Asia, Where We Stand in Vietnam (1967), Where We Stand in Indochina (1970), and The Changing War in Indochina (1971).\n\nCBS News broadcasts that Scheffler worked on, especially 60 Minutes, have received the industry's highest recognition, including the Peabody, DuPont and Emmy awards. In 1981, he received the Alumni Award for distinguished contributions to journalism from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, from which he received a master's degree. As an adjunct professor, he once taught classes there as well.\n\nPhilip Scheffler, 1981 CBS Photo Archive\n\nScheffler was born Sept. 16, 1930 in New York City and was graduated from the City College of New York. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Linda Weingarten Scheffler, a clinical psychologist, author and retired professor at Hunter College in New York City, his daughter, Ramsay Klaff, of Massachusetts and a son, Adam, of Chicago.
SONOMA, Calif. -- Video footage of the violent takedown of a teenage girl by a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy last year has been publicly released.\n\nCBS San Francisco reports that the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office released video footage from the body-worn cameras documenting the arrest of Gabrielle Lemos on June 14, 2015, as well as subsequent recordings of her telephone calls from jail.\n\nThe sheriff's office released the video and audio recordings Thursday, only after they were introduced as an exhibit in Sonoma County Superior Court, making them public information.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, Deputy Marcus Holton was in a rural area of Sonoma County when he happened upon a parked pickup truck and trailer that was blocking the road. As he investigated, he heard a woman screaming from the house nearby. He saw a man walking quickly towards the pickup truck from the house with several women yelling at him. One of the women was crying. Based on what he saw and heard he suspected he had encountered a domestic related incident.\n\nThe body cam videos, which were posted Thursday evening to the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office YouTube Channel, shows Deputy Holton investigating why the truck is stopped with the motor running in the middle of a rural road in Petaluma, and why there is yelling.\n\nIn the videos, four women are arguing with Deputy Holton for several minutes and then another deputy arrives on scene. The verbal confrontation continues for several more minutes with the family demanding a female officer.\n\nHolton then takes down Gabrielle as she is walking away, apparently ignoring his orders to stop.\n\nHolton's body camera fell off during the confrontation.\n\nAs Gabrielle is loaded into the back of the cruiser, you can see blood on her face.\n\nGabrielle has since filed a civil rights case against the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office. Shortly after doing so the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office filed charges against her.\n\nGabrielle's attorney, Izaak Schwaiger, wrote on Facebook Thursday: Here is the video of a Sonoma County Sheriff's assault on an innocent girl. Share far and wide.\n\nOne of the jail phone call audio recordings is of Gabrielle speaking to her mother Michelle Lemos, describing what happened after she left her mother's house in the back of the cruiser.\n\nThe contents of the conversations on the video and in the audio recordings contains explicit language.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff's Office released the following statement:\n\nDeputy Holton was well within his authority and Sheriff's Office policy to investigate this matter for a possible criminal violation. His conduct and that of the other Deputies involved has been reviewed by Sheriff's Office Administrators and we are confident they acted honorably and appropriately during this tense rapidly evolving situation.
After dropping for three years in a row, U.S. carbon emissions spiked in 2018, demonstrating how hard it can be to move away from fossil fuels while the economy is growing.\n\nPreliminary data from the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy, found that emissions rose 3.4 percent last year. That's even as Americans' reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hit a 40-year low.\n\nWhile a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, natural gas not only beat out renewables to [replace] most of this lost generation but also fed most of the growth in electricity demand, the report said.\n\nNatural gas, which has become a cheap and attractive competitor to coal, is cleaner-burning, but it is still a fossil fuel, emitting about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. Earlier studies have found that switching over all the world's coal plants to natural gas would do little to curb climate change.\n\nThe Trump administration's rollback of environmental laws and decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords play a role in the increase. But the main culprit is last year's spike in economic growth. Between 2007 and 2015, U.S. emissions came down 12 percent as utilities brought on clean-energy technology and the Great Recession dampened demand for power. In 2016 and 2017, emissions still decreased, but more slowly. Last year, as the economy expanded at the fastest pace in 15 years, boosted by tax cuts and other measures, emissions also grew at a record-setting pace.\n\nSo long as the economy is growing, that dynamic isn't going to change without a lot of breakthrough technology innovations or federal policy actions, John Larsen, one of the report's authors, told Greentech Media.\n\nThe transportation sector was the largest source of carbon emissions last year, with a slight drop in gasoline demand more than offset by increased trucking and air travel. Transport-sector emissions grew 1 percent last year, the same as 2017, according to Rhodium. In this sector, increases in efficiency—doing more with less power—and a move toward electric transport is beginning to make a dent, although a small one.\n\nThe largest emissions growth was in sectors that don't get much attention outside climate policy circles: Industry and buildings. The industrial sector added 55 million metric tons of carbon last year, more than four times its annual average in the past decade, because of an uptick in industrial activity. The sector is predicted to grow its gassiness and to become the leading carbon emitter in Texas within three years, according to Rhodium.\n\nAbsent a significant change in policy or a major technological breakthrough we expect the industrial sector to become an increasingly large share of US greenhouse gas emission in the years ahead, the report found.\n\nEmissions from buildings increased by 54 million tons last year, a sevenfold increase from its typical rate of increase. That's partly because of weather, with a colder winter requiring more heating, but Rhodium expects population growth to keep driving emissions in this sector.\n\nThe prospect of reducing emissions by up to 28 percent from their 2005 levels—as the U.S. would be required to do under the Paris climate agreement—will require a radical shift. It would mean cutting emissions at nearly double the pace of their 2007-to-2015 decline. That prospect, while not impossible, would require an immediate policy shift or a technological breakthrough, Rhodium found.\n\nThe U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets. The gap is even wider headed into 2019, it said.

Washington - Delta Air Lines can't get eight new aircraft in the air. Roughly a million government employees and contractors aren't being paid. Some Americans who are trying to start small businesses face delays in obtaining the required tax identification number from the IRS.\n\nAs the partial government shutdown moves through its fourth week with no end in sight, the economic blow is hitting not only federal workers but also businesspeople, households and travelers across the country. And while the damage to the overall economy so far remains slight, economist foresee real damage if the shutdown drags into February or beyond.\n\nEven if the shutdown is over by the end of the month, the hit to growth will be material, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note.\n\nShepherdson projects that after growing for nearly 10 years, the economy might even contract in this year's first quarter if the shutdown lasts through March. Other forecasts are less dire. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, thinks if the shutdown extends that long, the economy would slow by 0.5 percentage point but would remain on solid footing.\n\nS&P Global estimated the U.S. economy had lost $3.6 billion as of Jan. 11. If the shutdown continues. the loss could soon exceed the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump is asking for the proposed border wall, S&P Global estimated.\n\n\n\nThat may seem like pennies for the world's biggest economy, but it means a lot to those workers trying to cover their household costs without their paychecks, Beth Ann Bovino, the S&P Global chief economist, wrote in a report.\n\nFor now, though, the shutdown is rippling through the economy in ways that are not always visible, making it hard to fully assess its consequences. Complicating the task is that much of the economic data the government normally provides — from retail sales to home construction to the nation's GDP — has been suspended because the agencies that compile it remain closed.\n\nWith national parks shut down and some travelers suffering through long security lines and in some cases partial airport closures, for example, many Americans are having to decide whether to cancel travel and vacation plans.\n\nIt is now plainly evident that the shutdown is affecting air travel, and when that happens, damage to the overall U.S. economy will shortly follow, said Jonathan Grella, a spokesman for the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group.\n\nSome companies are pointing to specific problems: Delta said Tuesday the shutdown is costing it $25 million a month in government travel. Delta CEO Edward Bastian said with the Federal Aviation Administration partially closed, Delta will also likely delay the start date of eight new aircraft.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees public stock offerings, is mostly closed because of the shutdown. As a result, some companies that had been planning initial public offerings in coming months, including Uber and Lyft, are likely facing delays. Marianne Lake, chief financial officer for JPMorgan Chase, said the bank could lose out on fees from IPOs and merger and acquisition deals that would be delayed if other shuttered agencies can't approve them.\n\nFor small companies, too, the effects are increasingly making a mark. Edward Farrer, an executive at Principal Manufacturing, a manufacturer in Broadview, Illinois, said when the shutdown took effect, his company had nearly won approval for a request to the Commerce Department to import specialty steel from Europe free of U.S. tariffs. Commerce is among the now-closed government departments.\n\nWe think we'd got it to the goal line and were waiting for an approval, but everything is at an impasse because of the shutdown, Farrer said.\n\nPrincipal Manufacturing uses mainly American-made steel in the parts it sells to automakers and other industrial companies. But it imports some steel from Europe that it uses to make a component for auto underbodies. Last spring, it asked the Trump administration to exclude that steel from the 25 percent tariffs the White House imposed on steel imports. Commerce was considering the request as part of a process the administration had established for companies that say they can't obtain the steel they import from elsewhere.\n\nFor now, Farrer said Principal is paying the tariffs, which typically cost it tens of thousands of dollars a month. It wants to keep doing the work, so the company is eating the cost, Farrer said. But we can't do it forever.\n\nNeil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber has heard from members that have been unable to obtain an employer ID number from the IRS. That number is needed to open bank accounts and file tax returns.\n\nEric Smith, an IRS spokesman, said most U.S.-based businesses can obtain the numbers online, but paper applications aren't being processed.\n\nThe most hard-hit by the shutdown, of course, are government workers themselves, who missed their first paychecks Friday, and contractors that work closely with the government. Many have had to cut back on purchases, lowering overall consumer spending.\n\nAmong them is Pearl Fraley of Greenville, North Carolina, a consumer safety inspector for the food safety inspection service. Fraley, 53, helps ensure the safety of the nation's food supply by monitoring slaughter processing plants -- a job she has held for over 15 years.\n\nFraley's position is deemed essential, so she has to go to work even though she isn't being paid. She and her co-workers were told in an email that if they work 40 hours, they aren't eligible for unemployment benefits under North Carolina rules -- even though they're receiving no pay.\n\nFraley said she feels like an indentured servant and said her stress level is over the top.\n\nI can't pay my rent, she said. I can't pay my car payment or insurance. I have money for gas to go to work and for food.\n\nFor now, her 25-year-old daughter is contributing some of the money she earns from working at McDonald's. McDonald's doesn't typically pay enough for someone to actually live on, Fraley noted.\n\nMoody's Zandi said the shutdown could inflict longer-term damage on the government — and ultimately on the economy — in ways that might not be obvious. He noted, for example, that some demoralized federal employees, particularly those with vital skills in such areas as cybersecurity, might quit for jobs in the private sector. Federal agencies may also have a harder time recruiting young workers.\n\nGovernment workers have options, Zandi said, particularly with unemployment low and many employers desperate to fill jobs. This could be quite debilitating to the government.
For 16 years, presidents have sat for interviews ahead of the Super Bowl, a tradition that began when CBS sportscaster Jim Nantz interviewed then-President George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nLast year, ahead of the big game, President Trump spoke with Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan in the Blue Room of the White House. The president discussed the fight over border security funding, his disagreements with the intelligence community, the situation in Venezuela and the fight against ISIS in Syria.\n\nHere were some of the big moments from Mr. Trump's Super Bowl interview last year:\n\nKeeping an eye on Iran:\n\nDuring his pre-Super Bowl interview with Face the Nation, Mr. Trump said he wanted to leave troops and an unbelievable and expensive military base in Iraq to keep an eye on Iran as it continued to build upon its nuclear capabilities.\n\nTrump said the United States has spent a fortune on the Al Asad Air Base in western Iraq and that the United States should hold on to it.\n\nOne of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem, he said in the CBS interview. Flash forward one year, that very same base came under attack as Iran launched more than a dozen missiles in retaliation for the U.S. killing top military leader Qassem Soleimani.\n\nAll I want to do is to be able to watch. We have an unbelievable and expensive base built in Iraq. It's perfectly situated for looking at all over, different parts of the troubled Middle East, rather than pulling up, he said.\n\nNot having to agree with intelligence chiefs on global threats:\n\nAfter U.S. intelligence chiefs seemed to be at odds with Mr. Trump on several topics during congressional testimony on the threat posed by Russia and North Korea, he called them naive and suggested they might need to go back to school.\n\nBut on Face the Nation, the president indicated it was more the questions and answers about the worldwide threats report that troubled him, and he went on to tout the success of U.S. efforts around the globe.\n\nMy intelligence people, if they said in fact that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I disagree with them 100 percent. It is a vicious country that kills many people, he said.\n\nWhen pressed on the intelligence community's assessment that Iran was technically in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal, Trump said he doesn't have to agree with his intelligence chiefs.\n\nI have intel people, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. President Bush had intel people that said Saddam Hussein in Iraq had nuclear weapons, had all sorts of weapons of mass destruction. Guess what? Those intel people didn't know what the hell they were doing, and they got us tied up in a war that we should have never been in.\n\nA very good chance the U.S. would be able to make a deal with North Korea:\n\nAt the time, Mr. Trump told Margaret Brennan that there was a very good chance the U.S. would be able to make a deal with North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons program.\n\nThey think it's historic. And we'll see what happens. Now that doesn't mean we are going to make a deal. But, certainly, I think we have a very good chance of making a deal, he said.\n\nBut two fizzled summits later, North Korea still appears poised to fast-track their nuclear capabilities.\n\nTrump's feelings on his son playing football:\n\nMr. Trump said he would have a hard time allowing his 12-year-old son Barron to play football amid growing concerns over the safety of the sport.\n\nI just don't like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football — I mean, it's a dangerous sport and I think it's really tough. I thought the equipment would get better, and it has. The helmets have gotten far better but it hasn't solved the problem, Mr. Trump said.\n\nI hate to say it because I love to watch football, he said. I think the NFL is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son — well, I've heard NFL players saying they wouldn't let their sons play football. So, it's not totally unique, but I would have a hard time with it, he added.\n\nAt the time of the interview, the NFL announced that concussions were down 29 percent in 2018, from 190 a year ago to 135 the 2019 season.\n\nMr. Trump's relationship with the NFL has been fraught with tension during his time in office. Amid growing protests against racial injustice led by NFL players on the sidelines of pro games, the president has said players should be forced to stand as the national anthem played, claiming players were being disrespectful to the American flag and service members.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke about impeachment and foreign policy as the Senate convened on Friday, after President Trump authorized a strike that killed Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani.\n\nThe architect and chief engineer for the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military, McConnell said on the Senate floor. Now his terrorist leadership has been ended.\n\nMcConnell took a veiled shot at Democrats who have expressed skepticism about the strike, urging them to withhold judgment until the administration had provided more information.\n\nI recommend that all senators wait to review the facts and hear from the administration before passing much public judgment on this operation and its potential consequences, McConnell said, adding that the administration would be briefing Senate staff on Friday, and would provide a full briefing to the Senate next week.\n\nLawmakers are divided over the strike, with Democrats arguing it could lead to an escalation of violence in the Middle East and Republicans praising Mr. Trump for taking decisive action. Schumer was not informed of the strike before it occurred, CNN reported.\n\nIn his speech, Schumer said that it was important for the president to consult with Congress before making critical foreign policy decisions.\n\nIt is paramount for administrations to get an outside view to prevent groupthink and rash action, Schumer said. The administration did not consult in this case.\n\nHe questioned the legal basis for conducting the operation, as well as how the administration plans to avoid a larger and potentially endless conflagration in the Middle East.\n\nIt is my view that the president does not have the authority for a war in Iran, Schumer said.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers remain at an impasse over Mr. Trump's impeachment trial. Schumer has called for witnesses from the White House, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but McConnell has rebuffed the request.\n\nAfter addressing the strike against Soleimani, McConnell slammed the impeachment inquiry spearheaded by House Democrats.\n\nDemocrats have let 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' develop into a kind of partisan fever, McConnell said. He argued that senators have a right to think politically during an impeachment trial, despite swearing an oath of impartiality.\n\nAlthough the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump in December, the Senate is still waiting for the House to send the articles of impeachment.\n\nMcConnell accused House Democrats of developing cold feet by choosing not to immediately send the articles to the Senate, and said they were searching desperately for some new talking point on impeachment.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far declined to send the articles to the Senate. She said in December she wants to wait to see the process that's set forth in the Senate before appointing the House impeachment managers who will act as prosecutors in the Senate trial. The House is also expected to vote on a resolution designating the impeachment before delivering the articles.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Friday, McConnell said it's a non-starter for Pelosi to hand-design the Senate trial. He also called out out Schumer for campaigning in 1998 on opposition to President Clinton's impeachment, responding to the accusation that McConnell has prejudged Mr. Trump's case.\n\nOne symptom of Trump derangement syndrome is a bad case of amnesia, McConnell said with a small grin. He also noted that Senate rules do not allow an impeachment trial to begin until the House sends the articles.\n\nTheir turn is over. They've done enough damage, McConnell said about the House. It's the Senate's turn now to render sober judgment as the framers envisioned. But we can't hold a trial without the articles.\n\nIn a statement responding to McConnell, Pelosi gave no indication of when the House would transmit the articles to the Senate.\n\nToday, Leader McConnell made clear that he will feebly comply with President Trump's cover-up of his abuses of power and be an accomplice to that cover-up, Pelosi said. Every Senator now faces a choice: to be loyal to the President or the Constitution. The GOP Senate must immediately proceed in a manner worthy of the Constitution and in light of the gravity of the President's unprecedented abuses.\n\nSchumer also countered in his speech that McConnell was trying to defend holding an impartial, unfair trial.\n\nAs all eyes turn to the Senate, the question before us is: Will we fulfill our duty to conduct a fair impeachment trial of the president of the United States, or will we not, Schumer said. He also said that McConnell has not provided one good reason that the Senate should not hear from public witnesses.\n\nThere is only one precedent that matters. There has never, never in the history of our country been an impeachment trial of a President in which the Senate was denied the ability to hear from witnesses, Schumer said, calling McConnell an executioner of a fair trial.\n\nWhen you are accused of something you don't suppress evidence would exonerate you, Schumer said, questioning why the administration would not want witnesses to appear before the Senate. He added, scathingly, that if the Senate did not allow impeachment managers to call witnesses, the impeachment trial will be a nationally televised meeting of the mock trial club.\n\nThe Constitution does not delineate how the House should execute its powers of impeachment, saying only that the House shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. After impeachment, it falls to the Senate to try the president and vote on whether he should be removed from office.
The push for legalized marijuana has moved into Utah and Oklahoma, two of the most conservative states in the country, further underscoring how quickly feelings about marijuana are changing in the United States.\n\nIf the two measures pass, Utah and Oklahoma will join 30 other states that have legalized some form of medical marijuana, according to the pro-pot National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws. Nine of those states and Washington, D.C. also have broad legalization where adults 21 and older can use pot for any reason. Michigan could become the 10th state with its ballot initiative this year.\n\nUtah and Oklahoma already are among 16 states that allow for use an oil called cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound from cannabis that doesn't get users high but can treat a range of health concerns.\n\nJustin Strekal, political director for NORML, is confident the Utah and Oklahoma measures will pass.\n\nAmerica's appetite for cannabis is not going away, Strekal said. We are in the death rattles of prohibition.\n\nMarijuana legalization efforts have faced some pushback from religions before — including in 2016 in Arizona and Nevada from the Mormon church, and the same year from the Catholic Church in Massachusetts. But not to the scale they could face this year in Utah, where Mormons account for about two-third of the population, said Matthew Schweich, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project.\n\nMormons have long frowned upon marijuana use because of a key church health code called the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out against the proposal this month, saying in a statement drugs designed to ease suffering should be tested and approved by government officials first. The church said it respects the wise counsel of doctors, and commended the Utah Medical Association for opposing it. The association has accused organizers of trying to disguise their intention of simply paving the way for legalizing recreational marijuana.\n\nUtah Gov. Gary Herbert told middle school students in January that he thinks medical marijuana will someday be legalized in the state but in March he announced his opposition to the ballot question, which he argues lacks safeguards for the growing and distribution of marijuana.\n\nAdvocates remain confident that they've crafted a medical marijuana measure that respects the Mormon church and culture while providing much-needed relief for people with chronic pain, Schweich said. His Washington, D.C.-based organization helped draft the measure.\n\nUnlike other medical marijuana states, Utah's proposal would not allow pot smoking or for residents to grow their own, Schweich said. It would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation to allow people with certain medical conditions to get a card and use the drug in edible forms like candy, in topical forms like lotions or balms, as an oil or in electronic cigarettes. Proponents turned in the signatures Monday to get the measure on the ballot in November.\n\nIt's a question of compassion, Schweich said.\n\nOklahoma will vote in June on its proposal that would allow doctors to recommend that patients receive a medical marijuana license allowing them to legally possess up to three ounces of the drug, six mature plants and six seedlings.\n\nTed Lyon, a 78-year-old Mormon, is a supporter because he saw in the past decade how medical marijuana helped two of his neighbors in Provo — one with multiple sclerosis and another who has seizures. He said he wouldn't support the drug's legalization for recreational use.\n\nLyon, a retired professor at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning Mormons who will see the benefits.\n\nIn 10 years, the church may say something different, Lyon said. This is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. My father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'If you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'\n\nNathan Frodsham, a 45-year-old married Mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in Seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck.\n\nFrodsham wasn't discouraged by the Mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in Arizona and Nevada. He said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited.\n\nI think there's some room for interpretation on this, said Frodsham.\n\nThe 4,500-member Utah Medical Association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said Michelle McOmber, the group's CEO.\n\nWe want to be very careful about what we bring into our state, McOmber said. This is an addictive drug.
President Donald Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania in 2016 by less than 1%. To win in the upcoming election, he or the 2020 Democrat will need support from a crucial group of voters in the swing state: suburban women.\n\nEight women across the political spectrum from suburbs outside of Philadelphia told CBS This Morning co-host Anthony Mason what they thought about Mr. Trump, the Democratic candidates and issues like the economy and foreign policy. Here's what they had to say:\n\nOn President Trump\n\nFour of the women said they could not vote for Mr. Trump. One of them, Melinda Wolff, said she doesn't like to be labeled as either a Democrat or a Republican, but describing a candidate she would vote for, said, I want somebody I can look up to, somebody that has dignity, somebody that's not bullying.\n\nMaryEllen Digregorio, who flipped from voting Democrat to voting for Mr. Trump in 2016, said she doesn't see Trump as bullying.\n\nI see him challenging because the ridiculous that goes on sometimes, she said. I thought it was refreshing to find a businessman who made himself a millionaire want to work for me.\n\nI do have to ask, don't you think he's very thin-skinned? Cynthia Sabatini, an Independent who is registered as a Republican, asked Digregorio about Mr. Trump.\n\nListen, my husband's thin-skinned and a whackadoodle, and I'm still with him 26 years, she said.\n\nSabatini said she thinks a politician needs to be thicker skinned and not excoriate those who disagree with him.\n\nJulia Bohnenberger, a registered Republican who said she voted for Mr. Trump because he was the most qualified candidate, said part of Mr. Trump's appeal is that he punches back at people.\n\nPast Republicans, she said, have failed because they've taken the high road and they've been buried by it.\n\nI'm not saying that this necessarily appeals to me, but I think Trump appeals to a lot of people because he punches back, she said.\n\nMary Lou Doyle, who plans to vote for Mr. Trump in the 2020 election, said the president isn't everyone's cup of tea, without a doubt.\n\nI don't like everything he says, she said. I don't need him to be like me. I need to be safe, and I need to be able to know that my economy for my friends, my family is solid.\n\nOn the Democratic candidates\n\nCharrele Robinson-Brown, a Democrat with some conservative ideals, was the only Democrat in the group who had chosen who she will vote for. She said she has picked former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAsked why, she said, Honestly, the lesser of the evils.\n\nHe's got past experience, Digregorio pointed out.\n\nWolff said she will vote for who can best beat Trump.\n\nDebbie Morse, a Democrat, agreed with Wolff. And I do think Biden's probably at the top of the list, but I'm still looking at the other candidates also.\n\n\n\nNelly Jimenez, an Independent who said she will not vote for Mr. Trump, said she is concerned she'll have to vote for the less evil of the Democratic party or whoever else shows up.\n\nI am disappointed. I don't have choices. I don't feel that I have someone who's going to move me, she said.\n\n\n\nSabatini argued Jimenez could write in a candidate instead. I did a write-in in 2016, she said. My family took issue with me that I was complicit in Trump's election … But it was a matter of conscience.\n\nOn foreign policy\n\nMr. Trump's international policy has been bold and effective in ways that we never anticipated. Getting rid of ISIS, getting rid of Soleimani, getting rid of al-Baghdadi, Bohnenberger said.\n\nI will tell you personally, I'm a Zionist, she added. For a president to so boldly stand for Israel is very important to me, and I'm a Christian, by the way.\n\nBohnenberger also said strong borders were important to her.\n\nJimenez said she was concerned about the way people and children have been treated at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThere is a lot of issues for me there about racial profiling, she said. The issue of the border is one that I can't forget or forgive.\n\nRobinson-Brown agreed. I think that Donald Trump is allowing people to make the decision to mistreat people at the border, to have racially charged marches, she said.\n\nRobinson-Brown said she likes that Mr. Trump takes hard stances on some things, but, she said, he's not taking the hard stance on the racial issues, which are very close to me because I'm a black female.\n\nWe need for him to take a hard line … and say, 'Hey listen, we don't act like that here,' she added.\n\nOn the economy\n\nI like the fact that my portfolio looks pretty nice right now. I can make my taxes next year 'cause as time goes by cost of living does not match the cost of really living, Digregorio said.\n\nSabatini questioned the tax cuts under Mr. Trump.\n\nEconomic fairness is very important to me, she said. I'm not a Bernie Sanders supporter, I'm not an Elizabeth Warren supporter, but I believe that the Tax Act of 2017 was skewed in favor of the half of the 1%.\n\nAnd the corporations as well, added Doyle.
As homeschooling, business closures and working from home become the new normal in America, experts warn one group is already feeling the economic pain of the coronavirus more than anyone else: women, particularly working mothers.\n\nAs of Monday evening, 33 states had announced mandatory school closures, impacting at least 32.5 million students in kindergarten through 12th grade. In states that haven't ordered closures, cities have taken matters into their own hands. New York City's public school system, the largest in the nation, announced on Sunday evening it would be closing all 1,800 of its schools and telling all 1.1 million students to stay home.\n\nWe do know that when illness strikes, when medical needs arise, women tend to be the primary caregivers in families, particularly for children, said Jessica Mason, a senior policy analyst at the National Partnership for Women and Families, in an interview with CBS News. So the need to care for children when a school is closed, it is most likely to pose a disproportionate burden on women.\n\nCarrie Duran, a 48-year-old single mother of three in New Hampshire, found out her daughters' school was closing last Thursday, throwing a wrench into her part-time job as a legislative aide, something she told CBS News that she largely can't do from home. Duran, who describes herself as very low income, said she's worried about providing lunches to her daughters, an expense normally covered by their school, and medication for her youngest, who has special needs.\n\nYour mind goes to places of an apocalyptic level, Duran said. I'm a rational human being but protecting my family comes first.\n\nCarrie Duran's three daughters: Isabella, Marisole and Katie. Carrie Duran\n\nFor now, Duran has a food pantry she's used to feed her daughters, but she's worried about her ability to pay rent on April 1 if she's unable to work.\n\nIt's so scary because it's not, 'what if, what if, what if,' she said. It's 'when.'\n\nAbout one in five working Americans are employed part-time, and women make up nearly two-thirds of that work force, according to a report from the National Women's Law Center. Part-time workers are the least likely to have access to benefits, or continue to be paid during a downturn. Women are twice as likely as men to work part-time, making coronavirus-related business closures particularly devastating to mothers.\n\nFor decades, critically important public programs and structures have been starved of funding, and efforts to ensure that women have adequate income, health care, worker protections, support for caregivers, and nutrition and housing assistance have been met with relentless resistance, said Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women's Law Center, in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday. Those efforts have placed women and their families at unconscionable risk from the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAs Congress grapples with legislation to help families get through the COVID-19 outbreak — both medically and financially — Graves' group recommended politicians prioritize three things in order to help mothers in particular: stabilize state governments and find ways to provide income to families as soon as possible. The organization also recommended protecting frontline workers; about 80% of healthcare workers are women, making them particularly vulnerable to the virus.\n\nMembers of both parties have recognized the importance of helping single and low-income mothers in the federal response to the crisis. A preliminary aid package passed by the House establishes paid leave for some workers and includes hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency spending to provide food for mothers and pregnant women who lose their jobs, as well as provisions for states to help families with children who rely on schools for lunches. Proposals to provide direct cash payments to Americans to alleviate the crisis have also attracted widespread support on Capitol Hill.\n\nArleja Stephens, a single mother in Washington, D.C., relies on her job as an hourly security guard at the Smithsonian to support her four children. But last week, she found out on the news that the museum would be closing. For Stephens, that meant she was out of a job. Stephens's first reaction was to call her insurance company so she could start working for a rideshare company like Uber or Lyft, even though the work would put her at risk of exposure.\n\nI'm going to do whatever I have to do to take care of my children, Stephens said during a telephone interview with CBS News last week.\n\nDuring the interview, Stephens found out she'd be getting two weeks of pay while the museum was closed. She's expecting to use those funds, plus her $1,000 emergency savings, to take care of her family. In the meantime, she'll be applying for services like unemployment insurance and food stamps to make ends meet.\n\nAs long as it doesn't go past this month, I will be good, Stephens said. After that, rent is due.
Rampant speculation and a virtual gold rush of so-called ICOs -- or initial coin offerings -- have U.S. securities regulators issuing a chorus of warnings about the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nInvestors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, said Joseph P. Borg, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and director of the Alabama Securities Commission on Thursday. Cryptocurrencies and investments tied to them are high-risk products with an unproven track record and high price volatility.\n\nInvestor interest in the cryptocurrency market is understandable.\n\nEven though the U.S. stock market is rising rapidly, the Standard & Poor's 500 index's 20-plus percent gain in 2017 pales in comparison to how the major cryptocurrencies performed last year. Bitcoin, for instance, now sells for roughly $15,000 -- some 15 times its year-ago value. Litecoin is worth nearly 60 times its year-ago value, and ethereum's ether has had a similar run-up.\n\nYet these currencies have also suffered dizzying drops. One day last November, bitcoin's value dropped 20 percent in less than two hours, and its value remains some 30 percent below the November highs. Some say this rise is proof of a bubble, and its pop is certain to decimate investors.\n\nHowever, bubble or no, investors have a wide array of reasons to be skeptical about investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Specifically:\n\nHacking\n\nAlthough the people who mine and bank cryptocurrencies maintain they have nearly unbreakable security, in numerous instances their vaults have been breached. Indeed, Fortune magazine maintains that cryptocurrencies are far more likely to be stolen than real currency. Hacking took down a South Korean bitcoin exchange, swiped $64 million from a Slovenian bitcoin mine and has caused some to question the viability of some of the more recent entrants into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvestors have learned the hard way that there is generally no recourse if your cryptocurrency disappears.\n\nFraud\n\nWhen you buy euros or dollars, you can hold them in your hand -- inspect them, use a special light to make sure they're legitimate. Cryptocurrencies are traded in cyberspace, and few consumers are sophisticated enough to discern whether they're real or fake.\n\nThat's a nearly irresistible draw to crooks, who regulators fear are already nipping around the edges of the market, convincing gullible consumers to invest in nonexistent currencies. Indeed, the Texas State Securities Board on Thursday asked for an emergency cease-and-desist order against a British company called BitConnect, which is soliciting investors with promises of massive monthly returns. That's because it hasn't registered with state securities regulators, nor even provided an office address.\n\nRegulators shut down a similar Dubai-based cryptocurrency operation in December.\n\nFickle faith\n\nWhat makes most currencies valuable is investor faith in what backs them. The U.S. dollar, for instance, is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which -- if all else fails -- has the ability to tax its citizens to pay its debts. Cryptocurrencies have no such government backing, and when they're deposited in vaults, they're also not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nIf investors suddenly lose faith in the ability of bitcoin's hierarchy to control the amount of currency issued or keep it safe, the value could drop to nothing overnight.\n\nLimited usage\n\nGenerally speaking, you accumulate money to buy things. However, the number things you can buy with cryptocurrencies is severely limited. Bitcoin, the oldest and best-established of these currencies, brags that 100,000 merchants accept it as a form of payment.\n\nBut about 36 percent of those are other tech companies -- websites, hosting registrars and VPN services. If you pull those out, you have less than 70,000 merchants willing to accept bitcoin, worldwide. Finding one of those merchants isn't very hard, but it's not as easy as, say, finding a merchant that will accept your Visa card, which is good at roughly 29 million establishments. And can get you real cash at 2.3 million automated teller machines.\n\nGovernment risk\n\nZacks Investment Research said the biggest risk for cryptocurrencies are governments themselves. Why? They could simply outlaw cryptocurrencies, and they might if the currencies ever become a threat to managing monetary policy.\n\nTo clarify, governments (normally through central banks) encourage -- or slow -- economic growth by managing their money supply. When the U.S. was in the depths of recession, the Federal Reserve pumped money into the financial markets to encourage spending, and thus, economic growth. Because cryptocurrencies circumvent this management, they could impair countries' ability to manage their economic health.\n\nCrytocurrencies are currently a relative blip in the world currency markets, accounting for less than 1 percent of the world's cash. Thus, they have yet to create any significant risk to a major financial system. However, if they did, governments have the right to make the currency illegal and force users and investors underground.\n\nFew governments have so far acted to restrict -- or outlaw -- cryptocurrencies, but they could. China, in fact, already has.\n\nIf you choose to invest in these products, please ask questions and demand clear answers, Securities and Exchange Commissioner Jay Clayton recently urged investors.\n\nEmphasizing that you could lose everything you put into cryptocurrencies, NASAA's Borg added that this market is not for the faint of heart.
With daily coronavirus infections surging as a result of a new virus variant, the British government faced mounting pressure Saturday from teachers' unions to keep schools in England closed for at least another two weeks.\n\nThe government, which oversees schools in England, has already decided to keep all schools in London closed next week to try to stem new infections. Unions want the policy extended across the whole of England, expressing fears about the health of both teachers and children.\n\nThe U.K. on Saturday hit a daily record for new coronavirus infections — 57,725 — and looked set to soon overtake Italy once again to become the worst-hit country in Europe with nearly 75,000 COVID-19 deaths. The fear is that with rising infections, the number of deaths will also grow over the coming weeks.\n\nMedics transport a patient from an ambulance to the Royal London Hospital as the spread of the coronavirus continues in London, Britain, January 2, 2021. HANNAH MCKAY / REUTERS\n\nThe U.K. has recorded its five highest daily new infection numbers over the past five days — all above 50,000 and double the number of only a few weeks ago.\n\nAfter an emergency meeting on Saturday, the National Education Union, which represents over 450,000 education workers, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government to move learning online for at least two weeks. It also told members they have a legal right not to have to work in an unsafe environment of accelerating coronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths.\n\nWe are doing our job as a union by informing our members that they have a legal right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions which are a danger to their health and to the health of their school communities, said Kevin Courtney, the union's joint general secretary.\n\nAnother union representing teachers, the NASUWT, also called for an immediate nationwide move to remote education due to virus safety concerns. Its general secretary, Patrick Roach, said there's genuine concern that schools and colleges are not able to reopen safely at this time.\n\nThe NASUWT will not hesitate to take appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk as a result of the failure of employers or the government to ensure safe working conditions in schools and colleges, he said.\n\nThe government's own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies warned at a December 22 meeting that schools needed to stay closed to bring down virus transmission rates.\n\nThe U.K. is struggling with a sharp spike in new cases as a result of a new virus variant that officials say could be up to 70% more infectious.
Climate activists who have worked with President Joe Biden see his Day 1 executive actions on climate policy as a promising start. But it's just that, a start — they have specific policy goals for his administration.\n\nMr. Biden signed executive actions Wednesday afternoon to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, direct federal agencies to consider revising vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards, and cancel permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline — all reversals of policies put in place by President Trump.\n\nSunrise Movement, a progressive, youth-led group, had a seat at the table during the Biden transition as its co-founder and other allies sat on the Climate Task Force, started as a policy team meant to bridge Senator Bernie Sanders' climate platform with Biden's after Sanders dropped out of the race for president.\n\nSince that time, the Biden team has made multiple concessions, said Sunrise political director Evan Weber. Weber credits the group and other progressives for convincing the administration to create the Office of Domestic Climate Policy, and said it led the push to nominate Representative Deb Haaland as Interior Secretary.\n\nThe climate team as a whole has some of the strongest progressive bona fides across the administration which speaks to the climate movement's growing power, Weber said.\n\nTiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president for government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, told CBS News that the Biden team is the most pro-climate in history.\n\nNot that the Obama administration wasn't committed and wasn't pro-environment, [but] I think that this administration is so clearly prioritizing this, she said.\n\nExpectations couldn't be higher for the administration. While there's obvious relief amongst climate activists that Democrats are back in the White House and in control of Congress, none are taking their foot off the pedal.\n\nWe need to see a lot more administrative progress coming over the next days and weeks and every day of this administration, said Sittenfeld.\n\nThis week, the League of Conservation Voters published its Policy Priorities for the Biden-Harris Administration and 117th Congress, a 38-point agenda broken into categories ranging from Immediate Action (Announce commitment to protect 30% of our lands and waters by 2030), to First 100 Days (Tighten EPA and DOJ enforcement of polluters harming frontline communities), and beyond (Establish mandatory requirements to reduce agricultural runoff that causes harmful algal blooms.)\n\nSunrise sent its own memo to the incoming Biden administration Tuesday evening. Obtained exclusively by CBS News, the Top Priorities for the Incoming Biden Administration reads like a fiery plea addressed directly to the president:\n\nUse your bully pulpit: This is your FDR moment. You have said you want to have an FDR-sized presidency, and much of what was accomplished in that time was done by FDR taking a leading role in corralling the nation into action and taking bold executive action.\n\nThe tone is unrelenting. Sunrise's political director said lessons learned from the last Democratic administration contribute to that approach. Many on the progressive left fault President Obama for not doing enough to combat the climate crisis. Weber, a student-activist during the Obama years, recalled going from excitement and turning into extreme disappointment.\n\nYoung progressives learned that you can't take these promises at their face value and that the work does not end after an election, he said. We're definitely gonna ask nicely at first and when demands aren't met, we'll change tones and tactics.\n\nSunrise believes it can apply pressure when it needs to. The group has grown exponentially since it began in 2017. Today there are 477 active chapters across the country with approximately 87,000 members. Weber told CBS News that they've seen more than 100 of those chapters launched since the pandemic began.\n\nThey plan to mobilize their hundreds of chapters and lean on specific targets in Congress, including Democratic Senate leadership and moderates such as Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. There will be social media pushes, ad buys, and in-person rallies. Thursday will mark a Day of Action when Sunrise members plan to rally outside members' local offices — both Democrat and Republican.\n\nThere is an activated, energized, mobilized base of young people that really, really wants change and will reward politicians and defend politicians who are allies ... and will punish and go after people who are standing in the way of progress, said Weber.\n\nAlso this week, Organize For Justice, a sister organization of the progressive PAC Justice Democrats, plans to release two short documentaries to usher in the Decade of the Green New Deal. The short films will highlight workers on the front lines of the climate crisis who call on President Biden and Democrats to enact a policy agenda centered on climate, jobs and justice.\n\nJustice Democrats communications director Waleed Shahid told CBS News that he believes Mr. Biden has the will to enact lasting climate policy and be a once-in-a-generation American president. However, that optimism, Shahid warned, will not lead to complacency.\n\nWe are not sitting on our hands waiting for action to be taken. We're taking action ourselves. We're not afraid to put public pressure on the administration, he said.\n\nSunrise's Weber admits that safety precautions because of COVID-19 pose a challenge to their activism, but argues the pandemic has shown the need for sweeping legislation built to address a massive crisis.\n\nWe need that same kind of an all-in, marshaled effort to address [climate]. It's not something that's happening 30 years down the line. It's happening right now.\n\nRead the full memo from the Sunrise Movement below:
Former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis will be sworn in as Florida's new governor and Republicans will begin their third decade dominating the state's Capitol. DeSantis' inauguration ceremony will begin Tuesday morning in front of Florida's Old Capitol, where he'll lay out his vision for the next four years.\n\nDeSantis gave a preview of his priorities during pre-inaugural events Monday, saying that he's going to act quickly on a number of issues once the inauguration festivities are over. That includes naming three new justices to the Supreme Court, announcing major environmental policy proposals and visiting the areas devastated by Hurricane Michael in October.\n\nDeSantis is replacing Gov. Rick Scott, who will be sworn into the U.S. Senate on Tuesday.
NEW YORK --The foreign minister ofNorth Korea says in an interview with The Associated Press that his country is ready to halt its nuclear tests if the United States suspends its annual military exercises with South Korea.\n\nHe also defended the country's right to maintain a nuclear deterrent and warned that North Korea won't be cowed by international sanctions.\n\nForeign Minister Ri Su Yong, in his first interview with a Western news organization, held firm Saturday to Pyongyang's longstanding position that the U.S. drove his country to develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent. At the same time, he suggested that suspending the military exercises could open the door to reduced tensions.\n\nIf we continue on this path of confrontation, this will lead to very catastrophic results, not only for the two countries but for the whole entire world as well, he said. It is really crucial for the United States government to withdraw its hostile policy against the DPRK and as an expression of this stop the military exercises, war exercises, in the Korean Peninsula. Then we will respond likewise.\n\nRi, who spoke calmly and in measured words, a contrast to the often bombastic verbiage used by the North's media, claimed the North's proposal was very logical.\n\nStop the nuclear war exercises in the Korean Peninsula, then we should also cease our nuclear tests, he said, during the interview, conducted in the country's diplomatic mission to the United Nations. He spoke beneath portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jung Il, North Korea's two previous leaders.\n\nIf the exercises are halted for some period, for some years, he added, new opportunities may arise for the two countries and for the whole entire world as well.\n\nDPRK is the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nRi's proposal, which he said he hoped U.S. policymakers would heed, may well fall on deaf ears. North Korea, which sees the U.S.-South Korean exercises as a rehearsal for invasion, has floated similar proposals to Washington in the past but the U.S. has insisted the North give up its nuclear weapons program first before any negotiations. The result has been a stalemate between the two countries that Ri said has put the peninsula at the crossroads of a thermonuclear war.\n\nSanctions, he said, won't sway the North.\n\nIf they believe they can actually frustrate us with sanctions, they are totally mistaken.\n\nRi, in New York to attend a United Nations' meeting on sustainable development, said the possibility of conflict has increased significantly this year because the exercises have taken on what Pyongyang sees as a more aggressive and threatening tone -- including training to conduct precision decapitation strikes on North Korea's leadership.\n\nThis year's exercises are the biggest ever, involving about 300,000 troops. Washington and Seoul say they beefed up the maneuvers after North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test, in January, which also brought a new round of tough sanctions by the U.N. down on Pyongyang's head. The exercises are set to continue through the end of the month.\n\nPyongyang, meanwhile, has responded with a series of missile launches and statements in its media that the country has developed its long-range ballistic missile and nuclear warhead technologies to the point that they now present a credible deterrent and could even be used against targets on the U.S. mainland, though not all foreign analysts accept that claim.\n\nRi's comments to The AP came just hours after North Korea launched what was believed to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile in its latest show of defiance as the U.S.-South Korea exercises wind down.\n\nRi also used his presence at the U.N. conference as a forum to denounce Washington, saying in a brief statement that while North Korea is contributing to the objectives of global sustainable development by taking measures to double its production of grains to solve its food problem by 2030 and by reforesting 1.67 million hectares (4.13 million acres) of mountainous areas, it is doing so under the most adverse conditions due to outside forces.\n\nIn the interview, he stated that the United States has used its power to get other countries to join in pressure on North Korea.\n\nA country as small as the DPRK cannot actually be a threat to the U.S. or to the world, he told the AP. How great would it be if the world were to say to the United States and the American government not to conduct any more military exercises in the Korean Peninsula ... But there is not a single country that says this to the U.S.\n\nThese big countries alone or together are telling us that we should calm down, he said. For us this is like a sentence, that we should accept our death and refuse our right to sovereignty.\n\nRi said North Korea is not encouraged by the thawing of relations between Washington and Cuba or Iran.\n\nWe're happy for the Cuban people and the Iranian people that they have reached successes on their path to pursuing their own goals and interests, he said. But he added that those cases differ totally from the U.S.-North Korea relationship.
BEIJING - China faces pressure to reassure nervous world markets about its economic and currency management at Friday's gathering in Shanghai of finance ministers and central bankers from the United States, Europe and other major nations.\n\nSuch meetings of the Group of 20 major rich and developing economies tend to yield no major policy changes. But with anxiety rising over lackluster global growth, investors are looking for reassurance from Beijing.\n\nChinese leaders want a bigger role in guiding global finance and trade but their reputation for economic competence has been battered by turmoil in their financial markets. Economists and other governments complain Beijing has fueled global market volatility by failing to communicate policy changes clearly.\n\nA collapse in Chinese stock prices last year wiped out some $5 trillion in paper wealth, and the country's main market index fell by an unusually large daily margin of 6.4 percent on Thursday.\n\nBeijing has allowed its yuan to decline against the dollar since August, sparking concern, despite repeated Chinese denials, that the currency will be weakened further to boost exports. That has driven an outflow of capital from China that spiked to a record $135 billion in December.\n\nIn a report ahead of the Shanghai meeting, the IMF urged G20 leaders to support China's economic reforms but also called on Beijing to ensure clear communication of their exchange rate policies.\n\nCompanies and investors want at least a statement that makes it possible to reduce uncertainty about Chinese industrial and currency policy, said Tim Condon, head of Asian research for investment bank ING.\n\nThe global economic issue of the day is China's industrial restructuring and the consequences of the slow pace at which it is proceeding, Condon said.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in an interview broadcast Wednesday by Bloomberg Television that the meeting would likely produce a more stable understanding of what the future may look like, including greater clarity from Beijing about its plans.\n\nHowever, Lew said he did not expect the discussions to produce specific plans of what each country is going to do and how.\n\nOther officials due to attend include U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen; China's finance minister, Lou Jiwei, and its central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, and their counterparts from Europe, Japan, South Korea, India and South Africa.\n\nThe global economy is growing at its slowest rate in two years and private sector forecasters say the danger of a worldwide recession is rising.\n\nGlobal growth is at a highly precarious point, Citigroup economists Ebrahim Rahbari, Willem Buiter and Cesar Rojas said in a report Thursday.\n\nThe longstanding fragilities in the world economy relate to the structural and cyclical slowdowns in China and its unsustainable exchange rate regime, the excessive level of debt across many countries and sectors and ongoing regional and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nAt the Shanghai meeting, U.S. officials will urge G20 countries to avoid altering exchange rates for competitive purposes, a senior U.S. Treasury official told reporters in Washington.\n\nChinese officials meanwhile are trying to downplay attention on the yuan and their economic policies.\n\nThe G20 should not discuss a specific country's currency policy at its gathering, said a Finance Ministry official quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Thursday. The meeting should only touch on principles, not specific national policies.\n\nJapan's finance minister, Taro Aso, and European Union officials have expressed hope for policy coordination to reassure global markets. But they have yet to say what they might ask for at the Shanghai meeting.
SAN FRANCISCO - Yul Dorn and his wife raised their son and daughter in a three-bedroom home crammed with family photos, one they bought in a historically African-American neighborhood in San Francisco more than two decades ago.\n\nToday, the couple is living in a motel after they were evicted last year, having lost a foreclosure battle. A second home they inherited is also in default.\n\nThe Dorns expect to join the growing ranks of African Americans who do not own their homes, a rate that was nearly 30 percentage points higher than that of whites in 2016, according to a new report.\n\nThe person who bought the house, we lost all of our memories, said Dorn, a pastor and case manager with the city health department. He put the furniture out on the street, and it was just devastating to my family.\n\nThe nation's homeownership rate appears to be stabilizing as people rebound from the 2007 recession that left millions unemployed and home values underwater, according to the report by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. But it found African Americans aren't sharing in the recovery, even as whites, Asian Americans and Latinos slowly see gains in home-buying. The center said the disparity between whites and blacks is at its highest in 70-plus years of data.\n\nExperts say reasons for the lower homeownership rate range from historic underemployment and low wages to a recession-related foreclosure crisis that hit black communities particularly hard. In 2004, the pinnacle of U.S. homeownership, three-quarters of whites and nearly half of blacks owned homes, according to the Harvard study.\n\nBy 2016, the African-American homeowner rate had fallen to 42.2 percent and lagged 29.7 percentage points behind whites, nearly a percentage point higher than in 2015.\n\nNow, a lack of affordable housing and stricter lending are making it harder for first-time buyers to obtain what traditionally has been considered an essential part of the American dream and a way to build wealth.\n\nIt has always been historically and systemically harder for blacks, and we were seeing there a little bit of progress, and now we're back at square one, said Alanna McCargo, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a think-tank focused on inner-city issues that published a similar report.\n\nAn AP analysis of U.S. Census Bureau statistics shows some pockets of the Midwest and California had the lowest homeownership rates for African Americans, while some areas of the South had the highest.\n\nLow inventory adds to the problem, said Jeffrey Hicks, incoming president of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, which was founded in 1947 to promote fair housing opportunities for minorities. The Atlanta area has only about 30,000 properties for sale through real estate agents, compared with approximately 100,000 about 13 years ago, he said.\n\nYou had subdivisions going up everywhere in terms of newer homes, Hicks said. We haven't seen that resurgence of new housing stock.\n\nAfrican Americans snapped up homes at the peak of the housing bubble, lured by generous lending and a glut of affordable properties, housing experts say. Lenders also targeted minorities, pushing riskier subprime loans even when applicants qualified for lower-interest loans.\n\nGraciano de La Cruz, 70, grew up in San Francisco, the child of a Filipino father and an African-American mother. In 1960s, the city condemned his mother's house for redevelopment in the historically black Fillmore neighborhood. She was given a housing voucher and became a renter, losing any equity she could have passed to her children.\n\nHe and his wife, Buena, who is Filipino-American, must now sell their own home of two decades to pay off a debt that stemmed from a pick-a-payment loan with World Savings Bank in August 2006.\n\nThey asked for a loan with a fixed rate, but the lender said an adjustable-rate package would meet their needs. The initial monthly payment for the pick-a-payment loan was about $1,700.\n\nThen her health declined, and he lost his job. In 2014, Wells Fargo (WFC), which had purchased World Savings, issued a notice of default. By then, the monthly payments had mushroomed to roughly $3,000.\n\nI can't sleep, de la Cruz said. I fear I might get a knock on the door, and the banker will come up with sheriff's agents talking about, 'You got to leave now.'\n\nThe pick-a-payment loans drew wide government scrutiny. In 2010, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $24 million to end an investigation by eight states, including California, into whether lenders later acquired by the bank made unsustainable mortgages without disclosing the terms.\n\nWells Fargo has vowed to help create more than 250,000 new African-American homeowners to address declining homeownership. But spokesman Alfredo Padilla said the bank could not find a way to help the couple.\n\nDorn, the 60-year-old pastor, says Chase (JPM) misapplied a payment he made in 2008 and then failed to keep proper records. He made several payments on a modified trial loan, which the bank then denied.\n\nIn 2015, the home he bought for $168,000 in 1996 was sold for $482,000. In May, the new owner sold it for $850,000.\n\nChase spokeswoman Suzanne Alexander said foreclosure is always the last option, pursued only when other avenues are exhausted.\n\nYet there are bright spots in the homeowning front.\n\nThe New Haven metro area in Connecticut, for example, reported an increase in black homeownership from 2010 to 2015. Georgia's Albany area, which is predominantly African American, saw a 15 percent increase from 2005 to 2015.\n\nIn Detroit, a largely African-American city wracked by foreclosures, the mayor last year announced a financing program to make home-buying easier. Previously, banks couldn't provide loans for more than a home's appraised value, which wasn't enough to cover needed repairs or renovations.\n\nAnd in Jacksonville, Florida, 32-year-old Natasha Jones recently bought her first home, a three-bedroom listed at $135,000. The single mother of three worked with a member of the nonprofit NeighborWorks America, which supports community development, to clear up her credit and save for a down payment on a Wells Fargo-financed loan.\n\nI am my mom's first child to own my home, Jones said. Now that we're in our own place, I'm redoing the flooring the way I want to. I'm painting the kids' walls. It's ours.
The Janet Yellen era is over.\n\nJerome Powell, Yellen's successor as Federal Reserve chair, is stepping directly into the spotlight on Tuesday when he appears before Congress for the first time in his new role. And the stakes could hardly be higher.\n\nStocks are just recovering from one of the most harrowing declines on record -- with prices falling more than 10 percent at their lows. Leading the tumble were fears over rising wages, higher inflation and increasing interest rates. Some dovish comments from Powell's Fed colleagues (talking up the specter of more bond-buying stimulus in the next recession, for instance) have since calmed nerves.\n\nBut the underlying trends remain, with wage inflation set to rise further. And that means markets could be set for another wave of selling in the weeks to come.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett advises investors to prepare for higher volatility to persist. His Bull & Bear Indicator remains deep in Sell territory because excess optimism continues on risk assets, and thus the pain trade for stocks and credit [is] still to the downside.\n\nHis team expects the incoming economic data to be stagflationary/policy hawkish resulting in another risk-off bout of selling. The consequence of a multitude of structural factors -- higher inflation, a tightening labor market, fiscal malfeasance in Washington, Fed rate hikes, trade tensions -- is captured in the way the U.S. dollar has been trending lower (although it enjoyed a respite in February) while U.S. bond yields rise.\n\nThat's a rare phenomenon. How rare? Less than 10 percent of the time over the past 50 years. And those years weren't comfortable: On average inflation rose 2 percent, stocks fell 9 percent and volatility rose 22 points.\n\nHartnett recommends continuing to watch for evidence of higher wages (chart below) as the barometer for what comes next. Recent comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed that higher wages don't necessarily lead to higher inflation, which the Fed's own research suggests is true, when wage gains are relatively muted. However, the connection between rapid wage growth and high inflation is much stronger.\n\nMerrill Lynch global economist Ethan Harris believes the case for higher wage growth is easily made with the economy at or very near full employment -- something the Fed admitted in its most recent meeting minutes.\n\nWith the unemployment rate below the Fed's estimate of the natural rate and at the lowest level since December 2000, Harris highlights other measures of labor slack that have improved substantially and are now comparable to their previous-cycle levels: Involuntary part-time employment, the number of discouraged workers outside the workforce and the hiring and quit rate.\n\nEven the labor force participation rate, which is being dragged down because of structural and demographic issues, has improved. The Congressional Budget Office estimates participation was at about 99.4 percent of potential, a cyclical high. The CBS has penciled in wage inflation of 3 percent by the middle of this year.\n\nAnd it's looking for the unemployment rate to fall to 3.2 percent by the end of 2019 -- a level last seen in the 1950s.\n\nThe result will be an acceleration in the Fed's rate hike pace, with three hikes in 2018 and three more in 2019. That's double what the market has priced in for 2019, and it will worsen losses in the bond market. Buckle up.
Being a mom has plenty of advantages, like your kids showering you with love on Mother's Day. But the disadvantages are practical. For one, you earn less.\n\nWomen tend to earn more than men when first out of college. But once they have kids, the typical mom earns less than similarly educated men and other women who don't have kids, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Moms are also relegated to handling a disproportionate share of the household chores, which eats into the time they can spend at work and puts them at a disadvantage in high-wage, high-pressure jobs that demand long work weeks, the EPI study says.\n\nThen too, work breaks caused by temporary disability -- a.k.a. pregnancy -- can disrupt your ability to save and hamper your job prospects when you return to the working world.\n\nMen typically get a bump in pay when they become a father, says Sallie Krawcheck, chief executive of Ellevest, an investing platform for women. Women get a penalty -- and it doesn't matter whether you have your kids young or wait until you're established in your career.\n\nThat said, mothers don't have to spend their lives with such pay inequality, and stay stuck behind the financial curve. If you have kids, or plan to, there are five concrete steps you can take to get your financial life on track and keep it there, no matter what.\n\n1. Invest young. The moment you have a job, be it at 16 or 23, you ought to be investing for long-term goals. Don't wait until you think you can afford to invest because every year of delay costs you compound investment returns, Krawcheck says. Compounding allows you to earn higher returns on investment gains, which is incredibly powerful over time.\n\nConsider a hypothetical young woman we'll call Sally, who starts saving $500 a month from the day she gets her first full-time job at age 22. Assuming she earns 9 percent yearly on her investments, she'll have $96,757 a decade later.\n\nLet's say Sally takes a work break at that point and stops saving. If she simply leaves her investments alone and they continue earning 9 percent per year on average, she'll have $1.4 million at age 62 -- even if she never saves another dime. It's worth mentioning that she only saved $60,000 of her own money. The rest is compound investment returns.\n\nWhat would have happened if she started saving later, but didn't take that break? If Sally started saving at age 32, saved the same $500 per month and earned an average of 9%, she'd have just $915,371 at age 62. And she would have contributed three times as much -- $180,000 – of her own money.\n\n2. Take the match. If Sally did her saving in a 401(k) plan that offered a company match, she'd be even better off. Most large companies will kick in between 25 cents and a dollar for each dollar their workers contribute to the 401(k). So assuming that Sally's employer matched half of her contributions, she'd have $750 going into savings each month for 10 years. At age 32, when she took off to have kids, she'd have $145,136 invested. Left alone to compound, that would turn into $2.14 million by the time she reached age 62, assuming the same 9 percent average return.\n\n3. Invest aggressively. Is 9 percent too high a return to expect? Not if you invest aggressively -- that means in the stock market -- and for the long term. Although stock prices are volatile over the short run, over the 85-year stretch tracked by financial research firm Morningstar, a diversified portfolio of big company stocks returned 10 percent on average annually; a portfolio made up of 70% stocks and 30% bonds earned an average of 9.1 percent. U.S. Treasury bills, on the other hand, don't put your principal at risk, but they historically have returned just 3.4 percent, which is only slightly more than the rate of inflation.\n\nWhat does that mean in dollars and cents? If you invested $10,000 in U.S. Treasury bills, you would have accumulated just $27,692 at the end of 30 years. If you invested the same $10,000 in a broad basket of U.S. stocks, you would have $198,374, which is seven times more. That makes stocks the investment of choice for long-term goals, such as your far-away retirement.\n\n4. Negotiate. If you decide you're going to take a work break to raise kids, know that about 30 percent of those surveyed by the Ellevate Network ended up taking a substantial – 20 percent or more -- pay cut when they came back. Unfortunately, the impact of that reduction in pay compounds just like the interest on investments. But of course, this compounding works against you.\n\nIf you come back at a lower rate of pay, you get raises off that lower rate of pay too, Krawcheck says. So you might think taking two years off costs you $170,000, but it really costs about $1.7 million.\n\nBefore going back to work, consult websites such as Comparably, Glassdoor and PayScale, which list average pay ranges in various fields and geographies. If you have friends and former colleagues who might be willing to share salary data, that can also help. In addition to negotiating a competitive salary, consider asking for other benefits that you might want, from additional time off to the ability to work from home a few days a week.\n\n5. Ask. Want a raise? Ask for one, Krawcheck says. Sure, your boss might say no. But the odds are in your favor. When the Ellevate Financial Network surveyed professional women about what happened after they asked for a raise, 75 percent said they got it.
Washington — The Trump administration on Monday began enforcing stringent income-based requirements for green cards and certain visas, instituting the most ambitious unilateral effort in recent history to change the nation's legal immigration system.\n\nAfter multiple legal barriers blocking the implementation of the new requirements were cleared by the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, most green card applicants in the U.S. and abroad will now be subjected to a redefined public charge test. Under the rules by the Departments of State and Homeland Security, immigration officials have more power to deny applications from petitioners they deem are, or could become, an economic burden on the country.\n\nThe sweeping policy change, one of the administration's top immigration priorities, is expected to block the entry of hundreds of thousands of people, disproportionately affecting prospective immigrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to experts.\n\nSince it unveiled the final regulation last summer, the administration has portrayed it as a way to promote self-sufficiency among immigrant communities. (The rule) enforces longstanding law requiring aliens to be self-sufficient, reaffirming the American ideals of hard work, perseverance and determination, said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nImmigrant advocates and Democrats, however, say the rule amounts to a wealth test that will revive a discriminatory immigration system that shuts America's doors to low-income and working-class immigrants from the developing world.\n\nIn 1924, our policy explicitly made it much harder for people from some parts of the world than others to come here. There were country-based quotas and there were country-based categorical exclusions for Asian immigrants, Julia Gelatt, a senior analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, told CBS News.\n\nToday, it's not quite as explicit, but by placing such drawn emphasis on people's income and income potential, by putting in place what is essentially a wealth test, this public charge rule could have some of the same impact of reshaping our immigration system to be more European and less Latin American, Gelatt added.\n\nSoon after its final version was published last summer, the rule was blocked in court, with one federal judge in New York calling it repugnant to the American dream. However, circuit courts subsequently lifted three of the four nationwide injunctions. The administration then turned to the Supreme Court, which lifted the remaining nationwide injunction last month, as well as a state-wide injunction in Illinois on Friday, allowing officials to enforce the policy on Monday across the country.\n\nIn a withering dissenting opinion on Friday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressed concern about the conservative majority's recent decisions allowing the Trump administration to move forward with fundamental policy changes without cases being decided on merit.\n\nPerhaps most troublingly, the Court's recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others, Sotomayor wrote in her opinion, noting the conservative jurists on the bench have repeatedly sided with the administration.\n\nA broad and sweeping definition of public charge\n\nFor decades, the U.S. has asked most green card and visa petitioners to prove they won't be a public charge — or an economic burden — on the country.\n\nThe term dates back to a time period in U.S. history when the government actively sought to severely limit immigration from developing, non-white countries. It was first codified in U.S. law in 1882, the same year the U.S. enacted the discriminatory Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred the entry of most Chinese immigrants on the premise that they jeopardized the good order of certain localities.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Clinton administration issued guidance saying only cash benefits could be considered when determining whether an immigrant could be a public charge. The Trump administration's policy, however, substantially expands this centuries-old term by broadening the type and amount of benefits — as well as income-based factors — that count against immigrants seeking to stay or move to the U.S.\n\nThis certainly is a very broad and sweeping use of the public charge legislation, Gelatt said.\n\nUnder the new regulation, caseworkers would consider enrollment in the widely used Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), certain federally funded Medicaid benefits and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including the popular Section 8 vouchers.\n\nOfficials would deem an immigrant a public charge and deny the application if they determine he or she is more likely than not to use one of the considered benefits for 12 months or longer over the span of three years. On certain occasions, those deemed a public charge could post a bond for an amount no less than $8,100.\n\nTo determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a public charge, caseworkers would also take into account their income, assets, age, educational skills, English language proficiency, health and other factors. Since those expected to be affected by the rule are not eligible for most public benefits because they are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents, critics of the regulation say it is designed to severely restrict immigration based on those factors.\n\nAdvocates have also denounced harmful effects the rule is having on people who are technically not directly affected by it but who are scared that the use of any public benefits might jeopardize their or their family's immigration cases. Researchers have been documenting a chilling effect stemming from the proposed changes that has prompted fearful immigrant families, some with U.S. citizen members, to drop out of essential welfare programs.\n\nTo curb this confusion and fear, advocacy groups and local officials have staged public awareness campaigns. Organizations like the Legal Aid Society, Make The Road New York and Empire Justice Center have created tools for lawyers and advocates to advise and screen immigrants on the new requirements.\n\nThe implementation of the public charge rule today is a devastating blow for all Americans. The rule is heartless, cruel, and betrays our core values as a nation of immigrants, Kristin Brown, president of the Empire Justice Center, said in a statement. This public charge screening tool will guide community-based organizations in helping families make crucial decisions that may carry life-changing consequences.
Sydney — A senior Australian politician tested positive for the new coronavirus and entered hospital quarantine Friday, days after returning from Washington where he met Ivanka Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was in the United States last week for a meeting with members of the FiveEyes intelligence alliance — Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand — that included Barr.\n\nHe also met with President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka on March 6, according to a photo posted by the Australian embassy in Washington, which shows the pair standing close together.\n\nIt is not yet known when Dutton contracted the virus. This morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat, Dutton, an influential member of the government and a key architect of Australia's controversial immigration laws, said in statement released Friday. It is the policy of Queensland Health that anyone who tests positive is to be admitted into hospital and I have complied with their advice.\n\nA White House spokesperson said in a statement that Ivanka Trump was not showing symptoms. The White House is aware that Mr. Dutton tested positive for COVID-19. He was asymptomatic during the interaction. Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine. She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.\n\nDutton said he feels fine but his diagnosis will raise concerns about whether other members of the cabinet and Prime Minister Scott Morrison may have been infected.\n\nThe prime minister's office confirmed Friday that Dutton attended a cabinet meeting Tuesday, but other participants would not be quarantined.\n\nOnly people who had close contact with the minister in the preceding 24 hours before he became symptomatic need to self-isolate, a spokesman said.\n\nThat does not include the Prime Minister or any other members of the Cabinet.\n\nIn contrast, New Zealand Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin - who also met Dutton in Washington - has self-isolated and will get tested for the virus on Saturday, local media reported.\n\nMorrison will no longer attend a rugby match on Saturday night after earlier saying he would even as he announced a bar on gatherings of more than 500 people.\n\nDutton is among 184 people in Australia who have been confirmed as having COVID-19.\n\nPoliticians exposed to coronavirus\n\nHe is just the latest in a string of political figures around the world to suffer a scare.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in quarantine for two weeks after his wife tested positive for the virus.\n\nBritish MP Nadine Dorries, a junior health minister who helped craft legislation to fight the contagion, is also infected.\n\nSeveral U.S. lawmakers have isolated themselves after attending a conservative conference in late February.\n\nThe White House has insisted Mr. Trump does not need testing, despite interactions with several people who have been exposed to the virus, saying only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine.
BEIJING -- A Chinese man was detained after he altered an image of a newspaper front page to add a headline declaring the official adoption of a two-wife policy, a joke on the country's new two-child policy, the state-owned Yangjiang Daily said Friday.\n\nThe newspaper from the southern province of Guangdong fell victim to the prank and reported the incident to local police on Tuesday. The Yangjiang Daily said the altered image spread quickly on social media, causing an ill impact.\n\nChinese authorities have been cracking down on rumors and false information circulating online, saying they disrupt the proper flow of information on the Internet.\n\nThe Yangjiang Daily said the man, identified only by his family name, Lin, altered the image of the newspaper as a joke with colleagues but that it was shared online.\n\nLin was detained on the charge of fabricating a rumor, the newspaper said. It did not say how long he would be held.\n\nThe original headline was about the opening of a city meeting.
UNION, S.C. -- Authorities say a high school student who went through his teacher's cellphone, found a nude picture of her and posted it online has been charged with a computer crime and voyeurism.\n\nChief Sam White of the Public Safety Department in northwestern South Carolina said the 16-year-old was taken into custody at Union County High School on Friday.\n\nThe boy, charged as a juvenile, is being held for a hearing in family court. His name was not made public.\n\nAfter Friday's arrest, the teacher, Leigh Anne Arthur told CBS affiliate WSPA she was relieved and proud they are holding him accountable and responsible for his actions. When you're 16 just being sorry for something of this severity is not enough anymore.\n\nWSPA reported the incident took place on February 18 at Union County High School.\n\nHe opened up my gallery for my pictures and he found inappropriate pictures of myself and he took pictures from his cell phone of that and then he told the whole class that he would send them to whoever wanted them, Arthur told WSPA earlier this week.\n\nArthur said she took a nude selfie to share with her husband for Valentine's Day, and that the student warned her that something bad was coming.\n\nThe student who actually took my phone and took pictures turned around and told me your day of reckoning is coming, she said.\n\nSince the incident, Arthur said four photos taken from her phone were printed out and put in her mailbox. She claimed there was a message threatening her and her sons on the back of one photo.\n\nShe resigned earlier this week, claiming she was pressured to do so by the school district. Arthur said according to district policy, the student should have been expelled.\n\nThe whole premise of my privacy being invaded his being ignored and that's what's wrong, she said.\n\nSuperintendent David Eubanks has said Arthur was to blame for leaving students unattended during a four-minute break between classes and that the school was concerned she could be contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nEubanks released a statement Friday reiterating his belief that Arthur was at fault and claiming that she has used the media to transmit false information obviously intended for the purpose of deflecting the incident totally to students.\n\nWe do know that her failure to properly supervise students entrusted to her care will negatively impact the lives of students and their parents, Eubanks said.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, more than 11,000 people had signed an online petition calling for Arthur to be reinstated.
ON THE SILVER RIVER, Fla. — Wildlife managers in Florida say they want to remove roaming monkeys from the state in light of a new study published Wednesday that finds some of the animals are excreting a virus that can be dangerous to humans.\n\nScientists studying a growing population of rhesus macaques in Silver Springs State Park say that rather than just carrying herpes B, which is common in the species, some of the monkeys have the virus in their saliva and other bodily fluids, posing a potential risk of spreading the disease.\n\nHuman cases of the virus have been rare, with about 50 documented worldwide, and there have been no known transmissions of it to people from wild rhesus macaques in Florida or elsewhere. However, the researchers say the issue has not been thoroughly studied.\n\nThe findings, published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, prompted the researchers from the universities of Florida and Washington to warn Florida's wildlife agency that the infected monkeys should be considered a public health concern.\n\nState wildlife officials say they are taking the problem seriously.\n\nWithout management action, the presence and continued expansion of non-native rhesus macaques in Florida can result in serious human health and safety risks including human injury and transmission of disease, Thomas Eason, assistant executive director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said in a statement.\n\nEason would not elaborate on what specific management tactics the state may employ, but a spokeswoman said the commission supports ridding the state of the invasive creatures.\n\nThe commission supports the removal of these monkeys from the environment to help reduce the threat they pose. This can be done in a variety of ways, spokeswoman Carli Segelson said in an email.\n\nThe macaques, native to Asia, are one of Florida's many nonnative wildlife species. Their contacts with the public, including last summer when the monkeys chased a family, have made them somewhat notorious critters and have caused two partial park closures since 2016. The monkeys also have roamed far outside the park: Dozens were photographed recently swarming a deer feeder outside a home in Ocala. They have been spotted in trees in the Sarasota and Tallahassee areas.\n\nThe herpes B virus has been fatal to 21 of the 50 humans known to have contracted it from macaque bites and scratches while working with the animals in laboratories, according to the CDC.\n\nThe CDC said there is always concern about the threat that diseases like herpes B virus pose to people, especially in settings where there is frequent interaction between animals and humans where scratches or bites can occur.\n\nHerpes B virus infection is extremely rare in people, but when it does occur, it can result in severe brain damage or death if the patient is not treated immediately, CDC spokesman Ian Branam said in a statement.\n\nThe researchers estimate that up to 30 percent of the scores of Florida's feral macaques may be actively excreting the virus.\n\nThe findings suggest a public health concern, said David Civitello, an Emory University biology professor who was not involved in the study. Still, he said, while the research confirms the presence of the virus in the monkeys' bodily secretions, more work needs to be done to establish how much virus there is, and how easily transferable it is.\n\nIt is interesting to see oral shedding at all, Civitello said in an email after reviewing the paper. It will be important to figure out whether underreporting, low quantities, or low transmissibility would explain why infections in tourists have not been reported.\n\nThe presence of the virus in the monkeys' feces and saliva presents issues for park workers and visitors, who could be endangered if bitten or scratched.\n\nHuman visitors to the park are most likely to be exposed ... through contact with saliva from macaque bites and scratches or from contact with virus shed through urine and feces, the paper's authors wrote.\n\nThe creatures draw nature lovers. On a chilly day in November, Capt. Tom O'Lenick, who has navigated the Silver River for 35 years, hollered from his charter boat into the dense surrounding forest. Monkey, monkey, monkey! he cried.\n\nMore than two dozen monkeys eventually appeared in trees on the riverbank. Within minutes, curious kayakers and other boat tour operators pulled close to shore for a better look and to snap photos.\n\nMinutes later another troop was running along the opposite riverbank.\n\nThe animals' forebears were brought to an island in the Silver River early in the 1930s as a tourist attraction due to the popularity of the Tarzan movies.\n\nBut there was human error in that plan.\n\nThey didn't know monkeys could swim, O'Lenick said. Now there are believed to be about 175 in Silver Springs State Park.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics on monkey attacks on humans in the park, a state-sponsored study in the 1990s found 31 monkey-human incidents, with 23 resulting in human injury between 1977 and 1984.\n\nSamantha Wisely, a University of Florida disease ecologist and one of the study's authors, said whether the monkeys pose a significant public health threat is still unknown. The paper recommends that Florida wildlife managers consider the virus in future policy decisions.\n\nWe don't have any silver bullet; that's the nature of science, Wisely said.
Parler, a social media site that prides itself on allowing unrestricted freedom of speech, has been suspended from Apple's app store and Google Play for failing to moderate content that incites violence. The suspensions come as multiple social media companies are cracking down on posts that promote violence in the wake of the assault on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nApple said on Saturday that while it has always supported diverse points of view on the app store, there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity.\n\nParler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety, the company said in a statement. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues.\n\nPrior to its removal from the app store, Apple told Parler's developers that their measures for addressing dangerous and objectionable content are inadequate.\n\nParler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, Apple told Parler. ...You referenced that Parler has been taking this content 'very seriously for weeks.' However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient.\n\nAccording to Apple, Parler said that it would initiate a moderation plan for the time being and that they would create a temporary task force.\n\nParler will not be reinstated in the app store unless Apple receives an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the suspension initiated on Friday was made in order to protect user safety.\n\nOur longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence, a company spokesperson said. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months.\n\nThe company said it's aware of continued posting in the app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S, adding that In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.\n\nThere have been dozens of posts on the app that encourage users to partake in actions similar to those of Trump supporters rioting at the Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nA post on Parler advertising a million militia march.\n\nOne post that was published on Thursday includes a banner for a million militia march to be held on January 20, the day President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated.\n\nThe time for peaceful protests has past they're stealing this election, the post reads. ...#CallToArms take back our country.\n\nThe Google spokesperson said that the company recognizes content policies are debatable and that immediately removing content that violates the policy can be difficult, but that moderating egregious content is required by apps nonetheless.\n\nThe suspension comes hours after many pointed out how calls for violence on the app have intensified since Wednesday.\n\nOne post, highlighted by New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls the rioters patriots who were carrying banners of support for the greatest President the world has ever known and said they will return to the area on January 19, weapons in tow.\n\nWhat are @Apple and @GooglePlay doing about this? Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nCalifornia Representative Ro Khanna called on Amazon to follow in Google Play's footsteps, as the app is hosted by Amazon Web Services. Amazon should deny Parler services until Jan 21 unless they commit to removing all posts related to incitement of violence concerning inauguration, Khanna tweeted. This will help prevent further violence and save lives.\n\nThe suspension on the app store came soon after Twitter announced that President Trump has been permanently banned from using his personal Twitter account.\n\nTwitter's announcement sparked fury on Parler, leading some users to call for war. The United States of America has been taken over by the Communist Party today. You no longer have freedom of speech. They're coming for your guns next, one post says. Civil War is coming.\n\nThis might seem like a harsh call, but WAR is upon us. We didn't want this, but when the enemy shuts down every form of communication for patriots to get our story out to the public unfiltered there really is no other option. This is our time for #civilwar2, another post reads.\n\nParler CEO John Matze posted on his Parler account Friday afternoon that we will not cave to pressure from anti-competitive actors.\n\nWe will and always have enforced our rules against violence and illegal activity. But we WONT cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech, he said.\n\nMatze also posted a photo from the Apple app store Resolution Center regarding serious App Store guideline violations.\n\nWe want to be clear that Parler is in fact responsible for all the user generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users. We won't distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content, Apple said, according to the screenshot.\n\nAnyone who buys an Apple phone is apparently a user. Apperently they know what is best for you by telling you which apps you may and may not use. Apparently they believe Parler is responsible for ALL user generated content on Parler. Therefor by the same logic, Apple must be responsible for ALL actions taken by their phones. Every car bomb, every illegal cell phone conversation, every illegal crime committed on an iPhone, Apple must also be responsible for.... Standards not applied to Twitter, Facebook or even Apple themselves, apply to Parler. -- John Matze 🇺🇸 John Friday, January 8, 2021\n\nMatze mocked the message, saying apparently they know what is best for you by telling you which apps you may and may not use.\n\nApparently they believe Parler is responsible for ALL user generated content on Parler. Therefor by the same logic, Apple must be responsible for ALL actions taken by their phones. Every car bomb, every illegal cell phone conversation, every illegal crime committed on an iPhone, Matze said.\n\nMusadiq Bidar contributed to this report.
In this episode of Intelligence Matters, retired Admiral Sandy Winnefeld speaks with retired General Philip Breedlove, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe and Commander of U.S. European Command, about the trajectories of the United States' relationships with North Korea, China, Russia, Europe, and other adversaries and partners. Breedlove addresses the leadership characteristics and regional objectives of each nation and assesses U.S. engagement to date. He and Winnefeld also discuss the U.S. military's capabilities and readiness for potential confrontation with key adversaries. Breedlove reflects on his career at all levels of the U.S. Air Force.\n\nDownload, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher.\n\nHighlights:\n\nU.S. engagement with North Korea: It remains problematic. We have had people tell us for a long time that the Hermit Kingdom is going to implode and why are we worried about it. And I guess in a glib way, we should ask ourselves, 'How's that working out for us?' The North continues to pose a threat, not only in a conventional way, but now in a more growing nuclear way. And they're determined to use those advantages to try to build a political situation with South Korea and the rest of the world that would advantage them in their day-to-day operations.\n\nIt remains problematic.

Russia and Putin: I think Mr. Putin is a man who has grown up a proud Russian. He grew up in the KGB. He did not like the way the Cold War ended. He felt like that Russia was not at the table when the post-Cold War order was sort of set. And he felt like Russia was snubbed and should've been at the table. And he's determined to get Russia back at the table on determining the path of Europe as well as other parts of the world, as we see now in Syria and in North Africa. [...]. Mr. Putin has never been paid officially more than an army or air force lieutenant colonel. He's been a public servant all his life. And yet he's one of the richest men in the world. This is a kleptocrat who has been extracting wealth from that nation and he doesn't want to lose that wealth stream. So I think you've got on one side, a proud Russian that believes Russia was snubbed and should be a major power. And on the other side, there's a man that really likes the stream of money that comes from his position.\n\nI think Mr. Putin is a man who has grown up a proud Russian. He grew up in the KGB.

And they're really pushing ahead in some of these critical technologies that are going to challenge us. And if all we are going to do is just buy more of the same to try to address it, I think we're going to be on the losing end of that cost curve. Just like we applied that to Russia in its past, I think China's putting us on the wrong side of that cost curve now. [...]. We have to think about changing the cost curve in more than money, imposing on them issues and problems that they have to deal with like they're imposing on us. And so I do believe that we need to be thinking about new technologies of defense. We need to be thinking about the kind of technology that allows us to strike with precision at range and not cost us an arm and a leg to do it.\n\nDownload, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher.\n\nINTELLIGENCE MATTERS – GEN. PHILIP BREEDLOVE\n\nCORRESPONDENT: AMD. SANDY WINNEFELD\n\nPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWelcome to Intelligence Matters with Michael Morell. I'm retired Admiral Sandy Winnefeld, filling in for Michael while he's on travel. Our guest today is retired Air Force General Phil Breedlove, who served as the 17th Supreme Allied Commander of Europe and as the Commander of U.S.-European Command.\n\nBorn in Georgia, he attended Georgia Tech and was commissioned through their ROTC program. He flew F-16s in both Europe and Asia and also served as the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. My close association with and deep admiration for Phil began when we were fraternity brothers at Georgia Tech.\n\nI'm fond of saying that, at the time, people expected Phil to succeed. Phil is recognized as being one of our most effective, if not our most effective, Supreme Allied Commanders of NATO and has done a lot in his public and private life to point out the danger represented by Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation. Since he retired he's assumed a variety of roles in business and has also taught at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at his alma mater. Phil, welcome to Intelligence Matters.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSandy, it's great to be here with you. And I look forward to our conversation.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWell, we have a lot to cover today. Before we get into talking a bit about Europe and Asia, the title of this program is, of course, Intelligence Matters. Can you give me a sense, as a long-serving Air Force officer, former four-star general in several key positions, of how you interacted with and depended on the world of intelligence?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nWell, as you know, having also been a pilot in your career, in the early more tactical part of my career, it was all about, How was I going to prepare for my mission? What was the intelligence required to get to a target, deliver a weapon, etcetera? A very tactical look.\n\nAnd that obviously, through the years, changed. As the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, begin to look at what intelligence told me about the requirements that we had to make to shape our Air Force. And then finally, I don't have to tell you that in my role as the SACEUR and as the Commander of U.S.-European Command, and trying to shape policy and the reactions of 28 nations in NATO, intelligence was key. And having not only an understanding of what U.S. intelligence was, but what the intelligence that was agreed to by all 28 nations, what that was, and the problems and opportunities it generated.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nPhil, let's talk a little bit about Asia, starting with the Korean Peninsula. You did three tours on the Peninsula, including commanding a fighter wing at Kunsan Air Base in 2001. A lot has happened since then. How do you look at the current situation on the Peninsula and the way ahead?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nIt remains problematic. We have had people tell us for a long time that the Hermit Kingdom is going to implode and why are we worried about it. And I guess in a glib way, we should ask ourselves, How's that working out for us? The North continues to pose a threat, not only in a conventional way, but now in a more growing nuclear way. And they're determined to use those advantages to try to build a political situation with South Korea and the rest of the world that would advantage them in their day-to-day operations.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWe have gone from yelling about Little Rocket Man to hugs at the demilitarized zone. How do you feel about President Trump's overtures to Kim Jong-un? Have they been productive? Do you agree with them? And do you think the North Koreans will ever give up their nuclear weapons?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, Sandy, I think that we want to talk to them. We don't want to fight them. We're sort of playing poker with someone else's chips. It would be the South Korean people that would really pay if we were to begin a conflict on that peninsula. And so I would applaud any president -- I don't want to zero in on what's going on now -- but any president that began a real conversation.\n\nI think we have to understand that this is a nation and a set of leadership that is just going to be really hard to deal with. And they really haven't lived up to a lot of their promises in the past, so I think we all need to have a sober judgment of what we might accomplish.\n\nBut I would say it's better to try than not to try. And so I applaud any president that tries it. As far as giving up their nuclear weapons, I don't think so. The agreed framework in the early '90s under the Clinton years, we gave them tons of money, tons of fuel, tons of food, and we got, really, nothing in return for it. Unless we get persistent, pervasive inspection that allows us to completely understand what North Korea is actually doing, we're going to be at risk in any agreement I think we make with them.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWell, and it also seems that we have to be careful about mirror imaging on North Korea. You know, Kim Jong-un has to worry about both external threats, but also internal threats to the—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--regime. Our relationship with South Korea has, like many of our allies, become a little more transactional lately. We're starting to ask the South Koreans to pay a little bit more for our presence there. Have you got any thoughts for us on U.S. basing of forces in South Korea?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo it's not going to surprise you, having served almost half of my military career oversees, that I am a proponent for our military being engaged overseas. I think that that ounce of provision is worth a whole lot more than the cure if we let the Peninsula go. The investment that we make by having a fairly modest force forward to keep peace on the Peninsula is absolutely worth it. And you're going to hear this again as we talk about forces in other places around the world.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nNow this is going to be a tough fight, if it ever actually happens, a conventional fight on a peninsula. We have the tyranny of distance. Yes, we have sort of 'Fight Tonight' ethos on the peninsula. But how do you see this unfolding? Are we going to be able to stop the North Korean hoards with Seoul right on the border of—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, it's a great question. And really, some of those dynamics haven't changed for 20-plus years. The fact that North Korea can range the capital in that incredibly dense population, in the general Seoul area, can range it with dumb conventional firepower from the back side of the Kaesong Heights, at any moment's notice, it's a tough problem.\n\nAnd how do you shut that down as a force in the South? This will be a fight that the world hasn't seen in a long time. And the loss of life, both civilian and conventional military on the ground, we are not ready for that, I think, in this world.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nYes, it's going to be tough to get our forces there in time to make a difference. It's—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--going to be something that nobody can really accurately predict.\n\nPhil, we were just talking about Korea and Kim Jong-un and nuclear weapons. What do you think is the greatest impediment to him actually giving up those weapons?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, Sandy, I think it doesn't take a lot of looking into history to see what has happened to every despotic leader that has given up or had his nuclear weapons taken from them, to realize that the leaders in the North see this as their guarantee.\n\nAnd I think one of the toughest things in my tour as the SACEUR, is what happened in Ukraine. Here, Ukraine in the early '90s had an agreement with four signatory nations, that if they gave up their nuclear weapons that their territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed by those nations. And so they gave up their nuclear weapons.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nAnd look—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nAnd what happened?\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--what happened.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nOne of the signatories invaded them. And two of the other signatories did nothing about it.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWell, and that's to say nothing of Libya and, of course, Iraq. Phil, speaking of Asia, many view China as our most capable potential adversary. They've been closing previously existing gaps in conventional capability and opening new ones in asymmetrical capability.\n\nThis is making life very difficult for the Pacific Command Commander, as you might imagine. Do you think we can keep pace with the Chinese through only improvements in our capability? And if so, where do you see that heading? What kind of capabilities do we need in order to keep an advantage out there?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nActually, I don't think that's the right way to go. I've heard you talk about this. And I happen to agree with some of the thoughts you have about, we get locked into certain things. The ends aren't changing, so we have ways and means. We typically focus on those means because they are what we do as an industrial nation here in America.\n\nAnd I think that changing the ways may be the end tack we have to take. The bottom line is, China is very good at setting goals and sticking to those goals, investing. And they're really pushing ahead in some of these critical technologies that are going to challenge us.\n\nAnd if all we are going to do is just buy more of the same to try to address it, I think we're going to be on the losing end of that cost curve. Just like we applied that to Russia in its past, I think China's putting us on the wrong side of that cost curve now.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo you, I think, have a clear feel that just buying more stuff is not going to do the trick. There's sort of an intermediate step, maybe, between having to rethink the whole strategic challenge out there. And that is better stuff. Is there anything out there, any kind of breakthrough that could give us an advantage?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nYes, let me back up just a tiny bit. So we do have to fix readiness. The force needs to fix readiness. And some of that fixing readiness is investing in some of those capabilities that we need. So, I don't want to say we don't need to buy anything and we need to flip this, because we do.\n\nWe've got to recapitalize some fleets that have been rode hard and put up wet in all of our services. But in the meantime, I think that if all our imagination is captured in doing more of the same, we will lose in this proposition against China.\n\nWe have to think about changing the cost curve in more than money, imposing on them issues and problems that they have to deal with like they're imposing on us. And so I do believe that we need to be thinking about new technologies of defense. We need to be thinking about the kind of technology that allows us to strike with precision at range and not cost us an arm and a leg to do it.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo Phil, let's drill in a little bit more, beyond now the capacity piece and the technical capability piece.\n\nIf we actually bump up against the wall here and we have to think of a whole new strategic concept for China, do you have a sense for what that might look like? Is it about changing our ends and lowering our ambition in the Western Pacific? Or it's some different thing we can do that would present China with the dilemmas we've talked about?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, I don't know that it's all that easy to just change our ends. Our world and our societies expect certain things-- free passageway in the commons, free trade, etcetera, etcetera. And so I'm not sure that we are capable as a nation of really drastically changing the ends.\n\nAnd as I said before, if all we're going to do is look at means, I think that we are going to be in-- on the back side of a real problem here. So, I do believe we have to look at different ways. And I think that they are at risk in-- if we do-- if we hold them at risk inside their mainland.\n\nRight now we are not thinking about attacking the mainland, because this is a nuclear power. And frankly, they have done a pretty good job at holding us at bay and putting us at risk. But if we make them understand, through our investments and our new types of thinking about how to address this problem, that they are at risk in their homeland, I think it will change the calculus a bit.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo let's turn to your most recent work, where you served last in the military. And you're we'll known for your views on Vladimir Putin and Russia. You've been very outspoken on that. What do you think is motivating the Russian leader? And what do you see as the trajectory of our relationship with Russia, Phil?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, none of this will be terribly now because my views haven't changed. But let's just recoup. So, first of all, I think Mr. Putin is a man who has grown up a proud Russian. He grew up in the KGB. He did not like the way the Cold War ended. He felt like that Russia was not at the table when the post-Cold War order was sort of set.\n\nAnd he felt like Russia was snubbed and should've been at the table. And he's determined to get Russia back at the table on determining the path of Europe as well as other parts of the world, as we see now in Syria and in North Africa. And frankly, it's a bit tough to say.\n\nBut remember, this is a kleptocrat. You know, Mr. Putin has never been paid officially more than an army or air force lieutenant colonel. He's been a public servant all his life. And yet he's one of the richest men in the world. This is a kleptocrat who has been extracting wealth from that nation and he doesn't want to lose that wealth stream. So I think you've got on one side, a proud Russian that believes Russia was snubbed and should be a major power. And on the other side, there's a man that really likes the stream of money that comes from his position.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nPhil, to continue our discussion, I asked you about the trajectory of our relationship with Russia. Where do you see that heading?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nIt's not good. If I was to imagine being in the room, having a cognac with Mr. Putin at this point, I would think he would be a very happy man. What he wants when he looks to his west is an E.U. that is fractured and disorganized, a NATO that is fractured and disorganized.\n\nHe wants to deal with individual nations, individually, on individual security and business matters. And I think that right now he's succeeding. Let's just look at the state of conversation in NATO. Let's look at the state of conversation in Brexit and E.U., etcetera, etcetera. And so I think that right now what we see from Mr. Putin is unlikely to change, because in his mind, I believe, he sees his path as working.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWell, and that's to say nothing of his interference in our elections. And it seems to me that he's not necessarily favoring a single candidate. He just wants to see chaos his way.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nExactly. And I think that's a point that this particular city we're sitting in, seems to gloss over. Everybody wants to make this an election issue on one side or the other. And I couldn't agree with you more. What he wants is chaos. He wants to drag Western democracy down to the level of Russian democracy. And, of course, in some ways, he's having some success there.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nYes, which helps him set the expectations of his own people. Now Phil, you had a Russian counterpart, a very interesting guy, Valery Gerasimov, who's the chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces. He's very active, to say the least, and has very strongly-held views on the competition between Russia and NATO. Can you tell us a bit about your relationship with him and how you perceive his views?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nLet me just first start with, this is an intelligent man, a thinking man. And I believe he does a lot of his own writing-- maybe not the final products, but you can see what he thinks reflected in his speeches and his writing. So this is a learning, adaptive leader. And I think we need to respect him for that.\n\nI started off trying to build a relationship with him. And he and I began meeting on a series of video teleconferences and so forth. But sadly, I won't argue with why, but sadly when the Russians invaded Crimea and then when they went in and invaded Donbass and set up the radicals there, the SACEUR, first, was told, no longer to speak to Mr. Gerasimov. And then the U.S. European Command commander was also told to stop conversations with Mr. Gerasimov.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nAnd I'd draw a contrast there, not to interrupt, that when Russia invaded Georgia, the only contact between our two governments was between the chief of the general staff, Makarov, and Admiral Mike Mullen.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nI must tell you that --it's-- you're right, and that was right, in my opinion. I believe when conflict is happening, you step up your conversation. You don't shut it off. And I had offered my opinion about what we should do, but I was given direction from my leadership. And I followed that direction.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWell, and look what's happened. So, now looking at the big picture, end of the Cold War, the declaration of a peace dividend, do you think we went too far in drawing down from Europe? How do you feel about the ability now of the alliance to respond to Russian aggression? And let's start with how it might actually start and how you see it playing out and our ability to carry the day?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, I do believe we overcorrected. All of us, all the nations of NATO and our partner nations as well, we all took big peace dividends. And we in the U.S. removed so much capability from Europe. We don't have time to describe how big we were when Captain Phil Breedlove was in 2nd Brigade 3rd Infantry Division, standing with the Army as a TACP or an ALO in the early '80s.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nThat's an air liaison officer for—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nThe early--\n\n(OVERTALK)\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--the un-anointed.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nYes, so a forward air controller, Army associated. And so I think we have overreacted. And now we are having to sort of rethink about how we can do that. But again, not only did we withdraw our troops from Europe, but we downsized all of our militaries.\n\nAnd probably more damaging-- you could speak better to the Navy-- but probably more damaging, we have put such a strain on the military that we have, that our readiness is well below where it was when we faced the Soviet Union across the border. So I do believe that we have correction that needs to be made.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo let's drill a little bit more deeply into that. What do you see as the advantages, operational military advantages that Russia has if they decide to get a little feisty vis-à-vis the NATO alliance?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo the NATO alliance is on their backdoor. And it's a whole other subject to talk about the encroachment. But some of the nations that used to be Warsaw Pact are now NATO alliance members. And so if you remember Jomini, that great thinker, he talked about interior lines.\n\nRussia has the ability to quickly move and mass their forces, where NATO has to respond to the area. And I know you understand this better than most because of your naval background, but in the Cold War we almost took-- we fought to maintain the lines of contact with the East Coast of America and Europe.\n\nDuring the post-Cold War days, we have all but stopped worrying about fighting our way across the Atlantic. In fact, we assume safe passage across the Atlantic. And that's not the case anymore. And so Russia enjoys that ability to rapidly bring forces together. And if you've ever looked at Moscow and the spider network of roads and railroads from there, you understand how quickly they can do this. And then you have to look at what NATO has to do to respond. It's a physics problem.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nAnd that's not to mention a singularity of command and control—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--twenty-eight nations having to decide versus one, and some of the advantages they have in artillery and tactical air defenses and the like. So do you see the need, as we talked about with China, for a new way? Or is it just sort of, Get the stuff back over there so that we can be more prepared?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nThe answer is yes. It's a little bit of all of that. So I think that we, again, have to address our readiness. We and our -- primarily or as well our allies -- need to bring forces to capability and readiness. And yes, we need to look a little bit about, Do we have the appropriate forces over there?\n\nFrankly, I don't believe we'll ever permanently move another force to Europe. But we need to settle ourselves in a way with prepositioning and other tactics, to be able to rapidly reinforce. And then, as you know, we're-- with the 2nd Fleet, we're starting to now rethink how we defend our sea lines of contact with America. But as we talked about with China, we've got to think about different ways. It just can't be means anymore. We've got to change the paradigm a little bit in Europe.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nAs one of the most important organizations that was put into place in the wake of World War II, with the intent of preventing such large wars from ever happening again, was NATO. And our relationship with NATO has always been up and down. Where do you see it now? How do you see President Trump's influence on—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nUh-huh (AFFIRM).\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--that relationship? How do you feel about your old buddies back in Europe?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, it's an interesting story. And as people sort of pick at me about this, I remind them that we were thrown out of a NATO country once, literally thrown out. And so yes, we've had some peaks and valleys in our relationship with NATO. I would tell you that I have watched every one of the last three presidents try to get NATO to invest more in itself. And while you and I may not agree with the tactics, techniques and procedures used, we actually now have NATO allies reinvesting in themselves. It's been a bit of a rocky road. And we'll just leave it at that.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo it may be that we don't necessarily like the tone, but the result seems to be maybe in a direction we want.\n\nPhil, much has been made of the fact that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, expires in 2021. The U.S. withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in August 2019 because Russia failed to return to full and verified compliance through the destruction of its non-compliant missile system. Was pulling out of that treaty the right thing to do?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo this is now just my opinion. You got it right. We were the only one in the treaty. It's kind of hard to have a treaty with yourself. Russia had abrogated the treaty. So the question is, how do you move forward? How do you try to re-engage Russia?\n\nThe choice was to back out of the INF. If it had been me making that decision, I think I'd have done it differently. I would've tried to build from an existing treaty. I just think it's easier to do that than to renegotiate entirely a new treaty.\n\nBut let me throw one more curve ball into this calculus. And that is that we really need to have a treaty with more than just Russia. And it would be incredibly hard, but to get China into a treaty as well, because they are going to be an issue. And frankly, right now, I think Russia has more issues with China's capabilities than with ours, because we really don't have any in Europe right now.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nIt could be one of the reasons why they violated the treaty, right, because they're more worried—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--about China.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nWe have to be intellectually honest.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nHow do you feel about the Russian assertion that the missile defense system that's in Romania, which is a AEGIS system that not only can carry the SM-3 missile that's a ballistic missile defense thing, but could also theoretically carry the Tomahawk Missile and therefore we were also in violation of the INF treaty. What's your take on that?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nI think that's a convenient excuse for the Russian Federation to offer. I think it's hogwash.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo, the Russians have been developing some pretty exotic new strategic weapons, right? Nuclear cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons and even big transoceanic nuclear torpedoes, as we saw the strategic glance over Vladimir Putin's soldier looking-- or shoulder looking at a Power Point slide. But they've also talked about extending the START treaty. That almost seems to be at odds with each other. What do you see the trajectory of strategic arms control agreements with Russia?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nI will offer you my hope. I think we need to stay in the START. I think we need to grow from that to a new round of understandings. I think we need to wrap China into these conversations and try to bring that dynamic in. And I think we need to back in now and get a new INF-like treaty, even if it's only with Russia, but it would hopefully be with China. And I think that we want to do everything we can to slow this race to expanding the nuclear countries of the world.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo, one of the things that's always been a thorn in Russia's side in terms of arms control agreements, is ballistic missile defense. They firmly believe that our development-- or at least they say they believe that our development of ballistic missile defense was designed to negate their ability to respond to an attack, and therefore we would-- it would create strategic instability. Phil, do you think that they actually believe this? Or do you think they're using it as a convenient foil to try to just get us to get rid of ballistic missile defense?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nI think it's the latter. We all know that Russia has the ability to overwhelm our defenses. The only thing that a small defense that we have, if it's credible-- and I think ours is-- and gets more credible every day, the only thing that does is sort of take away the coercive value of small attacks to be-- to force us to think differently as we talk and negotiate with Russia.\n\nBut we can't build enough missiles to stop their attack. And frankly, I think they're more worried about our decapitation of their ability to launch an attack than they are about our missile defense. I think it's, again, a sort of convenient tool to try to shape us at the negotiating table.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nNow Phil, the realization that I came to in the last couple years I was on active-duty, that our space command and control capability was a bit weak, was a very unforgettable moment for me. That's getting a lot better. The Department has tried to reorganize itself for space. As a career Air Force officer, can you give me a sense for what your thoughts are on the new space force? Getting beyond the grief, they've taken over logos and uniforms—\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nRight, right.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\n--and the like. Do you think that the Department's headed down a wise path here?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nI think we're on a path. And we're going to make it as wise as we can. I love the way that our current chief of Staff sort of said it a few years ago. He said, We are currently an Air and Space Force. In 40 years, we're going to be a Space and Air Force.\n\nWe in this service, absolutely accept and acknowledge that that transition's going to happen. The real key here then is, how fast does that happen? It matters not now. The decision was to move out. And so I think you're going to see everybody that wears a blue uniform embrace that and move out.\n\nAnd I'm actually happy about that. What I think we need to understand is, that since we have done this so abruptly and so suddenly, we've got some problems to take care of. And one of them starts with people, or in the commercial world the H.R. business, of the Air Force.\n\nHow do we manage these people that were formerly Air Force and dutifully became missileers because we told them they had to be missileers to get promoted. And now we've got this mixture of people that aren't purely space, some of them missileers. How do we not damage those highly-valued members of our services as we do this really abruptly into the future?\n\nAnd so I embrace and am proud for the fact that we're going to create a space force. I don't want to leave dead and broken bodies along the way as we do that. And so we need to do it quickly. I believe in Star Wars. There are going to be X-wing fighters. I hope my grandchildren are flying them sometime in the future.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nThat sounds like fun. Maybe we were born too early.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nThat's right.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nSo Phil, you-- I have just a little bit of time left. I've known you a long, long time.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nYes.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nYou've had a fantastic career. You're one of the most highly regarded officers, let alone Air Force officers, that I know. Can you give me a sense for what the most valuable or the most rewarding part of your career was, whether it's NATO or your time in a blue uniform? What was the best part for you?\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nSo, it changed, Sandy. I think you and I both agree, when we were ensigns and lieutenants and captains and majors and commanders, all I wanted to do is fly that F-16. I wanted to be the most effective, efficient killing machine out there. I wanted to be right for my nation.\n\nAnd then along the way, I was asked to command. I commanded at a very small level in the Army. I commanded a squadron, a group, three fighter wings, a numbered air force, a MAJCOM and an alliance. And I will tell you that the most rewarding part of my career was working with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that I got to command along the way. It is absolutely incredibly -- it is our number one resource -- are those soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. And I would just tell you that even though I loved flying the F-16, being able to lead troops was a big deal to me.\n\nSANDY WINNEFELD:\n\nWell, and that's a great way to end. You have been listening to Intelligence Matters, hosted by Michael Morell. I'm your guest host, Sandy Winnefeld. And our guest has been General Phil Breedlove, former NATO supreme allied commander of Europe. Phil, thanks so much for spending time with our listeners today. It's been a great discussion.\n\nGEN. PHIL BREEDLOVE:\n\nThanks, Sandy.\n\n* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *
With presidential candidates spotlighting drug addiction on the 2016 campaign trail, Congressional Republicans are trying to do their part in pushing a legislative solution to the widespread issue.\n\nThis epidemic does not discriminate, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Saturday. Zip codes don't matter. It's affecting our cities, suburban areas, and rural counties. Young or old, rich, middle class or poor, black, white, Hispanic or Asian. The grip of addiction affects all of us.\n\nThe Ohio Republican touted a bipartisan effort, called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), that he said would make a real difference for families and communities.\n\nThe bill targets prevention and education resources and also provides more funding for evidence-based treatment and recovery programs. Among other changes, CARA would expand prescription drug take-back programs and establish monitoring to prevent over-prescriptions of painkillers.\n\nPortman, who cited drug overdoses as the killer of over 120 Americans daily, assured viewers that the legislation was moving.\n\nThere is an urgency to this issue, he said. Congress must act now to help repair our communities, our families and our country.\n\nOn Saturday, the president called for his own policy push, with a new video emphasizing the importance of teaching computer literacy in classrooms.\n\nWe have to make sure all our kids are equipped for the jobs of the future - which means not just being able to work with computers, but developing the analytical and coding skills to power our innovation economy, Mr. Obama said. In the new economy, computer science isn't an optional skill - it's a basic skill, right along with the three 'Rs.'\n\nThe White House announced a new Computer Science for All initiative that pushes for funding from Congress to provide schools with opportunities to teach computer science for all students.\n\nThe plan also calls for increasing training for teachers on the subject and culling together expertise from the public and private sectors.\n\nThat's what this is all about - each of us doing our part to make sure all our young people can compete in a high-tech, global economy, the president said. They're the ones who will make sure America keeps growing, keeps innovating, and keeps leading the world in the years ahead.
The coronavirus pandemic has roiled the American economy, with over 16 million workers filing unemployment claims in the past three weeks. Many employees who have not been fired or furloughed are working on the frontlines of the crisis, including health care workers and others providing essential services — like staffing grocery stores or driving trucks.\n\nMillions of non-essential employees are fortunate enough to be able to work from home. These remote workers include the 535 Americans representing their constituents in Congress. Most senators and representatives have returned to their districts, while their staff in Washington also work remotely.\n\nImportant topics normally hashed out in person are now being covered over phone calls or meetings over the video conference platform Zoom. Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, said in an interview with CBS News that he is connecting with constituents through Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIt's been interesting to see what are the types of things you can do remotely and what are the kinds of things that require human contact, said Khanna. Connecting with people is a major part of a politician's job, Khanna said, but you can't really do empathy remotely.\n\nBut Khanna feels that in some ways, he's been more informed during this tele-work period than when he's working in Washington, since he is participating in regular conference calls with other Democratic caucus members.\n\nAccording to an April 6 press release from House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, over 99% of House Democrats participated in caucus telephone conference meetings in the final weeks of March.\n\nThe full Democratic caucus has held 14 conference call meetings since March 16, with 184 out of 240 Democratic members participating in each of the calls. According to Jeffries' office, 235 caucus members participated in at least one caucus call since March 16, and 180 participated in at least ten calls.\n\nBut while Khanna noted that Zoom is being used for virtual meetings, senators have been cautioned against it. The Senate sergeant at arms sent a memo to senators urging them not to use Zoom, according to reporting by the Financial Times, because of concerns about security and privacy.\n\nMeanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy have also changed the format of their weekly press conferences from in-person briefings to conference calls with reporters. The audio of Pelosi's call is broadcast live on C-SPAN 1.\n\nPelosi is regularly using conference calls to communicate with members of Congress, as well as with White House officials. This week, the speaker participated in a conference call with Vice President Mike Pence and the White House coronavirus task force, her office said. She has also been conducting frequent TV interviews from her home in San Francisco, using FaceTime or Cisco Webex.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's penchant for conducting business on his flip phone is well known, but he, too, is adapting to working remotely. According to his office, Schumer has held or participated in several conference calls by phone, as well as video calls and TV interviews on his iPad. For the past few weeks, Senate Democrats have convened for a weekly conference call, replacing their traditional weekly lunch.\n\nCongress is supposed to reconvene on April 20, but until then, most business will be done remotely. The Senate convened for a brief pro forma session on Thursday, but very few lawmakers were actually in attendance.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, is taking advantage of his time working from home to connect with constituents remotely. This week, Cruz conducted a tele-tour of communities responding to the coronavirus pandemic using phone calls and video conferences. The tours included calls with organizations like the Texas Hospital Association, the Texas Trucking Association, the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and other regional economic development councils.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Cruz said that he typically would go to places to meet with constituents in the wake of a natural disaster like Hurricane Harvey, but working remotely meant moving those interactions online or to the telephone.\n\nThe responsibility is the same, but given the social distancing guidelines, it is neither feasible nor advisable to be everywhere in person, Cruz said. So I'm doing the same thing, but virtually.\n\nCruz said he normally dedicates the morning to media interviews and spends afternoons speaking to his staff about policy and connecting with constituents. Like many other American families impacted by stay-at-home orders, Cruz, his wife and his two daughters are all inside the house during the work day.\n\nA silver lining for Cruz has been eating lunch and dinner with his family, a rarity for a senator, as well as taking hour-long walks and playing games with his daughters after dinner. Working from home does occasionally mean interruptions while he has virtual conversations, Cruz said. During TV interviews and calls, sometimes a dog barks in the background or wayward children try to sneak into the background of his makeshift home set.\n\nDespite the advantage of being able to log on while wearing sweatpants instead of suits, working remotely has been stressful for some congressional staffers, who are often already expected to work long hours on weekdays and weekends. A communications staffer for a House Democrat told CBS News that she's working even more than usual, particularly because her boss is inundated by media requests about the coronavirus.\n\nI don't have a clear separation of 'this is work' and 'this is home.' Everything has been both work and home, the staffer said.\n\nKhanna said that working remotely had made him more fully appreciate the workers who are unable to do so, such as construction workers and food delivery workers.\n\nThere's a stark divide in this country between those of us who can work remotely and those who can't, Khanna said. My hope is that this entire crisis makes us reflect on the value and the essential nature of work that isn't online.
China and American officials began talks on Monday to potentially resolve a bruising trade war between the world's two biggest economies. While both sides have expressed an interest in settling the fight, China complained of a sighting of a U.S. warship in what it said were Chinese waters.\n\nIt was unclear if the ruckus over the warship might disrupt the working level talks being held at the Chinese Commerce Ministry. The two sides have provided scant information about the discussions, and neither has indicated its stance has changed since a Dec. 1 agreement by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to postpone further increases.\n\nEnvoys will have positive and constructive discussions during meetings Monday and Tuesday, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang.\n\nThe American side is led by a deputy U.S. trade representative, Jeffrey D. Gerrish, according to the U.S. government. Neither side gave details of their agenda but Gerrish's delegation includes agriculture, energy, commerce, treasury and State Department officials.\n\nThe Chinese government gave no details of who would represent Beijing.\n\nThe gulf between the U.S. and China poses one of the top global risks in 2019, according to the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.\n\nWe're not confident the trade and economic disagreements will be resolved anytime soon, Eurasia Group wrote in a Monday report. And something more fundamental has broken in the relationship between Washington and Beijing that can't be put back together, regardless of what happens to their economic ties.\n\nRising tensions\n\nThe talks are going ahead despite tensions over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on U.S. charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.\n\nTrump imposed tariff increases of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports over complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for U.S. companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.\n\nWashington, Europe and other trading partners complain Beijing's tactics violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nStern complaints\n\nMinistry spokesman Lu said Monday during a routine briefing that Chinese military aircraft and naval vessels were dispatched to identify the U.S. vessel and warn it to leave the area near disputed islands in the South China Sea.\n\nWe have made stern complaints with the U.S., Lu said. He said the warship, which he said was the destroyer the USS McCampbell, had violated Chinese and international law, infringed on Chinese sovereignty and undermined peace and stability.\n\nAs for whether this move has any impact to the ongoing China-U.S. trade consultations... to properly resolve existing issues of all kinds between China and the U.S. is good for the two countries and the world, Lu said\n\nMade in China 2025\n\nThe trade clash reflects American anxiety about China's rise as a potential competitor in telecommunications and other technology. Trump wants Beijing to roll back initiatives like Made in China 2025, which calls for the state-led creation of global competitors in such fields as robotics and artificial intelligence. American officials worry those might erode U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party is reluctant to give up initiatives it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nChina's leaders have tried to defuse complaints by emphasizing the country's potential as an export market. They have announced a series of regulatory changes over the past year to increase foreign access to their auto, finance and other industries.\n\nSome Chinese officials suggest the technology initiatives might be opened to foreign companies. But they have given no details, leaving it unclear whether that will satisfy Washington.\n\n90-day postponement\n\nTrump and Xi agreed to a 90-day postponement of additional tariff increases to take effect Jan. 1. But economists say that is too little time to settle all the disputes that bedevil U.S.-Chinese relations. They say Beijing's goal probably is to show enough progress to persuade Trump to extend his deadline.\n\nDuring that 90-day period, agreements may not be reached until the last day, said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\n\nThis week's talks will focus on technical details before higher-level leaders make hard political decisions, Tu said.\n\nIn the longer term, the final tariffs might remain for several years, Tu said. I don't think it will proceed that fast. It must take time.\n\nCooling economic growth in both countries is turning up the pressure to reach a settlement.\n\nChinese growth fell to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier. Weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter, and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening because of concern that growth will slow this year.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nBeijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticize his tactics but echo U.S. complaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.\n\nThe European Union filed its own challenge in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese rules that the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.\n\nFor their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with U.S. curbs on exports of dual use technology with possible military applications. They complain China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\n\nSome manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries to avoid Trump's tariffs.\n\nUBS said Friday that 37 percent of 200 manufacturers surveyed by the bank have shifted out of China over the past 12 months. The threat of U.S. tariff hikes was the dominating factor for nearly half, while others moved because of higher costs or tighter environmental regulation.\n\nMost firms expect the trade war to escalate, the bank said.
OAKLAND, Calif. -- A U.S. judge in California on Sunday blocked Trump administration rules, which would allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control, from taking effect in 13 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nJudge Haywood Gilliam granted a request for a preliminary injunction by California, 12 other states and Washington, D.C. The plaintiffs sought to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled on Monday while a lawsuit against them moved forward.\n\nBut Gilliam limited the scope of the ruling to the plaintiffs, rejecting their request that he block the rules nationwide.\n\nThe changes would allow more employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost contraceptive coverage to women by claiming religious objections. Some private employers could also object on moral grounds.\n\nCalifornia and the other states argue that women would be forced to turn to state-funded programs for birth control and experience unintended pregnancies.\n\nThe law couldn't be more clear - employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Sunday. Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said in court documents the rules protect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.\n\nAt issue is a requirement under President Obama's health care law that birth control services be covered at no additional cost. Obama officials included exemptions for religious organizations. The Trump administration expanded those exemptions and added moral convictions as a basis to opt out of providing birth control services.\n\nAt a hearing on Friday, Gilliam said the changes would result in a substantial number of women losing birth control coverage, which would be a massive policy shift.\n\nThe judge previously blocked an interim version of the rules - a decision that was upheld in December by an appeals court.\n\nThe ruling affects California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Audits of the nation's biggest insurance companies have uncovered a systemic practice of insurers not paying benefits on millions of policies - even when the companies knew the policyholder was deceased. Lesley Stahl reports that 25 insurance companies, without admitting wrongdoing, have agreed to pay more than $7.5 billion in back death benefits in a series of settlements reached with states across the country. Thirty-five companies still have not settled and remain under investigation. Stahl's report will be broadcast on 60 Minutes, Sunday April 17 at 7 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nFlorida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty CBS News\n\nInsurance companies have long maintained that it is up to policyholders' beneficiaries to contact the insurance company and to file a claim in order to collect whatever death benefit may be due them. But if beneficiaries are unaware of the policy, they don't know to file a claim - something that happens with surprising frequency, says Kevin McCarty, the insurance commissioner of Florida who led the task force investigating the industry. McCarty says the insurance companies don't reach out to the beneficiaries -- even when the insurers know of the policyholder's death. What we found is that companies have actual knowledge in their files that people have died, yet they have neglected to initiate an investigation and pay the claim, he tells Stahl.\n\nOne way insurers learned of someone's death was through the use of the Social Security Administration's Death Master File. McCarty says that many insurance companies used the Death Master File to their advantage, cutting off annuity, or retirement, benefits to policyholders when they died-- but not using it to notify beneficiaries that they're owed a death benefit.\n\nMcCarty is bothered by that practice. I'm here to say that you have a responsibility to investigate a claim if you know someone has died, he says.\n\nWhat's even worse, says McCarty, is a practice he discovered involving whole life policies in which many insurers continued to make premium payments to themselves using their dead customers' money. What happened, McCarty says, is that policyholders built up a cash value in their policies over time, a nest egg they could access while alive. But after they passed away, many of the insurance companies drained down that accrued cash value to pay themselves premiums. It's a tactic originally designed to keep a policy in force if the holder has lost the financial ability to pay premiums. But in this case, McCarty says it's adding insult to injury. Oh, by the way. If you stick that policy in a shoe box and stick it in your closet, not only are we not going to look for you, but we're going to take all the cash value in it... Give it back to the company. And leave your beneficiary with nothing. Here, sign here.
Washington — In a highly unusual move, American diplomats have drafted two cables condemning President Trump's incitement of the deadly assault on the Capitol and calling for administration officials to possibly support invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\n\nUsing what is known as the State Department's dissent channel, career foreign and civil service officers said they fear last Wednesday's siege may badly undermine U.S. credibility to promote and defend democratic values abroad.\n\nFailing to publicly hold the president to account would further damage our democracy and our ability to effectively accomplish our foreign policy goals abroad, according to the second of the two cables, which were circulated among diplomats late last week and then sent to State Department leadership.\n\nThe cable called on Pompeo to support any lawful effort by Vice President Mike Pence and other Cabinet members to protect the country including through the possible implementation of the procedures provided for in Article 4 of the 25th Amendment, if appropriate. The amendment allows for the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare a president unfit for office, and the vice president then becomes acting president.\n\nThe cables were an extraordinary protest against a sitting U.S. president by American diplomats, who have long complained that the Trump administration has ignored and diminished their role and expertise. The dissent channel is normally used to oppose specific foreign policy decisions. The two most recent cables appear to be unprecedented in their scope and characterization of the president as a danger to the country.\n\nThe cables also reflect anger at the response to the riot by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a loyal Trump ally.\n\nPompeo has condemned the violence at the Capitol but has pointedly not addressed the role Mr. Trump played in encouraging his supporters who stormed the building. Nor has Pompeo addressed the aftermath or acknowledged that American diplomats overseas may now face new difficulty in promoting democracy.\n\nMr. Trump himself has railed about what he sees as disloyalty at the State Department. He once referred to it publicly — and in front of Pompeo and reporters — as the deep State Department, a reference to what Mr. Trump and his supporters believe is a cabal of entrenched bureaucrats intent on subverting his policies.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many diplomats signed the cables, both of which were viewed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is essential that the Department of State explicitly denounce President Trump's role in this violent attack on the U.S. government, said the first of the two cables, which added that the president's own comments should not be used as he is not a credible voice on this matter.\n\nJust as we routinely denounce foreign leaders who use violence and intimidation to interfere in peaceful democratic processes and override the will of their voters, the department's public statements about this episode should also mention President Trump by name. It is critical that we communicate to the world that in our system, no one -- not even the president -- is above the law or immune from public criticism.\n\nThis would be a first step towards repairing the damage to our international credibility, it said. It would allow the beacon of democracy to shine on despite this dark episode. It would also send a strong message to our friends and adversaries that the Department of State applies an ethos of integrity and objective standards when it condemns assaults on democracy at home or abroad.\n\nIt also said Pompeo should support any effort by Vice President Mike Pence and other Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office.\n\nPressure is building on Pence and the Cabinet to strip the president of his office, though it's unclear whether such a move would have support from a majority of the Cabinet. House Democrats plan to request unanimous consent on a resolution from Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland that calls on Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Mr. Trump from office. If Pence declines to act, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring articles of impeachment to the floor.\n\nRaskin's resolution calls for Pence to use his powers under the 25th Amendment to convene the Cabinet to declare that Mr. Trump is unable to successfully discharge the duties of his office and to transmit to the speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate that Pence will serve as the acting president.
A new SpaceX rocket blasting off on its long-awaited maiden flight this Tuesday -- the Falcon Heavy -- promises to put on a spectacular show as the world's most powerful booster climbs away from the Kennedy Space Center's historic pad 39A atop nearly 5 million pounds of thrust from 27 engines, nine in each of three core stages.\n\nThe Heavy will be the most powerful rocket launched anywhere in the world since NASA's now-retired space shuttle, the Soviet Union's unsuccessful N1 moon rocket, its short-lived Energia booster and the gargantuan Saturn 5 that launched NASA's Apollo moon missions with a staggering 7.5 million pounds of liftoff thrust.\n\nNASA is currently building an even more powerful rocket known as the Space Launch System, or SLS, that will generate 8.8 million pounds of thrust in its initial configuration and up to 11.9 million pounds in a follow-on cargo variant.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon Heavy atop pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center last month for pre-flight tests. The rocket is being readied for its maiden flight Tuesday. SpaceX\n\nBut the SLS is not expected to fly until late 2019 or later, and the Falcon Heavy, assuming it succeeds, will easily hold the title of world's most powerful operational booster in the near term.\n\nI think this could be an extremely significant launch, first of all because it's happening in 2018, not whenever SLS is going to launch. It is going to be, if it succeeds, the most powerful rocket in the world, and that enables lots of different things, said John Logsdon, a noted space historian and space policy analyst.\n\nIt poses a competitive challenge to the NASA way of doing business. Just as SpaceX has posed a challenge to (competitor) United Launch Alliance that seems to be succeeding, it could well pose a challenge to NASA's launch strategy, Logsdon said.\n\nAdding to the drama of the Heavy's first flight is its payload: A 2,760-pound Tesla Roadster provided by SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, which will be released onto a trajectory carrying it beyond low-Earth orbit and into deep space. David Bowie's Space Oddity apparently will be playing on the stereo -- or at least in SpaceX mission control in Hawthorne, California.\n\nPayload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing 'Space Oddity,' Musk tweeted late last year. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk shared a photo of his cherry red Tesla Roadster, complete with a spacesiited mannequin known as Starman strapped in the driver's seat, before the car was encapsulated in the nose cone of a Falcon Heavy rocket awaiting its maiden launch. SpaceX\n\nRockets typically carry dummy payloads, or mass simulators, when making their first flights. While blasting a $250,000 Tesla into space might seem extravagant, building a simulator almost certainly would have cost as much or more. And besides, launching a sports car into space is much more in keeping with Musk's playful streak.\n\nResponding to a question from a Twitter follower, Musk said:\n\nI love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 2, 2017\n\nWith forecasters predicting an 80 percent chance of good weather, liftoff is targeted for 1:30 p.m. EST (GMT-5) Tuesday. The test flight has generated widespread interest in the space community and beyond, but Musk has gone out of his way to downplay expectations.\n\nThis is one of those things that's really difficult to test on the ground, Musk said last year. There's a lot of risk associated with the Falcon Heavy, a real good chance that that vehicle does not make it to orbit. Want to make sure I set expectations accordingly. I hope it makes it far enough away from the pad that it does not cause pad damage, I would consider even that a win, to be honest. And uh, yeah. Major pucker factor, it really is.\n\nSpaceX has shaken up the commercial rocket industry, launching 48 Falcon 9 rockets since the booster's debut in 2010 -- 18 last year alone -- and perfecting techniques for recovering the booster's first stage so it can be refurbished and re-launched, part of Musk's long-range plan to lower costs through rapid reusability.\n\nThe business end of the Falcon Heavy, showing 27 Merlin engines at the bases of three core stages. Firing together, the engines will generate about 5 million pounds of thrust. SpaceX\n\nThe company has suffered one in-flight failure and one on-the-pad explosion, but it has put together an impressive list of accomplishments for a startup without decades of experience. It has a $10 billion backlog of payloads awaiting launch holds, more than $4 billion in NASA contracts to deliver supplies to the International Space Station and, eventually, astronauts starting late this year or early next.\n\nLee Solid, a retired rocket engineer who helped build the engines that powered the Saturn 5 and the space shuttle, visited SpaceX's processing hangar at the base of pad 39A last week with former shuttle commander Eileen Collins.\n\nI was impressed with the whole vehicle and the people working it, he said in an interview Sunday. If I had any question or negative thoughts about what Elon's doing, they went away. It was a very professional operation out there.\n\nThe Heavy is made up of three side-by-side Falcon 9 core stages, each equipped with nine SpaceX Merlin engines burning RP-1 kerosene fuel and liquid oxygen. An upper stage atop the central core is equipped with a single Merlin engine generating 210,000 pounds of push. For its maiden flight, the Tesla Roadster will be mounted in a nose-cone fairing atop the second stage.\n\nAt liftoff, with all 27 core stage engines firing in concert at about 92 percent of full power, the Heavy will generate 4.7 million pounds of thrust. That's more than twice the liftoff power of a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy and more than one-and-a-half times the power of a European Ariane 5.\n\nFlying for the first time, it's difficult to predict exactly how the Falcon Heavy will perform. As it consumes propellant, loses weight and accelerates, hard-to-model aerodynamic stresses will build up, producing extreme loads on the structure and localized heating.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of controlling ignition, startup and steady operation of 27 engines firing in close proximity. The vibration environment with 27 clustered engines is extremely difficult to model, one veteran engineer said, subjecting the rocket to significant stresses. The Soviet Union built the huge N1 moon rocket with 30 first stage engines, but the booster failed all four times it was launched.\n\nThe Heavy's engines were test fired at the pad on Jan. 24 and SpaceX said later there were no problems. But Musk cautioned last year there's a lot that could go wrong when 27 engines are firing at once, adding, I encourage people to come down to the Cape and see the first Falcon Heavy mission. It's guaranteed to be exciting.\n\nThe two outside core stages will separate and fly back to landings at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station while the central core stage will attempt a landing on an off-shore droneship. SpaceX\n\nAnd not just for the launch. After engine shutdown, the two previously flown outside core stages will separate, flip around and fly back to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for side-by-side rocket-powered descents to touchdown at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1. The central core stage will attempt to land on an off-shore droneship.\n\nThe recovery of three stages will push SpaceX's record to 24 successful landings in 27 attempts while providing area tourists and residents with a dramatic show highlighted by dueling sonic booms.\n\nOn SpaceX's web site, the company claims the Heavy can send a payload weighing up to 140,660 pounds to low-Earth orbit and 37,000 pounds to Mars. It can send a probe to distant Pluto weighing up to 7,720 pounds, about seven times the mass of NASA's New Horizons Pluto flyby mission, which was launched by the most powerful version of United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket.\n\nNASA's space shuttle generated about 6.8 million pounds of thrust from three hydrogen-fueled main engines and two huge solid-fuel boosters. The agency's Saturn 5 moon rocket still holds the record as the most powerful operational rocket ever built, using five huge F1 first stage engines to generate 7.5 million pounds of thrust.\n\nThe Saturn 5, which flew 13 times, had an Earth-escape payload capacity of more than 100,000 pounds, about three times the capability of the Falcon Heavy. But at an advertised price of $90 million, the Heavy is much less expensive and can still boost sizable payloads beyond low-Earth orbit.\n\nBut SpaceX's long-range plans for the rocket are somewhat foggy. Musk said last year the Heavy would be used to launch two paying customers on a looping flight around the moon, but no details have been announced. As of this writing, only three missions are believed to be booked on the Heavy.\n\nComplicating the outlook, SpaceX is designing a much more powerful BFR rocket (a euphemism for big [expletive] rocket) that would dwarf the Heavy in payload capability. It is the rocket Musk plans to use for eventual flights to Mars.\n\nI don't understand what they're doing, Logsdon said. Elon's out talking about they're not going to pursue the Falcon line of rockets, he's going to put all his efforts into the BFR. So, what is the future of Heavy?\n\nA knowledgeable rocket engineer who asked not to be named said the Heavy is too powerful for routine use launching Earth-orbiting satellites but not powerful enough to serve as a stand-alone lunar exploration rocket. He said it's generally agreed that meaningful missions to the moon or beyond will require rockets capable of boosting 130-metric-ton payloads into Earth orbit.\n\nSome observers have speculated that the Heavy might be intended as a shot across NASA's bow, so to speak, while the agency is developing the more expensive, but more capable, Space Launch System rocket. They suspect Musk hopes to win government support to help fund the BFR at the expense of the SLS.\n\nLogsdon said he believes it is good for the country to have two alternative heavy lift vehicles, at least for a little while, to see which one works better. But he also believes the SLS enjoys enough solid congressional support to sustain it for some few more years, anyway.
The coronavirus took center stage at the 11th debate of the presidential primary season as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were tested on their approaches to the epidemic if they were president.\n\nThe outbreak's impact over daily life in the United States was evident from the outset of the debate, as Sanders and Biden opted for an elbow bump over a handshake before taking their places behind their respective podiums. The debate did not have a live audience and was moved last week from Arizona to CNN's studios in Washington, D.C., to limit the cross-country travel for the candidates and their campaigns.\n\nBoth candidates were pressed about how they would address the spread of the deadly virus and agreed it is vital to ensure hospitals have access to the equipment and tests needed. Americans, they said, should be protected from the economic fallout from the coronavirus, especially those who may find themselves out of work as businesses are forced to temporarily close their doors.\n\nThis is bigger than any one of us, Biden said. This calls for a national rallying of everybody together.\n\nSanders, meanwhile, said President Trump should be silenced, as it is unacceptable for the president to be blabbering with unfactual information, which is confusing the general public.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (2R) and Senator Bernie Sanders (R) take part in the 11th Democratic Party 2020 presidential debate in a CNN Washington Bureau studio in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, March 15, 2020. Getty\n\nBoth Sanders and Biden also agreed that there is a role for the U.S. military to play as states rush to limit the spread of the coronavirus, of which there are more than 3,000 reported cases in the U.S.\n\nWe use all of the tools that make sense, Sanders said.\n\nBiden, too, said he would call up the military now.\n\nThey have the capacity to provide this surge help that hospitals need and that is needed across the nation, he said.\n\nBut the debate over how best to address the coronavirus also highlighted the policy differences between Biden and Sanders, particularly regarding health care. While Sanders is an ardent supporter of Medicare for All, Biden favors expanding and building upon the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLet's be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weaknesses and dysfunctionality of our current healthcare system Sanders said.\n\nAmericans, Sanders added, should not have to worry about how to pay their medical bills.\n\nBottom line here is, in terms of 'Medicare for All,' despite what the vice president is saying, what the experts tell us is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we don't have a system, he said. We've got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide healthcare to all people.\n\n\n\nBut Biden knocked Sanders' support of Medicare for All, noting that Italy, which has seen its health care system overwhelmed by the coronavirus, has a single-payer system. The country implemented a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the illness.\n\nThe national crisis says, we're responding. It's all free. You don't have to pay for a thing, he said, referring to waiving medical costs during a public health crisis. That has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy. This is a crisis. We're at war with the virus. We're at war with the virus. It has nothing to do with co-pays or anything.\n\n\n\nThe two candidates also diverged on how best to mitigate the economic impacts of the coronavirus.\n\n\n\nSanders said the coronavirus outbreak demonstrates the need to address income and wealth inequality in the country with urgency.\n\n\n\nWe have got to move aggressively right now, he said.\n\n\n\nBut Biden said the focus should be addressing the public health crisis first before moving to larger economic issues.\n\n\n\nPeople are looking for results, not a revolution, he said.\n\n\n\nBoth Biden and Sanders are at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus due to their ages — Biden is 77 and Sanders is 78. To protect themselves, the two candidates said they are washing their hands frequently and using hand sanitizer liberally.\n\n\n\nThey have also directed their campaign staffs to work from home and are conducting virtual, rather than in-person campaign events.
WICHITA, Kan. -- The Kansas Department of Children and Families knew that a 2-year-old boy who died after being injured in his home last week was being abused and did not take steps to protect him, according to an attorney for the boy's grandparents. Anthony Bunn died Friday at a Wichita hospital after officers found him with head and face injuries, police said.\n\nHis mother, Elizabeth Woolheater, 22, and her boyfriend, Lucas Diel, 25, are being held in Sedgwick County jail on suspicion of murder and endangering a child.\n\nShayla Johnston, an attorney for the boy's maternal grandparents, says in a court document filed over the weekend that the state was aware of a previous abuse report involving Anthony in October 2017 and didn't follow procedures to find permanent placement for him, The Wichita Eagle reported.\n\nThe allegation comes as the department faces criticism for other cases in which young children died after law enforcement and the state agency received reports they were being abused. One of those cases involves Johnston's nephew, 3-year-old Evan Brewer, whose body was found in concrete in September. Evan's relatives have said they repeatedly reported abuse to the state and police. His mother and her boyfriend are charged in his death. And relatives of 5-year-old Lucas Hernandez, who disappeared in February, also say they called the state to report suspected abuse.\n\nJohnston said in a document filed in Sedgwick County District Court that after Anthony was abused in October 2017, he was safe in the custody of his grandparents, Zachary and Nancy Woolheater, for 12 days but he was eventually returned to his mother.\n\nThe state agency on Monday confirmed it conducted a joint child abuse investigation concerning Anthony with Wichita law enforcement in October 2017.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by this senseless tragedy ... and staff are reviewing this case to determine whether personnel, policy or procedure changes are necessary to prevent further tragedies from occurring, the statement said.\n\nJohnston filed the document in Anthony's death as part of the grandparents' effort to intervene legally on their grandson's behalf and to deal with his end-of-life medical care.\n\nZachary Woolheater gave an emotional statement to reporters Tuesday, according to CBS affiliate KWCH, saying his grandson had a face and personality that lit up everyone he met. He said he made the October 2017 report to the child welfare agency after noticing bruises on the boy's body.\n\nWoolheater called on residents to help end the plague of child abuse in the community and to hold local officials accountable for protecting kids.\n\nI pray that no one else ever has to have their babies taken away like this, said Woolheater. The amount of pain, anger and complete emptiness that we feel is overwhelming.\n\nA redacted report from Wichita police said officers investigated an abuse complaint involving Anthony in October but not enough evidence was found to file charges. The report said the possible abuse began on July 23, 2017, and ended on Oct. 16, 2017.\n\nThe county's district attorney's office confirmed Monday that the earlier case was presented as a child abuse case to prosecutors in November. District Attorney Marc Bennett was expected to make a statement after investigators present the new case to prosecutors, said spokesman Dan Dillon.
You know that universal sign we give truckers, hoping they'll sound their air horns? Well, you're going to be hearing a lot less honking in the future. And with good reason. The absence of an actual driver in the cab. We may focus on the self-driving car, but autonomous trucking is not an if, it's a when. And the when is coming sooner than you might expect. Already, companies have been quietly testing their prototypes on public roads. Right now, there's a high-stakes, high-speed race pitting the usual suspects, Google and Tesla and other global tech firms, against small start-ups smelling opportunity. The driverless semi will convulse the trucking sector and the two million American drivers who turn a key and maneuver their big rig every day. And the winners of this derby, they may be poised to make untold billions, they'll change the U.S. transportation grid and they will emerge as the new kings of the road.\n\nCBS News\n\n\n\nIt's one of the great touchstones of Americana: the romance and possibility of the open road. All hail the 18-wheeler hugging those asphalt ribbons, transporting all of our stuff across the fruited plains, from sea to shining sea. Though we may not give it a second thought when we click that free shipping icon, truckers move 70% of the nation's goods. But trucking cut a considerably different figure on a humid Sunday last summer on the Florida turnpike. Starsky Robotics, a tech startup, may have been driving in the right lane, but they passed the competition with 35,000 pounds of steel thundering down a busy highway with nobody behind the wheel. The test was a milestone. Starsky was the first company to put a truck on an open highway without a human on board. Everyone else in the game with the know-how keeps a warm body in the cab as backup. For now, anyway. If you didn't hear about this, you're not alone; in Jacksonville, we talked to Jeff Widdows, his son Tanner, Linda Allen and Eric Richardson - all truckers; and all astonished to learn how far this technology has come.\n\nLinda Allen: I wasn't aware 'til I ran across one on the Florida Turnpike and that just-- it just scares me. I can't imagine. But I didn't know anything about it.\n\nJon Wertheim: No one's talkin' about it at work.\n\nJeff Widdows: Nobody, never, never.\n\nEric Richardson: I didn't know that it'd come so far. And I'm thinking, Wow. It's here.\n\nTruckers speak with correspondent Jon Wertheim CBS News\n\nHe's right. The autonomous truck revolution is here. It just isn't much discussed - not on CB radios; and not in statehouses. And transportation agencies are not inclined to pump the brakes. From Florida, hang a left and drive 2000 miles west on I-10 and you'll hit the proving grounds of a company with a fleet of 41 autonomous rigs.\n\nJon Wertheim: This is a shop floor? Or this is a laboratory\n\nChuck Price: It's both.\n\nIn the guts of the Sonoran Desert, outside Tucson, Chuck Price is chief product officer at TuSimple, a privately held, global autonomous trucking outfit valued at more than a billion dollars with operations in the U.S. and China. At this depot, $12 million worth of gleaming self-driving semis are on the move.\n\nJon Wertheim: Right now we've got safety operators in the cab. How far away are we from runs without drivers?\n\nChuck Price: We believe we'll be able to do our first driver-out demonstration runs on public highways in 2021.\n\nThat's the when. As for the how...\n\nChuck Price: Our primary sensor system is our array of cameras that you see along the top of the vehicle--\n\nJon Wertheim: Heard about souping up vehicles. This takes it to a new level.\n\nChuck Price: It's a little bit different… yeah.\n\nThe competition is fierce, so much so their technology is akin to a state secret. But Price points us to a network of sensors, cameras and radar devices strapped to the outside of the rig, all of it hardwired to an internal AI supercomputer that drives the truck. It's self-contained — so a bad WiFi signal won't wreak havoc on the road.\n\nChuck Price: Our system can see farther than any other autonomous system in the world. We can see forward over a half mile.\n\nJon Wertheim: You can drive autonomously at night?\n\n\n\nChuck Price: We can. Day, night. And in the rain. And in the rain at night.\n\nChuck Price shows correspondent Jon Wertheim the automated trucks. CBS News\n\nAnd they're working on driving in the snow. Chuck Price has unshakable confidence in the reliability of the technology; as do some of the biggest names in shipping: UPS, Amazon and the U.S. Postal Service ship freight with TuSimple trucks. All in, each unit costs more than a quarter million dollars. Not a great expense, considering it's designed to eliminate the annual salary of a driver; currently around $45,000. Another savings: the driverless truck can get coast-to-coast in two days, not four, stopping only to refuel—though a human still has to do that.\n\nWe wanted to hop in and experience automated trucking firsthand.\n\nJon Wertheim: I feel like it's our turn on Space Mountain.\n\n\n\nChuck Price was happy to oblige. We didn't know what to expect, so we fashioned more cameras to the rig than NASA glued to the Apollo rockets...\n\nMaureen Fitzgerald: Is everybody buckled in?\n\nALL: Buckled in.\n\nMaureen Fitzgerald: Three, Two, One….\n\n...and we hit go.\n\n\n\nTRUCK COMPUTER: Autonomous driving started.\n\nWe sat in the back alongside the computer. In the front seat: Maureen Fitzgerald, a trucker's trucker with 30 years experience. She was our safety driver, babysitting with no intention of gripping the wheel, but there just in case. Riding shotgun: an engineer, John Panttila, there to monitor the software. The driverless truck was attempting a 65-mile loop in weekday traffic through Tucson.\n\nMaureen Fitzgerald's foot while automated technology takes the wheel. CBS News\n\nThe route was mapped and programmed in before the run, but that's about it - the rest was up to the computer, which makes 20 decisions per second about what to do on the road. As we rolled past distracted drivers, disabled cars, slow-pokes and sheriffs, our safety driver kept vigil but never disengaged the driverless system.\n\nJohn Panttila: Watching the front targets close in a hundred. Yep. Got to cut in right now. 55 mile an hour. Bad cut-off.\n\nJon Wertheim: This guy just flagrantly cut off--\n\nChuck Price: He just really cut us off.\n\nJon Wertheim: We did not honk at him. Did we disengage?\n\nChuck Price: We did not disengage. This vehicle will detect that kind of behavior faster than the humans.\n\nJon Wertheim: How far are we from being able to pick up the specific cars that are passing us? Oh, that's Joe from New Jersey with six points on his license.\n\n\n\nChuck Price: We can read license plates. So if there was an accessible database for something like that, we could.\n\nChuck Price says that would be valuable to the company though he admits it could create obvious privacy issues. But TuSimple does collect a lot of data, as it maps more and more routes across the southwest. Their enterprise also includes a fleet of autonomous trucks in Shanghai, as well as a research center in Beijing. The data collected by every truck, along every mile, it's uploaded and used by TuSimple, they say only to perfect performance on the road. Maureen Fitzgerald is convinced that tusimple's technology is superior to human drivers.\n\nJon Wertheim: You call these trucks your babies? What do your babies do well, and what could they do better?\n\nMaureen Fitzgerald: This truck is scanning mirrors, looking 1,000 meters out. It's processing all the things that my brain could never do and it can react 15 times faster than I could.\n\nMost of her two million fellow truckers are less enthusiastic. Automated trucking threatens to jack-knife an entire $800 billion industry. Trucking is among the most common jobs for american's without a college education. So this disruption caused by the driverless truck, it cuts deep.\n\nSteve Viscelli: As truckers like to say, if you bought it, a truck brought it.\n\nSteve Viscelli is a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in freight transportation and automation. He also spent six months driving a big rig.\n\nJon Wertheim: What segment do you think's gonna be hit first by driverless trucks?\n\n\n\nSteve Viscelli: I've identified two segments that I think are most at-risk. And that's-- refrigerated and dry van truckload. And those constitute about 200,000 trucking jobs. And then what's called line haul and they're somewhere in the neighborhood of 80,000-90,000 jobs there.\n\n\n\nJon Wertheim: So you're talkin' 300,000 jobs off the top-- It's a big number.\n\n\n\nSteve Viscelli: It is a big number.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe Florida truckers we met represent 70 years experience and millions of safe driving miles. They say they love the job and when asked to describe their work they kick around words like vital, honest and patriotic.\n\nEric Richardson: It makes you feel like you could-- should just poke your chest out with the responsibility (LAUGH) that you're taking on kinda makes you feel like a-- like you're needed.\n\nAsked about driverless trucks, they feel like they are being run off the road. But another issue troubles them even more.\n\nJeff Widdows: I think that companies need to keep safety in mind… You have a glitch in a computer at that speed--\n\nLinda Allen: Yeah.\n\nJeff Widdows: (LAUGH) you can do some damage--\n\nLinda Allen: There's too many things that can go wrong.\n\nEric Richardson: One of them semis hits something that's small, like a car or a passenger car, or anything like that, it's a done deal. I mean...\n\nLinda Allen: I was on 75-- last month-- through Ocala. And there was a bad accident So a state trooper came out. And he was hand-signaling people. You go here. You go there. How's an autonomous truck gonna recognize what the officer is trying to say or do? How's that gonna work?\n\nJon Wertheim: Sympathy, empathy, fear, code, eye contact-- I don't know how you create an algorithm that accounts for all that.\n\nLinda Allen: You can't.\n\nJon Wertheim: Does the public have a right to know if they're testing driverless trucks on the interstate--\n\nALL: --absolutely--\n\nTanner Widdows: That's-- well, that's our concern, is -- who's watching this? Who's making sure they're not throwing something unsafe on the road?\n\nSam Loesche: I think a lot of it-- is being done with almost no oversight from-- good governance groups, from the government itself\n\nSam Loesche represents 600,000 truckers for the teamsters. He's concerned that federal, state and local governments have only limited access to the driverless technology.\n\nSam Loesche: A lot of this information, understandably, is proprietary. Tech companies wanna keep, you know, their algorithms and their safety data-- secret until they can kinda get it right. The problem is that, in the meantime, they're testing this technology on public roads. They're testing it next to you as you drive down the road.\n\nAnd that was consistent with our reporting.\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you have to tell anyone when you test?\n\nChuck Price: No, not for individual tests.\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you have to tell them where you test?\n\nChuck Price: We do not currently have to tell them where we test in Arizona.\n\nJon Wertheim: Or how-- how often you test?\n\nChuck Price: No.\n\nJon Wertheim: Do you have to share your data with any state department of transportation?\n\nChuck Price: Currently, we're not required to share data, we would be happy to share data.\n\nJon Wertheim: What about inspections? Does anyone from the Arizona DOT come by and-- and check this stuff out?\n\nChuck Price: The DOT comes by all the time. We talk with them regularly. It's not a formal inspection process yet.\n\nA self-driving truck on the road. CBS News\n\nWe wanted to ask Elaine Chao, secretary of the Department of Transportation, about regulating this emerging sector. She declined an interview, but provided us with a statement which reads in part: The Department needs to prepare for the transportation systems of the future by engaging with new technologies to address… safety… without hampering innovation.\n\nTo that point, Chuck Price is emphatic that driverless trucks pose fewer dangers.\n\nChuck Price: We eliminate texting accidents, no distraction--\n\nJon Wertheim: Because there's no-- no texting while driving when there's a computer.\n\nChuck Price: There are no drunk computers. And the computer doesn't sleep. So those are large causes of accidents.\n\nHe adds that driverless trucks are more fuel efficient in part because they can stay perfectly aligned in their lane and unlike humans, are programmed never to speed, but he admits the profit motive is significant.\n\nJon Wertheim: You think there's a lot of money to be made here.\n\nChuck Price: There's certainly a lot of money to be made. There's a-- there's an opportunity to solve a very big problem.\n\nSteve Viscelli says the industry may be imperfect, but he thinks the solution should not depend on driverless technology alone.\n\nJon Wertheim: What's your response to the technology companies that say, Look, I'm trying to do something more efficiently, and I'm going to improve safety. This is American enterprise. What are you gonna get in the way of this for?\n\nSteve Viscelli: I'd say that-- that's wonderful. (LAUGH) But that's not your job. Right? Your job's to make money. Policy is gonna decide what our outcomes are gonna be trucking is a very competitive industry. The low-road approach often wins\n\nJon Wertheim: We talk about the internal combustion engine replacing the horse and buggy, and Eisenhower's Interstate System-- when we talk about these transformational markers in transportation-- Where's driverless trucking gonna rank?\n\nSteve Viscelli: It's gonna be one of the biggest.\n\nProduced by Michael Karzis.

A week after Super Tuesday, the Democratic field has winnowed to two main candidates, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who will be fighting for delegates in six states on Tuesday. The most closely-watched of these upcoming six states is Michigan. With 125 delegates, it offers the biggest prize of the night. In 2016, Sanders scored a major surprise upset against Hillary Clinton, by winning the majority of white voters, though Clinton won handily among black voters and women. It is unclear whether Sanders can replicate that victory this time around against Biden. Like Clinton, Biden has so far proven he has significant support among African Americans, and he is also more popular among working-class white voters than Clinton was.\n\nA new poll from Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a commanding lead over Sanders. Fifty-one percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they planned to support Biden compared to 36% for Sanders. Biden led Sanders among white voters (50% to 36%), voters of other races, (53% to 36%), voters age 50 and over (62% to 24%) and women (53% to 33%). Sanders led Biden among voters under 50 years old (49% to 38%) and men (49% to 39%). As of last week, according to a Detroit News/WDIV poll, absentee voters who had cast their votes also heavily favored Biden over Sanders. Pollster Richard Czuba estimated that Biden can bank an almost 150,000-vote lead on Sanders just through absentees. Michigan voters care most about beating President Trump (39.3%). Health care was a distant second (18.5%), the survey found.\n\nSanders is making a big push in Michigan, having appeared at events in five different cities during the final weekend before Tuesday's primary. He went to the county where he suffered his biggest defeat in 2016 by vote total, Wayne County, home of Detroit, and the county where he had his biggest win by vote total, Kent County, where Grand Rapids is located. He also stopped by the liberal haven of Ann Arbor to try to boost support from University of Michigan students at a rally with one of highest-profile supporters, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Young voters were critical to his success in 2016 in Michigan, and they're supporting him in large numbers so far in 2020. On the trail in Michigan, he has been vocal about trade, continuing to hammer home the theme that Biden has championed trade deals like NAFTA that many union voters view with suspicion. Turnout among African American voters will be closely watched. Though Biden's ties to black voters have been proven in the contests so far, turnout in Michigan, particularly in Wayne County, and the level of enthusiasm for him could be a key factor on Tuesday. Suburban women are another key constituency for Biden. Sanders has promised to expand the electorate with new voters, but after a disappointing showing on Super Tuesday, he has admitted some disappointment that the level of turnout is not what he had hoped for or anticipated. Michigan holds what's known as an open closed primary — there is no party registration requirement in the state. Any person can vote in either party's primary, but voters must ask for one party's ballot when they show up at the polls and identify in writing which political party they wish to vote with in the primary.\n\n\n\nDue to a 2018 ballot measure, voters can vote absentee without providing a reason. If a person voted absentee for a candidate who has since suspended his or her campaign, that voter can change their vote if they submitted requests in writing by March 7 or appear in person by Monday, March 9. As of March 6, 24,109 people had done this, according to the Michigan Secretary of State's office. Michigan's results could take some time to tabulate. As of March 5, about 90% more absentee ballots were sent compared to five days before the primary in 2016. Nearly 600,000 absentee ballots had been cast as of that day. The secretary of state has pushed Michigan's Legislature to change state law to allow clerks to process or count absentee ballots before Election Day. Sanders is expected to do well in Idaho and North Dakota, both states with largely white and rural populations, and both states he won in 2016 against Clinton. He is also polling high in Washington state, the last primary to close on Tuesday. But like California, most of Washington votes by mail, so the results may not be known for some time.\n\nMISSISSIPPI\n\nMississippi also votes on Tuesday. It's a state that's expected to go big for Biden, given that it has an even larger African American Democratic electorate than South Carolina. In 2016, 71% of the Democratic primary voters in the state were African American. Polls will be open between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. ET. There is no early voting in the state. Absentee ballots had to be received by March 9 to be counted. As of March 5, more than 15,000 voters had requested an absentee ballot for the March 10 election, according to the secretary of state's office. As of March 3, only 10,503 ballots have been received by the circuit clerks offices.\n\nMISSOURI\n\nIn 2016, Clinton had the support from key political figures and labor unions in the state, but won the state by less than 1,500 votes. Exit polling said Clinton won women with 54% but Sanders won men with 56%. Sanders also won over voters under 44, while Clinton had the backing of voters in the state 45 years old and up. Clinton also won 67% of black voters, compared to Sanders 32%, but Sanders won white voters 54% to 45%. Missouri is an open primary, so voters can ask for any party's ballot on Election Day. Delegates will be allocated proportionally to the vote, and the threshold for delegates is 15%. Missouri does not have early voting but allows absentee voting. The period to request ballots ended last week, and those ballots must either be received by the time polls close Tuesday or submitted in person by Monday. According to the office of the Missouri secretary of state, 66,374 people had requested absentee ballots as of March 6, but a spokesperson for the office said it would not have a clear sense of how many had been returned until after the election.\n\nIDAHO\n\nIn the Idaho primary, candidates need to meet at 15% threshold at the congressional district level or statewide to be considered viable. Independent and unaffiliated voters are allowed to participate in the Democratic primary but cannot participate in the Republican primary. In-person early voting in Idaho ran from February 24 through March 6. In 2018, Idaho changed from a party-run caucus to a state-run primary. Idaho allows same-day registration for voters at polling locations. Sanders prevailed against Clinton in the state in 2016.\n\nNORTH DAKOTA\n\nNorth Dakota holds a firehouse caucus, which is essentially a party-run primary. The caucuses are open and anyone can participate. Voting by mail took place January 20 through March 5. In the open caucuses, candidates must meet a threshold of 15% statewide to be considered viable. In 2016, Sanders beat Clinton in the state, winning the state's 18 delegates. Its voters are also largely white and rural.\n\n***Musadiq Bidar, Adam Brewster, Sarah Ewall-Wice & Alex Tin contributed to this report\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nBy the end of Monday night, Biden in Michigan will have appeared with his trio of recent, high-profile endorsers: Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Kamala Harris of California. CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson says that with the latest endorsement, Booker's backing on Monday morning, a total of 10 former Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed Biden. Sanders currently has two from former 2020 rivals: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Marianne Williamson. While Biden hopes to focus in the Rust Belt on his health care policy differences with Sanders, coronavirus has placed both the president and the Democratic candidates under the spotlight. I think there's no confidence in the president, in anything he says or does, Biden told MSNBC on Monday. I wish he'd be quiet, just let the experts speak and acknowledge whatever they suggest to him is what we should be doing.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nSanders dodged a question today about taking personal precautions for his own health in the wake of coronavirus, says CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. Well, I'm surrounded by medical personnel, Sanders said referring to a panel of health care professional around him, assembled for a campaign event on coronavirus. Thank you for asking. I am running for President of the United States and that requires a whole lot of work, he said. Sanders' message on coronavirus is twofold: First, he said the Trump administration's failure to embrace science is making the situation worse, including the appointment of Vice President Mike Pence as coronavirus czar. During the panel discussion, Sanders read a quote from the president that suggested people should work through symptoms. That might be the stupidest advice ever made by a president of the United States, said Sanders. Secondly, folding in Medicare for All, Sanders said a vaccine should be made free for everyone. He also said a single-payer system would lower the risks on contamination as people could to the doctor without fear of not affording care. Earlier Monday, at a rally in St. Louis, Sanders spoke the virus at length. And just look at the insanity dealing with this coronavirus, this very serious problem that we're dealing with in America, dealing with all over the world. Think about the insanity of a system where today, somebody wakes up and maybe they think they have the symptoms of coronavirus. Yet they cannot afford to go to a doctor. What does that mean? So they're gonna go to work, and make a serious epidemic even worse, he said.\n\nLIFE AFTER 2020\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG\n\nLess than a week after suspending his presidential campaign, billionaire and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg is spending his own money to combat voter suppression. CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry confirms Bloomberg gave $2 million to Collective Future for African American voter registration. This is not the first time Bloomberg has spent his own wealth for this particular issue. In December 2019, Bloomberg announced a $5 million donation to Stacey Abrams' new voter protective initiative. This donation expands on Bloomberg's commitment to register 500,000 voters from under-represented groups in key swing states heading into November's general election. Voter suppression efforts across the country have been a barely disguised effort to keep Black Americans and other Democratic-leaning voters from the polls. I've always believed we need to make it easier for all citizens to register and vote, not harder. Bloomberg said in a statement. That's why I strongly support Collective Future in their effort to register 500,000 Black Americans. These new voters could determine the November election - and the future of the country. The stakes couldn't be higher. So while our campaign for the presidency is over, our work to get America back on track is still growing. A spokesperson for Bloomberg told CBS News the money was transferred last week, but the proposal had been in the works before Bloomberg exited the race after a poor Super Tuesday showing.\n\nCORY BOOKER\n\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced on Monday he is endorsing Biden for president says CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In an email to supporters, Booker explained his decision to endorse Biden. Joe is building the kind of campaign that will do more than remove one guy from one office, the email reads. He will lead the Democratic Party to victory in races up and down the ballot across the country this November. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Booker talked about the importance of unifying the Democratic Party ahead of Tuesday's primary contests. It is about time we start unifying as a party and begin the work to beat Donald Trump and frankly, save our nation, humanity, address our common cause and our common challenges, Booker said.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\n\nIn his first television interview since suspending his presidential campaign, Pete Buttigieg told NBC News the decision to drop out of the race was his own after being asked if the establishment pressured him to end his presidential bid. Look the kind of people who run for President of the United States are the kind of people who make their own decisions, Buttigieg said. It was my decision. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Buttigieg also announced that he will be guest hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday. He said that one of the guests on Thursday is actor Sir Patrick Stewart.\n\nISSUES THAT MATTER\n\nTRADE\n\nThere's a trade war raging between the top two Democratic presidential contenders, report CBS News campaign reporters Bo Erickson and Cara Korte. Since Super Tuesday left two main candidates standing last week, Sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and Biden disagree. Trade has taken center stage this week, as the two men fight for delegates in the industrial Midwest. Though neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy, a decisive primary win in Michigan on Tuesday or next week in Ohio could signal how the Democratic Party will approach trade and the nation's economic agenda. Across one of the nation's most iconic manufacturing states, Sanders has been taking swipes at Biden's positions on trade. He slammed then-Senator Biden's support of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which eliminated most tariffs between the U.S., Mexico and Canada and the 2000 China Trade Bill, which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations (PNTR) with China. Sanders voted against both measures as a House member and continues to rail against the policies today, a point highlighted by a Sanders ad called Decimated that's up in every March 10 and March 17 primary state. If we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements, Sanders told a Detroit crowd on Friday. This playbook may seem familiar to Democrats, since Sanders waged a similar campaign against Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries in Michigan. He skewered her at a Democratic debate held in Flint, Michigan, two days before the primary. Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America. NAFTA, supported by the Secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide; tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs, he said at the time.\n\nThe argument helped Sanders eke out a win over Clinton in the Great Lakes state, in a 1.5-point upset. Later, Mr. Trump, too, consistently criticized Clinton over NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Sanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character. I worked with the unions as a member of the House of Representative to defeat NAFTA and to defeat PNTR with China. I can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in Montpellier, Vermont in opposition to NAFTA. I knew what it was gonna do. I knew that you cannot ask American workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in Mexico, Sanders said Friday in Detroit. The senator hit the same note during campaign stops in Michigan over weekend. He said in Flint on Saturday that I heard, during that period in the '90s, I heard all of corporate America say, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' And all of the media said, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' I stood with the unions, the working families of this country; I voted against those agreements! Joe Biden voted for those agreements. The reviews of NAFTA are somewhat mixed, and a new version of the deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, is expected to be implemented soon, after Canada ratifies it. In 2013, the liberal think tank Economic Policy Institute projected that NAFTA caused, 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power. At the same time, Foreign Affairs estimates that 14 million American jobs still depend on NAFTA. And a 2016 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission concluded the policy, had essentially no effect on real wages in the United States of either skilled or unskilled workers.\n\nBiden has rarely brought up North American trade policy on the stump since the Iowa caucuses, where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with China. Instead, he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members, even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of U.S. production to cheaper alternatives in Mexico, as General Motors did in March 2019, eliminating 1,700 hourly jobs in Ohio alone. He stands by his NAFTA vote, arguing that no, it wasn't a mistake to vote in favor of the deal, he said last May in Iowa. He has labeled himself a fair trader, rather than a free trader. He added, We should treat other countries in a way they treat us…Just deciding it's all about trade deficit balancing...we need to do more.\n\nThe most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the USMCA agreement, an idea then-candidate Barack Obama pitched in the 2008 primary. Biden has said that in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections, issues that he told CBS News in summer 2019 that he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed from the beginning of the NAFTA negotiation in the 1990s. Sanders unapologetically voted against USMCA, stating that protections did not go far enough. On this matter Sanders stood alone. His one-time Democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit. Elizabeth Warren, once Sanders' fellow progressive in the race, promised to support the USMCA and bargain for a better deal if elected. The distinction was noted by some in the Rust Belt. Frank Hammer, a retired 32-year General Motors employee, participated in a panel discussion on trade with Sanders Friday in Detroit. You were the singular, sole [candidate] that said — consistent with your past positions — that you were opposed to [USMCA] and I think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers, Hammer said. And I'm so grateful. Thank you.\n\nOn the trail Biden has dismissed China's status as an economic powerhouse, pointing out basic challenges Chinese leaders face, like providing enough potable water for their people, and boasting about the U.S. dominance in the future. The idea that China is going to eat our lunch, it's bizarre, he said in Iowa in late January, suggesting that rather than viewing China as an existential threat, the U.S. could help China with some of its problems. The U.S. can compete with China and insist that they follow the rules, he proposed. Unlike the Social Security ads the Biden campaign is running in Michigan, two Biden advisers tell CBS News after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage Sanders on the intra-party trade war. At this point I'm not sure voters are looking for a vote-by-vote analysis, one Biden adviser told CBS News, They're looking for a nominee. Others agree that focusing on trade — even in Michigan — may not be as beneficial as Sanders hopes. I think it's a miscalculation from Sanders, Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. Wolfers cited a Gallup poll that shows 67% of self-described Democrats say that NAFTA has been beneficial for the United States. Wolfers said that with the Mr. Trump's election everything is a little upside down in terms of trade politics because the GOP incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any Democratic nominee is likely to make. Relatively speaking, Democrats are now the pro-trade party, Wolfers added.\n\nBiden has a strong argument to make in Michigan on manufacturing, though, since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the Obama administration's 2009 auto bailout of two of the big U.S. automakers, General Motors and Chrysler. Just like the automobile industry came back, Detroit is going to come back, Biden said in 2014. It's not only an important city but it's an iconic city. It symbolizes the manufacturing might of the United States of America. According to an invitation obtained by CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, Biden is expected to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in Michigan this week, co-hosted by Cynthia and Edsel Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nThe California primary is far from over with more than 3 million ballots still left to count, according to estimates published by the California Secretary of State. As of Monday afternoon, CBS News estimates Sanders leads with 33.9%, followed by Biden at 26.6%. Sanders so far is estimated to win 185 delegates while Biden is at 143. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says the millions of ballots that remain unprocessed are because of last minute voters – those who either put their ballots in the mail on Election Day, or who voted in person but decided to change their party registration on the spot. This also includes ballots that were damaged, had typos, or required careful examination from a human election worker. In California, it typically takes counties weeks to process and count all of the ballots. According to the Secretary of State's office, Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the state, has more than 800,000 ballots that still need to be counted. San Diego County has about 350,000 remaining ballots, roughly 200,000 remain unaccounted in Sacramento County while more than 100,000 need to be counted in San Francisco County. State law requires county elections officials to report the final results to the Secretary of State by April 3, 2020. The Secretary of State has until April 10, 2020, to certify the results of the election.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE SENATE\n\nGovernor Steve Bullock announced Monday morning he will be running for the U.S. Senate, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Democrats have had their eyes on Bullock as a potential candidate to take on Republican incumbent Steve Daines in November. Bullock has won statewide three times and won his second term as governor of Montana in 2016, the same year Donald Trump carried the state by about 20 points. A popular Democrat in a red state would give Democrats a chance at expanding the map for Senate battlegrounds in 2020. Bullock was reluctant to run for Senate at first because he wanted a more executive role, so he launched a presidential bid in May. He told CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe around the time of his announcement that his experience has always been executive, and I think that's where I could best apply my talents, and that's what I'm looking forward to. Bullock suspended his presidential campaign after seven months without gaining traction in the polls. In the interview in May, Bullock also told O'Keefe, I know that we're going to have good candidates in Montana to take on Senator Daines. However, no strong candidate emerged in the months leading up to Monday's filing deadline. The deadline to submit candidacies to the Secretary of State's office is Monday evening. Bullock plans to file with his wife and children by his side at the secretary's office in Helena.
Donald Trump Jr. used Instagram Tuesday night to endorse his father's border wall policy, saying the evidence that a wall works is because they protect people from zoo animals.\n\nYou know why you can enjoy a day at the zoo? Because walls work, Trump Jr., 41, wrote in his Instagram story.\n\nPresident Trump has proposed erecting concrete walls and steel slats to keep undocumented immigrants out of the U.S. Trump Jr.'s post came shortly after the president's Tuesday night Oval Office address, in which he declared a crisis at the southern border. Democrats said he had chosen fear.\n\nTrump Jr. has made controversial analogies on social media before, like when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles, in which some of the candies are poisoned.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- United Airlines says it's investigating after mistakenly flying a Kansas family's dog to Japan. CBS affiliate KCTV reports that Kara Swindle and her two children flew from Oregon to Kansas City, Missouri, Tuesday on a United flight. The family is in the process of moving from Oregon to Wichita, Kansas.\n\nAccording to CBS affiliate, KCTV, Kara Swindle was flying into Kansas City Tuesday night, accompanied by her two children and Irgo, the family's German shepherd. Or so they thought.\n\nUpon landing in Kansas City, the family went to a cargo facility to pick up 10-year-old Irgo, a German shepherd, but were instead given a Great Dane. Swindle, of Wichita, Kansas, learned Irgo had been put on a flight to Japan, where the Great Dane was supposed to go. The airline said the kennels were similar.\n\nI just want to know where my dog is, Swindle told KCTV. The fact that we don't have any idea is the most frustrating part. He could be in Kansas City and we have no idea because the paperwork is all messed up. They have our paperwork here saying that this is the correct dog, but we know it's not. It's just horrible.\n\nAccording to KCTV, Irgo will see a veterinarian before being put back on a flight to Kansas City. There is a chance that Irgo may need to be quarantined for up to two weeks in Japan due to traveling on an international flight. It remains unclear as to when the dog will arrive in Kansas City.\n\nIrgo will see a veterinarian before being put back on a flight to Kansas City. Kara Swindle via KCTV\n\nAt this point, all I can do is be hopeful that my dog is going to be OK and return safely, Swindle told KCTV. I don't know what else to do at this point. I can't cry anymore. I've cried too much.\n\nA spokesperson for United issued this statement to KCTV:\n\nAn error occurred during connections in Denver for two pets sent to the wrong destinations. We have notified our customers that their pets have arrived safely and will arrange to return the pets to them as soon as possible. We apologize for this mistake and are following up with the vendor kennel where they were kept overnight to understand what happened.The news of Irgo's unplanned odyssey comes as United admits a dog died after a flight attendant forced it to travel in an overhead bin on a Houston-to-New York flight.\n\nThe airline recently changed its pet policy, limiting what animals are allowed in the aircraft cabin. Small dogs inside a carrier that fit underneath the seat are typically allowed.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi is expected to be elected Thursday as speaker of the House of Representatives for the second time, cementing her legacy as one of the most effective female legislators in American history. In her prepared floor speech upon accepting the speaker's gavel Thursday, Pelosi will outline Democratic policy priorities, including addressing income inequality and climate change. She's also anticipating a new dawn in the House after her party's net 40-seat gain.\n\nWhen our new members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed, and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class, she will say in her speech, according to prepared remarks. As speaker, she'll preside over the swearing in of new members of Congress.\n\nPelosi will say Democrats must be pioneers of the future and accelerate a future that advances America's preeminence in the world by improving public education and workforce development. She also sounds a warning on climate change, calling it a crisis manifested in natural disasters of epic proportions.\n\nThis is a public health decision for clean air and clean water; an economic decision for America's global preeminence in green technology; a security decision to keep us safe; and a moral decision to be good stewards of God's creation, Pelosi will say about the need for Congress to combat climate change.\n\nHowever, before Pelosi can achieve any of these goals, the partial government shutdown must end. President Trump is refusing to sign any legislation which does not include funding for a border wall, which Democrats in the House and Senate are unwilling to provide.\n\nWe will debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from – and in that spirit, Democrats will be offering the Senate Republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today – to meet the needs of the American people, and to protect our borders, Pelosi will say about the Democrats' immediate agenda.\n\nShe'll also refer to the For the People agenda, which Democrats campaigned on nationally, a package including bills on infrastructure, ethics reform, lowering health care costs and protecting those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nNancy Cordes contributed to this report.
Stock markets soared Friday as investors welcomed news of trade talks between the U.S. and China next week and the U.S. government reported a big increase in hiring in December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed, rising more than 700 points.\n\nThe Labor Department said U.S. employers added 312,000 jobs last month, a far stronger result than experts had anticipated. U.S. stocks have tumbled over the last three months as investors worried that the economy might slow down dramatically because of a variety of challenges including the trade dispute and rising interest rates. Some analysts said investors were acting as if a recession was on the horizon, despite a lack of evidence that the U.S. economy is struggling.\n\nIt's hard to square recession worries with the strongest job growth we've seen in years, said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell. The strong December jobs report is a net positive for stocks because investors' biggest concern has been slowing growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 index gained 84 points, or 3.4 percent, to 2,534. The Dow surged by 746 points, or 3.3 percent, to 23,432. The Nasdaq composite jumped 275 points, or 4.3 percent, to 6,739.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said talks will be held Monday and Tuesday in Beijing, and market watchers are hoping for signs the world's largest economic powers will make progress toward resolving their dispute. Trade tensions between the two have dragged on for nearly a year and uncertainty over their outcome has dragged down stock indexes around the world.\n\nThe U.S. and China have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's goods in a fight over issues including Beijing's technology policy, which Washington alleges is predatory. Last month, President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to 90-day ceasefire as a step toward defusing tensions.\n\nTechnology companies, banks, health care and industrial companies all made strong gains. Microsoft rose 4.7 percent to $101.93 and Deere gained 5.3 percent to $151.68. Retailers and internet companies rose as well, with Amazon up 5 percent at $1,575, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, rising 5.4 percent to $1,071. Most of the companies in those industries stand to do better in times of faster economic growth.\n\nStocks in the U.S. were on track to regain most of Thursday's losses. The S&P 500 fell 2.5 percent after Apple said iPhone sales in China are falling and a survey suggested U.S. factories grew at a weaker pace. Technology companies took their biggest losses in seven years.\n\nBond prices also changed course and moved sharply lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.65 percent after it plunged to 2.55 percent Thursday, its lowest in almost a year. That helps banks, as higher interest rates allow them to make bigger profits on mortgages and other loans.
London — In the final days of the Trump administration, the U.S. State Department announced that it will designate an Iranian-backed group in Yemen a foreign terrorist organization. Ansar Allah — better known around the world simply as the Houthis, controls a vast swathe of war-torn Yemen, and the United Nations warns the terrorist label could worsen the conflict. Humanitarian groups that provide aid to around 80% of the country's population say it will have dire consequences for their operations.\n\nFor five years the Houthis have fought in a brutal civil war against Yemen's internationally recognized, Saudi Arabian-backed government. The Houthis control territory where about 80% of Yemenis live, including the country's capital Saana and the major port of al-Hudaydah.\n\nThe designations are intended to hold Ansarallah accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a Monday statement. He said the measures would take effect on January 19 — the day before President-Elect Joe Biden is sworn into office.\n\nPompeo acknowledged in the statement concerns that these designations will have an impact on the humanitarian situation in Yemen, and said the U.S. would put in place measures to reduce their impact on certain humanitarian activity and imports. He said the administration was also ready to work with the U.N. and aid groups to address these implications.\n\nThe designations are also intended to advance efforts to achieve a peaceful, sovereign, and united Yemen that is both free from Iranian interference and at peace with its neighbors, the statement continued.\n\nUnited Nations spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said, however, that the new designation could aggravate the conflict, while impeding vital humanitarian operations and deepening Yemen's economic collapse.\n\nA worst-case scenario\n\nYemen brings in almost all its food via commercial imports. We are concerned that the designation will negatively impact — including through possible 'over compliance' by commercial actors — imports of food and other essential commodities just as more Yemenis are starving, Dujarric said. The humanitarian operation – the largest in the world — cannot replace the private sector or compensate for major drops in commercial imports of food and other essential goods.\n\nWe are also concerned that the designations may have a detrimental impact on efforts to resume the political process in Yemen, as well as polarize even more the positions of the parties to the conflict, he added.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Programme, which provides more food aid than any other organization to Yemen, acknowledged the U.S. government's commitment to work with the U.N. on the delivery of humanitarian assistance, but said it hoped to get more clarity soon on what accommodations would be made.\n\nWorkers carry food aid distributed by the World Food Program at a warehouse in Sanaa, Yemen, April 21, 2020. WFP/Mohammed Awadh\n\nRight now, this looks like a worst-case scenario for Yemen, Annabel Symington, WFP spokesperson for Yemen, told CBS News. Life has just gotten harder for millions, with over 24 million people in Yemen already in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe humanitarian response does not operate in a vacuum. We work with banks, commercial traders and transporters, who in turn have links to global insurers and so on. We urge that the special measures mentioned by the U.S. government to maintain the flow of humanitarian aid to Yemen take this into consideration, she continued.\n\nOther humanitarian groups that provide aid in Yemen took a harder line on the new designation.\n\nPure diplomatic vandalism. The U.S. government's action today is likely to tip the scale in Yemen towards economic meltdown, famine, and death. https://t.co/MWLofZYNWK — David Miliband (@DMiliband) January 12, 2021\n\nThis is pure diplomatic vandalism, David Miliband, CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement. After four years of a failed war strategy that has created the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe, the last thing the Yemeni people need is further interruption of aid and economic flows.\n\nThe further immiseration of Yemenis, which will be the product of this policy, is a disgrace to the name of the U.S., and will have the perverse result of strengthening precisely the forces it claims to oppose, added Miliband, who previously served as the U.K. Foreign Secretary.\n\nThe move was also the cause of serious consternation for some U.S. lawmakers this week. One U.S. Congressional aide described a Monday conference call between State Department officials and congressional staffers on the pending designation of the Houthis — along with a State Sponsor of Terrorism re-designation for Cuba — as an acrimonious disaster.\n\nThe aide told CBS News that a representative for the U.S. federal government's own Agency for International Development (USAID) had said on the call that the designation would cost lives. The aide said there was no consultation with U.S. lawmakers on the major policy change, which they said showed a completely disregard for the catastrophic loss of life it would cause.\n\nCBS News' Christina Ruffini at the State Department and Pamela Falk at the United Nations contributed to this report.
The following is a transcript of an interview with Former Secretary of State John Kerry that aired Sunday, January 12, 2020, on Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Dubuque, Iowa and the presidential campaign trail where former Secretary of State John Kerry is on a campaign bus trip with former Vice President Joe Biden and you can hear that bus generator going in the background. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.\n\nFORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY: Sorry about that. Good morning, MARGARET. Good to be with you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up kind of where we just left off with the two senators. You know, you've been touting Joe Biden's foreign policy experience as a reason voters should consider voting for him. Bernie Sanders, his opponent, has- has taken that on as a reason essentially not to specifically focusing in on Biden's vote to help authorize the war in Iraq. He called it appalling that after 18 years, Joe Biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong in the Iraq war, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history. Given what you know about the region and how Iran was essentially empowered by that, why- why doesn't he just call it a mistake?\n\nKERRY: Well, I think I in fact, MARGARET, I think that Bernie, regrettably, is distorting Joe's record in the following sense. I mean, he doesn't have what Joe Biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the National Security Council and demonstrating his judgment, whether it was on his leadership, dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of Iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort. I think that- that I know very well what Joe's position was, because I answered those questions back in 2002, 2000- 2003 and four. And it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy, that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. And ultimately we learned, as Joe did and I did, that the intelligence was distorted. So Joe spoke out and criticized. Joe was against what they were doing. The vote was not a vote specifically to go to war. It was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting Saddam Hussein back to the negotiating table, back to the inspections, excuse me. And I think we were let down and Joe has said many times that it was a mistake. Obviously, you trust the words of the administration who didn't follow through on what they said they were going to do. And I invite you to go back, read my speech on the floor and others--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nKERRY: --where I said this is not a vote specifically to let the president go to war. So I think Bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there. I understand that, but I think the vice president has unparalleled demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president. And he, in my judgment, is the one person running for president--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nKERRY: --who the moment he takes office, has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions, including the credibility of the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nKERRY: Joe has told the truth. People know that. And I think they will trust in his capacity to lead the country at a very, very delicate time--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\n\nKERRY: --when foreign policy experience--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It is--\n\nKERRY: --is, in fact, a premium.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It is. And Iran, an issue you know well, is front and center right now. But virtually every single Democrat running for office right now is claiming the same or virtually the same Iran policy, which is to try to revive the deal that you negotiated. There's- some would say a shell of it left now. Shouldn't voters expect more out of a Iran strategy from someone trying to be commander in chief?\n\nKERRY: Well, Joe Biden is, in fact, providing more, which is to recognize that- that it's not enough just to go back to where we were because obviously circumstances have changed and things have evolved in the last three and a half years. And- and what- what Vice President Biden knows we have to do is make sure now that all the things that we were going to do in the follow on agreement, which was always contemplated. MARGARET, you were there. You're an expert at this. You know exactly what the truth is about it. We were trying to take the nuclear weapon off the table first and then negotiate Yemen, Hezbollah, threats against Israel, the regional question of trafficking of arms. And- and so Vice President Biden understands that now has to also be front and center --\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nKERRY: --as you- as you revive the agreement. But the truth is, France, Germany,--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nKERRY: --Britain, China, Russia are all still trying to keep the agreement in place because they recognize it's the strongest, most transparent, most accountable nuclear agreement on the planet, --\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well --\n\nKERRY: -- and it did take a nuclear weapon off the table until President Trump decided unilaterally to ignore all of our allies and move to get out of the agreement.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president--\n\nKERRY: And everything--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president's going on the--\n\nKERRY: --that's happened in the last days--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --going on the attack on that deal this morning, specifically mentioning you. Perhaps not a surprise. But, you know, I- I know the deal you negotiated lifted sanctions, gave some relief in exchange for capping the nuclear program. There was also a parallel negotiation that released some cash as part of a settlement of a different, separate dispute. The president this week put blame on the administration, your- the administration you served on with essentially helping to provide money to the IRGC. I want to play a sound bite of what you said in 2016 to CNBC when you were asked about how Iran would spend the money.\n\n(BEGIN CLIP)\n\nKERRY: I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorist. You know, to some degree I'm- I'm not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented. But I can tell you this, right now, we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. I'm sure at some point some of it will.\n\n(END CLIP)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I remember talking to you at the time. Money is fungible.\n\nKERRY: Sure.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why, though, did you think--\n\nKERRY: Absolutely. Money is fungible.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that that was a risk worth taking if you knew the possibility of what would happen with that money?\n\nKERRY: Well, what I was really saying, I think, first of all, MARGARET, you are an expert at this. You were there. You know that the president's tweet is a lie. And the president tweeted this morning, because I am coming on the show and he knew you'd ask me the question or he'd push you in a place where you did ask the question. You and the media, I think, need to call a lie a lie. You know--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I asked you that question in 2015 too.\n\nKERRY: --they didn't get 150 billion dollars. No- no- no. But let me just finish. You know- yes. And I'll- I'll answer that. I was saying clearly some money from the budget of Iran is going to go to the IRGC. It always has. That's no surprise. But the truth is and President Trump- I- I- well, he probably doesn't know this, but the fact is his own defense intelligence agency in 2017 testified to the Congress that very, very little money actually went to the IRGC at all. Most of the money went to the economy of Iran, which is precisely what I said and what we all said. So, the IRGC has never had a problem getting money. MARGARET, but the fact is Donald Trump keeps saying they got 150 billion dollars. A lie. He keeps saying that all of that money went to pay for it. It did not. His own defense intelligence agency says most of the money went for the economy of the country. So, you know, we have to stop dealing with questions on Donald Trump's lies and start dealing with the reality of what is going on. The fact is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nKERRY: --that mo- the vast proportion of that money--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nKERRY: --went to the economy of Iran and they're always going to be funding the IRGC. There was no question about that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nKERRY: And the IRGC budget has not gone up markedly as a result--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\n\nKERRY: --of what happened with the agreement, period.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us. I want to take a break because we have a report from Iran.
DALLAS — Without the shocking video, it's unlikely that the world would have learned or cared about the violent manhandling of 69-year-old David Dao on a United Airlines flight last month.\n\nThe outrage on social media, the mea culpa by an airline CEO, the promise to treat customers better - none of it would have happened.\n\nThe passengers who shot those videos on a United Express plane in Chicago violated United's policy on photography. By the letter of the airline's law, they too could have been ordered off the plane.\n\nUnder United's policy, customers can take pictures or videos with small cameras or cellphones provided that the purpose is capturing personal events. Filming or photographing other customers or airline employees without their consent is prohibited. American, Delta and Southwest have similar policies.\n\nPassengers are accustomed to using their cellphones to take photos and videos that they can upload to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Airline rules on photography are sporadically enforced, but passengers should read them in the in-flight magazines because there can be consequences.\n\nThis month, a United ticket agent ordered a passenger's reservation canceled as he filmed her while disputing a $300 baggage fee in the New Orleans airport. After Navang Oza posted his video online, United apologized, saying that the video does not reflect the positive customer experience we strive to offer.\n\nIn April, a JetBlue Airways crew called airport police to meet a man who they said continued to record a selfie video during a security-sensitive time in flight, while the cockpit door was opened. Michael Nissensohn insists that he wasn't recording the procedure.\n\nI told them there is no rule against talking a selfie on a plane, Nissensohn says. He says he was ordered off the plane and held up at LaGuardia airport in New York for more than an hour before being let go without charges. JetBlue declined to comment on the incident. A spokesman says the airline doesn't publish its photography policy for security reasons.\n\nWith airline customer service in decline, videotaping is the only way that passengers can make sure they are treated fairly, says Gary Leff, a travel blogger who has criticized the airlines over the issue.\n\nThe TSA allows more photography at the checkpoint than the airlines allow on board their planes, he says.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration says that photography at checkpoints is fine if people don't take images of monitors or interfere with screeners. Travel bloggers say, however, that people have had run-ins with TSA officers, and you should expect to be questioned if you snap more than a casual photo of a companion.\n\nLawyers who specialize in First Amendment or travel law say airlines generally cannot limit photography or video recording in an airport because it is a public space. But airlines have more power on planes because as private parties they are not bound by the First Amendment.\n\nThey are within their rights to establish these rules, they are within their rights to throw you off the aircraft if you continue filming, says Joseph Larsen, a media-law attorney in Houston.\n\nHowever, there is no law against taking photos or video on an airplane, and it is unlikely that anyone would face legal jeopardy for taking pictures of an altercation on a plane or their own peaceful dispute with an airline employee, Larsen says.\n\nIf you see something going on that is a matter of legitimate public interest, he says, go ahead and capture it even if you don't have express permission to film another passenger. The man who was roughed up by airport officers on the United Express plane, David Dao, has already got his settlement with United, Larsen says. He is probably pretty happy that was documented.\n\nIndeed, Dao's attorney, Thomas Demetrio, said, Dr. Dao has become the unintended champion for the adoption of changes which will certainly help improve the lives of literally millions of travelers, CBS Chicago reported.\n\nDocumenting perceived injustices has become a powerful way for passengers, particularly economy class passengers, to push back against major airlines. It's a frustrating moment for economy-class travelers, who increasingly face airline fees for everything from cabin blankets to checked baggage to carry-on bags. In 2016, passenger airlines collected a total of $4.2 billion in baggage fees and $2.9 billion in reservation change fees, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nLong security lines exacerbate the problem, particularly for passengers who don't have access to expedited screening.\n\nAfter a recent video of a confrontation over a stroller between an American Airlines flight attendant and a mother with two young children, the airline grounded the employee. The person who shot the video violated American's policy, which prohibits unauthorized photography or video recording of employees or other passengers.\n\nPrivately, airline officials say it is unlikely they would take action in such cases. American is reviewing its policy because of the difficulty of enforcing it.\n\nEven if the law is on the side of the passenger with a camera, there are practical considerations.\n\nUnless it's a legitimate safety issue like annoying other people, I don't see a problem with taking photos on a plane. But that's a call of the captain, and in the first instance the captain is right, says Thomas Dickerson, a retired New York state judge and author of Travel Law.\n\nPassengers can challenge the captain's judgment in court, and might win, Dickerson says, but the problem for consumers is, do you really want to get thrown off the plane?
The following is a transcript of the interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that aired Sunday, Jan. 13, 2019, on Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now from Abu Dhabi one of nine countries he's visiting in an eight day trip through the Middle East is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Welcome to Face the Nation.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: It's great to be with you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, we are in the middle of this shutdown, and I know a number of State Department employees are not getting paid including a quarter of U.S. employees in foreign countries. You've been going to U.S. embassies. What are you telling staff about when they can expect a paycheck?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Look it- it's unfortunate that we're in the shutdown, I wish we weren't, too. I hope that it's resolved quickly and I've certainly told our- our teams that. But you have to know these great Americans who are working in our embassies around the world. They understand the mission. They understand its importance. They understand that whether the government is open or closed they have a task to do and they are hard at it. They have- they have all uniformly been very engaged and continue to be so. It's been a great trip in that respect.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How has this been impacting morale? I mean how are you telling people to explain to their foreign counterparts why the U.S. government shut itself down?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Yeah, Margaret, our foreign counterparts have lots of things on their agenda to talk with us about. The topic of the government being shut down in the United States hasn't risen to the top of the pile in any of the visits that I've had.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well I do want to ask you since we are so focused on what's happening with this shutdown here at home, the State Department when it comes to the border issues has issued a report in 2017 about counterterrorism and it says that there is no credible evidence that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States. It adds the southern border is vulnerable, but terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the United States. How does this match with the claim that there is a border security crisis?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Margaret, make- make no mistake about it Margaret, keeping our southern border secure is an important national security component, it's- it's critical that we do that well. There's a real risk to the United States of America. We need to take this seriously. We need to secure our southern border. We need to make sure that those who want to do us harm don't have a way to access us in that way. There are many things we have to do. One of the reasons I'm in the Middle East is to work on prevailing against terror. There are lots of elements of this but border security is a certain and certainly an important component.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So is the State Department report wrong to say that this is not how terrorists are trying to enter the United States?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Margaret, terrorists try to get into our country lots of ways. One of the ways they can come in is across our southern border. What you saw was an unclassified report. Make no mistake about it, terrorists will always find the weakest link. And we need to make sure that the weakest link in our national security isn't on our southern border.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to your trip through the Middle East, but I first want to ask you about this New York Times report that says right after President Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey the FBI began investigating whether President Trump himself was a potential threat to national security and whether he'd been working for Russia or unintentionally influenced by Moscow. What is your reaction to this?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: I'm not going to comment on New York Times stories, but I'll certainly say this: the- the notion that President Trump is a threat to American national security is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Just to clarify since you were CIA director did you have any idea that this investigation was happening?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Margaret- Margaret- Margaret. I've answered this question repeatedly indeed on your show. The- the idea that's contained in the New York Times story that President Trump was a threat to American national security is- is silly on its face and not worthy of a response.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the reasons you're in the Middle East is to reassure and explain to some of our allies what the U.S. policy in Syria is. So I'd like you to do that for us today because the Pentagon announced yesterday that it actually has begun its withdrawal from Syria. Yet the U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said that wouldn't happen until two things. One, the U.S. defeated ISIS and two, Turkey assured us it wouldn't go after our Kurdish allies. Have those two conditions been met?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Margaret the president's guidance is incredibly clear. The roughly two thousand uniformed soldiers that are in Syria today are going to be withdrawn that- that activity is underway. We're going to do so in an orderly and deliberate way. A way that protects America's national security. A way that allows us to continue the important mission that they were on - the counterterrorism mission. The effort to make sure that with the destruction of ISIS is not only complete but that their resurgence is not possible. Our efforts to counter the threat from terrorism stemming from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Those are all real missions. The tactical change we've made and the withdrawal of those two thousand troops is just that - a tactical change. Mission remains the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So has Turkey's president promised you not to attack our Kurdish allies?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Yeah, look when President Erdogan and President Trump spoke, they talked about this issue. The Turks have made clear that they understand that there are folks down in Syria that have their rights. We also want to make sure that those in Syria aren't attacking- terrorists aren't attacking Turkey from Syria. We're fully engaged. Ambassador Jeffrey is fully engaged in conversations with the Turks as well as with the SDF in Syria to make sure that we accomplish all of those missions. We can- we can do each of those things, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The SDF among some of the fighters that we were talking about Kurdish allies there. Just to explain for our audience.\n\nSEC. POMPEO: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you here though because you know as a diplomat the threat of credible use of military force is what gives you power at the negotiating table. How does taking out U.S. troops from Syria get you any closer to expelling Iran?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Margaret, the United States of America can project military power from lots of places in the world. The absence of a couple thousand soldiers on the ground in Syria in no way materially diminishes the capacity of the United States of America and our amazing armed forces to deliver American power to accomplish our objectives anywhere in the world. That certainly includes in Syria. It certainly includes into Iran if need be. We still have those tools. America's diplomats still have that leverage and that power standing behind them. I'm very confident in our military capabilities here in the Middle East.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So by that, are you saying that having U.S. troops in nearby Iraq will fill any kind of vacuum left by pulling out of Syria?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Margaret, we have lots of tools in the arsenal. I was out visiting some amazing warriors out at NAVCENT yesterday in Bahrain. We have an enormous amount of American military capacity. Our- our ability to achieve what we need to do militarily is there. My task as America's Secretary of State is to make sure that we don't have to use that tool. That we get the diplomatic outcomes to secure the Middle East and keep it stable and protect the American people as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to Iran, the Trump Administration has taken some, you know, confrontational tactics here, pulling out of the nuclear accord saying that Iranian threats would be matched here. But we saw this week another American - a Navy vet - Michael White has been behind Iranian bars since July. So the Trump administration is not stopping Iran from taking Americans hostage. What is happening with this American?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: This administration is proud of the work that we've done to get Americans released all across the world. With respect to that Michael White case in particular, I can't say much. It's an ongoing consular matter. But the American people should know we take the security of every American, wherever they are traveling in the world as one of our foremost priorities. We will continue to work to get each of them back. And your point- your point about the Islamic Republic of Iran is spot on. It's why the JCOPA was such a horrible idea. Many Americans are being held there today that were taken by the Iranian regime. These are a group of people who are among the worst terrorists in the world and who have the least respect for human rights in the world. And it's why this administration has taken the very hard line you just described against Iran.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is the Trump administration open to a prisoner swap with Iran?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: I'm not going to talk about something like that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well I ask you because Michael White's mother spoke to CBS and she said she would like the administration to negotiate for her son. She said, What is a human life worth? I would like the U.S. to negotiate. I want him home. What can you tell her you're doing to bring her son home?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: I have great sympathy for the families of those Americans who are wrongfully detained all across the world. And we do everything we can every day to get their return. We use our diplomatic tools in every corner of the world, to reach out to these places to get these young men and women home. We're intent to do that in Iran. We're intent to do that all across the world. We- we take this- this obligation as a solemn one. And this administration's had quite a few successes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So--\n\nSEC. POMPEO: I hope we have more.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Potentially open to negotiations then?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: We're using every tool that we have in our arsenal to get these Americans back home, wherever we find them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Bolton said the next summit with Kim Jong-un would be in January or February. We're in that window. When will we see President Trump sit down with the North Korean leader?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: We're working out the details Margaret, you'll be among the first to know.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know, sir, you're at the end of this trip, you will be headed to Saudi Arabia. It has been about 100 days since Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered there. Will you raise this issue with Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Of course.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Then what will you say?\n\nSEC. POMPEO: I'll say what- Margaret I'll say what we have said consistently. America's position both privately and publicly is the same. This was an outrageous act, an unacceptable murder. Those who were responsible will be held accountable by the United States of America. We're determined to do that. We're determined to get at the facts just as quickly and as comprehensively as we can. We've had a policy that's been remarkably consistent with respect to this. We- we- we, we like the rest of the world, value human rights all across the globe. And the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was outrageous and we'll hold those responsible accountable. And then we'll talk about all the important things we do with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and all the support they provide to keep Americans in Kansas and Colorado and California and in Washington, D.C. safe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your time. Safe travels.\n\nSEC. POMPEO: Margaret, thank you very much. You have a great day
On Thursday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned in response to the riot at the Capitol earlier in the week. In her resignation letter to President Trump, DeVos said that there is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me. Lesley Stahl interviewed Secretary DeVos a year into her tenure. The following is the transcript from Secretary of Education, which originally aired March 11, 2018.\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos is a devout Christian grandmother from Michigan -- who has spent most of her life trying to improve the quality of education for poor kids. So how in the world did she become one of the most hated members of the Trump Cabinet?\n\nShe is dedicated to promoting school choice but her critics say she really wants to privatize the public school system that she once called, quote, a dead end.\n\nNow, after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, her portfolio is expanding. Monday, President Trump is expected to appoint her as head of a new commission on school safety charged with developing policies to prevent school violence.\n\nDo something unexpected: answer our questions. You came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions for the 90 minutes you were actually here. How about you actually do your job? #neveragain #DoYourJob https://t.co/4Ts0INq0gR — Aly Sheehy🦅 (@Aly_Sheehy) March 7, 2018\n\nBetsy DeVos visited the school in Florida on Wednesday, but like almost everywhere else she goes, she faced criticism. Some of the students sent out angry tweets: You came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions. Betsy DeVos came to my school, talked to three people, and pet a dog. Many of the students are frustrated at the administration for talking about school safety, but not acting.\n\nBetsy Devos came to my school, talked to three people, and pet a dog. This is incase the press tries to say something else later — Alanna//#NEVERAGAIN (@AgCI3Cu2) March 7, 2018\n\nBetsy DeVos: I give a lot of credit to the students there for really raising their voices, and I think that they are not going to let this moment go by.\n\nLesley Stahl: They want gun control.\n\nBetsy DeVos: They want a variety of things. They want solutions.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think that teachers should have guns in the classroom?\n\nBetsy DeVos: That should be an option for states and communities to consider. And I hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, I couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way. But for those who are-- who are capable, this is one solution that can and should be considered. But no one size fits all. Every state and every community is going to address this issue in a different way.\n\nSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos speaks with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl CBS News\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you see yourself as a leader in this-- in this subject? And what kind of ideas will you be promoting?\n\nBetsy DeVos: I have actually asked to head up a task force that will really look at what states are doing. See there are a lot of states that are addressing these issues in very cohesive and coherent ways.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you feel a sense of urgency?\n\nBetsy DeVos: Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: 'Cause this sounds like talking. Instead of acting.\n\nBetsy DeVos: No, there is a sense of urgency indeed.\n\nI hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, I couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way.\n\nThe reason Betsy DeVos wanted to be secretary of education was so she could promote school choice, offering parents options other than traditional public schools – where 90 percent of kids go. She has proposed massive cuts in public education funding and wants to shift billions to alternative players like private, parochial and charter schools.\n\nBetsy DeVos: We have invested billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal level And we have seen zero results.\n\nLesley Stahl: But that really isn't true. Test scores have gone up over the last 25 years. So why do you keep saying nothing's been accomplished?\n\nBetsy DeVos: Well actually, test scores vis-à-vis the rest of the world have not gone up. And we have continued to be middle of the pack at best. That's just not acceptable.\n\nLesley Stahl: No it's not acceptable. But it's better than it was. That's the point. You don't acknowledge that things have gotten better. You won't acknowledge that, over the--\n\nBetsy DeVos: But I don't think they have for too many kids. We've stagnated\n\nLesley Stahl: Okay, so there's the big argument. So what can be done about that?\n\nBetsy DeVos: What can be done about that is empowering parents to make the choices for their kids. Any family that has the economic means and the power to make choices is doing so for their children. Families that don't have the power, that can't decide: I'm gonna move from this apartment in downtown whatever to the suburb where I think the school is gonna be better for my child if they don't have that choice – and they are assigned to that school, they are stuck there. I am fighting for the parents who don't have those choices. We need all parents to have those choices.\n\nWe should be funding and investing in students, not in school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems.\n\nQuestion is: does her solution work? Do choice schools perform better than public schools? Naturally -- there are conflicting studies. It's complicated.\n\nBut DeVos spends a lot of time showcasing choice schools like Cold Spring Elementary, a public school in Indianapolis – that was allowed to get rid of the local teachers' union and create an innovative curriculum.\n\nBut when parents choose these options, taxpayer funds follow the child and that means that the public school left behind can end up with less money.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why take away money from that school that's not working, to bring them up to a level where they are-- that school is working?\n\nBetsy DeVos: Well, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school-- school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems.\n\nLesley Stahl: Okay. But what about the kids who are back at the school that's not working? What about those kids?\n\nBetsy DeVos: Well, in places where there have been-- where there is-- a lot of choice that's been introduced-- Florida, for example, the-- studies show that when there's a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually-- the results get better, as well.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos works with students at Cold Spring School in Indianapolis CBS News\n\nLesley Stahl: Now, has that happened in Michigan? We're in Michigan. This is your home state.\n\nBetsy DeVos: Michi--Yes, well, there's lots of great options and choices for students here.\n\nLesley Stahl: Have the public schools in Michigan gotten better?\n\nBetsy DeVos: I don't know. Overall, I-- I can't say overall that they have all gotten better.\n\nLesley Stahl: The whole state is not doing well.\n\nBetsy DeVos: Well, there are certainly lots of pockets where this-- the students are doing well and--\n\nLesley Stahl: No, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better, is not working in Michigan where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here.\n\nBetsy DeVos: I hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them.\n\nLesley Stahl: The public schools here are doing worse than they did.\n\nBetsy DeVos: Michigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it.\n\nLesley Stahl: Have you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they're doing?\n\nBetsy DeVos: I have not-- I have not-- I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\n\nLesley Stahl: Maybe you should.\n\nBetsy DeVos: Maybe I should. Yes.\n\nDeVos is the only Cabinet secretary protected by a squad of U.S. Marshals because she's gotten death threats. She's frequently met by protesters who accuse her of pushing an elitist agenda.\n\nShe often manages to offend, as when she called historically black colleges and universities pioneers of school choice – as though they had a choice.\n\nAt this commencement speech at Bethune-Cookman University, students booed and turned their backs to her.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why have you become, people say, the most hated Cabinet secretary?\n\nBetsy DeVos: I'm not so sure exactly how that happened. But I think there are a lot of really powerful forces allied against change.\n\nLesley Stahl: Does it hurt?\n\nBetsy DeVos: Sometimes it does. Sometimes it does. Again, I think-- I think--\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you ever say--\n\nBetsy DeVos: --I'm more misunderstood than anything.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos CBS News\n\nSome of the criticism, she feels, is unfair, especially when it involves her wealth. She faced a hostile question about it during a speech at Harvard last year.\n\nHarvard Question: So you're a billionaire with lots and lots of investments. And the so-called school choice movement is a way to open the floodgates for corporate interests to make money off the backs of students. How much do you expect your net worth to increase as a result of your policy choices?\n\nModerator: You can choose not to answer that secretary.\n\nAmong President Trump's cabinet of moguls and titans, DeVos is the richest: she grew up wealthy and married even wealthier. In their hometown of Grand Rapids, the DeVoses have been exceedingly charitable, their name decorates buildings like the civic center and children's hospital.\n\nAt her bruising confirmation hearing, she was grilled about her wealth and lack of experience. She's been an advocate, not an educator.\n\nLesley Stahl: What happened there?\n\nBetsy DeVos: I've not had a root canal, but I can imagine that a root canal might be more pleasant than that was.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you've been on the job now over a year. What have you done that you're most proud of?\n\nBetsy DeVos: Yeah. We've begun looking at and rolling back a lot of the overreach of the federal government in education.\n\nBy overreach she means regulations. And like most of President Trump's cabinet, DeVos is a devoted de-regulator. Part of her job as Secretary of Education is overseeing guidelines that protect the civil rights of students.\n\nJust days after being confirmed, she rescinded a guideline implemented under President Obama that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice – sparking even more protests.\n\nShe is now considering scrapping the Obama-era guidance on how to identify, avoid and remedy discriminatory discipline, which aims to prevent schools from punishing students of color more harshly than their white classmates.\n\nBetsy DeVos: We are studying that rule. We need to ensure that all students have an opportunity to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. And all students means all students.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah but let's say there's a disruption in the classroom and a bunch of whites kids are disruptive and they get punished, you know, go see the principal, but the black kids are, you know, they call in the cops. I mean, that's the issue: who and how the kids who disrupt are being punished.\n\nBetsy DeVos: Arguably, all of these issues or all of this issue comes down to individual kids. And--\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, no. That-- it's not.\n\nBetsy DeVos: --it does come down to individual kids. And--often comes down to-- I am committed to making sure that students have the opportunity to learn in an environment that is conducive to their learning.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you see this disproportion in discipline for the same infraction as institutional racism?\n\nBetsy DeVos: We're studying it carefully. And are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments.\n\nWhile this regulation is under review, she has already drawn fire for changing Title IX guidelines on handling sexual assault on college campuses. She's allowing colleges to require stronger evidence from accusers, and give the accused a greater benefit of the doubt.\n\nLesley Stahl: Are you in any way, do you think, suggesting that the number of false accusations are as high as the number of actual rapes or assaults?\n\nBetsy DeVos: Well, one sexual assault is one too many, and one falsely accused individual is one too many.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, but are they the same?\n\nBetsy DeVos: I don't know. I don't know. But I'm committed to a process that's fair for everyone involved.\n\nLesley Stahl: The Me-Too Movement has come along at the same time. This is all feeding into it. We're not talking about colleges anymore. We're talking about men in positions of power in industry and government. Have you ever had an issue?\n\nBetsy DeVos: I can recall a number of moments in the past-- several decades ago that I think today would just be viewed as unacceptable. Yeah.\n\nIt's been an unlikely journey and balancing act for grandmother Betsy DeVos, from her sheltered life in Michigan – to her life now as a lightning rod in Washington.\n\nProduced by Shachar Bar-On.

As you take a closer look at your financial footing amid the headwinds of a pandemic, it's an excellent time to examine the possible impact of a Joe Biden presidency on money matters.\n\nThe balance of Congress has shifted following the Georgia runoffs, providing possible momentum for President Biden's agenda. A new COVID-19 stimulus check, taxes, health care — it's all on the line. Here's how it may impact your wallet.\n\nAnother round of stimulus checks\n\nLook for a third round of pandemic relief shortly after Biden's inauguration, said Bernard Yaros Jr., an economist with Moody's Analytics. Analysts expect the new administration to roll out direct payments of $1,400 to millions of Americans.\n\nIn February, we expect that there's going to be a COVID-specific relief package, Yaros said. That measure will likely once again extend unemployment insurance benefits, with enough support for another round of checks issued to Americans, whether it's 2K or slightly lower, he said.\n\nSmall businesses are likely to receive more grants and forgivable loans, as well.\n\nAnd we're also thinking, you would probably get some additional funding for rental assistance, Yaros added.\n\nFrom relief to stimulus\n\nWith Democrats gaining two seats in the Senate from the Georgia runoffs, there is now a greater possibility of moving from relief to stimulus mode in late 2021.\n\nThat's because now that the Democrats have a simple majority in the Senate. They can pass changes to the tax code as well as implement changes in spending, Yaros said.\n\nMoody's Analytics economists expect the Biden administration will dedicate increased funding for enhancements to social safety nets, possibly including:\n\nExpanding eligibility for Medicare.\n\nRetooling Obamacare into Bidencare.\n\nRolling out paid sick leave protections.\n\nOffering universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\nProviding some kind of student debt forgiveness.\n\nBut on these initiatives, Democrats will have to pick and choose, Yaros said.\n\nAmong the more moderate Democrats, they're not going to want to increase the deficit too much. That's obviously going to be a limiting factor, he adds.\n\nAnd while Vice President Kamala Harris holds the deciding vote in the event of a Senate tie, the 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans doesn't constitute filibuster-proof power.\n\nReversing Trump tax cuts\n\nHigher taxes are expected to partially fund the widening of these social safety nets.\n\nYaros says Biden is likely to succeed in reversing Trump's tax cuts, raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, increasing the tax rate for taxable incomes of more than $400,000 and eliminating some tax breaks for those making more than $1 million.\n\nBut the tax hikes may be smaller than widely anticipated, says Michael Zezas, head of U.S. public policy research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn a Senate where Democrats have the slimmest majority possible, any one Democratic senator effectively has a veto. And when it comes to taxes, we expect many of the Biden administration's proposed taxes won't pass muster with Democratic moderates, Zezas said in an analysis.\n\nWe estimate about $500 billion of tax increases are possible, obviously a smaller number than another potential COVID stimulus round, and also smaller than the $1 trillion-plus spending now in play for each of health care and infrastructure, Zezas added.\n\nEven if Biden can swing the tax hikes, they aren't expected to kick in until 2024, Yaros said, to make sure that there's no fiscal drag, at all, on the economy in these next couple of years when we're still digging ourselves out of the pandemic.\n\nFocus on retirement savings\n\nJoe Biden also has some ideas to reshape employer-sponsored retirement plans.\n\nOne of those proposals is to equalize the tax benefit of contributing to a retirement plan so that higher-income earners aren't getting more of the benefit than the lower-income workers, that it's standard across the board, said Anne Tyler Hall, founder and principal of Hall Benefits Law.\n\nFor example, someone in a 37% tax bracket is able to deduct the full amount of a retirement plan contribution, so $37 for every $100 pre-tax contribution. That's a greater tax benefit than someone in a lower tax bracket, such as 20%, who would receive a $20 deduction for each $100 pre-tax contribution.\n\nThe idea proposed by the Biden administration is to offer a tax credit to low- and moderate-income workers, resulting in an equal tax benefit.\n\nDemocrats are also pushing for employers to make retirement saving easier for the U.S. workforce.\n\nEmployers who don't offer retirement plans would be required to allow employees to make contributions to individual retirement accounts, IRAs, Hall said. Contributions to the IRAs would come directly from paychecks.\n\nWith the shift of balance in Congress, Hall says such changes may be more likely. Plus, some of these provisions have bipartisan support, she added.
HELSINKI - Finland has become the first country in Europe to pay its unemployed citizens a basic monthly income, amounting to 560 euros ($587), in a unique social experiment which is hoped to cut government red tape, reduce poverty and boost employment.\n\nOlli Kangas from the Finnish government agency KELA, which is responsible for the country's social benefits, said Monday that the two-year trial with the 2,000 randomly picked citizens who receive unemployment benefits kicked off Jan. 1.\n\nThose chosen will receive 560 euros every month, with no reporting requirements on how they spend it. The amount will be deducted from any benefits they already receive.\n\nThe average private sector income in Finland is 3,500 euros per month, according to official data.\n\nKangas said the scheme's idea is to abolish the disincentive problem among the unemployed.\n\nThe trial aims to discourage people's fears of losing out something, he said, adding that the selected persons would continue to receive the 560 euros even after receiving a job.\n\nA jobless person may currently refuse a low-income or short-term job in the fear of having his financial benefits reduced drastically under Finland's generous but complex social security system.\n\nIt's highly interesting to see how it makes people behave, Kangas said. Will this lead them to boldly experiment with different kinds of jobs? Or, as some critics claim, make them lazier with the knowledge of getting a basic income without doing anything?\n\nThe unemployment rate of Finland, a nation of 5.5 million, stood at 8.1 percent in November with some 213,000 people without a job - unchanged from the previous year.\n\nThe scheme is part of the measures by the center-right government of Prime Minister Juha Sipila to tackle Finland's joblessness problem.\n\nKangas said the basic income experiment may be expanded later to other low-income groups such as freelancers, small-scale entrepreneurs and part-time workers.\n\nOther European countries have considered offering citizens basic income, although to date Finland is the only one to experiment with the policy. Swiss voters last year rejected a proposal that would have guaranteed that all residents receive roughly $2,560 per month to help cover their basic needs.
Brett McGurk, the former special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS who stepped down in December, said he had no choice but to resign after President Trump's sudden and unexpected order to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.\n\nIn his first television interview since resigning, McGurk said ISIS is not defeated, despite claims to the contrary by officials in the Trump administration.\n\nI've probably traveled to Syria more than any other American civilian official, he said. I know our people in Syria. My heart is broken, he added, extending condolences to the families of four Americans killed in a suicide bombing last week, the deadliest incident for U.S. forces in Syria since the civil war began.\n\nMcGurk, a longtime diplomat who was appointed special envoy by President Barack Obama in 2015, criticized Mr. Trump's decision to order the withdrawal of U.S. troops, which he cast as a total reversal of years of U.S. policy in the region.\n\nOn instructions from the White House, we were telling [U.S. partners on the ground that] we'd stay in Syria until we completed the enduring defeat of ISIS, not just the physical territory. We'd stay in Syria until the Iranians left Syria, and also until there was a irreversible political progress in Geneva to end the ultimate civil war, McGurk said. And it was the total reversal of our policy that made it — I just, I concluded I could not be effective in carrying out those new instructions.\n\nMcGurk said a sustainable plan had been in place to defeat ISIS and begin serious negotiations with parties in Syria, including Russia.\n\nThe minute you announce to the world that you're leaving, a vacuum opens up and all the other powers in the region start making different calculations, he said.\n\nStill, given Mr. Trump's announcement, he said the world has to really accept some hard truths — I think, number one, we are leaving. The president has made that clear — we are leaving.\n\nMcGurk said the top mission for troops should be to get out of the country safely.\n\nWithdrawing under pressure from a combat zone is one of the most difficult military maneuvers we can ask our people to do, he said.
Outgoing U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urged Congress to reject calls to forgive student loan debt, a promise made on the campaign trail by President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nIn what reads like a farewell letter, DeVos offered closing thoughts on her time leading the education department. DeVos, a decadeslong advocate for school choice, made her final case as education secretary for expanding federal tax dollars for families that opt for private schools and opposed student loan forgiveness and free college, calling the proposals misguided.\n\nAcross-the-board forgiveness of college debts is not only unfair to most Americans, it is also the most regressive of policy proposals – rewarding the wealthiest sector of our labor force at the expense of the poorest, DeVos wrote in the Monday letter obtained by CBS News.\n\nThe Department of Education suspended all monthly federal student loan payments in March amid the coronavirus outbreak and the economic fallout caused by the pandemic, granting all borrowers an interest-free forbearance period. In its $900 billion stimulus bill, Congress neglected to extend the program and student loan payments could resume as soon as February.\n\nIt's possible the popular forbearance program will be extended again after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20. When student loan payments do resume, the Department of Education doesn't expect a smooth transition. In its 2020 annual report, issued Tuesday, the department said it expects loan servicers and the federal government will face a heavy burden in 'converting' millions of borrowers to active repayment. Some of those borrowers, the report warns, will become delinquent.\n\nTackling student loan debt will be a major issue for the Biden administration. Mr. Biden has pledged to address the student loan crisis, including a proposal to cancel $10,000 in debt for students who work in national or community service.\n\nLast year student loan debt reached an all-time high, nearly $1.6 trillion among more than 40 million Americans, making the Department of Education the country's biggest consumer lender, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. About 1 in every 5 borrowers are in default, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nDeVos wrote that under her leadership the way in which borrowers apply and pay back loans was revolutionized thanks to a streamlining of services.\n\nWhere there was once a confusing and frustrating maze of websites, StudentAid.gov is now the single online home for information. Where there were once dozens of phone numbers, now there is a single 800 number, DeVos wrote. Understanding and repaying student loans is becoming easier than ever.\n\nDeVos did not directly acknowledge President Trump's loss or refer to Mr. Biden by name in the five-page letter, which was shared with Congressional leadership and House and Senate education committee members as well as Congressional appropriation subcommittee members.
Although tens of millions of U.S. workers stand to benefit from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, roughly as many Americans would not.\n\nThe proposed bill, which the Senate is expected to vote on this week after the House passed similar legislation last weekend, could provide billions of dollars to workers affected by the coronavirus — a key step in propping up an economy that is quickly sliding into recession.\n\nThe measure is a huge, huge first step, said Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Millions of people are going to get some paid time off that they would not have otherwise, and employers are getting a big government subsidy.\n\nShe added: People are already starting to take this leave, with or without emergency benefits.\n\nStill, unless changes are made to the bill, more than 60 million Americans would be ineligible for the two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of family and medical leave it offers for those impacted by the global pandemic. That's because larger companies, those with 500 or more employers, are exempt from the proposal's provisions.\n\nFor now, the bill's status remains fluid. House lawmakers passed a series of corrections to their bill Monday night. In the Senate, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul is reportedly threatening to delay a vote unless lawmakers include additional means of funding the benefits expansion.\n\nMy understanding is changes are being made as we speak, Sarah Jane Glynn, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. Whether that leads to substantive revisions in the bill or minor technical fixes remains to be seen, she added.\n\nWhat the House is proposing\n\nThe House's latest proposed changes to its measure stipulate that:\n\nCompanies would not be compensated for sick days they already provide workers, although they could be reimbursed for health care premiums for employees on emergency sick leave.\n\nThe right to paid-family leave would only apply to parents whose children's school or childcare facility had closed due to the coronavirus.\n\nHealth-care providers and emergency responders — along with workers who had been in quarantine or caring for a family member with the virus — would not be eligible for the additional 10 weeks of paid leave.\n\nIn the original version of the bill, all workers who received paid sick time would be eligible for another 10 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay.\n\nThere is a risk that the Senate could look to make alterations to the House bill, though we expect that the pressure to act rapidly, and the bipartisan nature of the current text, will reduce the likelihood of changes, Height Securities analysts Clayton Allen and Hunter Hammond said in a report.\n\nThe paid sick leave provision — the center of negotiations last week between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — is complicated, according to the analysts. It mandates that employers with less than 500 employees fund paid leave at varying rates for varying amounts of time, with wide variations for different circumstances, they wrote. Government tax credits would offset some of those costs.\n\nThe 500 employee cap likely leaves millions of Americans without the new benefit, Allen and Hammond wrote.\n\nStranding small businesses?\n\nAs it stands, the bill provides tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses finance the new benefit. For an employer, those credits would materialize when they pay their taxes, which companies typically do quarterly. For self-employed workers, that relief would also come when they pay their annual taxes.\n\nEither way, that presents problems, given that many employers are already taking an income hit from the virus, Glynn said. For one, the bill would not take effect for two weeks after being signed into law. For small businesses, that means they'd have to start covering workers as soon as early April — but they wouldn't see any relief until July, when filing quarterly taxes.\n\nFor small business experiencing steep declines in demand now, my fear for some is that is going to mean having to close their doors, Glynn said.\n\nAs now structured, the measure covers workers in businesses with less than 500 employees, which is roughly half of private-sector workers, or 67 million, Glynn said. If you add public sector workers into the mix, a total of 87 million are covered.\n\nOf the 61 million people working for the larger employers that are exempt from the coronavirus relief measure, 11%, or 6.7 million, have zero paid sick days, data show. Most those workers have 7 to 8 paid sick days — not enough to self-quarantine as long as health experts recommend.\n\nThere were earlier versions that would have covered more people, but after extensive lobbying from big business and what conservatives wanted, this is where we ended up, Glynn said.\n\nThe wait for the refundable tax credit is now the number one sticking point, said Romig, while adding that everybody sees we need to do this quickly.\n\nAs she put it: As the crisis spreads it's going to become more evident that this is necessary, that businesses of all sizes will need this, at some point.
NEW YORK -U.S. stocks are skidding Monday as energy stocks take big losses. Companies including Xerox and drugmaker Perrigo are down after reporting disappointing earnings and lowering their expectations for the year. Global stocks also fell.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 64 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,939 as of 1:45 p.m. ET. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost eight points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,084.

The company's costs went up as it gets ready to split into two businesses, and its revenue fell. The stock shed $1.45, or 13 percent, to $9.72.\n\nIrish drugmaker Perrigo is tumbling after cutting its profit forecast. The company said prices for over-the-counter products in Europe are down, and it may take an impairment charge for a business it bought just a year ago.\n\nPerrigo's CEO also left the company to join Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The stock lost $18.71, or 15.4 percent, to $102.64.\n\nCorporate earnings statements pick up a head of steam this week. Around a third of the S&P 500 are due to report their results. Those companies include Apple, Procter & Gamble, Amazon, Boeing and Exxon.\n\nGannett, the owner of USA Today and other papers, offered to buy Tribune Publishing for $388 million. Tribune owns 11 newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. It said Tribune has refused to start constructive talks.\n\nThe offer values Tribune Publishing at $12.25 per share, and its stock surged $4.19, or 55.7 percent, to $11.70.

The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors don't expect it to raise interest rates, but the Fed's comments about the U.S. and global economy will be closely watched.\n\nTraders will look to see whether the Japanese central bank enacts a further stimulus.\n\nThe government of Saudi Arabia said a small portion of the world's largest oil company will go public. The kingdom valued Saudi Aramco at more than $2 trillion. It's long been considered the most valuable company in the world. Apple, the most valuable publicly traded company, has a market capitalization of about $585 billion.\n\nThe planned IPO is part of a series of economic reforms that are intended to make the Saudi economy less reliant on oil.

NEW YORK -- Verizon will pay a $1.35 million fine over its use of supercookie technology that the government said followed phone customers on the Internet without their permission. Verizon will also have to get an explicit yes from customers for some kinds of tracking.\n\nThe supercookies landed their name because they were hard, or near-impossible, to block. Verizon uses them to deliver targeted ads to cellphone customers. The company wants to expand its advertising and media business and bought AOL for its digital ad technology in 2015.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said Monday that it found that Verizon began using the supercookies for consumers in December 2012, but didn't disclose the program until October 2014. Verizon waited until March 2015 to update its privacy policy to disclose the trackers and gave people an option then to opt out.\n\nConsumers care about privacy and should have a say in how their personal information is used, especially when it comes to who knows what they're doing online, FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said in a press release.\n\nThe FCC settlement says consumers now must opt in to letting Verizon share data with a third party. But for data-collection and sharing within Verizon itself, the company can choose to have customers either opt in or automatically do it and give consumers the option to stop it, a less stringent requirement.\n\nThe New York-based company has already changed some practices that critics considered most invasive. In an emailed statement, the company said that the FCC settlement recognizes that it had already made adjustments to its ad programs that give consumers more choices.\n\nNate Cardozo, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy watchdog that had been critical of the supercookies, said the settlement was an unqualified win for consumers. Today's order will mean that other companies contemplating similar involuntary tracking will think twice before proceeding without explicit consumer consent, he wrote in an email.\n\nWhy did Verizon use this controversial technology? Supercookie tracking allowed it to help advertisers offer more targeted advertising, CNET reports. But when privacy and consumer advocates started to call out against this practice, it caught the eye of the FCC. A 2015 study revealed that supercookie tracking information couldn't be erased and could be accessed by third parties, even if a user removed his or her browser history from a mobile phone browser.\n\nFor its part, Verizon said it changed its policy to ensure that customers are more informed.\n\nVerizon gives customers choices about how we use their data, Richard Young, a spokesman for Verizon, told CNET.

AUSTIN, Texas -- A man is suing a woman after he says she texted throughout the course of their date at a Texas movie theater, CBS affiliate KEYE in Austin reports.\n\nThe plaintiff, Brandon Clarke Vezmar, is seeking damages in the amount of $17.31, the cost of two movie tickets. He says the woman texted during the film and she eventually left the theater when he asked her to stop.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Vezmar says he purchased the tickets on May 6, and that the woman sent text messages on her cellphone 10 to 20 times during the first 15 minutes of the film.\n\nThe suit says texting is in direct violation of the theater's policy, adversely affecting the viewing experience of [Vezmar] and others.\n\nWhile damages sought are modest, the principle is important as Defendant's behavior is a threat to civilized society, the lawsuit reads.\n\nVezmar told the Austin-American Statesmen that the alleged texting took place during Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2.
Health officials have identified a cluster of dentists who died of a mysterious lung disease. A report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that nine dentists in Virginia were found to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, progressive lung disease of unknown cause, between the years 2000 and 2015.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, IPF causes scar tissue to build up in the lungs, which makes the lungs unable to transport oxygen into the bloodstream effectively. The condition is associated with a poor prognosis, the CDC says.\n\nOf the nine dentists in the report, seven died.\n\nOverall, the researchers found 894 patients diagnosed with IPF at a medical center in Virginia. Dentists made up just 1 percent of IPF patients documented in the study. However, researchers note that number is striking when considering the number of dentists in the United States.\n\nA cluster is defined as an aggregation of cases grouped in place and time that are suspected to be greater than the number expected, even though the expected number might not be known, Dr. Randall Nett, the lead author of the study and a medical officer with the U.S. Public Health Service, told CBS News in an email. The number of dentists treated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) at this Virginia tertiary care center was about 23 times higher than expected.\n\nThe cause of the disease is not known, but experts say work-related hazards are likely at play. Past research has linked the condition to jobs that involve exposure to dust, wood dust and metal dust. Some other suspected causes include tobacco smoke and viral infections.\n\nThis is the first study to find a possible association with dentistry and IPF.\n\nDentists and other dental personnel have unique exposures at work. These exposures include bacteria, viruses, dusts, gases, radiation, and other respiratory hazards, Randall said. At this time, we do not know what caused this cluster of IPF cases in dental personnel. However, it is possible exposures at work contributed to this cluster.\n\nHowever, he emphasized that the group identified in the study is very small and says more work has to be done before any conclusions can be drawn about the risk dentists or other dental personnel may face from the disease.\n\nDr. Paul Casamassimo, chief policy officer of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's Pediatric Oral Health & Research Center, notes that a number of dental professional organizations have taken steps to add safety of both patients and dental personnel to their program agendas. Their aim is to improve awareness and offer advice to mitigate health risks.\n\nDentists now do far less laboratory work in most instances even while training in school, Casamassimo told CBS News. The likelihood of exposure to dusts and airborne chemicals is less than in the past, but still there for many dentists, particularly if they trained long ago and haven't kept up with environmental and workplace warnings.\n\nExperts recommend dental workers wear certified respiratory masks if they are working in any environment that might result in respiratory hazards.\n\nThe report concludes that more research is needed to better understand the potential health risks of working in dental care and how that might be associated with IPF.\n\nThis cluster of IPF cases reinforces the need to understand further the unique occupational exposures of dental personnel and the association between these exposures and the risk for developing IPF so that appropriate strategies can be developed for the prevention of potentially harmful exposures, the authors write.
Children who suffer through multiple ear infections are often candidates for ear tube surgery. But a new study finds that the use of one type of ear drops — quinolones — after these surgeries may raise a child's risk for a perforated eardrum.\n\nChildren who received post-surgical quinolones were 60 percent more likely to suffer eardrum perforations than those who received another type of ear drops, called neomycin, according to researchers from the University of Florida in Gainesville.\n\nThe surgery in question is called tympanostomy. In these surgeries, small tubes are inserted into the eardrums to open up the area behind the eardrum and keep air pressure at a level equal to that of the middle ear. This helps prevent fluid buildup in the middle ear.\n\nWe have tended to use quinolone ear drops fairly liberally after tympanostomy tube surgery, study co-author Dr. Patrick Antonelli, chair of otolaryngology, said in a university news release.\n\nIn the new study, Antonelli's team tracked data on nearly 100,000 children who underwent ear tube surgery. The researchers then compared post-operative eardrum perforation rates after kids were given either quinolone or neomycin drops.\n\nThe study couldn't prove cause-and-effect. However, children who received quinolones were 60 percent more likely to suffer eardrum perforations than those who received neomycin ear drops, the findings showed. And the researchers believe that the rate of perforations might rise higher if children are given quinolones together with steroids.\n\nOur findings suggest the need for more caution with the use of quinolone ear drops, Antonelli said.\n\nThe new study builds on prior research suggesting that quinolones may come with risk, he added. Concerns have been raised about potential problems with quinolones, including harmful effects on soft tissues. Last year, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee concluded that the benefits of quinolones in certain instances might not outweigh the risks.\n\nAccording to study co-author Almut Winterstein, Evidence on quinolones' detrimental effects on soft tissues, animal studies, clinical trials and observational studies overwhelmingly point to the possibility that quinolones could contribute to the development of persistent eardrum perforations. Winterstein is chair of the university's department of pharmaceutical outcomes and policy.\n\nHowever, even though this study raises concern about quinolones, neomycin ear drops come with their own hazards, the researchers conceded. Repeat use of neomycin has been linked to hearing loss over time.\n\nSo, Antonelli said, Physicians are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Until we have other, safer antibiotic ear drops available, clinicians and parents must be cautious when using quinolones or neomycin, and understand the risks associated with both classes of drugs.\n\nTwo physicians familiar with treating childhood ear infections reviewed the new findings, and agreed the issue is a tough one.\n\nQuinolones have some advantages over the commonly used alternatives, which themselves are associated with toxic effects on the hearing nerve, said Dr. Michael Grosso. He's head of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.\n\nThese results leave ENT [ear, nose and throat] surgeons without an obvious alternative: the risks and benefits of using other antibiotics — or no antibiotic — will need to be considered, possibly on a case-by-case basis, Grosso said.\n\nAn otolaryngologist said the study did have some flaws, as well.\n\nAccording to Dr. Darius Kohan, there were many variables influencing the results — the kids in the study were largely covered by Medicaid, details on the dose and duration of therapy was unavailable, and the study only focused on one form of quinolone ear drops.\n\nStill, the Florida researchers do focus on a potential problem we should be acutely aware of, and I do agree with the conclusion that one must judiciously employ topical antibiotic therapy for ear infections and ear surgery, Kohan said. He's chief of otolaryngology at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.\n\nGrosso had one more caveat for parents.\n\nParents should be cautious about agreeing to 'ear tubes' in the first place, he said. Although they are clearly helpful to many children, parents should do their homework to be sure that their child's ear problems meet the narrow criteria set forth by experts, as many cases of ear fluid go away with 'watchful waiting' alone.\n\nThe study was published recently in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.
Stocks were spooked badly earlier this week when Federal Reserve officials made comments that sounded like rising interest rates were a sure thing. Those hawkish remarks pushed the Nasdaq 100 below its 50-day moving average (a major trend indicator) for the first time since December. Even though Wall Street rebounded on Wednesday, investors should pay attention.\n\nClearly, the Fed has made a major change in tone from the years of monetary policy dovishness that investors had become accustomed to.\n\nDespite some recent softness in the economic growth and inflation data, the Fed hiked interest rates again earlier this month. That's the third quarter-point hike since Election Day, a dramatic quickening from the prior pace of a single hike in December 2015.\n\nMoreover, officials penciled in another rate increase before the year-end as well as the start of a rollback of its $4.4 trillion balance sheet swollen by years of asset purchases (QE1, QE2, etc.). That's a far more aggressive pace than the market believes is appropriate.\n\nIn their latest series of comments, Fed policymakers outlined their justification for action, summarized into these three overarching concerns. Investors should be watching closely because as long as these worries remain valid, the Fed will keep tightening the screws on interest rates, credit availability and thus the stock market's performance:\n\nMarket valuations/sentiment\n\nBoth Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer noted that asset price valuations were extended. Fischer highlighted that equity price-earnings ratios are near the top of historical levels and that it would be foolish to think all risks [are] eliminated amid a notable uptick in risk appetites in asset markets.\n\nHe's right: The widely followed Shiller p-e ratio, which smooths earnings over a 10-year window, has increased to nearly 30 and is on the verge of eclipsing the 1929 Black Tuesday high that ushered in the Great Depression. Only the dot-com bubble, with a ratio of nearly 45, exceeds the overvaluation stocks are getting now.\n\nOn Tuesday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams told an Australian TV interviewer that the stock market rally still seems to be running very much on fumes and that it clearly is a risk to the U.S. economy.\n\nJob market tightness\n\nWhile inflation remains relatively tame, thanks to renewed weakness in energy prices, the unemployment rate has fallen to just 4.3 percent. In Yellen's press conference after the Fed's latest policy announcement a couple of weeks ago, she cited this along with other data points suggesting labor market tightness is a historical antecedent to higher inflation pressure.\n\nOn June 25, Williams warned that a very strong job market comes with risks. Namely, that if the Fed is too relaxed in its rate hike pace the economy will eventually overheat, causing inflation or some other problem. On June 27, he added that he expected wage inflation to increase to a range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent.\n\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker added on June 27 that he sees very little slack in the labor market and views the recent inflation weakness as temporary.\n\nFinancial stability risks\n\nBut above all, the Fed is slowly beginning to acknowledge its unofficial third mandate: The risks that runaway markets pose to financial stability. (The central bank's two official mandates are price stability and maximum employment.)\n\nFischer warned that high financial market prices may lead to future stability risks. Put simply, if valuations become too extended, it could lead to a bubble, which will eventually pop and jeopardize the broader economy.\n\nNew York Fed President Bill Dudley admitted in a speech to the Bank for International Settlements on June 25 that the Fed has become frustrated by an easing of financial market conditions since the rate hike campaign started in 2015. This is the opposite of what policymakers wanted to see. And it's being driven in large part by the stock market's near-20 percent rise since that time.\n\nThus, Dudley warns, the Fed will likely keep tightening policy harder than the economic and inflation data in isolation would suggest so that it can cool investor sentiment, increase credit costs throughout the economy and prevent job market overheating and thus high inflation.\n\nThe trouble with all this: The Fed has a terrible record of engineering soft landings in the economy and financial markets. The last two tightening cycles resulted in major stock market losses and volatility. Once investors' speculative fever breaks, sentiment often devolves into panic and a rush to exit.\n\nGluskin Sheff economist David Rosenberg noted that there have been 13 bouts of Fed hawkishness since World War II. Ten have landed the economy in recession.
Julián Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary who announced Saturday he is running for president, says President Trump is a failed leader on immigration and called for an end of detentions of families seeking asylum at the southern border.\n\nHe's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time, Castro said on Face the Nation Sunday. And it's just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention.\n\nCastro, who is Mexican-American, made his presidential announcement in San Antonio, his hometown and the city where he served as mayor for five years. He served as HUD Secretary under President Obama.\n\nIn the Face the Nation interview, Castro said as president he would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology and that does not scapegoat these immigrants, but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.\n\nHe criticized Mr. Trump's policy of family separations at the southern border, saying it has not deterred more families coming from Central American countries. Actually the exact opposite happened, he said.\n\nCastro also said he supports Medicare for all to transform the U.S. health care system.\n\nI'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like Medicare for all would be easy, he said. But I do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it.\n\nCastro, whose campaign slogan is One Nation. One Destiny, acknowledged he has an uphill battle ahead of him to capture the Democratic nomination among what is likely to be a crowded field of contenders.\n\nI'm under no illusion right now that I'm in the poll position or anything, Castro said. I'm not a front-runner, but nobody who grew up here in these neighborhoods, including myself, has ever been a front-runner. And I think in this country right now, that there are a lot of people who don't feel like front-runners. And I'm going to go speak to them in this campaign.
HAVANA - The Rolling Stones say they will play a free concert in Havana on March 25, becoming the biggest act to play Cuba since its 1959 revolution.\n\nThe Stones will play in Havana's Ciudad Deportiva three days after President Barack Obama visits Havana. The concert is expected to draw a massive audience in a country where the government once persecuted young people for listening to rock music, then seen as a tool of Western capitalism. Along with dropping that policy, the Cuban government has increasingly allowed large non-official gatherings.\n\nThe band says in a statement that we have performed in many special places during our long career but this show in Havana is going to be a landmark event for us, and, we hope, for all our friends in Cuba too.\n\nRolling Stone magazine reports the band is currently in the middle of its Latina America Ole tour, playing venues throughout Central and South America to rave reviews and packed stadiums.
Mexico made it clear it won't pay for the border wall promised by President Donald Trump during the 2016 election campaign. Yet Mr. Trump keeps repeating the notion in various forms, most recently tying it to his newly renegotiated trade agreement with Mexico. The latest utterance came in his speech from the Oval Office last night.\n\nThe wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico, Mr. Trump said.\n\nFact check: False.\n\nThe new trade agreement reached last year, called the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA, would replace the existing North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, which has been in effect since the early 1990s. NAFTA eliminated most tariffs between the three signatories, with a few exceptions.\n\nUSMCA, which does little to change those eliminations, isn't yet in effect. That's because Congress still needs to ratify the deal (as do legislative bodies in Mexico and Canada).\n\nIn the U.S., USMCA ratification is far from certain and isn't likely to be taken up soon, given Democrats now control the House and the government remains partially shut down. Even if the new trade deal is enacted, it's not clear how funds in the U.S. Treasury would be earmarked to build Mr. Trump's wall.\n\nCongress controls the purse strings\n\n\n\nThe president has previously implied that tariffs paid on Mexican imports could be used to bolster U.S. coffers and, in turn, be eventually allocated to pay for wall construction. That's also problematic: Congress drafts budgets and must approve any government spending.\n\nDonald Trump keeps repeating the ludicrous claim that somehow the revised NAFTA will fund his wall even though it remains unclear if the deal will be enacted, Lori Wallach, director of trade policy for advocacy group Public Citizen, said in a statement. And if it is, the text does not include border wall funding directly nor would it generate new government revenue indirectly given it cuts the very few remaining tariffs, not raises them.\n\nTariffs are taxes paid at the border to the government in order to import goods and services into the U.S. for sale inside the country.\n\nAny taxes collected into the U.S. Treasury that could be allocated for wall construction would still have to be approved by Congress, which at the moment remains at an impasse with Mr. Trump on that very topic. It's why the government is partially shut down.\n\nReminder: Companies, not countries, pay tariffs\n\nImporters like Ford or Walmart pay these duties. They either swallow the cost or pass it along to consumers. That means it's often ordinary Americans who foot the bill for tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump's trade levies are designed to make certain goods more expensive for U.S. consumers, who in turn are likely to seek out lower-cost items made in the U.S. or from countries that aren't facing the higher tariffs.\n\nFor U.S. manufacturers, purchases are often raw materials, like steel, or finished and semi-finished parts, like seats for automobiles. The U.S. also imports food and commodities like grain and meat.\n\nTake steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump's White House imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum last year. Because prices for imported metals are now higher, domestic producers have also been able to raise prices. And it's those increases that can get passed onto consumers for the finished goods.\n\nWhen it comes to the USMCA, Mexico generally doesn't pay taxes on goods imported into the U.S. If there are tariffs, U.S. companies pay them. Higher tariffs can force a company to pass on that extra cost to the consumer.\n\nAnother theory is that the U.S. economy will be so good under the new agreement that the U.S. Treasury's coffers will swell, providing enough funds to pay the billions for Mr. Trump's wall. That's a lot of ifs, given the current impasse, experts have noted.\n\nBottom line: No matter how many times Mr. Trump says it, Mexico probably isn't paying for the wall, directly or indirectly, anytime soon. As things now stand, U.S. taxpayers would wind up with the bill.
Pete Buttigieg, President Biden's nominee to lead the Transportation Department, fielded questions from the Senate Commerce Committee on a wide range of topics including infrastructure, the airline industry, Amtrak, regulations and federal funding in his confirmation hearing Thursday.\n\nIf confirmed, he's likely to be among those tasked with trying to convince Congress to pass a major infrastructure plan that would also help spur job growth. The nation's infrastructure has been crumbling, Republicans and Democrats agree, but there's been no major legislation passed on funding an infrastructure overhaul in recent years.\n\nNow is the time, and we have a real chance to deliver for the American people, Buttigieg said in his prepared opening remarks. We need to build our economy back, better than ever, and the Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing President Biden's infrastructure vision.\n\nButtigieg pointed out that it's states, counties and local governments that are expected to maintain roads and bridges, but they lack resources.\n\nIt's another example of how we need major and significant investment as a safety concern to enhance, upgrade and maintain bridges and other key infrastructure assets across the country, he said, in response to questioning by Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.\n\nThe young former presidential candidate impressed Democrats and Republicans alike with his testimony.\n\nI'm quite certain he will be confirmed, Republican committee chairman Senator Roger Wicker said during the hearing.\n\nMontana Senator Jon Tester, a fellow Democrat, raved, You have put on a clinic on how a nominee should act. You haven't avoided questions, he said, adding, and you know what the heck you're talking about. And that's refreshing.\n\nIf confirmed, Buttigieg would oversee a department that requested $89 billion for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nButtigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, brought up his experience dealing with infrastructure and transportation issues as mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He also highlighted that his experience as mayor would help guide him as he approaches transportation issues and funding for the department.\n\nAs a mayor from the industrial Midwest, I will bring a bottom-up perspective on transportation programs and funding, Buttigieg said in his opening remarks. If confirmed, I look forward to working with our partners at the state, local, territorial, and tribal levels to find solutions to our infrastructure issues while we also prepare for the future of transportation at a time of great change.\n\nIn his prepared opening testimony, Buttigieg mentioned that effective transportation policy can help people achieve the American Dream, but he said that he is also aware that misguided policies and missed opportunities in transportation can reinforce racial and economic inequality, by dividing or isolating neighborhoods and undermining government's basic role of empowering Americans to thrive.\n\nAfter Mr. Biden announced Buttigieg's nomination, there were early signals of bipartisan support for Buttigieg. In a statement from December 15, Republican Senator Todd Young of Indiana, who sits on the Commerce Committee, said, As a former city leader here in Indiana, Pete understands how critical infrastructure is to growth and opportunity. It will be good to have a Hoosier serving in this capacity.\n\nWhen running for the Democratic presidential nomination, Buttigieg occasionally admitted that he thought the Trump administration would enact infrastructure reform, citing the potential job growth from an infrastructure package. In addition, Buttigieg, when talking about infrastructure on the 2020 campaign trail, also frequently advocated for the U.S. to increase investments not only in bridges, railways and roads, but also in implementing better infrastructure to provide clean, safe water.\n\nButtigieg is the latest of Mr. Biden's Cabinet picks to testify before Senate committees. If confirmed, he will be the first openly LGBTQ Cabinet member to be confirmed by the Senate. He introduced his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, who attended the hearing, to the committee during his opening remarks.\n\nI want to thank him for his many sacrifices and his support in making it possible for me to pursue public service, the nominee said.
President Donald Trump's trade war with China isn't only hitting Apple -- new data suggest it's taking a toll on the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, said Thursday that its closely watched manufacturing index fell sharply in December from the previous month to its lowest level in more than two years. The drop — the biggest in a decade — was worse than economists had expected. The cause? A slowdown in growth in the world's two largest economies -- the U.S. and China.\n\nThe story here is that the trade war, coupled with China's underlying slowdown, is wreaking havoc in both countries, said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note.\n\nCompanies seeking clarity\n\nApple on Wednesday pointed to trade tensions as one reason for weaker-than-expected demand for its flagship iPhone in China.\n\nAlthough American manufacturers remain in good shape after a year of solid economic growth and healthy consumer spending, evidence that the manufacturing sector is cooling seemed to contribute to the malaise on Wall Street. Stocks were already tumbling Thursday, suffering another sharp decline the day after Apple cut its revenue forecast.\n\nThe ongoing open issues with tariffs between U.S. and China are causing longer-term concerns about costs and sourcing strategies for our manufacturing operations, one manufacturer said in responding to the ISM survey. We were anticipating more clarity [regarding] tariffs at the end of 2018.\n\nThe manufacturing index's drop echoes the deterioration in the other manufacturing surveys and suggests that the slowdown in global growth is starting to take its toll on the U.S. economy, Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note.\n\nAmerican consumers were already seeing some impact from the trade fight with China, with prices up for some items during the holidays. And they're likely to feel a bigger pinch in 2019. Walmart last year warned that prices could jump because of tariffs on Chinese imports. In recent weeks, companies reporting third-quarter earnings have also discussed raising prices if the trade battle escalates.\n\nNot so easy to win\n\nMr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day suspension of further tariff hikes in their fight over Beijing's technology policy, but left in place penalties already imposed. The U.S. Trade Representative's office has set a March 2 deadline for stepped up tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nOn Thursday, one White House advisor signaled that trade wars may not be easy to win, as Mr. Trump has contended, after all. A heck of a lot of companies that do business in China will see a hit to their earnings until the U.S. and China negotiate a trade deal, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs, told CNN.\n\nAmerican trade negotiators want Beijing to drop requirements that U.S. companies share technology and other proprietary data, as well as cut tariffs on American goods. Mr. Trump has also pushed for China to lower its trade surplus with the U.S.\n\nChina isn't the only trade issue on the table. Congress also must approve a newly-negotiated trade pact with Canada and Mexico, while the Trump administration is considering whether to impose tariffs on auto imports. And existing tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum, solar panels and washing machines remain in place.\n\n-- The Associated Press contributed to this report
WASHINGTON -- In the spring of 2014, as a team of experts was examining what ailed the U.S. nuclear force, the Air Force withheld from them the fact that it was simultaneously investigating damage to a nuclear-armed missile in its launch silo caused by three airmen.\n\nThe Air Force on Friday gave The Associated Press the first substantive description of the accident after being questioned about it by the AP for more than a year.\n\nThe accident happened May 17, 2014, at an underground launch silo containing a Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. The silo, designated Juliet-07, is situated among wheat fields and wind turbines about 9 miles west of Peetz, Colorado. It is controlled by launch officers of the 320th Missile Squadron and administered by the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren Air Force Base at Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nThe Air Force said that while three airmen were troubleshooting the missile, a mishap occurred, causing $1.8 million in damage to the missile. The service declined to explain the nature of the mishap, such as whether it caused physical damage, saying the information is too sensitive to be made public.\n\nThe three airmen were immediately stripped of their certification to perform nuclear weapons duty. The missile was taken offline and removed from its silo. No one was injured and the Air Force said the accident posed no risk to public safety.\n\nMore than a year later the three airmen were recertified and returned to duty.\n\nAt the time of the accident, a group of nuclear weapons experts was nearing the end of a three-month independent review of the entire U.S. nuclear force, an examination prompted in part by a series of AP stories on troubles within the force. The experts were operating on orders from then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who asked them to begin their review in March. They reported their results to him June 2.\n\nThe AP asked Lt. Col. John Sheets, spokesman for the Air Force Global Strike Command, which is responsible for the ICBM force, whether the May 17 accident had been reported to the Hagel-appointed review group. The experts were looking at a range of issues, including shortcomings in training, equipment, morale and leadership.\n\nNo. The accident was going through the investigative process when the review teams made their visits to ICBM bases, Sheets said. Pressed further, he said he could say no more and referred questions about this to the Pentagon, which did not immediately comment.\n\nThe Accident Investigation Board did not begin its work until Aug. 25, more than three months after the mishap. A safety investigation was begun sometime earlier. The Air Force denied an AP request for the accident investigation report in 2015 under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said Saturday the fact that the Hagel review group was not told about the accident raises questions about what other accidents and incidents may have been overlooked by that investigation.\n\nOn Friday evening, the AP was given a brief summary of the report. It said the Minuteman 3 missile became nonoperational during a diagnostic test on the evening of May 16, 2014. The next morning a mishap crew chief, who was not identified, did not correctly adhere to technical guidance during troubleshooting efforts, subsequently damaging the missile. No further details about the damage or errors were disclosed.\n\nThe investigation report summary said there were four contributing factors to the accident, and two were identified. One was the mishap chief's failure to follow technical guidance. The other was that the mishap chief lacked the necessary proficiency level to anticipate the consequences of his actions during the troubleshooting.\n\nIn seeming contradiction of that second point, the Air Force said in its separate statement to the AP that the mishap team chief was properly trained for the task he was performing.\n\nSheets said it is possible that some or all of the three could still face disciplinary action.\n\nThe summary said the central cause of the mishap was established by clear and convincing evidence, but the Air Force would not disclose the cause or the evidence. It said the cause is cited in the investigation report. The Air Force refused to make that public, saying the report is classified, even though the service's own policy requires the public release of accident board reports.\n\nThe amount of damage to the missile - $1.8 million, according to the Air Force - suggests that the airmen's errors might have caused physical damage, Kristensen said. If so, he said, it could have been categorized by the Air Force as a Bent Spear event, which is an official reporting code word for a significant nuclear weapon incident. The Air Force refused to reveal how it categorized the Juliet-07 accident.\n\nBy keeping the details of the accident secret and providing only vague responses, the Air Force behaves as if it has something to hide and undermines public confidence in the safety of the ICBM mission, Kristensen said.\n\nSheets, the Global Strike Command spokesman, said Pentagon leaders were briefed on the results of the accident investigation in December. Members of Congress also were briefed, he said.
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his aides were the driving force behind the separation of thousands of migrant families in 2017 and 2018, pushing for the policy's implementation even as federal prosecutors raised concerns about the young age of some of the children, according to a report released by the Justice Department's internal watchdog.\n\nA 93-page report published on Thursday by the Justice Department's Inspector General found that Sessions and top aides, including his counselor Gene Hamilton, failed to coordinate with U.S. prosecutors, the U.S. Marshals Service and shelters before ordering the zero tolerance policy of prosecuting all adults who crossed the southern border without legal permission, including those traveling with their children.\n\nWe concluded that the Department's single-minded focus on increasing immigration prosecutions came at the expense of careful and appropriate consideration of the impact of family unit prosecutions and child separations, the report said.\n\nAccording to the report, U.S. attorneys along the southern border were not initially made aware that Sessions wanted them to prosecute all migrant parents who had been apprehended with minor children. They were later told that was the case, and that there would be no categorical ban on prosecuting parents because of their children's age.\n\n[W]e need to take away children, Sessions said during a call in May 2018, according to contemporaneous notes taken by several U.S. attorneys. [I]f care about kids, don't bring them in; won't give amnesty to kids; to people with kids, the notes said. Sessions declined to be interviewed by investigators with the inspector general's office, the report said.\n\nJohn Bash, the former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, told the Justice Department Inspector General's team that then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said prosecutors could decline to prosecute some cases if they involved parents of children who had a disability or spoke pre-Columbian languages.\n\nRosenstein told investigators from the inspector general's office that he understood the zero tolerance policy would result in children being separated from their families.\n\nI think the answer is yes, he said. I think everybody understood that what it meant was we are going to prosecute ... everybody who committed a crime without regard [to] whether they brought a child.\n\nIn a statement following the report's release on Thursday, Rosenstein, who stepped down in May 2019, said he wished we all had done better.\n\nSince leaving the Department, I have often asked myself what we should have done differently, and no issue has dominated my thinking more than the zero tolerance immigration policy, said Rosenstein, who is one of the few Trump administration officials who have expressed regret over their involvement in enforcing the policy. It was a failed policy that never should have been proposed or implemented.\n\nAs detailed in the report, a U.S. prosecutor in Texas told investigators that the prosecution of migrant parents had a considerable effect on his office's ability to prosecute other criminal cases, including those related to sex crimes. Crossing the border without permission, if prosecuted, is a misdemeanor offense.\n\nDuring the spring of 2018, U.S. immigration authorities separated more than 2,800 migrant children from their parents, before judicial intervention and public outcry forced the Trump administration to halt the practice.\n\nThe children were incorrectly designated as unaccompanied minors and sent to shelters overseen by the U.S. refugee agency, while their parents were prosecuted for crossing the southern border without legal permission.\n\nMost of the 2,800 families who were separated during the zero tolerance period were still in the U.S. when a federal judge blocked the policy, and were eventually reunited.\n\nRoughly 470 parents were deported during this period, and about one-third chose to have their children brought back to Central America, as the government generally opposed allowing them to return to the U.S. The rest allowed their children to remain in the U.S. without them.\n\nMany of the migrant parents separated from their children in 2017 and early 2018, however, were deported without them, complicating reunification efforts. Because of stale or outdated personal information and phone numbers, advocates have been struggling to locate all parents and more than 600 remain unreachable, according to court documents.\n\nLee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the separated families, urged the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden to rectify the immoral and illegal legacy of the family separation policy. Mr. Biden has pledged to create a task force to help locate separated parents who have yet to be located.\n\nThe incoming administration must reunite the separated families in the United States, but we cannot stop there, Gelernt said. These families deserve citizenship, resources, care, and a commitment that family separation will never happen again.
FAIRBORN, Ohio -- An Ohio police officer accused of making an inappropriate comment about a Black Lives Matter activist who killed himself on the Statehouse steps has been fired.\n\nFairborn police say officer Lee Cyr was fired after an investigation into a Facebook comment posted last month under Cyr's account.\n\nThe comment stated Love a happy ending. It was posted on the Ohio Politics Facebook page two days after MarShawn McCarrel II shot himself. McCarrel had helped with protests after high-profile police shootings led to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nBlack Lives Matter activist MarShawn McCarrel, 23, shot himself on the steps of the Ohio Statehouse Monday night. http://ddnnews.com/1nWb2pZ Posted by Ohio Politics on Tuesday, February 9, 2016\n\nMcCarrel had helped with protests after high-profile police shootings led to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nCBS affiliate WBNS reported that McCarrel's final post on Facebook: My demons won today. I'm sorry.\n\nPolice say that while Cyr was off duty when he posted the comment, his actions violated the department's social media policy.\n\nCyr had been with the department since 1994. No publicly listed phone number could be found for him Tuesday.
Chris Mosier, a hall-of-fame triathlete, All-American duathlete and six-time member of Team USA, has overcome many challenges — and not just in sports. Mosier is also know as the first transgender man to represent the United States in international competition and is credited with prompting the International Olympic Committee to change its policy on transgender athletes.\n\nHowever, it was a long road to receiving that acceptance.\n\nThe athlete and advocate recently participated in a speaker series geared toward highlighting under-told stories of minority athletes. During an in-depth conversation with former NFL player Dhani Jones for Gatorade Endurance's Someone Like Me Speaker Series, Mosier spoke about being accepted as a transgender athlete.\n\nDoing an ironman race is nothing compared to me just existing in the world and some of the pain and the hurt that I had felt up to that point in identifying as trans and having interactions with the world, Mosier told Jones.\n\nI had some really heartbreaking moments... at races, specifically, but it wasn't my competitors, it was the fans and the spectators there that posed the issue, and sometimes the volunteers, he said. And sometimes it was purposeful and sometimes it was accidental\n\nMosier noted that sometimes people make hurtful comments to transgender people without even knowing, because people lack a basic knowledge and information about what it means to be transgender, about how to talk about identity.\n\nIn an interview about the speaker series with CBS News, Mosier said he wants to be the role model he didn't have as a child. He created transathlete.com in 2013 as a resource for students, athletes, coaches, and administrators to find information about trans inclusion in athletics at various levels of play.\n\nThe site also breaks down legislation and policies affecting trans athletes at different levels, from state to international. While progress has been made in some areas, Moiser the sports world is getting worse for transgender and nonbinary athletes.\n\nStates across the country are proposing bills that would ban transgender high school student athletes from participating in sports in the gender with which they identify, Mosier told CBS News. There are national sport governing bodies across the globe that are outright banning the participation of transgender athletes. And we know that just socially, there are so many barriers for our participation and acceptance.\n\nAccording to transathlete.com and data from GLESEN, which works to end discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, 16 states have friendly policies for trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming student athletes.\n\nHowever, 14 states require medical proof or invasive disclosures from student athletes, and 10 states did not issue statewide guidance on best practices.\n\nEleven states have discriminatory policies that create additional barriers for trans, nonbinary and gender non-conforming student athletes.\n\nMosier has used his social media to draw attention to specific legislation, such as Tennessee's House Bill 1572, which would penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to play on the team that aligns with their gender identity. He has also raised awareness online about similar bills regarding transgender student athletes in other states including Georgia, Washington and Missouri.\n\nMosier says he hopes sharing the diverse stories of athletes helps create change in society.\n\nI think that sport is a vehicle for social change and if we can make change in or sports teams, in our sports leagues, in our community sports clubs, that change can ripple out into the rest of our communities, he said.
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled an agreement with the United Nations on Tuesday to resettle thousands of African migrants after pressure from hawks in his coalition prompted him earlier to suspend it. Netanyahu suddenly announced he was suspending the deal Monday night, just hours after touting it on national television, until he could meet with Israeli residents of south Tel Aviv, areas with large migrant populations who feel slighted by the deal.\n\nAfter meeting with residents on Tuesday Netanyahu said he had weighed the pros and cons and he decided to cancel the agreement.\n\nThe move came after pressure from Netanyahu's nationalist allies who lashed out against the deal.\n\nNaftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist Jewish Home party, tweeted shortly before Netanyahu's statement nullifying the deal that the agreement is bad for Israel.\n\nHe said it's not enough to suspend it, I call on the prime minister to cancel it completely. Its approval would cause generations of crying and determine a precedent in Israel granting residency for illegal infiltrators.\n\nEritrean migrants wear chains to mimic slaves at a demonstration against the Israeli government's policy to forcibly deport African refugees and asylum seekers from Israel to Uganda and Rwanda, outside the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in Jerusalem, Jan. 17, 2018. AP\n\nNetanyahu had announced Monday afternoon that Israel agreed to cancel the planned expulsion of the migrants. The deal called for sending about half of the 35,000 African migrants to Western nations and allowing the rest to remain in Israel.\n\nDozens of migrants and their Israeli supporters protested the suspension outside the prime minister's office in Jerusalem and government offices in Tel Aviv as Netanyahu met with the neighborhood representatives.\n\nSome protesters stripped to the waist, draped themselves with chains and taped their mouths shut at a protest in Tel Aviv. Others waved signs reading Human lives are not to play with. Yes to the deal.\n\nProtester Daniella Elyashar called on Netanyahu to stop this political game. Another protester, Veronika Cohen, said yesterday we were in tears of joy and this morning just in tears.\n\nAfrican migrants and Israelis demonstrate in Jerusalem, April 3, 2018, against the Israeli government's policy to forcibly deport African refugees and asylum seekers. Getty\n\nHardliners in Netanyahu's coalition strongly criticized the deal for allowing thousands of Africans to remain after the prime minister announced it.\n\nLabor Party leader Avi Gabbay slammed the sudden turnaround on Army Radio questioning if defense decisions are also made in the same manner.\n\nIt is sad, troubling and even a little scary that decisions are made that way, Gabbay said. He accused Netanyahu of leadership based on polls and comments on social media.\n\nIsraeli commentators slammed Netanyahu for folding to pressure.\n\nWriting in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, Sima Kadmon noted Netanyahu's decision lasted for just six hours and 45 minutes before an important and courageous decision by the prime minister was trampled under the boots of the right wing divisions.\n\nMost of the African migrants are from war-torn Sudan and Eritrea, the latter having one of the world's worst human rights records. The migrants say they are asylum-seekers fleeing danger and persecution, while Israeli leaders have claimed they are merely job seekers.\n\nThe Africans started arriving in 2005 after neighboring Egypt violently quashed a refugee demonstration and word spread of safety and job opportunities in Israel. Tens of thousands crossed the porous desert border with Egypt before Israel completed a barrier in 2012 that stopped the influx.\n\nThousands of African migrants are concentrated in neighborhoods in south Tel Aviv, where ethnic food shops and phone card stalls line the streets, and the area has become known as Little Africa. This has sparked tension with the working-class Jewish residents who have been putting pressure on the government to find a solution.\n\nResidents complained the agreement doesn't address their needs and demanded assurances that remaining migrants will be dispersed around the country as promised.\n\nThe prime minister's turnaround threw into limbo the surprise agreement, which had finally offered a solution to an issue that has divided Israel for a decade. The deportation plan had been widely criticized at home and abroad, even by some of Israel's closest supporters.
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Sunday fired a medium-range missile, U.S. and South Korean officials said, in the latest ballistics test for a country speeding up its development of nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\nOne U.S. official said it appeared to be a successful test of the land-based version of North Korea's sub-launched missile, CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reports.\n\nThe solid-fuel missile that was launched was the second successful test of a missile that the U.S. calls KN-15, Martin reports.\n\nThe rocket was fired from an area near the North Korean county of Pukchang, in South Phyongan Province, and flew eastward about 310 miles, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. It did not immediately provide more details.\n\nWhite House officials traveling in Saudi Arabia with President Trump said the system, which was last tested in February, has a shorter range than the missiles launched in North Korea's most recent tests.\n\nU.S. Pacific Command said it tracked the missile until it landed into the sea.\n\nA man passes by a TV news program showing a file image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, on Sun., May 21, 2017. AP\n\nThe United Nations Security Council plans to hold urgent consultations following the missile test. Council diplomats say the closed discussion was requested by the U.S., Japan and South Korea and will take place Tuesday. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting has not been officially announced.\n\nThe North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) assessed that the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America, Commander Dave Benham, director of media operations for U.S. Pacific Command, said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Pacific Command stands behind our ironclad commitment to the security of our allies in the Republic of Korea and Japan, the statement said.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the country's military is closely monitoring the North Korean military for any further provocation and maintaining readiness to respond.\n\nIn February, North Korea used a launcher truck to fire a midrange solid-fuel missile that it calls the Pukguksong (Polaris)-2, a land-based version of a submarine-launched missile the country revealed earlier. That missile traveled about 500 kilometers before crashing into the sea, according to South Korean and U.S. officials.\n\nThe February launch, the North's first missile test after Trump took office, alarmed neighbors because solid-fuel missiles can be fired more quickly than liquid-fuel missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and require a larger number of vehicles, including fuel trucks, that could be spotted by satellites.\n\nThe North's latest launch came a week after North Korea successfully tested a new midrange missile that Pyongyang said could carry a heavy nuclear warhead. Experts said that rocket flew higher and for a longer time than any other missile previously tested by North Korea, and that it could one day reach targets as far away as Hawaii and Alaska.\n\nThat missile launch showed that North Korea's technology seems to be getting more sophisticated, and it represented a significant advance for Kim Jung Un and his nuclear weapons program, Martin reported. U.S. officials said it appeared to have been a test of a reentry vehicle, a key technology North Korea must master before it can develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon.\n\nUnder the watch of third-generation dictator Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been aggressively pursuing a decades-long goal of putting a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.\n\nNorth Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year alone, possibly improving its knowledge on making nuclear weapons small enough to fit on long-range missiles. The country has also conducted a slew of rocket launches as it continues to advance its arsenal of ballistic weapons, which also include midrange solid-fuel missiles that could be fired from land mobile launchers or submarines.\n\nSuch tests present a difficult challenge to new South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who took office on May 10 and has expressed a desire to reach out to North Korea. Pyongyang's aggressive push to boost its weapons program also makes it one of the most urgent foreign policy concerns for the Trump administration, though Washington has struggled to settle on a policy.\n\nSunday's missile launch came hours after Moon named his new foreign minister nominee and top advisers for security and foreign policy.\n\nMoon held a National Security Council meeting at the presidential Blue House to discuss the launch, his office said.
President Trump is facing consequences from yet another social media platform following last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol. YouTube said late Tuesday it had removed new content from Mr. Trump's channel and banned him from uploading any videos or livestreams for at least a week.\n\nComments were also indefinitely banned on the channel.\n\n1/ After review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to Donald J. Trump's channel for violating our policies. It now has its 1st strike & is temporarily prevented from uploading new content for a *minimum* of 7 days. — YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) January 13, 2021\n\nThe video-sharing site removed content uploaded on Tuesday for violating its policies on inciting violence. YouTube referred to its three-strikes policy, which states that a one-week suspension is standard for one strike.\n\nA two-week suspension would be enacted if the channel receives a second strike within 90 days. A third strike would result in the channel's termination.\n\nYouTube and other tech giants faced mounting pressure to take action against the president's accounts in the wake of the Capitol riot. Groups like #StopHateForProfit, a coalition of more than 1,200 businesses and non-profits and countless consumers, urged those companies to permanently ban Mr. Trump.\n\n#StopHateForProfit was even contemplating a boycott against YouTube if it did not respond.\n\nJim Steyer, the founder and CEO of Common Sense Media and an organizer of #StopHateForProfit, called YouTube's decision an important and necessary first step.\n\nWe hope they will make it permanent, Steyer said in a statement to CBS News. While it is disappointing that it took a Trump-incited attack on our Capitol to get here, it appears that all the major platforms are finally beginning to step up and take this important issue seriously and that policymakers and the public are committed to holding them accountable. Our democratic norms and institutions, not to mention our kids' future, depend on it\n\nMr. Trump has been locked out of Twitter and Pinterest as well as Facebook and Instagram. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Mr. Trump was banned from using both Instagram and Facebook until at least the end of his presidency. The pro-Trump platform Parler has also been dropped by Apple, Google and Amazon.
New research suggests food options available at U.S. workplaces are likely doing no favors for Americans' waistlines.\n\nA new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found nearly a quarter of employed U.S. adults obtain food or beverages at work at least once a week. And those foods and drinks are typically unhealthy, often high in calories, sodium, added sugars, and refined grains.\n\nInvestigators looked at data collected from 2012 to 2013 on more than 5,000 study participants from across the country. On average, each person consumed nearly 1,300 calories from foods and drinks at work per week. Generally, these foods and beverages did not align well with the Department of Health and Human Service's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\nThe most common foods and drinks obtained at work include pizza, soft drinks, cookies, cakes, brownies, pies, and candy. The foods included in the study were either purchased on site at work either from a cafeteria or vending machine or offered for free in common areas, during meetings, or at worksite social events. The data did not include foods that were brought into work from home or purchased at off-site restaurants or retail stores.\n\nImproving food options for employees\n\nResearchers say improving the nutritional quality of foods eaten at work can go a long way in improving the nation's health. Obesity and poor nutrition are two of the main risk factors for chronic conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. These diseases make up seven of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and account for 84 percent of total health care costs, the researchers point out.\n\nPrevious research published in 2010 found that three in 10 working adults in the U.S. were obese. Employed adults with obesity also report eating less fruits and vegetables and lower levels of physical activity outside of work than normal weight adults.\n\nWith approximately 150 million working adults nationwide, the researchers say employers are in position to institute workplace wellness programs with the potential to reach and have an impact on a large number of Americans' health.\n\nEmployers can offer appealing and healthy options in cafeterias, vending machines, and at meetings and social events, said lead CDC investigator Stephen J. Onufrak, PhD, a researcher with CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity. One way to do this is by incorporating food service guidelines and healthy meeting policies into worksite wellness efforts.\n\nIn addition to providing foods that are more in line with the dietary guidelines, including fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds, work places can take additional steps to help improve health of employees.\n\nFoods can be placed in areas that encouraged consumption of the better choices, like placing fruit on the welcome desk or bottles of water at the cash register, and keeping unhealthy choices in less appealing places such as putting full sugar sodas on the very top or very bottom rack of the cooler, Debbie Petitpain, MS, RDN a media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told CBS News. And financial incentives, such as a frequency program or employee discount, can be used to encourage employees to make the healthy choice.\n\nMaking healthier choices at work\n\nEmployees can also do their part to make healthier food decisions at work. Petitpain recommends knowing what food options are available in the cafeteria or vending machines before lunch or snack time.\n\nMany operations post a menu online or outside the cafeteria so you can review the options and pick the best choice ahead of time instead of making the decision when you are hungry, under a time crunch and smelling burgers, she said.\n\nSimple swaps can also reduce the amount of calories, sodium, and added sugars consumed. These include choosing baked chicken over fried, a sandwich instead of pizza and an unsweetened drink like tea or carbonated water rather than soda.\n\nFor breakfast, Petitpain suggests eating a whole grain cereal or oatmeal instead of processed meat like bacon or a stack of pancakes. And for a snack, sticking with yogurt, a fruit cup, or cottage cheese, or selecting nuts, trail mix, or whole grain crackers from the vending machine over sweets or chips is the way to go.\n\nThe new CDC research also found that nearly 70 percent of calories consumed at work came from free foods offered at meetings, in common areas, or at workplace social events. While experts say employers can work to address the healthfulness of these free foods, employees can also take steps to avoid temptation.\n\nUnfortunately, even if the food is free, the calories still count. Portion control makes all the difference, Petitpain said. One slice of veggie pizza or a small slice of cake can be worked into an overall healthy diet. A healthy eating pattern isn't defined by one meal. You can always alter your dinner to balance out foods eat during work hours. Remember, though, that just because it's offered, you don't have to eat it.\n\nShe recommends keeping busy during meetings by taking notes or chatting with co-workers at celebrations to keep from nibbling.\n\nWhile the study didn't take into account foods brought in to work by colleagues, anyone who's ever worked in an office knows it's the first place people bring leftover Halloween candy or holiday treats.\n\nAsk your colleagues to adopt a 'no junk food' policy or to also bring a healthy treat with the unhealthy one, Petitpain recommends. Research shows that keeping the treats out of sight, say in the break room or in a cabinet, reduces mindless snacking. Brushing your teeth after lunch or chewing gum can keep you from nibbling, as well.
By now it's clear that the tech stocks that have been fueling the U.S. stock market are running out of gas. Sparking Tuesday's collapse in share prices across the board was the tech-heavy Nasdaq's nearly 3 percent tumble.\n\nYou may not directly own any of the big tech names that have been the sector's leaders, but if you're in the stock market, you're likely carrying outsized exposure to a handful of mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nYou also may not know the term -- FANGMAN -- used for these stocks on Wall Street trading desks, but you know the names: Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA). These are among the most heavily weighted shares in the S&P 500 stock index -- upon which nearly $8 trillion in assets are benchmarked -- because of their large market capitalization (price multiplied by shares outstanding).\n\nAnd thanks to persistent outperformance powered by tailwinds from iPhone sales, advertising revenue, subscriber growth and the promise of new technologies like autonomous vehicles, they've padded portfolio returns and shrugged off disappointing performances in other areas of the market (in transports and industrials, for instance).\n\nBut it's all coming apart now, marked by these key tech stocks suffering one of their worst collective declines on Tuesday.\n\nThe dynamic has been self-reinforcing recently: The more these stocks rise, the larger their market cap gets, which forces more money into them as their weighting in the S&P 500 increases. Unknowingly, many regular investors are assuming more risk as they become more exposed to a smaller group of speculative, growth-focused stocks.\n\nIt's not just the S&P 500 that's afflicted. Earlier this month, a subset of this group (Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet) accounted for a quarter of the Nasdaq Composite, up from less than 20 percent just three years ago. Goldman Sachs analysts recently pointed out that the FANGMANs were among the most crowded trade on Wall Street, with Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet three of the top four most widely held stocks among hedge funds.\n\nBank of America's Michael Hartnett warned clients this week that this is just the latest bubble created by overly easy central bank policy. He's dubbed it the Icarus Trade and wrote that the lowest interest rates in 5,000 years have guaranteed a melt-up trade in risk assets including the latest e-Commerce bubble consisting of the majority of the FANGMAN stocks. They're up 617 percent since the financial crisis, making it the third-largest bubble of the past 40 years.\n\nBut rapid price deflation is underway as a perfect storm of negative headlines hit. Facebook shares have been pushed into a bear market -- down more than 22 percent from their recent high (chart above). The company is now grappling with the #DeleteFacebook blowback following revelations of the political weaponization of personal data, a looming Congressional appearance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and growing realization that stricter data regulation is coming. These forces will also hit the data hoarders at Google.\n\nApple is suffering from tepid demand for $1,000 iPhones. Nvidia has been affected by the worries over the safety of self-driving cars in the wake of the fatal accident in Arizona between an autonomous Uber and a pedestrian crossing a street outside a crosswalk.\n\nWeakness in the FANGMANs is threatening to push the S&P 500 below its long-term 200-day moving average (blue line in the chart above). That's a widely recognized measure of trend that was last violated briefly in the summer of 2016.\n\nThis would be a big negative, according to the folks at SentimenTrader, because it would end a streak of more than 400 days above this long-term average. And stocks have tended to perform poorly when they're below and looking up at the 200-day, with an average annualized return of just 0.2 percent (vs. 11.1 percent when above this measure).
President Trump released a farewell address on Tuesday in his final full day in office as he attempts to cement his legacy, after the assault on the Capitol that followed weeks of his false claims about the election and after he became the first president in history to be impeached twice. Mr. Trump is scheduled to depart the White House at 8 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Trump's recorded address touched on themes his administration and campaigns have pushed from the beginning, including American greatness and reaching the forgotten man and woman. The outgoing president tried to make the case that he's kept his promises.\n\nWe did what we came here to do, and so much more, Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president did acknowledge the new administration taking over the White House, but did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. He has yet to call Mr. Biden the president-elect.\n\nThis week we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word, Mr. Trump said in a speech that was clearly scripted but with small insertions of Trump flair.\n\nMr. Trump thanked his family, the Pences, his chief of staff Mark Meadows, the Secret Service and law enforcement.\n\nMost of all, I want to thank the American people, Mr. Trump said. To serve as your president has been an honor beyond description.\n\nMr. Trump said it never failed to move him when Americans flocked to wave at his motorcade, not just to see him but out of honor for the country.\n\nThe president did mention the violent attack on the nation's Capitol, even as he has denied that his rhetoric was remotely responsible for it.\n\nAll Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated, the president said in his address.\n\nMr. Trump reminisced on his policy agenda items, from withdrawing from the Paris climate accord to replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement, to increasing the child tax credit. He also touted his foreign policy, saying he's especially proud to be the first president in decades to start no new wars.\n\nI did not seek the easiest course. By far, it was actually the most difficult, Mr. Trump said, claiming he sought the tough path for the American people.\n\nMr. Trump is bucking the tradition of attending his successor's inauguration, instead leaving the White House Wednesday morning for a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews. The White House sent out invitations for an 8 a.m. ceremony.\n\nNow, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration, at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There's never been anything like it, Mr. Trump said in his address. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country, and for our children, the best is yet to come.
HAVERTOWN, Pa. - An administrative judge found Chipotle's (CMG) social media policy violated federal labor laws while ruling in favor of a Philadelphia-area employee who was fired after criticizing the company on Twitter last year.\n\nThe Colorado-based fast-food chain must offer to rehire 38-year-old James Kennedy and pay him for lost wages, the judge ruled Monday. Kennedy worked at the chain's store in Havertown until he was fired in February 2015 and now has a union job with American Airlines.\n\nIf you want to tweet something about your personal experience at your job, do it, Kennedy told Philly.com on Tuesday. A lot of times your bosses will sugarcoat what's going on. Doing it publicly really puts the spotlight on them.\n\nThe social media post that landed Kennedy in hot water came after a customer tweeted thanks for a free food offer in January 2015.\n\nChipotleTweets, nothing is free, only cheap #labor. Crew members make only $8.50hr how much is that steak bowl really? Kennedy tweeted in response.\n\nKennedy took down the tweet after a supervisor showed him a social media policy that banned disparaging, false statements about Chipotle. But he was fired two weeks later after circulating a petition about workers being unable to take breaks.\n\nKennedy, of Upper Darby, was represented by the Pennsylvania Workers Organizing Committee, which has pushed for higher pay for fast-food workers. The National Labor Relations Board agreed with complaints filed by the group that Kennedy was unfairly treated. The case was one of several the NLRB considered regarding the social media rights of fast-food workers protesting wages and working conditions.\n\nAt a hearing, Kennedy's manager testified that she fired Kennedy, a war veteran, because she was concerned he would become violent after arguing with her about the petition.\n\nAdministrative law judge Susan Flynn ruled Chipotle's social media rules violated labor laws and ordered the restaurant to post signs acknowledging some of its employee policies -- and especially the social media rules -- were illegal.\n\nA Chipotle spokeswoman didn't respond to Philly.com's report and didn't immediately return an email from The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nKennedy said he'd happily accept his back wages in the form of food vouchers.\n\nYou cannot deny that their food is delicious, but their labor policies were atrocious, he said.
Gold has been a hot commodity so far this year. But will it last?\n\nThe yellow metal is up more than 19 percent and has recently tested the $1,280-an-ounce level for the first time since early 2015 (chart below). In comparison, the Dow Jones industrials index is down 2.7 percent for the year to date. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite -- which features one-time momentum favorites like Apple (AAPL) -- fares even worse: It's down 7.2 percent.\n\nA number of factors are fueling gold's rise. The recent cooling in the U.S. dollar. Financial volatility at the start of the year. Early evidence of rising inflation. Physical metal shortages in the futures market. And the recent experiment with deepening negative interest rates in Europe and Asia as overseas central banks respond to recent vulnerabilities with even more aggressive monetary policy stimulus.\n\nAbove all, though, inflation dynamics should keep gold pushing higher as crude oil looks set to stabilize and the U.S. labor market tightens.\n\nEd Yardeni at Yardeni Research notes that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure -- the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Deflator -- increased to 1.7 percent in February up from a recent low of 1.3 percent in October (chart below). That's very close to the Fed's 2 percent target and suggests that factors like rising housing costs and an ongoing decline in the unemployment rate are lifting the general price level -- both in a cost push (as businesses try to pass on higher unit labor costs) and demand pull (from lower rental vacancies, for instance).\n\nAt the same time, Fed policymakers have recently been voicing increasing worry about the potential risk of expectations about prices -- or where people believe inflation is headed -- from low energy costs. This suggests that despite the firming up of core, or ex-energy, inflation measures, the Fed is likely to hold off on any further interest rate hikes until the second half of the year as it waits for hard evidence that that U.S. economy is bouncing back.\n\nIf so, that means the central bank could potentially fall behind the curve on inflation because monetary policy operates with a lag of around nine months. It takes time for changes in interest rates to percolate through the financial system into loan rates, affecting credit-fueled purchases and, ultimately, business revenues.\n\nConformation of this should come courtesy of the Fed's updated Summary of Economic Projections, or dot plot, at its next policy announcement a week from today, on March 16.\n\nHigher inflation and a dovish Fed? That's a golden recipe for success for precious metals investors.
Republican candidates descended on South Carolina Saturday to speak at the Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity - an anti-poverty summit hosted by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Tim Scott.\n\nThe summit is being billed as an opportunity for GOP candidates to discuss conservative solutions to the problems of the American poor. It's named after former Congressman Jack Kemp, whom Ryan considers a mentor. Kemp was known as an aggressive crusader for supply-side conservative economics, which argued lower taxes would increase growth. But he was also known for his outreach to minority communities and people living in poverty, and his insistence that the Republican Party should speak to everyone in America, not just the middle class and the well-off.\n\nNaming the gathering after Kemp echoes the former congressman's efforts to do what Ryan is trying to do, Face the Nation host John Dickerson wrote in a column shortly after the summit was announced. Kemp even tried to do it when he was Bob Dole's vice presidential nominee. He traveled to Harlem in New York, Watts in Los Angeles, and the South Side of Chicago preaching the gospel of free enterprise. Green is the color of civil rights, he used to say, meaning the money that came from free enterprise. Much like Ryan, Kemp was ultimately discouraged from appealing for votes in poor neighborhoods where there weren't many Republicans.\n\nIn one of Ryan's first major policy addresses as Speaker, he echoed Kemp's message.\n\nThere are the millions of people stuck in neutral: 6 million people who have no choice but to work part time, 45 million people living in poverty, he said. Conservatives need to have an answer to this--because we do not write people off in this country. We just don't.\n\nThe summit was arranged before Ryan became Speaker, but he felt strongly enough about his message that he wasn't going to let his new job scuttle the event.\n\nThis is such a high priority for me, I instantly determined as soon as I became speaker that I'm going to keep this on the schedule, Ryan told the Wall Street Journal this week.\n\nThe forum could give Ryan and the Republican candidates an opportunity to renew Kemp's message for a new generation and demonstrate how their policies would address the problem of poverty in America. And according to the most recent annual data available, that's no insignificant task.\n\nThe census defines poverty on a sliding scale according to the size of a family unit, but for a family of four, the poverty threshold in 2014 was just over $24,000. For one person, it was just over $12,000.\n\nIn 2014, 46.7 million people were living in poverty, according to the Census Bureau - a poverty rate of 14.8 percent.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau\n\nSome groups were harder hit than others - 21.1 percent of children were living in poverty, comprising a full third of the American poor. The poverty rate for white Americans was only 10.1 percent, but for Hispanic Americans, it was 23.6 percent, and for black Americans, it was 26.2 percent. Among men, the poverty rate was 13.6 percent; among women, 16.1 percent.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau\n\nIn an interview on Sunday's broadcast, we'll ask Ryan what he hopes to accomplish with his summit, and what he thinks of the GOP candidates that shared the stage with him on Saturday, so make sure you tune in!

The elbow bump has replaced the handshake. Hand sanitizer and soap are considered debate night buzzwords. Rallies and town halls are held exclusively online. Field organizers are working from home. And I wash my hands is a CDC-friendly campaign slogan. Welcome to the art of campaigning in the age of coronavirus. The global pandemic comes as the presidential primary process is still underway, says CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns, changing the very nature of traditional hand to hand campaigning and offering a rare, real-time and multilayered test for a would-be commander-in-chief.\n\nIt is also threatening the act of in-person voting, prompting some states to postpone their primaries over health concerns, including Ohio's primary, which was scheduled for today. Florida, Illinois and Arizona went ahead with their primaries as scheduled but made changes to accommodate concern about the virus, like moving polling locations out of senior living facilities and offering sanitizing materials. In-person voting is a comparable transaction to picking up a takeout restaurant order or shopping at a grocery store, said Matt Dietrich of the Illinois State Board of Elections. Primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters.\n\nOfficials and campaigns alike have also been advocating for absentee or mail-in voting, where available, in the coming primaries. These options have been available in several of the states that have voted.\n\nTogether, Tuesday's three contests offer 441 delegates. Joe Biden has won Florida, CBS News projects, and he's poised for victories in Illinois and Arizona, too. Bernie Sanders' pathway to the nomination does not appear to be mathematically possible.\n\nStill, postponing the remaining primaries could prolong the nomination process, and depressed voter turnout could affect the ability of the campaigns to glean the crucial demographic and messaging data points from the votes.\n\nGeorgia, Louisiana, Kentucky and Maryland have all also suspended primaries slated to take place over the next several weeks.\n\nDemocrats do see some silver linings emerging from this unconventional primary process, however, and hope it leads to more states allowing other options to vote besides in-person.\n\nWe are really on the cusp here on a big expansion of early and absentee voting, and tremendous innovation in the campaign world, says Robby Mook, a CBS News political analyst and former Hillary Clinton campaign manager. Voters are sitting at home, you've got a captive audience....Every time you're reaching people online you're able to reach more people.\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday's primaries, the Democratic campaigns have operated largely online, canceling all in-person events and instructing staff to work from home. On Monday night, Sanders' campaign held a first-ever digital rally with several musical guests, distributed via livestream. Last week, he broadcast a fireside chat. Biden hosted a tele-town hall on Monday, where the impact of the pandemic was a top concern.\n\nRead more here.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nAfter run-ins with protesters in New Hampshire and California, Joe Biden officially received full protection from the Secret Service on Tuesday, according to a spokesperson. As the future of the 2020 race continues to remain uncertain, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson says Biden, like his fellow Americans, is at home following social distancing guidelines. While the campaign has repeatedly said they are following the advice of local and state public health officials regarding Tuesday's primary contests, they also today released a memo declaring the US held elections during the Civil War, the 1918 flu pandemic, and World War II. Regarding potential health fears keeping voters from the polls, the campaign also said they believe overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois due to early voting measures.\n\nAs the primary process continues to creep along, a hot topic of political gossip is taking hold around the Biden campaign: If he is the nominee, who should his vice presidential nominee be? It is unclear if the campaign has begun the vetting process for vice president, but Biden prompted speculation this week when he promised to choose a woman.\n\nSo, allies of his are already sending their recommendations, including former Congressman Luis Guiterrez, who wrote that Biden should pick a Latina. Other allies of Biden's have told CBS News they'd like to see former Democratic presidential rivals Senators Kamala Harris or Amy Klobuchar on the shortlist.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nSanders' campaign announced today that in the midst of the COVID19 crisis, their last three digital events have amassed 5.3 million views across various online platforms. Saturday's fireside chat from Sanders' Burlington home has been viewed 2.8 million times. Their pre-debate streamed event Sunday, which did not feature the senator himself, has 1 million views. And Monday's digital rally featuring a performance by Neil Young has so far been viewed 1.6 million times. In addition to the view counts, CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte says the Sanders camp announced Tuesday morning on a fundraising email that they have received more than 10 million contributions. As of March 1, they had 8.7 million donations since the start of the campaign.\n\nTONIGHT'S PRIMARIES\n\nARIZONA\n\nThe Arizona Democratic Party backed the state's move to carry on with the primary election, celebrating already record early voting turnout for the contest across the state. By Monday in Maricopa County, Arizona's largest by population, Democratic ballot returns had already topped 2016's primary by more than 70,000 votes.\n\nIn just the first hour of polls were opening today, an additional 3,500 were cast. Election officials across Arizona told CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin they raced to make changes to address the coronavirus pandemic, insisting they were not hampered by staffing and cleaning supply shortfalls that have plagued polls in other states.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes on Tuesday suggested the primary was already on schedule. We already tabulated just about every ballot that we've had in house which is a first time, ever.\n\nFLORIDA\n\nCBS News declared Joe Biden the winner as the polls closed in Florida, a battleground state. Florida Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee said that with the exception of a couple of counties in South Florida, voting locations around the state opened on time.\n\nBy Monday evening, nearly 2 million Florida voters had already cast ballots via early voting and voting by mail. But even with these early totals, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reported that some county supervisors, political party leaders, and Florida voters expressed concern about how coronavirus would impact the state's in-person voting turnout totals. A group of civil rights organizations filed a lawsuit against both the governor's and the secretary of state's offices demanding reasonable voting accommodations be made for Floridians.\n\nStephanie Porta, the co-founder and executive director of Organize Florida, one of the groups involved in the lawsuit, said, There are thousands of people in Florida who are under self-quarantine or forced quarantine, who are unable to participate in this election as well as thousands of students who have been ordered to move home…it's important that we have participation levels that ensure that everybody's voice is heard in a democracy.\n\nThe complaint requested an extension for people to be able to request a vote-by-mail ballot to March 27. It also asked the state to contact voters whose precincts changed as a result of site relocations. By the Florida Democratic Party's count, at least 91 precincts had closed or moved throughout the state in the days before the primary contest. The state Democratic Party staff contacted voters to let them know of precinct changes based on information gathered from conversations with state county supervisors.\n\nExecutive Director Juan Peñalosa said that modernizing voting is essential to mitigate future potential risks like coronavirus. For us to continue to vote as we did 50 years ago or 100 years ago is ludicrous. We need to modernize our voting systems to keep up to date with a changing world, said Peñalosa. We need to update the way we vote and how we allow people access to their vote and if we are not able to do that between now and November then we've failed — not just the Democratic Party but our government has failed.\n\nRachel Gilmer, co-director of Dream Defenders — another one of the groups included in the aforementioned lawsuit — was saddened by the low turnout that she observed Tuesday in her own polling place in Miami-Dade County. I vote every election and I went to my polling place and for the first time ever, my polling pace was like completely empty. It was me and one other person there and usually I have to wait in line to go and vote. I always vote on election day, said Gilmer.\n\nILLINOIS\n\nVoters in Chicago, where a lion's share of Illinois' votes will come out of, saw a whirlwind start to voting on Tuesday, says CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In calls with reporters, Chicago Board of Elections spokesperson Jim Allen said they've had to relocate more than 200 polling locations in the past couple days, with a couple of them dropping out as soon as this morning. This led to some precincts to not have the election machine or supplies they need. That was the biggest issue of the morning, Allen said. In addition to some precincts not having equipment, a Cook County official confirmed with Navarro that 850 election judges told Cook County ahead of time that they would not show up on election day, and that there's more that didn't show up without giving a heads up. They said they've been able to replace most of them.\n\nFederal guidance from CDC was distributed to all polling locations. Some in Cook County tried to maintain the proper line distancing of six feet by marking spaces on the floor. One voter told Navarro that one precinct had voters wait outside before entering to vote.\n\nOfficials expected low overall turnout, but saw records in mail-ballots and early voting. State Board of Elections spokesperson Matt Dietrich said if this were a normal year, they would have expected turnout to approach the 47% the state had in 2016. Dietrich pointed to the 33% average across the past five presidential primaries instead. The combination of the early vote and returned ballots account for 10% of registered voter turnout.\n\nThe Chicago Board of Elections and Governor J.B. Pritzker played a bit of the blame game, after Allen said in a morning call that they requested a move to mandatory mail ballots but that it was rejected by the governor.\n\nWe have a health order from the state not to have gatherings of 50 or more people, can you please reconcile that with having an election? Allen said on the call.\n\nPritzker took a moment to respond in a daily coronavirus press briefing, saying that he offered aid from the National Guard and a group of volunteers, but that that was rejected by the Chicago board. There are people out there today who want to say, 'Oh, it's a crisis, bend the rules and overstep your authority.' Let me tell you this, it is exactly in times like these, when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else, Pritzker said.\n\nIt is not a time for games. It's not a time for political posturing. It's not a time to complain that you're being asked to do uncomfortable things, to make hard choices to go above and beyond in your responsibilities.\n\nOHIO\n\nPolls did not open in Ohio Tuesday after the state health director backed by the governor and secretary of state ordered all polling locations to be closed, citing a health emergency. In a statement, Governor Mike DeWine said the state was facing an unprecedented public health crisis and to conduct an election would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says the move came Monday night just hours after a county judge rejected a lawsuit calling for the state's March 17 primary to be postponed, but overnight, the Ohio Supreme Court upheld the decision to keep polling places closed Tuesday after a complaint was filed by a candidate for county court to have the primary move forward March 17. On Tuesday, Boards of Elections posted signs at polling locations letting voters know voting had been postponed. It's now slated to take place on June 2. As directed by the secretary of state's office, the boards of elections will process absentee ballot applications postmarked by May 26, and returned ballots must be postmarked by June 1.\n\nMeanwhile, while the Democratic Party of Ohio said in a statement that holding the primary election on Tuesday would have been impossible given the chaos, confusion and mixed messages of the past 24 hours. The party is calling for the primary to conclude before June 2. Extending for that long is highly problematic for any number for reasons, and it is not at all clear that in-person voting will be possible on that date anyway, read the statement. The state Democratic Party is now calling for expanded vote-by-mail, making sure absentee ballots are widely available, include pre-paid postage, are counted and there is an option for secure curbside absentee ballot drop off, among other efforts to comply with laws protecting voting rights.\n\nMORE DELAYS\n\nMARYLAND\n\nMaryland is joining a growing list of states across the country that are delaying elections amid fears over the spread of the coronavirus, report CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson. In a press conference Tuesday, Republican Governor Larry Hogan announced a proclamation to move the state's primary elections from April 28 to June 2. He said his two main priorities are keeping Maryland's people safe and protecting their constitutional right to vote. Maryland is the fifth state to delay its presidential primary, following the decisions of Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Ohio. Mr. Hogan said he expects more states to make similar decisions in response to coronavirus. There is one exception to Hogan's proclamation. He said the special election for Congressman Elijah Cummings' seat in Maryland's seventh congressional district scheduled for April 28 will go forward using a vote-by-mail program.\n\nPUERTO RICO\n\nThe Puerto Rican Senate approved the Democratic party's request to postpone their primary from March 29 to April 26, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In a release, Charles Rodriguez, chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico, said Governor Wanda Vazquez has indicated she will sign the bill as soon as it reaches her desk. Rodriguez told CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson that Puerto Rico House of Representatives will convene on Thursday, and that the governor will have the bill late Thursday evening or Friday.\n\nPOLLING STATUS\n\nAs a number of states postpone primaries and other state officials continue to monitor the situation, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is urging the remaining primary states to protect the health of voters by implementing a number of steps including vote by mail. As our country deals with the uncertainty of coronavirus, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters, Perez said in a statement. States can provide easy access to voting while still taking necessary precautions to protect the health and safety of the American people. Along with pushing for vote by mail, CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says Perez also suggested no-excuse absentee voting where voters can drop off their ballots at a convenient location or in the mail. He's also calling for the days and hours of voting to be expanded where in-person voting can still take place to cut down on lines.\n\nMeanwhile, Perez slammed Ohio's late night primary postponement, echoing the state Democratic party by saying Monday night only led to more chaos and confusion. He said the Ohio state party is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote and argued that other states should make it easier to vote rather than moving primaries to later in the election season where there could be continued uncertainty. So far, five states have postponed primaries to dates in May and June. Perez said the DNC said it will work with state parties around their delegate selection plans so that states can elect their delegates to the national convention once they are allocated.\n\nON THE $$$\n\nAD SPENDING\n\nCBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster says Biden and Sanders have spent more than $100 million on advertising during the 2020 Democratic primary, but neither candidate currently has advertising buys scheduled beyond today, according to Kantar/CMAG data. Sanders, who has spent $73,810,697, was scheduled to spend $97,245 on broadcast and cable television in Georgia today. Georgia's primary was scheduled to take place on Tuesday, March 24, but Georgia's Secretary of State recently postponed the primary to May 19 due to coronavirus. Biden does not have any advertising booked Tuesday or moving forward and Unite The Country, a super PAC supporting Biden, currently does not have any scheduled advertising buys.\n\nCHECK PLEASE!\n\nAt a White House Press Conference today, the Trump administration advocated for sending immediate cash payments directly to Americans, part of an historic $850 billion economic stimulus package originating in Congress and aimed at quelling economic fallout from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. We're looking at sending checks to Americans immediately, Mnuchin told reporters on Tuesday. And I mean now, in the next two weeks. Lawmakers, including Senator Mitt Romney, have proposed immediately sending $1,000 checks to each American. It was the topic of discussion during a Monday night meeting between Romney and Mnuchin. Mnuchin has not endorsed a specific dollar amount for check payments, suggesting that there might be cash payment cut-off for higher-income earning households. I think it's clear we don't need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks, Mnuchin said during the White House press conference.\n\nBefore the worldwide coronavirus crisis, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says presidential candidate Andrew Yang proposed granting every adult American monthly payments of $1,000, turning the concept of Universal Basic Income into a household name for many. Yang tweeted Tuesday that his team has been in touch with the White House and is offering up resources. It's unfortunate to see this development take place under the current circumstances, but this is exactly what Universal Basic Income is designed to do-- offer a way to ensure that Americans can make ends meet when they need it most, Yang said in a statement released by Humanity First, his Super PAC. I look forward to monitoring the developments of the White House as they consider methods of distribution, and both me and my team are eager to offer our support to ensure this process runs as smoothly as possible, the statement continued. My hope is that these checks extend beyond this period of dire need in order to prepare us for any future crises and the continued transformation of our economy and our society.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nQUARANTINED CAMPAIGNS\n\nSeveral Senate campaigns have announced they are suspending campaign activities to mitigate the threat of the coronavirus, but several campaigns are also using their infrastructure to help out others during the outbreak, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Congressman Joe Kennedy, who is challenging incumbent Senator Ed Markey in the Democratic primary in Massachusetts, announced Monday night that he will be using his campaign email list to fundraise for organizations in Massachusetts and across the country that are working to provide relief. Republican Senator Joni Ernst, who is up for reelection in November, has encouraged her supporters to call or text five people to check in and make sure they're doing OK. Democratic Senator Gary Peters in Michigan has asked supporters to donate to state food banks instead of his campaign, and Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is running in the Democratic primary to challenge Republican Senator David Perdue in Georgia in November, released a public health video Tuesday afternoon with his wife, who is a doctor, about the need to implement social distancing.\n\nOn the House side, candidates involved in Tuesday races have had to adapt their Get Out the Vote efforts due to the pandemic, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In Illinois' 3rd district, Democrat challenger Marie Newman encouraged people to join a remote phone bank to encourage others to vote. It's going to look a little different than it has in past years. We won't have volunteers knocking on doors or organizing large groups to go to the polls -- and that's the way it should be right now, a Newman email to supporters read. That means we're counting on people like you all the more. A consultant for a Republican congressional candidate in Illinois' 14th district told Navarro they've had to cancel their election watch night party, and will only have essential staff in a room to monitor results. It's a very bizarre election day for me, having been a part of a bunch of these, they said.\n\nMaryland's 7th district special election for the former seat of late-Congressman Elijah Cummings will remain on April 28, despite the Presidential race being moved to June 2. The caveat is that all ballots for this race will be cast by mail. Democrat Kweisi Mfume, who previously represented this district, and Republican Kimberly Klacik are both looking to win and serve out the rest of Cummings' term. Though this district leans heavily Democratic, Klacik tweeted that the mandatory mail ballots means our chances of flipping this seat red just increased.\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nIn California, former Congressman Duncan Hunter was sentenced 11 months in federal prison on Tuesday, after he previously plead guilty to misusing campaign funds, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. It's an end to a long case that began before he was re-elected in 2018, and involved campaign funds being used for vacations, tickets and affairs Hunter was having. Hunter previously served as Congressman for the state's 50th district, encompassing much of San Diego County. He resigned in January, with his former Democratic challenger Ammar Campa-Najjar and former California Congressman Darrell Issa running to fill the spot.\n\nTwo primary races to watch for Tuesday night in Illinois are in the Chicago collar suburban counties. In Illinois' 3rd district, progressive candidate Marie Newman is trying to beat an incumbent Blue Dog Democrat, Congressman Dan Lipinski. Newman came within 2.2 points in 2018, and has received the support of groups like EMILY's List and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Lipinski is pretty conservative on some social issues, most notably abortion, which has drawn the ire of pro-choice groups like EMILY's List, but has held this southwest Chicago suburb district since 2004 and always handily wins against any Republican candidate.\n\nIn Illinois' 14th district, seven Republican candidates are looking to flip the district back red, after Democratic Congresswoman Lauren Underwood pulled off the upset in 2018 and beat Republican Randy Hultgren. Perennial state politics candidate Jim Oberweis has loaned $1 million to his campaign, though financial trader Ted Gradel has the advantage in terms of cash on hand. State Senators Sue Rezin and businesswoman Catalina Lauf are also running for this district, though there will be no runoff as the one with the majority of the votes will win outright.\n\nISSUES THAT MATTER\n\nVOTING RIGHTS\n\nMore than 200 organizations have signed on to a letter urging Congress and state elected officials to protect voting rights amid the evolving 2020 primary and general election schedule, according to CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion. At least five states have postponed their primaries due to the coronavirus outbreak. The coalition calls for allowing online voter registration in all states, extending voter registration deadlines, expanding early voting and making mail-in ballots available to all registered voters. It also recommends state and local officials identify polling locations that protect vulnerable communities but also ensure access for minority voters, voters with disabilities and students. Indeed, the very purpose of these policy recommendations is to provide guidance on how each state can administer their elections without disenfranchising any of our fellow citizens, said the groups. We are in a state of national crisis now; that is why it's all the more important that we band together to safeguard both our health and our democracy. The letter was initiated by The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nLIFE AFTER 2020\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG\n\nBillionaire and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg will be making another sizable donation to a political organization Tuesday, CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry reports. Bloomberg is donating $2 million to Swing Left, a national grassroots organization consisting of over a million volunteers and donors with the goal of flipping seats from red to blue. I'm glad to help Swing Left continue the work of organizing voters in those states. Bloomberg said in a statement. When supporters wanted to donate to our campaign, I suggested they instead give to groups like Swing Left — because whoever the nominee is, Swing Left can help us achieve our goal: Defeating Donald Trump, electing Democrats up and down the ballot, and getting our country back on track. Since he ended his presidential campaign, Bloomberg has announced several donations through Bloomberg Philanthropies to organizations that range from registering people of color to vote to combating coronavirus. Last week, his charitable organization announced it would spend $40 million to fight the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThis election cycle Swing Left Executive Director and Co-Chair Ethan Todras-Whitehill welcomed the cash infusion, saying that defeating President Trump will require everyone's support. In 2020, the organization plans to focus its energy and efforts on the grassroots of 12 Super States: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.\n\nThere's no time to wait, which is why we're organizing now to support eventual Democratic candidates in their general election battles. Todras-Whitehill said in a statement. This donation and others like it will help Swing Left continue to fulfill our mission of making it as easy as possible for everyone to have maximum impact on the most important elections up and down the ballot — from wherever you live. Bloomberg has already spent over $500 million during this campaign cycle, and this is not the first election cycle he's investing heavily in. Bloomberg spent millions of his personal fortune in the 2018 midterm elections. While he ran for president, Bloomberg would often say that he helped flipped 21 House seats that proved to be consequential in helping House Speaker Nancy Pelosi regain control of the House and rise to Speaker.
Hundreds of migrant children who crossed the U.S. southern border alone after their families were required to wait in Mexico under a Trump administration policy are being denied legal safeguards established by Congress, lawyers told a federal court Thursday.\n\nSince instituting its Migrant Protection Protocols program in early 2019, the Trump administration has required roughly 70,000 non-Mexican asylum-seekers, including families with children, to wait for their U.S. court hearings in northern Mexico, which includes areas the State Department warns Americans not to visit due to widespread crime and violence.\n\nCiting conditions in tent camps, insecurity in Mexican border towns and overall desperation, some migrant parents enrolled in the program have allowed their children to present themselves to U.S. border officials without them, since minors who are processed as unaccompanied can't be returned to Mexico under U.S. policy and law. Many of the children have other family members in the U.S. willing to care for them.\n\nAccording to government data obtained by CBS News, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency responsible for housing unaccompanied children, has housed 701 minors whose parents were in Mexico under the MPP program. Most — 643 of them — have been released to family members in the U.S.\n\nOnce they reached U.S. soil in late 2019 from Honduras, Modesto and his 15-year-old son were returned to Matamoros, Mexico, where they lived for months in the squalid tent city there, the largest migrant camp along the southern border. Modesto said they lived a cruel life in the camp.\n\nHe would tell me, 'Dad, I can't stand it anymore. I suffer here. I'm hungry. I can't study. We don't live well here, and I feel desperate. I want to be in the U.S.,' said Modesto, who asked for his surname to be omitted because he has an ongoing U.S. immigration case.\n\nModesto said he could barely provide for his son in Mexico.\n\nAfter a year in Matamoros, Modesto said he allowed his son to present himself to U.S. border officials as an unaccompanied minor last November, hoping that his son would be able to live with Modesto's sister in Texas. He called it a very difficult choice.\n\nIt still hurts a lot, but I'm always thinking about his future, Modesto said. We adults have to make hard decisions.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the Justice Action Center and other groups in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday said the Trump administration is seeking to deport children like Modesto's son while many of their parents remain in northern Mexico. Doing so, the lawsuit argued, violates a patchwork of legal protections for unaccompanied children.\n\nChildren play between tents at a makeshift migrant camp in Matamoros, Tamaulipas state, Mexico, on Sunday, March 1, 2020. Bloomberg\n\nU.S. law shields unaccompanied minors from expedited deportations and requires the government to connect them with lawyers and child advocates while they are housed in shelters overseen by the refugee agency, which is charged with releasing them to family members willing to sponsor them.\n\nThese minors are entitled to seek asylum through child-sensitive interviews with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, rather than in an adversarial courtroom proceeding with a judge and a government attorney who seeks their deportation. If they lose their case, they can apply for asylum a second time before an immigration judge. They may also request visas for victims of parental neglect, abuse or abandonment.\n\nThe government has argued that children who received a removal order alongside their family under the Remain-in-Mexico program can be quickly deported after re-entering the U.S. as unaccompanied minors. But advocates believe these children should be afforded the safeguards offered to other unaccompanied minors, arguing they did not get a fair day in court while waiting in Mexico.\n\nThese children seeking safety deserve the protection, compassion and care that our government should, in theory, provide, Natalia Trotter, an attorney for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services who is representing Modesto's son, told CBS News. The fact that this administration has allowed children to be in this chaotic situation is disgraceful.\n\nClara, a Los Angeles resident who also asked for her surname to be omitted because of an active immigration case, has been caring for her 12-year-old grandson since his mother allowed him to present himself to U.S. border agents alone last year. He has not seen his mother, who remains in the migrant encampment in Matamoros, for more than a year.\n\nThere are many factors that lead him to not live a happy life, like a normal child. We try to give him all the support, but find him constantly sad, Clara said of her grandson. He misses his mom. He has that uncertainty over whether he will see his mother.\n\nAccording to Thursday's lawsuit, the 12-year-old child and his mother fled Honduras in 2019 after gangs threatened the boy. While traveling through Mexico, they were kidnapped and held for ransom until they managed to escape. They were returned to Mexico when they reached U.S. soil, and remained for months in Matamoros, where Clara said the family feared being kidnapped again.\n\nAt the young age of eleven, A. Doe had already experienced far more violence than any child should, the lawsuit reads, using a pseudonym for the boy. Knowing that she would be unable to protect him from the gangs who had already targeted him in Honduras and from the violence of Matamoros, A. Doe's mother made the difficult decision to send her son across the border alone.\n\nThe group Human Rights First has compiled more than 1,300 reports of murder, rape, kidnapping, torture and assault against migrants returned by the U.S. to Mexico.\n\nA member of the Red Cross takes the temperature of a Central American migrant outside La 72 migrant shelter in the town of Tenosique, Tabasco state, Mexico, on Sunday, Oct. 4, 2020. Bloomberg\n\nAccording to the lawsuit and lawyers, the U.S. government has sought to deport Modesto's son and Clara's grandson based on their previous cases in the Remain-in-Mexico policy. Through the lawsuit, advocates hope to require the government to offer all unaccompanied children the protections Congress created for them, regardless of whether they were previously waiting in Mexico with their families.\n\nThe Trump administration has hailed the Remain-in-Mexico program as its signature border policy, arguing that it stemmed U.S.-bound migration from Central America and allowed U.S. officials to weed out non-meritorious or fraudulent asylum claims.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. border officials have placed fewer asylum-seekers in the program, as most migrants, including unaccompanied children, have been rapidly expelled without a court hearing under an emergency measure authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because of a court order in November, U.S. officials are currently barred from expelling unaccompanied minors.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has pledged to discontinue the Remain-in-Mexico policy, but his advisers have cautioned doing so will take time, given the ongoing pandemic. His transition team has also not indicated what will happen to the cases of an estimated 23,000 migrants who remain in northern Mexico.\n\nAdvocates are urging the incoming administration to reprocess these migrants and allow them to make their case for asylum or other relief from deportation in the U.S. Meeth Soni, a lawyer for the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said children who entered the U.S. alone after being required to wait in Mexico with their parents should also be protected from quick deportations after Inauguration Day.\n\nWhat's at stake is the long-standing commitment we have made to protect vulnerable children from being summarily and unfairly deported to countries where they face danger, exploitation, and trafficking, Soni said. The Biden administration cannot turn their backs on them.\n\nAfter being released from government custody earlier this month, Modesto's son is now living with his aunt in Texas. Modesto said his son appears happy and well-fed during video calls. But the Honduran father said he misses his son dearly, noting he's never been separated from him.\n\nModesto remains in the Matamoros tent camp, waiting to see if his fortunes change under a new U.S. administration.\n\nWe never expected to experience so much suffering on this border, that this program would cause so much harm, he said. Not just to us, but to every migrant.
Women who say they were sexually assaulted by a New York obstetrician are demanding Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance resign over his handling of the case. One of those who's spoken out about the doctor's alleged abuse is Evelyn Yang, wife of Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang.\n\nShe said in a CNN interview January 16 that Dr. Robert Hadden sexually assaulted her under the guise of conducting an internal exam for her pregnancy at Columbia's NewYork-Presbyterian hospital in 2012.\n\nHadden was charged in 2014 on allegations of assault involving six women, but prosecutors indicated at the time that they intended to include accusations dating back two decades from more than a dozen others.\n\nInstead, in 2016 he agreed to plead guilty to two individual counts of criminal sex act in the third degree and forcible touching. In exchange for his guilty plea and forfeiting his medical license, prosecutors dropped all other charges and agreed not to pursue cases related to other alleged victims. The plea deal also included a stipulation downgrading his sex offender status to the lowest level — meaning he is not listed in New York State's online sex offender registry.\n\nHadden did not serve a day in jail or prison.\n\nThe case led to a 2018 lawsuit against Columbia University that initially included 17 women, and now involves dozens more. Two of the plaintiffs said they were assaulted when they were 15 and 16 years old, at their first gynecological examinations. In the lawsuit, Hadden is accused of a lengthy list of sexual abuses, including licking and digitally penetrating his patients' vaginas without gloves, and fondling their breasts and anuses, all under the pretense of performing medical examinations.\n\nAt a press conference in front of New York's City Hall Thursday, Marissa Hoechstetter, who has accused Hadden of assaults during her pregnancy with twins in 2012, said Yang's case highlights problems with how Vance's office and Columbia handled the case.\n\nOne assault allegation was reported to police about six weeks before Yang's incident. Hadden was handcuffed while at his office and interviewed by police, but allowed to return to work. It would be more than two years before he was indicted.\n\nPolice knew and the D.A. knew and Columbia knew and they let it happen. They let him go back to work, said Hoechstetter, who is the founder of Reform the Sex Crimes Unit, an advocacy group.\n\nNew York City Council Member Carlina Rivera said the case fits a pattern that has led to withering criticism of how Vance's office has handled high-profile sexual assault suspects. She pointed to the district attorney's handling of cases involving disgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein, and the deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nVance's office declined to charge Weinstein in 2015 after model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez wore a police wire to record Weinstein discussing an alleged assault. After dozens of women accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct in explosive media exposés, Vance's office charged him in May 2018 in connection with two other allegations of rape and sexual assault. His trial on those charges is now underway.\n\nIn a different case involving Jeffrey Epstein, a judge expressed shock in 2011 when a prosecutor from Vance's office argued that Epstein should have been given the lowest level sex offender status — the same status later given to Hadden.\n\nUnder Cy Vance's leadership, the Manhattan DA's office and specifically their sex crimes unit and special victims bureau failed to protect and fight for survivors against rich, white and powerful men who committed countless sexual assaults. It is time that Cy Vance resign, Rivera said.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Vance did not address the calls for his resignation, but defended the sex crimes unit, which he said  fights day in and day out for survivors of sex crimes — helping them to obtain justice, vital services, and critical public policy changes — irrespective of the wealth, power, or race of their assailants.\n\nOur record of success makes clear that our career prosecutors do not shrink from the challenge of prosecuting powerful men, Vance said.\n\nHe added that he supports the victims of Hadden, calling the doctor a serial sexual predator.\n\nAt the protest Thursday, Hadden's accusers said they want other allegations against the doctor to be given a fresh look by a new prosecutor. Dayna Solomon, who said she was abused by the doctor over the course of nine years as a patient, said Vance had a moral obligation to seek a harsher punishment against Hadden.\n\nIf Cyrus Vance's priority was to protect people he would have taken that moral action that was so painfully clear, and so obvious and so warranted, she said.
DECORAH, Iowa – With four days until Monday's Iowa caucuses, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nButtigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. His attacks on Biden and Sanders come as recent polls show him lagging behind Biden and Sanders, albeit narrowly.\n\nI hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said Thursday at a town hall in Decorah. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.\n\nButtigieg then pivoted to Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors Medicare for All and free college tuition at public universities. Buttigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating Sanders would be a risk at a time when Democrats are desperate to reclaim the White House from President Trump.\n\nI hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts, Buttigieg continued. And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.\n\nButtigieg has remained in the top tier of Democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. The most recent Des Moines Register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely Iowa caucus-goers while Sanders was the first choice of 20%. The same poll in November found Buttigieg leading the Democratic field in the state with 25% support.\n\nThe millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to show versus tell that he's the best candidate to face Mr. Trump with strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on February 11th. He hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in Nevada and South Carolina, where is currently polling well behind Sanders and Biden.\n\nWhile maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, Buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between Sanders and Biden over Social Security. The Vermont senator has accused Biden of being open to cutting Social Security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.\n\nThis is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before, Buttigieg said. The less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better.\n\nAfter his town hall in Decorah, Buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for.\n\nWe're competing, Buttigieg told reporters. It's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. I admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win.
NJ casino can regulate how much waitresses we...\n\nATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- New Jersey's highest court says an Atlantic City casino can regulate how much its cocktail waitresses weigh.\n\nThe Press of Atlantic City reports the state Supreme Court on Thursday denied the Borgata Babes' request to review the case.\n\nAn appeals court in September had upheld a 2013 ruling that the Borgata casino's personal appearance standards are lawful.\n\nThe court said that an element of performance and a public appearance component were part of the described Borgata Babe position.\n\nThe casino has fired two Borgata Babes over the years for violating the policy, which prohibits servers from gaining or losing more than 7 percent of their body weight.\n\nThe casino's attorney says it's pleased with the decision.
President Donald Trump has always linked illegal immigration to the southern border and the need for a wall. On Thursday — the 13th day of a government shutdown tied to the issue — Mr. Trump tweeted a video called crisis on the border depicting rioting migrants trying to rush into the country.\n\nBut only one-third of the recent undocumented immigrant population came to the United States through the southern border, according to the Center for Migration Studies (CMS), a New York City-based think tank. The rest came legally on work visas and stayed after they expired, according to CMS.\n\nIn other words, a wall wouldn't have kept them out.\n\nAccording to CMS, about 42 percent of the 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. in 2014 — the most recent year for which data was available — were doing so on expired visas. As the southern border has hardened, that number is estimated to have risen to over half, Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. Programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said.\n\nThe fight over a border wall is a typical issue of 'fighting the last war': ten years ago was the fight against Mexican migration to the U.S., Capps said in a telephone interview with CBS News. The problem isn't Mexican migration anymore. Now the immigration problem is overstayers, not border crossers.\n\nThe undocumented immigrant population hit a 12-year low in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, almost entirely due to a sharp drop in unauthorized border crossings by Mexican nationals, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew estimated that the unauthorized Mexican immigrant population decreased by 22 percent since its peak in 2007.\n\nOver a five-year period ending 2016, a little over half a million Mexicans illegally entered the U.S. through the southern border. That was down from 2.05 million during five years ending 2007, according to Pew.\n\nWhile there has been an increase in Central American migrants arriving at the southern border recently, a vast majority have claimed asylum, a legal mode of immigration, said Capps.\n\nMr. Trump has made immigration, specifically a border wall, a signature piece of his administration's priorities. While there have been some measures to rein in visa overstays since Mr. Trump was sworn into office, the changes have been less resource-draining.\n\nOne such change is that Immigration Customs and Enforcement now emails visa holders to warn them that their legal residency is about to expire, said Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group that supports policy which admits fewer immigrants.\n\nIt'll make people think twice about staying, Vaughan said in a telephone interview with CBS News. I think it'll help.\n\nIn the year ending September 30, 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, about 700,000 foreigners were living in the U.S. on visas that had expired in the prior 12 months, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security. The agency estimated that about 15 percent of those have since left the country, but the rest remain in the U.S. as undocumented immigrants. 2017 was only the second year that DHS reported the overstay figure.\n\nLike most other immigration data points, pinpointing the total undocumented population and how they arrived in the U.S. is equal parts art and science, Vaughan said. Using deportation data from ICE, which tracks how immigrants arrive in the U.S., Vaughan estimates that visa overstays comprise somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of the undocumented immigration population.\n\nBoth modes of entry are a big problem, said Vaughan.
The Cincinnati mayor said he will introduce legislation requiring mandatory bias sensitivity training following the release of body camera footage showing officers using a racial slur during two separate police calls last year. The new training would be required for all all city employees, including police officers, and would cover both explicit and implicit bias, Mayor John Cranley announced Friday.\n\nWe need to set a clear moral tone as to what's right and wrong, and using the N-word is wrong, Cranley said during a press conference Friday. It's racist, and we won't stand for it.\n\nCranley said that in light of recent events, we need a refresher on that.\n\nCincinnati police on New Year's Eve released bodycam video from the two incidents. The latest, recorded Dec. 22, shows officer Dennis Barnette, who is white, using the slur while attempting to arrest a black woman during a confrontation at a Roselawn nightclub. In the video, the woman can be seen yelling that someone hit her inside the club. The officer tells her to be quiet, and the confrontation escalates. A scuffle ensues and the camera is knocked to the ground. Police later said the woman pushed the officer.\n\nBarnette is heard saying, That n****r slapped me in the face! The woman responds, What the f*** did you just say?\n\nThe Cincinnati NAACP said it was investigating the matter and has called for Barnette to resign or be terminated.\n\nThe word used is hateful, and coming from someone with the authority to use deadly force, is dangerous to those whom he is sworn to serve and protect, the group said in a statement. Officer Barnette's actions disgraced not only him but the department and city that employ him.\n\nIn a separate Sept. 26 incident, officer Donte Hill is heard using the same racial slur as he responds to a domestic call. Hill encountered a group of intoxicated people and used a Taser on a man who was fighting with someone else, reports CBS affiliate WKRC. Hill is heard on body camera video saying, This is f****** stupid. I told you to f*** walk off, didn't I? That f****** alcohol got you n*****s acting stupid.\n\nBarnette had his police powers suspended in the wake of the Dec. 22 incident. Cincinnati police chief Eliot Isaac initially gave Hill, who is African-American, a reprimand. However, Hill was also placed on desk duty last week after Isaac wrote in a memo to City Manager Patrick Duhaney that Hill's behavior was as egregious as Barnette's, WKRC reports.\n\nUnder a revised city non-discrimination policy enacted in October, use of the racial slur by a city employee is punishable by 40 hours of suspension without pay, Duhaney said Friday. The employee would also be required to undergo re-training and would be eligible for termination upon a second offense.\n\nCincinnati police are conducting an internal investigation of the incidents involving both Barnette and Hill. Isaac said Friday that the results of the investigation are expected shortly. Both officers would be subject to the 40-hour suspension and re-training if the allegations that they violated city policy are sustained, Isaac said. The officers would have the right to appeal.\n\nAs the leader of this organization, I apologize that that word was ever used, Isaac said. I know the significance of it -- I've felt that sting both personally and professionally. I take it personally. It won't be tolerated.\n\nIsaac said Friday he supports the efforts of the mayor and city manager to implement bias sensitivity training for all city employees. Cranley says he'll introduce the legislation next week to City Council's Law and Public Safety Committee.\n\nThe department was already under scrutiny after officer Kevin Brown tased an 11-year-old black girl suspected of shoplifting from a Cincinnati grocery store in August after she tried to run away. Brown, who was working off-duty security detail at the store, is heard on bodycam video telling the child, You know what, sweetheart, this is why there's no grocery stores in the black community, because of all this going on.\n\nThe department reportedly determined that Brown, who is also African American, violated four department policies, including making prejudiced comments and not warning the girl he was going to use the stun gun. He was handed down a punishment that included a seven-day suspension from duty and a two-month suspension from working outside police-related details, City Beat reported.\n\nCincinnati police union president Dan Hils defended Brown's statement to the girl, WKRC reported.\n\nThis was nothing more than an African-American police officer talking to the girl in a fatherly way, Hils said.\n\nIt marked the second time Brown has been accused of making inappropriate comments while on duty, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer, which said he was previously written up for using a homophobic slur in reference to a domestic violence victim.
NEW YORK -- Mets reliever Jenrry Mejia has become the first player to receive a lifetime ban under baseball's drug agreement after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance for the third time.\n\nThe commissioner's office said Friday that Mejia tested positive for Boldenone, which athletes have used to increase muscle mass and once was popular for use in horse racing.\n\nThe 26-year-old was the Mets' closer before he was suspended for 80 games last April 11 following a positive test for Stanozolol, a drug popular among bodybuilders. At the time, he said, I can honestly say I have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system.\n\nHe returned July 12, appeared in seven games for New York, then was banned for 162 games on July 28 after a positive test for Stanozolol and Boldenone.\n\nI think not surprisingly there's a tremendous amount of disappointment, I think to some extent, anger, to some extent, amazement that this could happen so soon after a previous suspension was completed, Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said then. This is the consequence of making bad choices.\n\nMejia's 162-game suspension had matched the longest under the big league program, a year-long ban served by the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez in 2014 that originally was 211 games before an arbitrator reduced it.\n\nMajor league players and teams agreed in November 2005 that a third positive test for PEDs would result in a lifetime ban. No players have been banned for life under the rules, which were put in place under pressure from Congress to toughen their drug program.\n\nMejia has spent parts of five seasons with the Mets. His breakout campaign came in 2014, when he appeared in 63 games and posted a 3.65 ERA and 28 saves. The Dominican right-hander signed with the organization in 2007.\n\nThe Mets and Mejia had just agreed last month to a one-year, $2.47 million contract.\n\nWe were deeply disappointed to hear that Jenrry has again violated Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program,the Mets said in a statement reported by CBS New York. We fully support MLB's policy toward eliminating performance enhancing substances from the sport. As per the Joint Drug Program, we will have no further comment on this suspension.\n\nMejia may apply one year from now to baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred for reinstatement, and Manfred at his discretion has the power to let Mejia back in baseball - but no earlier than for the 2018 season.\n\nIf an application is made and denied, Mejia could ask baseball's arbitrator to end the ban, claiming the penalty is without just cause. The arbitrator cannot reduce the ban to less than two years.
Des Moines — Faced with a bounty of potential candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, party voters appear to be putting a premium on electability, a signal of a more strategic approach to the selection process.\n\nInterviews with voters and strategists show a baseline for support coming into focus for 2020: Can this candidate beat President Trump?\n\nI didn't know it was that bad to lose, said Des Moines resident Debbie Whittie, who came to check out one of Elizabeth Warren's events over the weekend. Whittie, who works for a credit union, says she is more engaged in political news than ever before. I'm already worried about that, she said when asked about electability. I really think I should go for 'the best,' but that consideration is going to have to be in my best.\n\nJeanne Williamson, another Des Moines resident and a Democratic caucus-goer, said she will be taking a hard look at how the candidates stand on various policies. But, That's my first reaction: to beat Trump, she said while standing in line to see Warren on a chilly Saturday evening.\n\nI would vote for anyone probably who could defeat Trump, said Sally Carney, another Iowa Democratic voter. Oh, it's the most important: get him out, said Cathy Sanchez, a preschool teacher who came to Warren's event in Council Bluffs. Bill Shackelford, a retiree, said he wants someone who is not subject to being characterized by the right wing and therefore vulnerable to defeat by Mr. Trump. Don't underestimate him, he said of the president.\n\nPeople are going to want to see how the person can match up to Trump, said Mike Vlacich, a New Hampshire Democratic strategist who managed Hillary Clinton's campaign in the state. Voters are going to try to visualize this person on a debate stage with Trump and on social media and ask, does this person have what it takes?\n\nIn that way, a voter is going to be a little more of a political scientist, Vlacich said, and less interested in sending messages or proving points, but making sure we have what it takes to win the White House back.\n\nWho that candidate will be is anyone's guess at this point. And voters had varying views about how to beat Trump, whether it be through character and policy contrasts, inspiration and passion, or adopting the incumbent's own tactics. But the sentiment is driving interest and attendance at political events at this early stage in the cycle. And the prospect of taking Mr. Trump on is attracting what is expected to be the largest Democratic field in two decades.\n\nFor the last generation, [when] there has been such an overwhelming presence of individuals on the Democratic side, a lot of Democrats didn't see a path to victory, said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley. Donald Trump has convinced every single person on every street corner in America that they could do a better job as president.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney are the only candidates who have so far made official moves towards presidential bids. But several others are at least seriously considering bids, including a number of incumbent senators, former mayors, businessmen, and a former vice president.\n\nElectability, though, is difficult to measure, particularly at this stage in the cycle. And perceived electability doesn't always equal success, as the 2016 election most recently demonstrated to Democrats. But the reaction among Democratic voters to the current president is so viscerally negative that it has become a unifying force in the party.\n\nSome Democrats are concerned about the official party operation getting too involved in picking who is the most electable. And the Democratic National Committee is making an effort to be as inclusive as possible, as evidenced by their debate schedule and overall strategy. Activists, too, acknowledge the concern about letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nThere's definitely a pragmatic streak. We're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater, said Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive activist group Democracy for America. No doubt defeating Donald Trump is the priority. But we have to be more than a party standing against Donald Trump. We have to stand for something.\n\nIn her stops through Iowa over the weekend, Warren did not mention Mr. Trump by name. Instead, she aimed to introduce herself to voters as a fighter for the middle class and for a fairer economic playing field. One voter asked why she gave Mr. Trump fodder to be a bully by releasing a DNA test, a signal that some may not like a candidate who plays the president's game. Others thought the approach showed a certain toughness, or didn't matter much to them at all.\n\nWarren has shown a propensity for sparring with Mr. Trump, particularly through his preferred medium of Twitter. But in Iowa, she made a point not to make the trip about him. She did, however, try to pitch herself as having a broader appeal beyond her current fan base.\n\nWe gotta stay focused on what matters to us. And what matters to us is that everybody gets a fighting chance, Warren said. You don't have to persuade people ... Democrats, Republicans and independents get it.
WASHINGTON — A prestigious scientific panel is recommending that states significantly lower their drunken driving thresholds as part of a blueprint to eliminate the entirely preventable 10,000 alcohol-impaired driving deaths in the United States each year.\n\nThe U.S. government-commissioned, 489-page report by a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released Wednesday throws the weight of the scientific body behind lowering the blood-alcohol concentration threshold from 0.08 to 0.05. All states have 0.08 thresholds. A Utah law passed last year that lowers the state's threshold to 0.05 doesn't go into effect until Dec. 30.\n\nThe amount of alcohol required to reach 0.05 would depend on several factors, including the person's size and whether the person has recently eaten. A 150-pound man might be over the 0.05 limit after two beers, while a 120-pound woman could exceed it after a single drink, according to the American Beverage Institute, a national restaurant group.\n\nThe panel also recommended that states significantly increase alcohol taxes and make alcohol less conveniently available, including reducing the hours and days alcohol is sold in stores, bars and restaurants. Research suggests a doubling of alcohol taxes could lead to an 11 percent reduction in traffic crash deaths, the report said.\n\nIt also calls for cracking down on sales to people under 21 or who are already intoxicated to discourage binge drinking, and putting limits on alcohol marketing while funding anti-alcohol campaigns similar to those against smoking.\n\nAll the proposals are likely to draw fierce opposition from the alcohol and restaurant industries. The beverage institute took out full-page newspaper ads opposing Utah's new law that featured a fake mugshot under a large headline reading, Utah: Come for vacation, leave on probation.\n\nThe recommendations in the academies' report would do nothing to deter repeat offenders and high BAC drivers, who represent the vast majority of alcohol-impaired driving deaths, the Distilled Spirits Council said in a statement. The council said it also doesn't support the report's recommendations for tax increases and advertising bans, which will have little or no impact on traffic safety.\n\nThe report points out that alcohol-impaired driving remains the deadliest and costliest danger on U.S. roads, accounting for 28 percent of traffic deaths. Each day, 29 people in the U.S. die in alcohol-related crashes and many more are injured. Forty percent of those killed are people other than the drunken driver.\n\nRural areas are disproportionately affected. In 2015, 48 percent of drunken driving fatalities occurred in rural areas.\n\nThe report says many strategies have been effective to prevent drunken driving, but a coordinated multilevel approach across multiple sectors will be required to accelerate change.\n\nThe problem isn't intractable, the report said.\n\nFrom the early 1980s to the early 2000s, there was significant progress as the result of an increase in the drinking age to 21, decreases in the blood-alcohol threshold, and other measures, the report said. But since then, progress has stagnated and recently has begun to reverse.\n\nAction to address drunken driving can't wait for the advent of self-driving cars immune to the lures of a cold beer or a fine wine — it will take too long for autonomous vehicles to replace all the human-driven machines on the road, said the panel's chairman, Steven Teutsch, a senior fellow for health policy and economics at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the meantime, we have 10,000 people a year dying and we ought to do something about it, he said.\n\nThe report cites studies that show the United States lags behind other high-income countries in preventing drunken driving fatalities. More than 100 countries have adopted the 0.05 threshold lower. In Europe, the share of traffic deaths attributable to drunken driving was reduced by more than half within 10 years after the standard was dropped, the National Transportation Safety Board said in 2013. The safety board has also recommended the 0.05 threshold.\n\nAlcoholic beverages have changed significantly over the past 25 years. They are more affordable, of far greater variety, and more widely advertised and promoted than in earlier periods, the report said. The lack of consistency in serving sizes and the combination of alcohol with caffeine and energy drinks make it harder for drinkers to estimate their level of impairment.\n\nThe report was commissioned by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which asked the academies to determine which strategies for reducing drunken driving have been proven effective.
President-elect Joe Biden has chosen Rohit Chopra to be the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, tapping a progressive ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren to helm the agency whose creation she championed. The pick comes as Democrats eye ways to provide student loan relief to millions of Americans as part of a COVID-19 relief package.\n\nChopra, now a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, helped launch the consumer agency after the 2008-09 financial crisis and served as deputy director, where he sounded the alarm about skyrocketing levels of student loan debt. Chopra previously served as assistant director of the CFPB, where he led the agency's efforts on student loans. He also served as a Special Advisor at the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nIn these roles, Chopra led efforts to spur competition in the student loan financing market, develop new tools for students and secure hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds for borrowers victimized by unlawful conduct by loan servicers, debt collectors, and for-profit college chains.\n\nBiden announced the move Monday, along with his intent to nominate Gary Gensler, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs banker, tightened oversight of the complex financial transactions that helped cause the Great Recession.\n\nBiden's choice of an expert with experience as a strong markets regulator during the financial crisis to lead the SEC signals a goal of turning the Wall Street watchdog agency toward an activist role after a deregulatory stretch during the Trump administration.\n\nConsumer advocates praised the selections of Gensler and Chopra.\n\nGary Gensler wasn't afraid to take on Wall Street as chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and will return the SEC to an agency that both protects small investors from risky practices and protects the financial system from dangerous actors, Ed Mierzwinski, senior director for federal consumer programs at consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG, said in a statement.\n\nGensler, now a professor of economics and management at MIT's Sloan School of Management, was an assistant Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and later headed the CFTC during Barack Obama's term.\n\nGensler was senior adviser to U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes in writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and was Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2001 and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999. With a background of having worked for nearly 20 years at Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs, Gensler surprised many by being a tough regulator of big banks as CFTC chairman.\n\nFluent in the nexus between politics and economic policy, Gensler was chief financial officer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign against Donald Trump and an economic adviser to Obama in his 2008 presidential bid.\n\nGensler has been a leader and adviser of Biden's transition team responsible for the Federal Reserve, banking issues and securities regulation.\n\nProtecting unsophisticated investors\n\nJay Clayton, a former Wall Street lawyer who headed the SEC during the Trump administration, presided over a deregulatory push to soften rules affecting Wall Street and the financial markets, as Trump pledged when he took office. Rules that under the Dodd-Frank law tightened the reins on banks and Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession were nipped in.\n\nGensler will tip the SEC away from making it easy for companies to raise money and toward protecting unsophisticated investors, said Erik Gordon, an assistant professor of business at the University of Michigan. His history in the Obama administration leaves him few friends on the Republican side — and he probably doesn't care.\n\nThe senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, said Gensler's receptiveness to new financial technologies and cryptocurrency are positive. But he added, I fear Democrats want to steer the (SEC) away from bipartisan common ground in an attempt to achieve their most partisan goals.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee who is set to become its chairman, said Gensler's record as a regulator demonstrates that he will hold bad actors accountable and put the interests of working families first.\n\nBrown said Chopra will return the CFPB to its central mission of protecting consumers and also will ensure the agency plays a leading role in combating racial inequities in our financial system.\n\nThe CFPB was created at Warren's behest as an independent agency by the Dodd-Frank law. Its director was given broad latitude to act alone, without winning agreement from members of an agency board.\n\nWhile it enforces consumer-protection laws, the CFPB also gained powers to scrutinize the practices of virtually any business selling financial products and services: credit card companies, payday lenders, mortgage servicers, debt collectors, for-profit colleges, auto lenders, money-transfer agents.\n\nOutspoken critic of Facebook\n\nThe CFPB became a keen target of conservative Republicans. Trump named then-White House budget director Mick Mulvaney as acting director of the CFPB when Cordray left in November 2017.\n\nMulvaney had been a vocal critic of the consumer agency and made deep changes to it, softening regulations on payday loans, for example, and pulling back on enforcement efforts. The agency has been led by Trump appointee Kathy Kraninger since December 2018.\n\nAs one of two Democratic commissioners on the five-member Federal Trade Commission, Chopra has been an outspoken critic of practices by big companies, especially tech giant Facebook. He has lodged strong dissents on FTC actions against the company for privacy violations and alleged anti-competitive conduct, saying they didn't go far enough.\n\nRohit Chopra has the ideal background for hitting the ground running at the CFPB, Mike Litt, consumer program advocate with the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, said in a statement. In his government service, he has used all policy levers available to protect consumers from corporate wrongdoers. We couldn't be happier with his selection to restore the CFPB after three years of disastrous leadership.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, @BernieSanders\n\n@BernieSanders HHS Secretary Alex Azar, @SecAzar\n\n@SecAzar Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, @SecPompeo\n\n@SecPompeo Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, @ScottGottliebMD\n\n@ScottGottliebMD Anthony Salvanto, CBS News Elections & Surveys Director, @SalvantoCBS\n\nCBS News Elections & Surveys Director, @SalvantoCBS Ed O'Keefe, CBS News Political Correspondent, @edokeefe\n\nClick here to browse full transcripts of Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington and this week on FACE THE NATION, the coronavirus has now claimed the life of an American within the U.S. and the number of infected has increased and now includes cases of unknown origin. Meanwhile, the Trump administration scrambles to calm fears of Americans concerned with the spread of coronavirus and its impact on the economy as the stock market has its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Plus, it's a big win for former Vice President Joe Biden in South Carolina. As the candidates head to Super Tuesday, can he stop Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders?\n\nJOE BIDEN: We are very much alive.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Former Vice President Joe Biden won South Carolina and won it big.\n\nJOE BIDEN: You launched Bill Clinton, Barack Obama to the presidency. Now you launched our campaign on the path to defeating Donald Trump. This campaign has taken off.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: With fourteen states up for grabs in just two days, Biden's victory gives a boost to establishment Democrats hoping to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: There are a lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders about the race.\n\nPlus, as the coronavirus crisis prompts questions of whether or not the U.S. is ready to handle a pandemic, the politics of preparedness becomes a big issue.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Now the Trump administration faces a crisis of its own: Calming and reassuring the American public.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are preparing for the worst. We are ready. We are ready.\n\nThis is no reason to panic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it's been a rough week of mixed messages and attacks on familiar targets.\n\nMICK MULVANEY: The press was-- was-- was-- was-- was-- was covering their-- their hoax of the day because they thought it would bring down the President.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. This is their new hoax.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb will both be here.\n\nThen the Trump administration signs a peace deal with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from that signing ceremony with the Taliban, and we will talk to him.\n\nAll that and more is just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It was a knockout win for former Vice President Joe Biden last night in the South Carolina primary. He got nearly half the vote coming in close to thirty points ahead over his closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here to tell us more. So, Anthony, how did Joe Biden do this?\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. Big keys for him. First of all, overwhelming support from black voters. That was key and they make up most of the electorate in South Carolina. That was really helped by an endorsement from Representative Jim Clyburn, the most influential African-American politician in the state, more saying that was important than not. And then, finally, big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat Donald Trump in November. The question now, Margaret, is can Joe Biden parlay that argument into Super Tuesday?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll get details and forecasts from you on Super Tuesday ahead, Anthony.\n\nWe turn now to Senator Bernie Sanders. He is on the campaign trail in Norfolk, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@BernieSanders/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this now a two-man race?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, all I can say is we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. We won the Nevada caucus. We lost last night. We're looking forward to Super Tuesday. I think we got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts, and a number of states around the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina is the first southern state. Does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like Virginia and-- and North Carolina? Will Joe Biden really challenge you there?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, Margaret, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty-six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Margaret, it is not only-- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a Super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires. What we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working-class people all across this country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that Michael Bloomberg has offered. He said he'd extend it to any party nominee. Do you really want to turn down his bankroll?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, Mister Bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his sixty billion dollars and that's legal. All I can say is at this point we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working-class and middle-class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you would accept it?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --whether conservative or progressive, is-- I didn't say that. What I would say--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, Margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you are a Democratic socialist. You have never officially entered the Democratic Party. In fact, you constantly criticize Democratic establishment. So, how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify Democrats and challenge President Trump?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, two points. I am a member of the Democratic leadership. I have been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress thirty years ago and from-- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats that have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, Margaret, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people who work eleven, twelve bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: They can't afford health care. They are scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump. And, by the way, almost all of the national polls out there, you know, I've had last seventy polls, sixty-five of them, I think, have us beating Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We're beating them in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. We can beat Trump.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota, and other states around the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool, or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid I spent time in Israel. I am not in-- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You got seventy percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we-- continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even-handed policy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel; I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you on foreign policy. The President just authorized a deal with the Taliban. What do you think of that? Because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I don't have enough details and the-- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the Afghan government. We don't know what's going to happen. One of the difficulties, to be very honest, Margaret, in dealing with Trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in Afghanistan. But it is my view that the United States and I-- I speak of somebody help lead the opposition to getting us into the war in Iraq. It is my view that we got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in America sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has not yet appeared on a ballot, but that will change Tuesday. He sat down with our Scott Pelley yesterday in an interview for tonight's 60 MINUTES. Here's a preview.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nSCOTT PELLEY (60 MINUTES): How do you view this emergency?\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG (60 MINUTES): I find it incomprehensible that the President would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did last night in South Carolina.\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: He-- he said the-- the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, we don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that if it is, we have the medicines and the structure, and the knowledge to deal with it.\n\n(End VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Scott's interview with Mayor Bloomberg will air tonight on 60 MINUTES.\n\nFACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at the growing fears over COVID-19, commonly referred to as the coronavirus. Last week the World Health Organization said the global risk of the virus spreading is now very high. Here in the U.S., there are now seventy-one cases of coronavirus and worldwide the death toll is almost three thousand. There are also concerns about the global economy. Here in the U.S., the stock market took its biggest hit last week since the 2008 financial crisis. We begin today with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Good to have you here.\n\nALEX AZAR (Secretary of Health and Human Services/@SecAzar): Glad to be here. Thank you for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So we just had the first American death on U.S. soil out in Washington State. What do we know about how the virus was contracted and how much it has spread?\n\nALEX AZAR: So this individual and we just want to express our sympathy, certainly for his family and for all who are suffering from the coronavirus, this individual was in the hospital out in Calif-- out-- out in Washington. We do not know how he contracted the virus, yet. And so that's why we and the State of Washington are deployed out there to try to trace who he had contact with and how he might have gotten the virus. That's why we call it right now a potential community case, meaning we don't have a discernible connection to any travel to Korea or China or any other impacted area.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, at this point, you don't know if this person came into contact with anyone. He just showed up sick at the hospital?\n\nALEX AZAR: We have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area. And so we do not know how he contracted the virus. That's really what we do. That's the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we're going to trace the people that he had contact with. We're going to trace the other cases. There is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital. And there are cases in that nursing home. But who spread to whom? We do not know yet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The President yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman. It is a man.\n\nALEX AZAR: It-- yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How is a mistake like that made? Because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust.\n\nALEX AZAR: Well, I understand that. It's a very fast-moving situation. Our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were up late at night, very earl-- early in the morning, working with the Washington state public health office and inaccurately recorded that the individual was a female. That's what the President was briefed on. They've apologized for incorrectly briefing on that. But it's a very fast-moving situation. Obviously, we regret the error.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Given that it is so fast moving, what are your projections now? How many Americans do you expect to come down with this virus?\n\nALEX AZAR: So what your viewers need to know is the risk to average Americans remains low. We are working to keep it low. We will see more transmission of cases in the United States. We've got the finest public health system in the world here. This is what we do. We cannot make predictions as to how many cases we'll have but we will have more and we will have more community cases. It's simply just a matter of math.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have to have a number you're working with in order to make sure that you have adequate supply, things like testing kits, right? So--\n\nALEX AZAR: We- we don't--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --how are we on shortages? You may not want to tell me the number, but you have one in your head--\n\nALEX AZAR: No we don't--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --you're using for planning.\n\nALEX AZAR: No we don't. We- we don't-- we do not use-- because it is an unknown, the epidemiological spread of this virus in a highly developed health care system that was on it with-- at the most aggressive containment measures in the history of the United States. It is unknown how that will spread. In terms of testing kits, we've already tested over thirty-six hundred people for the virus. We now have seventy-- the capability in-- out-- in the field to test seventy-five thousand people. And within the next week or two we'll have a radical expansion even beyond that of the testing that's available.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In Washington State, in places that have declared emergencies, even shutting down schools I mean they are projecting numbers themselves.\n\nALEX AZAR: They might make projections of numbers themselves, but we are not. We'll take aggressive public health measures. It's what we call community mitigation steps. So depending on the nature of the disease and depending on what we learn from these in the field investigations--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nALEX AZAR: --the state and local government will take measures appropriate to contain the spread of the disease.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So in France, they shut down the Louvre Museum. They're telling people, don't kiss, don't shake hands. In Japan, they're closing schools for a month. Canada's health minister told his people to start stockpiling food. In the U.S. there are closures, as we just said, in Washington and in Oregon. They've declared a state of emergency out there. And the CDC said this week, disruption to everyday life might be severe.\n\nALEX AZAR: Might. Might. That's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? I mean Americans hear this and they are concerned. There's about a two-percent fatality rate.\n\nALEX AZAR: And I-- I appreciate that people are concerned of that, and that-- that is why we're being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be. And that's why we say might be, but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps. Right now it's important for people to understand we're not advising any types of particular measures in the United States like travel restrictions or closures. State or local public health offices, which are the frontlines of response, might make their own decisions to do that. But, at this point, we do not have sufficient spread in the United States that would indicate those measures. But we're not taking any of them off the table. The full range of options will always remain on the table.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In a crisis you need public trust.\n\nALEX AZAR: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: An inspector general announced this week that they are looking into this complaint by a whistleblower that your agency did not provide adequate training or equipment to those workers who went to receive and welcome back Americans who had been evacuated from Wuhan, China. And those workers were not tested for the virus after they had that contact. Have you personally looked into these allegations?\n\nALEX AZAR: Yes, we are-- we are looking into these allegations. I am personally involved in doing so. First--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, can you say that this wasn't something that tipped off the spread on the West Coast?\n\nALEX AZAR: That is absolutely not the case. So, first, we take the protection of our employees very seriously. Second, we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate. Third, we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns. We are aggressively looking into any-- if-- to see whether there's validity to the concerns. But what the American people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any HHS employee had contact with the individuals involved. They are not-- nobody is symptomatic. Nobody has a disease. Even if these allegations prove to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm.\n\nALEX AZAR: And we have offered, even though it is not medically indicated, we have offered to test any HHS employees involved if they would like that extra piece of mind. We want to do that for our employees.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There are cases of the coronavirus in Mexico and in Canada. Yesterday, the President said he is considering and looking at closing the southern border.\n\nALEX AZAR: Well--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What will decide that? Are you looking at that?\n\nALEX AZAR: That's not one of the highest priority areas that we're looking at right now, because Mexico only has a couple of cases. Canada's epidemiology is similar to the United States right now. What the President's making clear, though, is we'll always be looking at travel restrictions, border protections. We will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the American people. But we don't forecast doing that anytime soon.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect drug shortages, as some senators have highlighted concerns there could be because of disruption to the supply chain?\n\nALEX AZAR: So, we're very concerned about the intermingling of our supply chain with China, in particular. We-- the FDA has gone out and worked proactively with drug manufacturers and there are twenty drugs for which the entire molecule or a critical element of the molecule is made exclusively in China. And so we're working aggressively with the-- with the manufacturers to determine if there are any shortages. We are aware of one drug which has many, many replacements in terms of that therapeutic class available that may be in shortage for a short period of time. But--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What drug is that?\n\nALEX AZAR: --I'm not able to because it's commercially confidential information that's submitted voluntarily to us, I'm not able to discuss that. But this is a drug in a class where there are many, many, many alternatives available. It's a generic drug. Very available.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Secretary, thank you for your time.\n\nAnd we will be right back with another cabinet official, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, so stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday, the U.S. signed a deal with the Taliban that may lead to a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Since it began in 2001, the war has claimed the lives of more than two thousand four hundred American troops. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from the signing ceremony in Doha. He got off the plane just a short while ago. And thank you for being here, Mister Secretary.\n\nMIKE POMPEO (Secretary of State/@SecPompeo): Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So this is significant. And according to the deal that was released, the U.S. will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty-five days. And then if conditions are met, a total withdrawal within fourteen months. But the President said yesterday, if bad things happen, we'll go back in. What's the benchmark there?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am. This was a historic day. American blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time. We went there after 9/11. No one still feels the anger of that day any more than I do. But it was time. And the Taliban knew it was time. President Trump has allowed us to take the fight to the Taliban these last two years. And we have done so. It's why they, for the first time, have announced that they're prepared to break with their historic ally, al-Qaida, who they've worked with much the det-- detriment of the United States of America. You can see, go read the document, the Taliban have now made the break. They've said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the United States, from Afghanistan. This is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the Trump administration. You can see our work on counterterror, whether it's al-Baghdadi, Qassem al-Rimi--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How long will it take--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: --the work that we did against Qassem Soleimani. This is a President who is committed to defending and protecting the American people. We'll do that every place we battle against terror whether that's Afghanistan or any of the other dozens of places we push back each and every day.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How long would it take to get U.S. troops out? Because you're saying this is based on conditions. That means the Taliban has to follow through on a few things.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What would make the President hit the brakes and stop the withdrawal?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Look, we can't get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the Taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur, the nature of what's got to take place. We are hopeful that in the coming days, there will be inter-Afghan negotiations that commence as well. That has not happened before. It's going to be rocky and bumpy. No one-- no one is under any false illusion that this won't be a difficult conversation. But that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the Afghan people. And that's the appropriate place for that conversation to take place. We're-- we're prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep America safe. We've asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence, both the Afghan national--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: --security forces and the Taliban.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But President Trump said he's going to meet with the Taliban in the near future. When? Where? Is that Camp David?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: I don't know when. I don't know where. I-- I'm very confident. President Trump wants to make sure that everyone in Afghanistan understands that the United States is committed to making sure that this conversation take place. We have been at this for an awful long time. You recounted the loss of American life. There's a better path forward. The Taliban now know this because of the work that we've done. And President Trump will be actively engaged in helping us get the conditions right and beginning this journey that the first step was taken in Doha yesterday.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break and continue the conversation on the other side of it. Please stay with us. We hope you will, too.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Pompeo is here for more on ending America's longest war, and then a look at politics and Super Tuesday.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. And we are continuing our conversation with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is just back in the U.S. after signing a deal with the Taliban in Doha. And-- and-- just that statement alone is kind of amazing. You were the first U.S. cabinet official to ever meet with a member of the Taliban. I think you actually met with one of the founding members of the Taliban who is involved in this.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: I met with a senior negotiator yesterday, yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you called them terrorists in the past. Do you still consider the Taliban terrorists?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: They have an enormous amount of American blood on their hands.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And, apparently, in a partnership still with al Qaeda?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Yep, they said yesterday, signed a document. The gentleman whom I met with agreed that they would break that relationship and that they would work alongside of us to destroy, deny resources to and to have al Qaeda depart from that place.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Don't trust anything. We're going to deliver. It's about actions. The agreements that set out, the conditions that set out the space. But, no, this deal doesn't depend upon trusting anyone. It has a deep, complex, well-thought out, multi-month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable. We'll do that. It's not about trust. It's about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday, which was an important day, but in the days that follow.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. pledged in this agreement, which is public, as you say, that it will help to get up to five thousand Taliban prisoners released. The president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, says no way, no how. He-- nothing like that was agreed to. All of this is supposed to happen in the next ten days. Did the U.S. agree to help release five thousand prisoners?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: You saw what the document says. It says, we will work with all relevant--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So Ghani-- what he is saying is wrong?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: It says that we will work with all relevant parties to build on confidence, to create confidence-building measures amongst all of the parties, the Afghan government, non-Taliban, and others in the Afghan. We-- we want this to be an inclusive process.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a process--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: We want-- we want women--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --this would be a spoiler in just--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: We want-- we want--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --the first ten days.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: We want women to be involved. They-- there will be lots of people say things. There will be lots of noise. Everyone is competing for attention and time in the media. What matters is the actions that we take, the discussions that we had. We have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday. While I was in Doha, Secretary of Defense was in Kabul, along with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. They made a declaration. There was a commitment from the Afghan government, too. We've made a lot of progress. No one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward. We've built an important base where we can begin to bring American soldiers home, reduce the risk of the loss of life of any American in Afghanistan, and, hopefully, set the conditions so the Afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their, now what for them is a forty-year struggle.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, putting five thousand or up to five thousand fighters back on the field is, obviously-- would have a significant impact on-- on any of the implementation, one would think. So, are-- are--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: So, there have been-- there-- there-- there have--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --do you expect this to actually happen?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: --there have been prisoner releases from both sides before. We have managed to figure our path forward. We'll know who these people are. We are working to build out a set of confidence measures that will do for America what President Trump has committed: reduce our cost in blood and treasure and keep America safe from terrorism. I don't think any American can doubt President Trump's seriousness in that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Republican, and about twenty allies--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Who I know well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --who you know well, wasn't very happy with you this week, though, because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this, that you-- you-- you are pretending that the Taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying, you know, the Taliban is still allied with al Qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of Congress--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Mm-Hm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --she suggested wouldn't accept a deal like this, that you raised concerns about secret side deals that the Obama administration had cut with Iran--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --back then. So that any kind--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Oh, I remember it well, yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --of annex-- she says there are secret annexes to this deal.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Yes. She-- she-- I'm happy to talk with her. There-- there are--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are there?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: There are no annexes that the members of Congress won't have a chance to see--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning they are all classified details--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: The public-- the public document--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that will be shared with Congress?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: The public document was released yesterday. There are two implementing elements that will be provided. They are secret. They are military implementation documents that are important to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. Every member of Congress will get a chance to see them. They are classified, secret. There aren't any side deals. Remember, the side deals I was complaining about were deals that the American side--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: --never got to see. John Kerry never got to see those side deals. This is-- this is not that. This is a fully transparent arrangement. And as for-- and as--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So there is no deal to keep a certain U.S. military presence in Afghanistan?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: And there-- the document that was made public yesterday is the complete agreement. The implementing elements of that will be available for every member of Congress to see. Know this. I saw what Congresswoman Cheney said, and I have an enormous amount of respect for her. The American people should know Donald Trump is not going to take words on a paper. We are going to see if the Taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they've made. The Bush administration and the Obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the Taliban would break from al Qaeda publicly. We got that. That's important. Now, time will tell if they'll live up to that commitment is our expectation. They have promised us they will do so and we'll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's a historic agreement.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Thank you very much, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for coming on to talk about it. We'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\n(Excerpt from a Campaign Video)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was businessman Tom Steyer doing a little pre-primary dance in South Carolina. He did come in third, but he had hoped to do better and he dropped out of the race last night but rest of the candidates have moved on to Super Tuesday, and that's this Tuesday, when fourteen states will hold contests. Among them California and Texas. We have some new CBS News Battleground Tracker numbers for both of them. Out in California Senator Bernie Sanders is up with thirty-one percent support. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren come in behind Sanders with nineteen and eighteen percent, respectively. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has twelve percent, and the rest of the field comes in at under ten percent. Looking to Texas, the race is tighter. Bernie Sanders is in the lead here with thirty percent, but Joe Biden close behind him with twenty-six percent and Elizabeth Warren comes in at seventeen-percent support. Michael Bloomberg is at thirteen percent, and the rest of the field comes in at six percent or less. Joining us once again is CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. We want to bring in CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, this was a big and much-needed win for Joe Biden in South Carolina. What does this mean for him going into Tuesday?\n\nED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Well, his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late-deciding voter who is not a fan of Bernie Sanders to side with them instead. Their hope is that by the end of Tuesday, he emerges as the clear alternative to Sanders. It's pretty mathematically impossible, based on what polling is showing us right now, for somebody to surpass Sanders, especially because he is going to have such a big win, it looks like, in places like California. But they are hoping, the Biden team is, that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, does he have the enthusiasm that you say Sanders' supporters have?\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that Bernie Sanders' supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates. That's why his numbers remain so stable. Those folks turn out for him. But Joe Biden still has a challenge in that regard. His supporters are less enthusiastic about him. Can he motivate them to turn out? I think it remains a key question. And, look, to that point, when you look at California, Texas, at these big delegate hauls, the Democrats give out delegates just to top finishers. And so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And there are a lot of delegates at stake here on Tuesday. A thousand three hundred forty-four, it's about thirty percent of what's needed for the nomination. So, Ed, how do the candidates sort of crack the threshold? Explain some of the math here.\n\nED O'KEEFE: So there is, essentially, two numbers to look at on Tuesday night. There's the perception number, who wins the state? Who can say that they walked away winning the most states? But the more important number, ultimately, is the nomination number. Who gets closest to getting the one thousand nine hundred ninety or ninety-one delegates you need to get over the threshold and-- and win that nomination.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not winner take all.\n\nED O'KEEFE: It is not. You have to hit fifteen percent in each congressional district and in the states. And so the numbers to look for are fifteen. So if you look at our California and Texas numbers right now, Mike Bloomberg is in trouble because he is not hitting fifteen percent. This could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can't hit fifteen percent in those two states. But this is why, despite not winning anything so far, Elizabeth Warren is still in this race. Because she sees that she is doing well enough in California and in Texas and in a few of these other states, likely, that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later March and April.\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: And that Bloomberg number that you talk about is so critical because if he does do just well enough to pick up delegates, if he picks up delegates in some regions of these states, even if he doesn't win them, then that changes the math for everybody else. Now he is a player. But if he falls just short of it, then all those delegates can go to other top candidates, to a-- to a Biden or to a Sanders and that changes the math going forward for them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, can four hundred million dollars in ad spending close that gap? That's a big gamble.\n\nED O'KEEFE: It could, potentially. Look, and, tonight, he is-- he is doing something that hasn't been done in a while. He is buying three minutes of advertising on NBC and CBS to talk about the coronavirus. And trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager, who could probably help solve this problem, and would have tackled it sooner than the President. He can spend as much as he wants. But if he doesn't hit fifteen percent in these states on Tuesday, it will have been for naught, essentially. Certainly, they believe that they can go on into Florida and Arizona and Illinois next and-- and try to compete in later March contests. But, perhaps, the biggest loser last night in South Carolina was Mike Bloomberg because Joe Biden did so well. They needed Biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It couldn't have felt good for Tom Steyer to have spent over three hundred million-- two hundred million dollars, almost three hundred million on spending on ads.\n\nED O'KEEFE: It's a warning sign because South Carolina was his-- was his petri dish.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nED O'KEEFE: It was his test that if he could do it there, he could do it anywhere. He couldn't.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Anthony and Ed, there are a lot of headlines after South Carolina saying this is now a two-person race but there are still a lot of people on the field. So--\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: It remains a multicandidate race. There's no question about it. And I think part of that is you look at Bernie Sanders and you look at, despite that enthusiasm that he has, can he grow it? Can he draw people to him? And when we ask folks, most of the people supporting Sanders say they've already liked him. They've liked him for a long time. But far fewer say they've taken-- taken a second or third look at him as he's won these early states. So can he translate any success he's had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty-five, that thirty percent that he's already got? That, I think, remains a key question.\n\nED O'KEEFE: This will not be clean. This is going to be a messy contest. It's different than what we've seen before because we have so many candidates. We are down to seven, the magnificent seven, perhaps, who are going into Tuesday. Will the field shrink after Tuesday? Probably. But, again, if you're somebody who can hit viability, fifteen percent in a few of these states, you have no reason to get out yet.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It makes for some exciting political watching on Tuesday.\n\nED O'KEEFE: And very little sleep.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks.\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A very little sleep for (INDISTINCT).\n\nANTHONY SALVANTO: A very long night with delegates coming as we go, as we go.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we'll-- we'll gear up for that with both of you. Thank you.\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: For a closer look at how prepared we are for the coronavirus here in the U.S., we turn to former FDA commissioner and physician Doctor Scott Got-- Gottlieb. Good to have you here.\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Thanks.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You served in the Trump administration. What do you think the administration is doing now that is right, wrong in its handling of the virus?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. Well, certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move. We're going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs. Hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day. By the end of the week after that, we'll probably bring on another ten thousand. So we'll have testing capacity of, perhaps, as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks. Once we bring on the academic labs, that was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --and-- and leveraging their capacity. These are the major medical centers. What we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get a therapeutic. We know when this started, but we don't know when this is going to end. And what's going to end it is our technology. Our savior here is going to be our technology. And we need to make a really robust effort to try to develop a therapeutic.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning a treatment?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: A treatment or a vaccine. But a-- a therapeutic-- a treatment is going to be more likely to be available in the fall. A vaccine is a much longer way off. And we always knew when that once in a generation strain came along, and this might be that strain, that what we were going to have to depend on was our science and something to stop it like a treatment or a vaccine. A treatment, again, we could have by September, October, potentially.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But more testing means more positive results. I mean you're saying, basically, expect the number of those who've been diagnosed with the virus to also increase?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's going to increase. This-- right now, there's probably hundreds or low thousands of cases. Everyone's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Hundreds or low thousands of coronavirus cases--\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: In the U.S.--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in the U.S. that aren't reported?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --that aren't reported yet. It's a big country three-- three hundred and forty million people, three hundred and thirty million people, so anyone's individual risk is-- is still very low. But we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. We need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. There was an analysis out today by Trevor Bradford, very good researcher out of the Hutch, looking at the genetic strains in Washington State. And by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. It's an interesting analysis. There probably are more cases. We have community spread now in Washington State, California, perhaps, Illinois, Oregon. So certainly hundreds of cases.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So has the administration been slow in its response?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the decision the administration made to block the travel, which was controversial at the time, clearly, bought us time. It-- it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country. Virus was probably here at that time, but it slowed additional cases. The question is what do we do with that time? I think there's some things we did that were very smart. We got the country prepared. One of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. I think what-- what we should have done and I don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the CDC. We always rely on a CDC in a public health emergency. But simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. We've done that. You know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. And that is now in place. And those labs are going to be coming online. So we course corrected. I think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? It's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. And we need to do that now in a therapeutic. We-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket. We need to be looking at antibody-based prophylaxis, treatments, vaccines, and all of the above approach. If case one doesn't work out, we have other options.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you'd suggest that's the conversation the President should have tomorrow with the pharmaceutical companies--\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Tomorrow is the vaccine manufacturers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --when he brings those--\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we need to look at the companies that-- that can develop antibody-based prophylaxis as well. We did that against Ebola. That is actually what we could potentially have for the fall-- fall or a small molecule drug that's currently on the shelf, trying to repurpose it for this.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The NIH director, Anthony Fauci, a doctor, said that from what he's seen, if you get infected, you likely won't get reinfected. But there seems to be so much we don't know. If someone has just sort of mild or moderate symptoms, how do they last? How do you know to go and get tested?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's the challenge here. You don't. You know there isn't-- the spectrum of disease here is very wide. A lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they shed virus and they're still infective. They can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick. And so, it's probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it. The other thing is that people who get very sick, don't get very sick right away. The time to hospitalization in-- in different studies was nine to twelve days. So they start off with cold-like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill. And it's in that phase that people are spreading it. There was a very interesting analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --across a spectrum of disease. And the people who are mildly symptomatic shed as much virus as the people who are very sick and that's atypical. Typically, the amount of virus you have and shed to-- in-- in some diseases comports with how much-- how much of virus you have.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Doctor, thank you very much for coming on and giving us--\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --your analysis.\n\nWe'll be back in a moment with a look at Super Tuesday and more.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our panel. We brought in two of the big guns from the New York Times today. Edward Wong is a diplomatic correspondent, and Michael Crowley is a White House correspondent covering foreign policy. Good to have you both here.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY (The New York Times/@michaelcrowley): Thanks, Margaret.\n\nEDWARD WONG (The New York Times/@ewong): Thanks, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on what we haven't mentioned thus far in the show, that the President has made a choice to run the intelligence community. He's going to renominate a congressman, John Ratcliffe. Is he actually going to go through and get nominated and-- and confirmed?\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: Well, that's a big question. You know, President Trump was getting close to nominating Congressman Ratcliffe back in the summer, and met so much resistance from senior Republicans in Congress who said this man is not qualified. He's only been on the Intelligence Committee for a year, may have inflated his resume, and is much more partisan around the people who've held that job. The President pulled back and didn't do it. The question is now has Ratcliffe changed any minds? There's not a lot of evidence to that, but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the President has installed Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany, in that job, in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the-- the-- how long acting directors can serve. By nominating a new person, even if President Trump doesn't think Ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows Rick Grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time. There's another theory that Rick Grenell is even more unpalatable to people in Congress than Ratcliffe. So Ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative. So there's a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what's real and what isn't.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I bring that up first because it gets to some of what we have been talking about today in terms of confidence in professionals versus political choices made for political reasons, and-- and confidence in-- in hard fact and in intelligence. Ed, I know you've been following, as you always do, you lived in China for so long, and you followed the origins of this outbreak of corona, when you heard the administration this week change its language so many times in describing and characterizing response, what did you make of that? And what do you make of what is actually known in terms of what China is sharing with the U.S.?\n\nEDWARD WONG: Well, I think that everyone agrees that full transparency or a large amount of transparency on this virus is necessary both, you know, to push forward with expertise on addressing the virus, plus, calming public fears over it. I think when an administration or government appears to be nontransparent on it then that creates problems. I think that the Trump administration really grappled with that this past week when you saw President Trump come out and say it was a new hoax by the Democrats or when--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And his chief of staff went out and-- and said the media's covering this--\n\nEDWARD WONG: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --because they think it's going to take down the President.\n\nEDWARD WONG: Right. And I think that they're trying to adjust the language now from what I can tell. But I think that, you know, there's valid criticism of that. And I think if you compare that to the way Beijing reacted, there are some parallels in that communist party officials, Chinese officials really covered up the start of the virus, and there's a lot of information coming out these days that perhaps it started earlier, and that they kept the public from learning about it. We know that one of the key whistleblowers, Dr. Li--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nEDWARD WONG: --tried to warn health care professionals in a private chat group about it. And then he was even taken in by the police because of that and admonished.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Michael, I mean does the President now have the credibility and-- and the trust of the public at a moment of crisis when you need it most?\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: No, that's a huge problem here, Margaret. Think back to what happened when Hurricane Dorian was hitting the United States last summer President Trump made an inaccurate comment about the hurricane's path and was criticized for it. And then a day or two later, he's holding up a map showing the storm's forecasted path in the Oval Office and it appears to have been doctored with just the kind of sharpie pen that President Trump loves to use to sign documents. It really looks like they were altering information they were giving the public to make the President look good, to cover up for a mistake he had made. And President Trump has repeatedly bungled basic facts, including numbers of victims in the country. Yesterday he got the gender wrong of the person who died in Washington although he may have been briefed inaccurately. I will say, Margaret, that I do think that that briefing yesterday was a step in the right direction. Having all those health experts there--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: --particularly Doctor Fauci. There were questions about whether he was being muzzled. He said he was not, one of the nation's foremost authorities on these things. And I think President Trump understands he doesn't-- he wants the markets to bounce back. The markets want to see that kind of expertise in Trump-- expertise and-- and-- and credibility. And at least yesterday, there was a step in that direction.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when markets open tomorrow what they thought of it. But, certainly, for the public, we'll continue to follow the details of this as we have on FACE THE NATION.\n\nThank you all today for watching and each week as you do. We'll see you Tuesday night for CBS News' special coverage of the Super Tuesday results. We go on the air here on CBS at 8:00 PM eastern, 5:00 Pacific, and our CBSN coverage starts at 5:00 PM as well.\n\nFor FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
President-elect Joe Biden will extend the nearly year-long pause on federal student loan payments on day one, the first concrete promise the incoming administration has made to tackle the $1.6 trillion debt crisis.\n\nBiden transition official David Kamin told reporters Friday that alleviating the crushing financial burden of student debt would be an immediate priority for the incoming administration as part of its commitment to get our economy moving and keep Americans afloat. That includes directing the Department of Education on day one to extend the popular student loan forbearance program, as well as expanding income based repayment programs, and fixing and expanding loan forgiveness programs for those with public service jobs.\n\nBut how exactly the incoming administration will handle student loan forgiveness for other borrowers remains unclear. In the call with reporters, the transition official said Biden supports Congress immediately canceling $10,000 of federal student loan debt per person as a response to the COVID crisis but didn't offer details or a specific time frame.\n\nStudent loan debt has been a looming financial issue since before the pandemic, but widespread coronavirus-related job losses and pay cuts, especially among millennials, have exacerbated the issue. Last year student loan debt reached an all-time high, nearing $1.6 trillion among more than 40 million Americans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On average, student loan borrowers owe between $200 and $299 every month, an amount that for many is simply untenable; about one in every five borrowers are in default, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nDemocrats are split on how to address the crisis. Originally a fringe idea, the concept of student loan cancellation has gained traction among more progressive pockets of the party. During the 2020 presidential primaries, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts proposed forgiving up to $50,000 in debt and independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for cancelling all student loans. In a more moderate approach, Mr. Biden has expressed his support for Congressional legislation that would cancel $10,000 per borrower.\n\nNo matter the specifics of Mr. Biden's plan, the approach will likely be an about-face from the current administration's stance. In a letter early last week, now-former U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos urged Congress to reject calls to forgive student loan debt, calling the policy proposals misguided and unfair to most Americans.\n\nSince March, all federal student loan payments have been suspended as part of the federal government's COVID-19 response. An extension of the grace period was included in early drafts of December's stimulus package, but was cut in final negotiations. Student loan payments are currently scheduled to resume at the end of this month. The transition team did not indicate how long a new extension could last.\n\nA Pew study from November found that nearly 6 in 10 borrowers said it would be somewhat or very difficult to restart payments on their loans the next month.\n\nWhen student loan payments do resume, the Department of Education doesn't expect a smooth transition. In its 2020 annual report, the department said it expects loan servicers and the federal government will face a heavy burden in 'converting' millions of borrowers to active repayment. Some of those borrowers, the report warns, will become delinquent.\n\nAlex Tin contributed to this report.
U.S. stocks are seeing their biggest decline in months, pulled down by hefty losses in health care and technology companies.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 31 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 2,822. The Dow Jones industrial sank 363 points, following a 145 point slump on Monday, to end at 26,077. The Nasdaq lost 64 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,402.\n\nStocks also slumped on Monday. The market's last two-day losing streak was in late December. The VIX, a measure of how much volatility investors expect in stocks, was up 4.8 percent, its highest level since August.\n\nIs it profit-taking? Probably a little bit of that, said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management. There's too much positive economic momentum going on right now, but certainly two significant down days makes you wonder if there's something else going on that we're not recognizing.\n\nFinancial and industrial stocks also accounted for a big slice of the decline. Energy companies fell as crude oil prices headed lower. The broad slide put the stock market on course for its first two-day losing streak in more than a month.\n\nThe stock market got off to a fast start in 2018, with the Dow quickly vaulting to new milestones and other indexes also setting all-time highs. But that momentum stalled last week amid investor unease over the Trump administration's push for more favorable trade terms with key economic partners.\n\nHealth care sector companies slumped on news that Amazon is teaming up with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create a company that helps their U.S. employees find quality care at a reasonable cost. The venture, whose initial focus would be on developing technology, is in its early planning stage. Express Scripts tumbled $5.71, or 7 percent, to $76.21. Cigna slid $12.91, or 5.8 percent, to $210.99. UnitedHealth Group lost $8.19, or 3.3 percent, to $239.22.\n\nThe partnership between the three corporate giants could be disruptive and create further competitive pressure on CVS, Walgreens and pharmacy benefit managers, as there hasn't been a new competitor with this magnitude of resources in the employee health care space for a very long time, Moody's analyst Mickey Chadha said in a statement.\n\nThe sell-off comes during a week with no shortage of potential market-moving corporate news and economic data. Several big-name companies are due to report quarterly results on Wednesday and Thursday, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google's parent company Alphabet.\n\nAlso on investors' radar: Tuesday night's State of the Union address and a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve's policymaking committee that wraps up Wednesday. Among the issues President Donald Trump is expected to touch on are trade, taxes and immigration.\n\nWe expect [Mr. Trump's] 'America First' policy and fair and reciprocal trade to be themes, and while the possibility of additional protectionist announcements cannot be ruled out, we do not expect Trump to take any actions on NAFTA at this time, TD Securities analysts said in a note.\n\nThe Conference Board said Tuesday its index of consumer confidence rose to 125.4 in January from a revised 123.1 in December. Meanwhile, a national housing index showed that home prices rose a sharply in November, lifted by a shortage of homes on the market.\n\nBond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.71 percent from 2.70 percent late Monday.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude slid $1.19, or 1.8 percent, to $64.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, dropped 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $68.25 a barrel in London.\n\nThe dollar, which fell sharply last week, declined to 108.89 yen from 108.94 yen late Monday.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell 7.1 percent to $10,366, according to the tracking site CoinDesk. Bitcoin futures on the Cboe Futures Exchange slid 6.8 percent to $10,410.
LONDON -- British Queen Elizabeth II's 96-year-old husband, Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh, was hospitalized on Tuesday evening in London to receive treatment for an infection, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Wednesday morning.\n\nThe prince's illness meant he would miss the queen giving her official speech to open a new session of Parliament later on Wednesday.\n\nThe palace said Philip was admitted, as a precautionary measure, for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition.\n\nThe statement did not go into further detail on his illness, but said he was, in good spirits and is disappointed to be missing the State Opening of Parliament, and the royal couple's annual pilgrimage to the Royal Ascot horse race.\n\nQueen Elizabeth was being kept informed of her husband's condition as she prepared to address the nation's gathered legislators -- and the nation at large -- in the televised speech, which is used to lay out the elected government's key policy plans and ambitions for the coming months.\n\nPhilip retired from public life on May 4 this year, announcing that he would no longer play an active role in the dozens of organizations for which he has served as a member and patron for decades.\n\nThe prince has been hospitalized several times in recent years for issues relating to abdominal complaints and bladder infections.
WASHINGTON D.C. -- States should make it easier for convicted felons to obtain state-issued identification after they get out of prison, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday in announcing a set of measures aimed at helping smooth the return to society for the hundreds of thousands of inmates released each year.\n\nThe announcement is part of a broader movement to undo criminal justice policies that have meted out exceptionally long sentences for drug offenders, caused prison populations to balloon and, advocates say, created unnecessary barriers for ex-convicts looking to rebuild their lives. It amplifies an ongoing Justice Department push to rethink harsh drug sentences and to ensure alternatives to prison for certain nonviolent defendants, an effort known as Smart on Crime.\n\nThe long-term impact of a criminal record prevents many people from obtaining employment, housing, higher education and credit -- and these barriers affect returning individuals even if they have turned their lives around and are unlikely to reoffend, the department said in a seven-page policy statement titled Roadmap to Re-entry.\n\nLynch made the announcement in Philadelphia on Monday at the start of National Re-entry Week.\n\nThe issue of felons' rights has attracted growing attention at the state and federal levels in recent years. Last week, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe issued an executive order that would allow more than 200,000 convicted felons to cast ballots in November, calling voting rights the essence of our democracy.\n\nEach state sets its own eligibility requirements for voting. Nearly 6 million Americans are unable to vote because of their criminal backgrounds, though more than 20 states have acted in the last two decades to help people with criminal convictions vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nA letter released Monday by the Justice Department calls on governors to allow federal inmates who are returning to their communities to exchange their prisoner identification cards for state-issued identification, or to simply accept their prison cards as a primary identity document. Without identity documents, Americans leaving prison face challenges in getting jobs, housing or opening bank accounts, Lynch wrote in the letter.\n\nThe practical impact is to standardize varied state laws about identification.\n\nBut even more important is the message that such a program would send to returning citizens: That they are welcome back into society; that their government is invested in their success; and that they can now - quite literally - exchange their old identity as a federal inmate for a fresh start, Lynch said in Philadelphia, where she was joined by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.\n\nSeparately, Lynch announced a series of actions taken by the federal Bureau of Prisons, which houses nearly 200,000 prisoners, to help convicts better acclimate to society. Roughly 600,000 state and federal prisoners return to their communities each year, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe Justice Department initiative directs federal prisons to prepare an individualized re-entry plan for each inmate that will take into account substance abuse, criminal history and education level.\n\nIn addition, the agency will be reviewing its network of halfway houses, where some 80 percent of federal prisoners who return to U.S. communities live before being fully released, and assessing life skills, education and job training programs to ensure that they're best serving inmates' needs. A pilot program is also being launched at four bureau facilities for children of incarcerated parents as a way to keep families united.\n\nThe Justice Department is publishing a manual to provide advice and guidance on re-entry to all U.S. citizens leaving federal correctional facilities.
SAN FRANCISCO -- A San Francisco Bay Area sports anchor is in hot water, CBS San Francisco reports. The anchor allegedly took a jacket belonging to a Golden State Warriors security official.\n\nIn surveillance video from the AT&T Center in San Antonio, a man in a red shirt is seen taking a jacket from a chair following a Warriors floor practice session Thursday before the team defeated the Spurs in a playoff game.\n\nThe video then shows the man walking out of the arena.\n\nThe man in the video is reportedly Mike Shumann, a former NFL player for the San Francisco 49ers and a longtime anchor and reporter for KGO-TV in San Francisco.\n\nA man is seen walking toward a jacket belonging to a Golden State Warriors security official at AT&T Center in San Antonio on April 19, 2018. CBS San Francisco\n\nThe Athletic website reported the jacket belongs to Ralph Walker, the director of team security for the Warriors and Stephen Curry's personal bodyguard.\n\nKGO-TV called Shumann home after it learned of the incident, according to The Athletic. He was not part of the station's postgame coverage on Sunday night.\n\nThe station told The Athletic: We are taking these allegations very seriously and conducting a full investigation. As a matter of policy, we do not comment about personnel matters.\n\nWatch CBS SPORTS HQ, a 24-hour streaming network offering sports news, highlights and analysis, all accessible for free on connected devices & at cbssports.com/live
A growing number of Wall Street banks and businesses have cut ties with President Donald Trump's campaign and its financial arms, as well as the broader Republican Party, following last week's riots and insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nFinancial technology company Stripe stopped processing payments for the Trump campaign, a person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press. The person requested anonymity because the decision hasn't been made public.\n\nThe move by Stripe reportedly cuts off Mr. Trump's fundraising arm from what has been a steady stream of small-dollar donations that are often solicited through emails and text messages.\n\nStripe did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.\n\nAlso on Monday, American Express and JPMorgan Chase said they would no longer donate to candidates who supported the rhetoric that stoked last week's insurrection or did not vote to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the Electoral College on December 6.\n\nLast week's attempts by some congressional members to subvert the presidential election results and disrupt the peaceful transition of power do not align with our (values), American Express' CEO Steve Squeri said in an email to employees.\n\nCitigroup confirmed this week that it is pausing all federal political donations for the first three months of the year.\n\nIn a memo to employees sent Friday, Citi's head of global government affairs Candi Wolff said we want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law.\n\nCEOs at Visa and PayPal have also denounced the violence Mr. Trump's supporters carried out last week, which have now led to two Capitol Police officer deaths.\n\nSeveral technology companies have clamped down on President Trump, the GOP and other forums that were considered avenues for violent extremism and insurrection. Twitter suspended Mr. Trump from its platform, as did Facebook, last week. The social media company Parler was banned from Apple's App Store as well as Google's Play Store, and Amazon cut off Parler from its Amazon Web Services platform.\n\nOnline-store platform Shopify also removed Mr. Trump's campaign merchandise from its platform, saying those web pages violated company policy against sellers promoting violence. Both Trump-oriented merchandise websites — trumpstore.com and shop.donaldjtrump.com — were disabled last week. The Canadian company said in a statement that it does not tolerate actions that incite violence.\n\nWhen active, both Trump online stores offered Make America Great Again hats, Trump 2020 buttons, flags, pennants, T-shirts, bobbleheads and more. That merchandise is still for sale on Amazon.
There was more fallout Friday from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. The former USA Gymnastics doctor was sentenced this week to decades in prison for molesting young girls. On Friday, that group's directors agreed to resign, and Mark Hollis said he's retiring as athletic director at Michigan State University.\n\nBut Nassar treated athletes there for nearly two decades, and there are serious questions about how the university responded to complaints about Nassar.\n\nAmanda Thomashow was one of the 156 women who confronted Nassar last week.\n\nI didn't know who to tell and I was scared no one would believe me. Sometimes I even had a hard time believing myself. But in the end, I knew I had to report it, she said.\n\nMSU memo concerning Larry Nassar CBS News\n\nIn 2014, Thomashow complained to Michigan State University that she had been sexually abused by Nassar. The university conducted a sexual harassment investigation and cleared him. The report given to Thomashow concluded: we cannot find that the conduct was of a sexual nature. But it said her claim was helpful in that it allows us to examine certain practices at Michigan State University.\n\nA different, more detailed conclusion was sent to Nassar and his boss at Michigan State. Unknown to Thomashow, the report found significant problems that the practice will want to address. Those problems included exposing patients to unnecessary trauma based on the possibility of perceived inappropriate sexual misconduct, and the failure to obtain consent.\n\nThe report also recommended a chaperone during a sensitive procedure.\n\nLarry Nassar was cleared to practice again under new guidelines that weren't actually enforced, said Thomashow.\n\nA 2017 Michigan State University police investigation stated at least 12 assaults were reported after Nassar was cleared in 2014. Many of them were at MSU and involved the lack of a chaperone during sensitive procedures and un-gloved skin-to-skin contact.\n\nIn a statement, Thomashow told CBS News she felt anger and betrayed that her university concealed critically important information from her.\n\nMichigan State University told CBS News it was standard practice to have an internal version of a report when no violation of their sexual harassment policy had been found. They added she was told the investigation had led to policy changes.
Travelers who fly with insects, hedgehogs or goats as service animals or for emotional support will no longer be able to bring the creatures aboard American Airlines flights.\n\nCiting a 40 percent increase in animals traveling in its cabins, the world's biggest air carrier said it would curb the types of creatures allowed. Starting with tickets booked on or after July 1, animals including ferrets, birds of prey, snakes, insects, hedgehogs and goats are banned from American cabins.\n\nAmerican will now enforce the existing 48-hour advanced notice and pre-clearance policy for emotional support animals -- including dogs and cats -- where passengers must submit documents 48 hours ahead of flight time showing that permitted animals are healthy, trained and there at the recommendation of a mental health professional. American will have procedures in place for emergency travel booked within 48 hours of departure, the carrier stated.\n\nThe new rules have American joining other carriers, including United, Delta and Alaska airlines, that have added such requirements.\n\nUnited's policy on comfort animals changed in March after an incident involving an emotional support peacock, which a passenger attempted to take on a cross-country flight in January. The carrier's animal-related troubles continued with the death of a puppy in an overhead compartment on a United flight in March. After reviewing its animal policy, United this month banned more than 20 breeds of dogs and cats from riding in the cargo holds of its planes.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation lets passengers fly with emotional support animals but gives airlines the ability to impose restrictions.\n\nUpon toughening its requirements in March, Delta reported an 84 percent hike in animal incidents since 2016, including the mauling of a passenger by a 50-pound dog on a flight from Atlanta to San Diego last year.
SAN FRANCISCO — A trial will begin Monday in federal court in San Francisco over the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nJudge Richard Seeborg is scheduled to hear a week of testimony from experts and other witnesses. The judge will decide whether to allow the question.\n\nSeeborg is presiding over lawsuits by California and numerous cities in the state that argue the citizenship question was politically motivated and would discourage immigrants and Latinos from participating in the Census.\n\nThe plaintiffs say that would result in an undercount that would jeopardize their federal funding and the state's representation in Congress. Data from the Census are used to determine the distribution of Congressional seats to states and billions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nThe lawsuits want Seeborg to keep the citizenship question off the Census.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice argues Census officials take steps to guard against an undercount, including making in-person follow-up visits, so the final numbers will be accurate. Households that skip the citizenship query but otherwise fill out a substantial portion of the questionnaire will still be counted, Justice Department attorneys said in court documents.\n\nSeeborg is the second federal judge to hold a trial on the issue. A ruling in a trial in New York that ended in November is expected soon.\n\nThe Commerce Department announced the addition of a citizenship question in March, saying the Justice Department had requested it and it would improve enforcement of a 1965 law meant to protect minority voting rights. The move sparked an outcry from Democrats, who said it would disproportionately impact states that favor their party.\n\nAll households were last asked whether individuals were citizens of the U.S. or not in the 1950 census.\n\nDocuments unearthed as part of the litigation in New York appear to show that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was pursuing the addition of the question well before the DOJ's request and spoke about it in spring 2017 with former senior White House adviser Steve Bannon and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nThere was enough evidence to infer that Secretary Ross was motivated to add the citizenship question for the partisan purpose of facilitating the exclusion of non-citizens from the population count for congressional apportionment, California and other plaintiffs told Seeborg in court documents.\n\nThey plan to use testimony from academics to support their claim that the citizenship question would result in a costly undercount. That would violate the Constitutional requirement that the Census include everyone in the U.S., even non-citizens, they argue.\n\nThis week we'll bring in witnesses who will demonstrate just how critical an accurate 2020 Census count is for our state and people, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.\n\nThe DOJ plans to rely on its expert, Stuart Gurrea, to argue the citizenship question would cause no change in congressional apportionment in any state and only a negligible dip in the distribution of federal funds to California.\n\nIn a court filing, they said the plaintiffs had failed to show ulterior motives for the question. Ross's request that his staff look into adding it to the Census does not show he acted improperly nor does the fact that other officials might have supported it for different reasons, DOJ attorneys said.\n\nIt is unremarkable for an agency head to enter office with predispositions toward certain policy choices, they said.
The fear of running out of money in retirement is widespread -- and understandable. But it may also be pushing retirees to hoard their hard-earned savings more than is warranted. And that means they may be shortchanging themselves when it comes to funding their living expenses in retirement.\n\nThese are among the many findings in a recent report issued by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI).\n\nEBRI analyzed the assets and spending statistics for retirees in the first 20 years of their retirement, using data from the respected Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS). They found that in general, retirees are spending down their assets quite slowly. For example:\n\nFor retirees with less than $200,000 in non-housing assets immediately before retirement, the median had spent down about one-quarter of their assets after 18 years.\n\nFor those with between $200,000 and $500,000, the median had spent down a little more than one-quarter of their assets over 18 years.\n\nFor those with at least $500,000, the median had spent down just 11.8 percent within the first 20 years of retirement.\n\nAbout one-third of all sampled retirees had increased their assets over the first 18 years of retirement.\n\nEBRI also found that retirees with pension income were much less likely to have spent down their assets than non-pensioners. During the first 18 years of retirement, the median non-housing assets of pensioners had dropped by just 4 percent, compared to 34 percent for non-pensioners. One possible explanation is that pensioners had started with higher retirement savings than non-pensioners.\n\nAlso, the majority of retirees avoided drawing down their assets by limiting spending to their flow of regular income from sources such as Social Security, pensions and annuities. This is another possible explanation for why pensioners are drawing down assets at a slower rate than non-pensioners\n\nIn additions, the EBRI report discussed the possible reasons retirees are hesitant to spend down their savings:\n\nThey're uncertain about how long their money might need to last, so they're cautious with it in case they live a long time.\n\nRetirees might be worried that they'll incur high expenses for medical care or long-term care at the end of their lives.\n\nThey might want to preserve assets for bequests.\n\nRetirees might not be aware of strategies that allow higher spending yet still preserve a level of assets, so they err on the side of caution.\n\nMany retirees might find it difficult to shift their mindset from accumulating savings to spending them down.\n\nIndeed, these are all valid reasons for retirees to be cautious with their spending. EBRI's findings that retirees appear to be frugal with their spending are consistent with an earlier report prepared by the advisory firm United Income.\n\nThe EBRI report is also careful to point out that some retirees are running out of money in retirement. For example, of those who started with less than $200,000 in savings, about one-third have less than 20 percent of their assets remaining after 17 to 18 years of retirement.\n\nWhat are some possible lessons new retirees and older workers who are approaching their retirement years can take from EBRI's study results? Here are a few:\n\nOlder workers and retirees who adopt one or more of these strategies might feel comfortable spending more in retirement to enjoy their lives. Financing a 20- to 30-year retirement isn't easy, so it only makes sense to spend some time researching and adopting smart strategies.
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - When three Florida teenagers stole a car, crashed it into a cemetery pond and then drowned, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri talked about his frustration, about lives needlessly lost, and how the vehicle became a death chamber for the three girls.\n\nNow, nearly a month after the tragedy, Gualtieri is angrily defending his agency against accusations that his officers didn't do enough to rescue the girls as the car sank in 15 feet of water. Bloggers, some TV stations and comedian D.L. Hughley have posted about the March 30 incident that claimed the lives of two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old from St. Petersburg.\n\nPolice caught on tape watching girls die. They didn't even try to help. Just watched. Sickening, Hughley wrote Friday morning on Facebook. His post had more than 5,000 reactions and 7,000 shares.\n\nThe posted dashcam video, which Gualtieri said was a misleadingly edited version of the original, shows the scene and includes audio of some of the officers. One deputy comments that he thinks he hears screams coming from the car and another says, They are done. They are sig-7 dude. Signal 7 is law enforcement code to indicate a fatality. Commenters on Facebook widely criticized the deputies for not going into the water and trying to save the people inside the sinking car.\n\nLater Friday, Gualtieri posted a different dashcam video from a second cruiser on the department's Facebook page showing two officers walking by with clothes in hand. Gualtieri said that deputies waded into the water and tried to save the girls - and that the video proves it.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a false narrative that's being spread by people on social media, he said. We're unfortunately in a society today that if it's not on video, then it didn't happen.\n\nCBS affiliate WTSP in Tampa reports there are some troubling inconsistencies with the story. One of them is, due to a technical issue, it's nearly impossible to match up the deputies time stamps on their dash-cam video. That's because the time is actually set by each deputy manually when they turn their vehicles on.\n\nOn one of many videos reviewed by The Associated Press on Friday, a camera captures a police cruiser driving to the pond, behind several other police cars. It parks, and then eight minutes later, a deputy in a black shirt walks in front of the camera, holding clothing in his hand. Seconds later, another deputy, in a tank top and holding a uniform, walks in front of the cruiser.\n\nOfficials say those two deputies attempted to enter the water but retreated due to safety concerns.\n\nThe vehicle began listing forward, at which point, I took off my duty belt and attempted to swim out to the vehicle, wrote Deputy Logan Tromer, who is also on the Sheriff's Office dive team but who happened to be working the night shift. I made it approximately 10-15 yards out; however, at this point the vehicle was facing front bumper down and was completely submerged within seconds. Due to the unknown depth, thick vegetation and officer safety concerns, I had no choice but to exit the water and suspend my rescue efforts.\n\nAccording to deputies, Dominique Battle, 16, Ashaunti Butler, 15, and Laniya Miller, 15, drowned after they stole a gold Honda Accord from a Pinellas County Walmart parking lot. Though the county sheriff's rules forbid deputies from chasing stolen vehicles, some officers were trailing the car when the car plunged into a pond off a sharp turn in the road around 4 a.m. the next morning.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office does not have a policy about officers rescuing people in the water; a spokesman said it's up to the individual deputy at the time of the call.\n\nGualtieri told The Associated Press that the girls had seven arrests between them in the past year for auto theft, and that he's upset by not only the girls' deaths but an auto theft epidemic in the county.\n\nDon't put it on us. We didn't do anything wrong, he added.\n\nA lawyer for the girls' family did not return a call for comment. Earlier, she told local news media that some of the officials' original statements about the deputies' actions were misleading.
New surveillance footage might give investigators fresh clues into the disappearance of two Idaho kids. The video appears to show their mother, Lori Vallow, at a storage facility near their home shortly after 7-year-old JJ and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan were last seen in September.\n\nInvestigators went through a storage unit where they found bikes, photos and a backpack with JJ's initials, according to CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti who reported from inside the Rexburg, Idaho facility.\n\nIt was disturbing to see that it was the children's belongings that were in that storage unit, private investigator Rich Robertson said. Robertson had been working on the case with JJ's grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock.\n\nThe video shows Vallow and a man visiting the storage unit on multiple occasions after the children went missing in Fall 2019. At one point, a man is seen carrying a heavy tote bag.\n\nIf they had expected the kids to be coming home soon, why would that stuff be in a storage? On the other hand, if they didn't think the kids were ever coming back, why keep it? Robertson asked. Vallow and Daybell have both denied any wrongdoing in the case.\n\nKay Woodcock attended a press conference last week after Vallow ignored a court order to produce the two kids. On Wednesday, the Woodcocks filed a petition to obtain guardianship of JJ.\n\nMeanwhile Vallow and her husband, Chad Daybell, were last seen in Hawaii at the end of January after both of their former spouses, and Vallow's brother, all died under what authorities call suspicious circumstances over the past eight months.\n\nRobertson, the private investigator working with JJ's grandparents, said that one of the victims, Vallow's ex-husband Charles, had a $1 million life insurance policy.\n\nAt this point we think that Lori Vallow believed she was the beneficiary, he said.\n\nA legal expert who spoke to CBS News said that a lack of evidence could be why Vallow has not yet been arrested. A contempt charge for failing to produce the children as the court ordered could be a possibility, though it is likely insufficient to compel her back to Idaho.
The Senate on Friday overrode President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act, the $740 billion defense policy bill. This veto, in the waning days of Mr. Trump's presidency, marked the first time Congress has voted to override him.\n\nThe final vote tally was 81 to 13, with a two-thirds vote required to overturn the veto. The bill had previously passed in the Senate 84-13 earlier this month, and the House has already voted to override Mr. Trump's veto.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted after the vote that Senate Republicans had missed a big opportunity to get rid of Section 230, one of the portions of the bill he had objected to. Mr. Trump wanted to repeal the social media liability shield, but several members of Congress, including some Republicans, argued that the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was not relevant to national security.\n\nMr. Trump also vetoed the NDAA because of a provision on renaming bases honoring Confederate officials.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has tied a vote on repealing Section 230 to a bill which would increase direct payments to Americans from $600 to $2,000. McConnell has repeatedly expressed his opposition to increasing direct payments, which is supported by Mr. Trump and some Republicans, and so tied it to a repeal of Section 230 knowing that adding a controversial rider would prevent its passage.\n\nMr. Trump has vetoed nine bills during his presidency, but none have been overridden. If successful, this will be the first time one of his vetoes will be overturned. The NDAA is a critical defense bill that has passed every year for decades, so overriding the veto will not necessarily be a controversial vote for Republicans.\n\nCongressional Republicans are mostly still in lockstep with the president, with some refusing to acknowledge President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Several House Republicans and at least one senator, GOP Senator Josh Hawley, are expected to challenge the results of the election when Congress convenes to tally Electoral College votes on January 6.\n\nA few Republicans have criticized their colleagues for being willing to undermine the electoral process and challenge a duly elected president.\n\nLet's be clear what is happening here: We have a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there's a quick way to tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage, Republican Senator Ben Sasse wrote in a post on Facebook on Thursday. But they're wrong — and this issue is bigger than anyone's personal ambitions. Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government.
American envoys are expected in Beijing for talks Monday in a tariff battle over Chinese technology ambitions that threatens to hobble global economic growth.\n\nThe two days of meetings are aimed at carrying out the Dec. 1 truce by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping that postponed additional tariff hikes, the Ministry of Commerce announced Friday. It said the American delegation will be led by a deputy U.S. trade representative, Jeffrey D. Gerrish, but gave no other details of the agenda or participants.\n\nSigns are emerging that the trade war is impacting U.S. businesses. Apple on Wednesday pointed to trade tensions as one reason for weaker-than-expected demand for its flagship iPhone in China. New data released on Thursday suggest the trade war is also taking a toll on the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole.\n\nThe American Embassy in Beijing didn't immediately respond to a request for confirmation and additional details about the new round of trade talks.\n\nArrest tensions\n\nThe talks are going ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on U.S. charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe two governments express interest in a settlement but give no indication their stances have shifted.\n\nThey hope to have positive and constructive discussions, said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang.\n\nThe clash reflects American anxiety about China's emergence as a competitor in telecoms, solar power and other technologies and complaints by Washington, Europe and other trading partners that Beijing's tactics violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nMade in China 2025\n\nTrump wants Beijing to roll back initiatives including Made in China 2025, which calls for state-led creation of champions in robotics, artificial intelligence and other fields. American officials worry those might erode U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nChina's leaders have offered to narrow its politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more soybeans, natural gas and other American exports. But they reject pressure to scrap technology initiatives they see as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nBoth governments face economic pressure to reach a settlement.\n\nChinese economic growth fell to a post-global crisis of 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. Auto sales tumbled 16 percent in November over a year earlier and weak real estate sales are forcing developers to cut prices.\n\nThird-quarter U.S. growth was 3.4 percent and unemployment is at a five-decade low. But surveys show consumer confidence is weakening due to concern growth will moderate this year.\n\nEuropean stance\n\nBeijing has tried in vain to recruit France, Germany, South Korea and other governments as allies against Trump. They criticize his tactics but echo U.S. complaints about Chinese industrial policy and market barriers.\n\nThe European Union filed its own challenged in the World Trade Organization in June against Chinese regulations the 28-nation trade bloc said hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their own technology.\n\nWashington has imposed punitive tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing responded by imposing penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing down customs clearance for U.S. companies and suspending issuance of licenses in finance and other industries.\n\nTariff hiatus\n\nTrump and Xi agreed to a 90-day postponement of more tariff hikes due to take effect Jan. 1. But economists say that is too little time to resolve the sprawling disputes that bedevil U.S.-Chinese relations.\n\nThe decision to hold this week's talks at a deputy minister level reflects the need to work out technical details before higher-level officials make hard political decisions on major issues, said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\n\nThe dispute has rattled companies and financial markets that worry it will drag on global economic growth that is showing signs of declining.\n\nFor their part, Chinese officials are unhappy with U.S. curbs on exports of dual use technology with possible military applications. They complain China's companies are treated unfairly in national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\n\nMore exports\n\nChinese exports to the United States held up through late 2018 despite Trump's tariff hikes. But that was due partly to exporters rushing to beat new duties — a trend that is fading.\n\nSome manufacturers that serve the United States have shifted production to other countries.\n\nThe investment bank UBS said Friday that 37 percent of 200 manufacturers surveyed said they have shifted out of China over the past 12 months. It said the threat of U.S. tariff hikes was the dominating factor for nearly half, while others moved due to higher costs or tighter environmental regulation.\n\nAnother 33 percent of companies said they plan to move out of China in the next six to 12 months, according to the UBS report.\n\nDespite the December truce, most firms expect trade war to escalate, the report said.
Stay-at-home orders issued across the U.S. have made it a challenging time to run a political campaign. And it's even more difficult to ask voters —and supporters — for cash to help fuel these operations. In three weeks, more than 16 million U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits as efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus shut down businesses across the country. With so many people suffering economic devastation because of the novel coronavirus and uncertain of what the future holds, candidates are faced with a conundrum.\n\nHow do you ask someone to give money to a campaign right now, wondered Charleston County Democratic Party Chair Colleen Condon. I don't know how you do it. I don't know how anybody does it.\n\nIt's a question that candidates and supporting organizations are grappling with across the nation. Many struggle with asking for cash even in the best of times, but for better or for worse, money is still what fuels a campaign, so now, it's about striking a delicate balance.\n\nOn fundraising, it's definitely a huge challenge, especially for down-ballot candidates who don't have as big of a network to work with, said Ianthe Metzger, deputy director of campaign communications for Emily's List, which supports progressive women candidates. If we do get back to normal in a few months, candidates are going to need the resources to get them over the finish line, so we're not telling them to stop fundraising, just to kind of really talk to people, she adds.\n\nPeople are incredibly stressed. They're stressed about their job, they're stressed about are they going to bring the virus home to their kids, said Dr. Kayser Enneking, a Democrat running for a Florida state House seat. This is not the time for me to call and say, 'hey, by the way you know, I know you want better government and that costs a lot of money to do.' And so, that's been really challenging because we know how political campaigns run — they run on money.\n\nOne Republican House strategist told CBS News he expects small-dollar fundraising is going to be hardest hit by this pandemic.\n\nIf you're a restaurant or retail worker that's been furloughed, it's really hard to keep chipping in your $10 or $15 contribution online when you're worried about when your next paycheck is going to come, he said.\n\nWe're telling candidates, they're going to have to exercise some judgment on a lot of this right now, said Ross Morales Rocketto, co-founder of Run for Something which focuses on recruiting progressive young candidates for down-ballot races.\n\nHis organization and others are encouraging candidates to continue making calls to supporters, including those who donate money. Ted Terry, the first vice chair for the Georgia Democratic Party, is running for a county commission seat. He said during this pandemic, he's continued to make calls because people are continuing to donate when they can.\n\nA lot of times you're calling people that you already know are...big Democrats, said Terry. They already care about these issues — it's just a matter of do they have money now or are they waiting till the end of the month because they just gave their discretionary fund to support the local food bank and…next month, they'll be able to support your campaign.\n\nIn some cases, the calls have shifted from candidates explaining their own efforts to checking in with their constituents and their well-being. If people are struggling, it's best to nix the hard ask. Run for Something has also suggested candidates go through their lists and ensure they're not calling health care workers or other essential personnel on the frontlines of the pandemic and those who may have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic.\n\nAt the same time, down-ballot campaigns that are no longer holding in-person fundraising events have turned money-raising gatherings into virtual ones. Zoom happy hours have been popping up for candidates up and down the ballot. One held a movie night online and another brought donors together with online Bingo. Ted Terry said his team is beginning to experiment with Zoom fundraisers too, and in a couple weeks he plans to integrate yoga into his online fundraising. A yoga instructor has offered to conduct an online class and donate all the proceeds to his campaign.\n\nWe're not trying to just be like 'hey let's all get on a Zoom call and just talk to each other for 30 minutes, said Terry. We're trying to think outside the box.\n\nEven without the overt asks, donations are going up in some cases. Health care professionals-turned-candidates have, for example, seen a bump in funding as more people determine they want to support people with this kind of expertise representing them in government. Other candidates with health care backgrounds have become a vital resource for constituents.\n\nThey are texting me and they're saying, 'you know, I have a fever. Do you think I need a COVID test?' [Or] '...should I be wearing a face mask? You know, is it okay for me to go to the grocery store?' I mean just some basic questions that they need somebody to turn to and because they know that I have a public [profile], they know how to find me and they know I'll answer it and answer it as truthfully as I can, said Enneking, a University of Florida anesthesiologist.\n\nZoom webinar with Dr. Kayser Enneking, a Florida state House candidate, bottom of photo. screengrab\n\nWhile Enneking said fundraising is a crucial part of campaigning, she doesn't believe it's appropriate for her right now.\n\nI don't want people to think that I am using this virus as a political tool to highlight the fact that I'm a doctor, said Enneking. What this is about is saying 'yes, I am a doctor and I understand the science, and I understand that policy affects health outcomes, and that's why we need people that understand medicine here.'\n\nOthers not in the health care field but with strong views on the current system here have addressed the coronavirus in their own fundraising pitches.\n\nIn an email to supporters, M.J. Hegar, who's running to unseat Texas Senator John Cornyn solicited donations under the subject line, Help me defend our health care. Others have sent out similar pleas by text message.\n\nWe have to do [fundraising] with empathy and putting our values first, said Andrew Feldman from the National Democratic Training Committee, which serves as a resource for Democrats running at every level. Connecting with potential donors with the values your campaign believes in, which are issues largely that we're seeing that if implemented would have helped this crisis… issues like affordable universal health care, sick leave. I mean, these are things that Democrats have been leading on for a long time.\n\nIn terms of hard numbers, it's unclear what the pandemic's overall impact on campaign cash funds the pandemic will be. According to one Democratic strategist, Democratic House candidates started off 2020 with very strong numbers, but there was a dip towards the tail end of the quarter. There will likely be a clearer picture at the end of the second quarter. Same goes for Senate candidates.\n\nI think the impacts of not being able to do events and doing virtual fundraising won't really hit until next quarter, said an aide on a Democratic Senate campaign. People have concerns about their own livelihood, so they're less inclined to donate. I'm sure we'll see that in the next quarter.\n\nDemocratic Senate races will continue to raise the resources they need, but right now they are all focused on supporting their communities, providing reliable information, and putting forward real solutions to help address this crisis, said DSCC spokesperson Stewart Boss.\n\nIn a memo sent in early March, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Emmer told members to be sensitive that your donors may have suffered financial losses during this pandemic. While large gatherings fundraiser may be impractical or illegal depending on your location, you can still sit down and make fundraising calls and touch base with donors asking how they are.\n\nBeing able to come off of Super Tuesday with a big win, really did put some wind in our sails to get through March. Obviously we wanted more wind, but you never know what happens when the whole world stops, Texas House Republican candidate Genevieve Collins told CBS News. She also pointed to delays in the passage of the stimulus package as a potential issue boosting small dollar donations. In a time where we really have to meet people at their most basic needs, to stall something...really hurts the majority of Americans and is very distasteful in Dallas. And people are mad about it and are quite frankly, capable of giving $25. You know they're not giving $2,800 but they're giving what they're feeling, what they're comfortable to give.\n\nWinRed, the platform used by Republican candidates to raise funds, had anticipated seeing a decrease in funding as coronavirus precautions went into effect but did not see a significant dip in the first quarter. The platform hauled in nearly $130 million for Republicans over the first three months of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the organization ActBlue which Democrats use for fundraising has not released fundraising totals since the outbreak began, but it has promoted resources to help candidates and progressive organizations navigate asking for cash under the current circumstances.\n\nWhen civilian life will be returning to some semblance of normal remains unknown. With that in mind, multiple candidates confirmed to CBS News, they're already considering options should they be forced to carry on a virtual campaigns heading into the general election.
Batten down the hatches, hurricane season is around the corner.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said today it expects an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season this year, which extends from June to December. NOAA forecast between 11 and 17 named storms, of which five to nine could actually become hurricanes with winds of 74 miles per hour or higher, and two to four of them could reach 111 miles per hour.\n\nHurricane season outlooks have a tendency -- like many weather forecasters -- to be wrong. And when meteorologists do err on cyclones, they do so very publicly. When a hurricane wallops the East or Gulf Coast, TV cameras focus on the devastation, while announcers report that they got it wrong again.\n\nThis year, like any other, somebody is bound to be wrong. The Colorado State University (CSU) Tropical Meteorology Project said in April that, based on cooler ocean temperatures, it expected a slightly below average season of major storms. But Global Weather Oscillations, which boasts that it has the most accurate predictions, said that years 2017 and 2018 would be the most active and dangerous in a decade.\n\nSo who should you believe?\n\nDoes it really matter? asked Julie Rochman, the head of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) in Tampa, Florida, the heart of hurricane country. It only takes one bad storm for you to be part of the 'hit' parade on TV saying, 'We thought it could never happen here!\n\nRochman gets her kicks deliberately blowing down houses and conducting other weird wind and water experiments so that the IBHS can see exactly how buildings and property get damaged during a storm. And she has a lot of advice for protecting yourself from the 100- or 500-year storm that just might hit this year and perhaps next year, too.\n\nAmericans have become complacent about hurricanes in recent years, even though there have been some severe storms, such as 2016's Hurricane Matthew, which devastated Haiti and then went on to kill 43 people in the Southeast U.S.\n\nBut the profit motive and the desire for waterfront property is getting the better of many people as major storms like Katrina and Sandy begin to fade, said Loretta Worters, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the property-casualty insurance industry.\n\nEven though lately tornadoes have gotten a lot more attention than hurricanes, remember that it only takes one hurricane in a densely populated area to cause vast devastation, she said.\n\nHere's a sobering statistic: If a storm the size of Miami's monster 1926 hurricane hit today, the damage would be at least $125 billion, or three times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the worst the U.S. has suffered so far. That's because many more people are living in harm's way, added Worters.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau data shows that the population of coastal counties, which contain 14 of the nation's 20 largest metropolitan areas, grew by 84 percent from 1960 to 2008. In contrast, the population in noncoastal counties increased by only 64 percent during the same period.\n\nThe nine states with the highest population density are located along the East Coast and the five states experiencing the biggest increase in population -- California, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Virginia -- are also situated on the coast. According to AIR Worldwide, the insured value of property in coastal states has historically doubled each decade.\n\nAny victim of Sandy or Katrina will tell you that flooding is the worst part of the storm. And it's only likely to get worse if, as The New York Times just pointed out, an Antarctica meltdown raises sea levels by as much as six feet.\n\nFlood damage is excluded under standard homeowners' and renters' policies, but it's available as a separate policy from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). It's also sold as excess coverage from a few private insurers that provide policies for high-value homes and businesses worth more than $250,000.\n\nBut despite warnings from insurers and the media, an III poll conducted in 2016 showed that only 12 percent of American homeowners had flood insurance, compared to the 14 percent that had this coverage in 2015. Even though, according to the NFIP, during the term of a 30-year mortgage, a property owner is 26 times more likely to suffer flood damage than fire dam­age.\n\nA homeowners' policy doesn't necessarily protect you against all the wind damage from a hurricane, either. Homeowners should be aware that they may have a hurricane or windstorm deductible, said the III's Worters. A homeowner could be responsible for anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the loss, though in areas where homes are close to the coast that deductible could be as high as 10 percent.\n\nMore and more companies are indicating the actual dollar amount you'll be responsible for rather than the percentage to make it less confusing for homeowners, said Worters. For example, if you have a 1 percent deductible and your home is worth $200,000, you would be responsible for $2,000. But if you're a beachfront resident with a 10 percent deductible and your home is worth $1 million, the first $100,000 in wind losses is on you.\n\nIs there any good news? Hurricanes come with built-in warning periods, said the IBHS's Rochman. You get time to prepare. And here are her suggestions for doing so:
Three unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. government custody have tested positive for the coronavirus, federal officials said Thursday, highlighting concerns among advocates about the vulnerability of detained immigrants during the global pandemic.\n\nThe three minors, who are housed in a shelter in New York, are the first confirmed coronavirus cases among the 3,600 unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR. In response to the outbreak, the refugee agency has stopped releasing migrant children in New York facilities to sponsors, who are typically family members living in the U.S.\n\nNo further discharge restrictions have been made as of Thursday, an ORR spokesperson said. The agency had previously stopped placing minors in shelters and programs in California, New York and Washington. In addition to the three confirmed cases, ORR has tested 15 other children in its custody as of Thursday. Eleven results came back negative and the rest are pending. The agency is consulting with local health authorities in New York to determine next steps.\n\nOfficials also revealed on Thursday that the number of positive coronavirus cases among staff members and contractors at facilities for unaccompanied migrant children has grown to seven. Six of them work in New York and one is a staff member in Texas. A foster parent in Washington also tested positive for the virus earlier this month. The refugee agency said it is also notifying anyone who may have been exposed to the workers.\n\nCoronavirus is particularly dangerous for older people and those with underlying medical issues, but children and young people can carry and transmit the virus, even if the risk of serious illness is relatively low. Migrant minors in ORR custody crossed the southern border without parents or guardians, or in certain circumstances, were separated from them.\n\nIn this September 24, 2019, photo, girls play dominos with a staff member at a shelter for migrant teenage girls, in Lake Worth, Florida. Wilfredo Lee / AP\n\nThe announcement on Thursday is likely to fuel even more calls for the Trump administration to quickly release some of the tens of thousands of immigrants it is currently detaining, especially as the public health crisis to contain the coronavirus intensifies. On Wednesday, lawyers asked a federal court in California to require officials to release unaccompanied migrant children who have been in government custody for more than a month or transfer them to facilities where social distancing can be reasonably practiced.\n\nSimilar calls have been made for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to reduce its detainee population, which stood at more than 38,000 over the weekend. Despite confirmed coronavirus cases among detainees and staff at detention facilities, the agency has not moved to significantly downsize its detainee population.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, ORR, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is also prioritizing placing migrant children in local facilities after receiving them from Department of Homeland Security officials, who are generally the first to apprehend unaccompanied minors near the southern border. Officials said the move is designed to avoid air travel.\n\nLast week, ORR leadership also issued guidance requiring that migrant children in its custody undergo mandatory temperature checks twice day, agency officials said. If a child has a temperature higher than 100 degrees, the shelters have to notify the government.\n\nUnder U.S. law, the Department of Homeland Security is generally required to transfer unaccompanied migrant children in its custody to ORR within 72 hours. The children stay in ORR custody until they are released to sponsors.\n\nTwo years ago, the agency struggled to house the thousands of minors who the Trump administration separated from their parents or guardians as part of the controversial zero tolerance policy.
We're beginning to see the economic impact of coronavirus in unemployment claims at the national level, but CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster says economists are warning that the worst is still to come. According to Labor Department data released on Thursday, there were 281,000 seasonally adjusted initial unemployment insurance claims for the week ending March 14. This measures people who hadn't filed for unemployment insurance the week before. The number of claims was up 33% from the previous week and was the highest number of initial claims since September 2, 2017, right after Hurricane Harvey.\n\nThe increase in initial claims are clearly attributable to impacts from the COVID-19 virus, the Labor Department said in a news release. But the unemployment insurance numbers released today cover a period of time before some states ordered restaurants to close their doors, except for takeout and delivery services, and told bars, theaters, gyms and other businesses to close to help stem the spread of the outbreak. That impact will be seen in next week's numbers.\n\nWhile the jump today would be staggering in normal times, early unemployment figures from states this week indicate there could be a huge spike in claims when data is released next week, according to Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. The initial claims number that will be printed next Thursday, so it won't be official until then, but ones printed next Thursday will show over a million initial claims. It may show one and a half million, Wolfers said. So this morning you saw it rise by 70,000, which is about a third. It's going to rise by a factor of five.\n\nIn an analysis for the New York Times, Wolfers found 629,899 claims filed in just 15 states this week. More than 80,000 claims were filed in California on Tuesday, according to Governor Gavin Newsom, compared to 2,000 on a normal day. Minnesota has seen more than 50,000 claims filed this week. The Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency is experiencing a more than 550% increase in claims compared to normal anticipated activity at this time of year, according to Erica Quealy, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.\n\nWhen there's a slow drip of businesses closing, economists can spend months debating whether there's a recession. Now, many have been forced to close their doors at once due to Coronavirus, which will lead to terrifying numbers for the coming weeks.\n\nWe expect the next two to three weeks to be terrifying, Wolfers said. All of those job losses that would normally occur over several months are going to occur over several weeks. What's not clear is whether there will be job losses beyond those expected in the next few weeks that are directly attributable to social isolation, Wolfers said. It will take some time to tell if there's a significant round of job losses that follows the initial wave caused by businesses closures. One literally quite important thing to say is no one knows anything, Wolfers said. And that may actually make you optimistic right now because it could be that we're wrong about lots of negative effects as well.\n\nIn an effort to blunt the losses from closing dine-in services, restaurant owners are encouraging people to continue ordering delivery and take-out, according to CBS News reporter Kate Smith. Some establishments are offering the services for the first time and say it's allowing them to keep some of their employees working close to full schedules. L'Artusi, a downtown Manhattan Italian restaurant, had never done delivery before this week. Kevin Garry, the owner and managing partner of Epicurean, the restaurant group behind L'Artusi, said when we turned it on, we had an amazingly positive response. Business has been so good that L'Artusi has been able to offer their kitchen employees close to a full schedule, Garry said.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nWith the 2020 race seemingly on the back burner as the nation focuses on the immediacy of the Coronavirus, Joe Biden's campaign has been actively trying to shift its message online during the pause of public campaign events, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. One strategy they're employing is blistering responses to President Donald Trump's response-related daily press conferences. Today's headline from the Biden team: Trump Lies After Spending Months Downplaying Coronavirus and Ignoring Scientists and Experts Who Sounded the Alarm.\n\nIn a statement, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said, Time after time, President Trump has failed the American people through his negligent and incompetent response to a global health pandemic — squandering months as he blithely downplayed its risks. Biden's campaign pointed to seven examples of statements from Mr. Trump between January 22 and March 9 which they say shows the White House downplayed the growing threat of the virus.\n\nThe continued focus on the pandemic also allows Biden to defend the legacy of former President Obama. The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19, Biden tweeted, Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nThe campaign for Bernie Sanders reached out to supporters today via email in a note signed by the Vermont senator, CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte reports. The note followed up on what we've heard Sanders talk about this past week regarding COVID19 – they're looking for folks to share stories on how the virus is impacting them and what they need to get through this time. As was the case in his email yesterday, there was no donation ask; however, hyperlinks throughout the message routed to his website, which is bugged with ActBlue Donation tabs. The main point to be made is that in this period of crisis it's imperative that we stand together […] This is a moment that we have got to be working together and going forward together, it reads. The letter asks for supporters to share their experiences but also sign a petition to show support for Sanders' COVID-19 agenda.\n\nIf the campaign is on its last legs, a note like this reminds that Sanders and his staff speak to supporters as a tight-knit community. At the same time, the information collected could used to show Biden and the Democratic establishment an indisputable tally of Sanders' coalition, which could arm Sanders with some leverage.\n\nLIFE AFTER 2020\n\nTULSI GABBARD\n\nHawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard announced in a Twitter video that she is suspending her presidential campaign, leaving former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders competing for the Democratic nomination. In the video, Gabbard said she is offering her full support for Biden in order to unify the country. The endorsement of Biden is a shift for Gabbard, who endorsed Sanders in the 2016 presidential election after resigning from her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAlthough I may not agree with the Vice President on every issue, I know that he has a good heart and he is motivated by his love for our country and the American people, Gabbard explained in her Twitter video. I'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha -- respect and compassion -- and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Gabbard consistently polled in the low single digits and failed to make the debate stage as the nominating contests were underway. CBS News estimated that Gabbard received two delegates from American Samoa.\n\nMONEY MATTERS\n\nCAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING\n\nAs the campaign rallies and town halls come to a grinding halt due to fears over coronavirus, one political activity has not yet been canceled: campaign fundraising. CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns and CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice say presidential and congressional campaigns must adjust to a strange new world of digital rallies, tele-town halls and ground-game operations, but fundraising is an area that has already been working effectively online and candidates have long been investing in and growing digital fundraising tools and see it as a critical campaign function.\n\nOn Thursday, CBS News confirmed that the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have suspended in-person fundraising events, but digital fundraising efforts will continue. President Trump and the RNC have the strongest fundraising operation in presidential history and our unmatched data and digital operation make us uniquely equipped to sustain a digital fundraising operation, said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh in a statement.\n\nAs it is, we are in an incredibly strong position. While we are temporarily suspending in-person fundraising events, we will still be able to gather support from Americans who fully support President Trump, his accomplishments, and his leadership, he said.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden's campaign has also not been holding in-person fundraisers of late but his team is exploring digital fundraising options. We're raising money digitally, doing virtual fundraisers [and will] continue to be creative about how to use video or multimedia elements, says Biden Campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo, arguing that President Trump's handling of the pandemic has caused an even greater sense of urgency among Democrats to oust him from office while generating enthusiasm around Biden's candidacy.\n\n\n\nAfter Sunday's debate — which showed Biden and Bernie Sanders standing a socially distant six feet apart and bumping elbows instead of shaking hands — the Biden campaign had its best debate fundraising haul, surpassing each of the past 10 previous debate nights. The handling of COVID-19 was a chief topic of discussion. The outbreak comes as the Democratic presidential primary is wrapping up with Biden leading Sanders in the delegate count 1,093 to 802. Such a moment would, in normal times, present a prime fundraising opportunity for the Biden campaign.\n\nAt this point historically, what would happen is we'd aggressively start to pivot to the general election to talk about joint fundraising committees with the DNC and really building the infrastructure to really compete with the Republicans in November, said Rufus Gifford, President Obama's 2012 campaign finance director and a supporter of Biden. It will be generally harder to raise money at a time when people are concerned… It's not the easiest or best time to raise money, so you have to acknowledge that reality especially considering we don't know how long that's going to last.\n\n\n\nBut the pandemic and the ensuing economic instability make asking for money a delicate task. With people's jobs and livelihoods at stake — candidates have to consider the sensitivity around raising money in a time of crisis as other aspects of daily life have come to standstill. You have to be a little mindful that there's lots of stuff going on that might prevent someone from being able to contribute or to contribute as much as they would want to, said Ducklo.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nCONNNECTICUT\n\nOn Thursday, the Governor of Connecticut Ned Lamont announced he would be postponing the state's presidential primary scheduled for April 28 amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says this makes Connecticut the sixth state to delay its 2020 primary following Maryland, Ohio, Louisiana, Georgia and Kentucky.\n\nIn coordination with other states and our Secretary of the State, and in an effort to carry out Democracy while keeping public health a top priority, I have decided to move our presidential primary to June 2nd, Lamont first stated in a tweet. My most important concerns are allowing every Connecticut voter to make their voice heard in the selection of the presidential candidates, and ensuring that they are able to cast their ballots as safely as possible, posted Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill on Twitter. Moving the primary date is a good first step, and will give our local election officials more time to prepare. Changing an election date is not something we do lightly – it's a recognition of the severity & nature of this crisis, and more steps may be necessary to guarantee that every CT voter has an opportunity to cast their ballot.\n\nFour states are still scheduled to hold primaries on April 28, including Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. However, the Rhode Island Board of Elections voted on Tuesday to move the primary from April 28 to June 2 as well but it still awaits the governor's approval.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nTwenty-six lawmakers have had to self-quarantine because of the coronavirus, with many other House members closing their offices to prevent further spread or because of a positive diagnosis of a staffer. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports that these 26 lawmakers include two House members that tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Ben McAdams of Utah.\n\nIn a Tweet, Diaz-Balart said that he will remain in his Washington D.C. apartment to avoid contact with his wife in South Florida, who has a pre-existing condition. I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better. However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus.\n\nThe question of how Congress can function and act on emergency legislation, in a time of social distancing in response to a disease that appears to have greater impact on older populations, still remains to be seen. In a letter, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the House, which is currently in recess, will not return until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis. Hoyer added, I share the concerns of many Members regarding the number of Members on the House Floor at any one time. I therefore expect that the House will adjust our voting procedures in order to follow the CDC's recommendations. No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options.
DALLAS - The price of oil keeps falling. And falling. And falling.\n\nThe cost of crude briefly dipped below $30 a barrel Tuesday, its lowest level in more than 12 years, before climbing back above that threshold before the close of trading. Oil, which had sold for roughly $100 a barrel for nearly four years before beginning to fall in the summer of 2014, is down 17 percent this year alone and is now probing depths not seen since 2003.\n\nAll you can do is forecast direction, and the direction of price is still down, said Larry Goldstein of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, who predicted a decline in oil in 2014.\n\nThe price of crude is down because global supplies are high at a time when demand for it is not growing very fast. The price decline, already more dramatic and long-lasting than most expected, deepened in recent days because economic turmoil in China is expected to cut demand for oil even further.\n\nLower crude prices are leading to lower prices for gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, giving drivers, shippers, and many businesses a big break on fuel costs. The national average retail price of gasoline is $1.96 a gallon.\n\nThat trend is expected to continue. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that the average retail price for gas to hover around $2 a gallon for most of 2016. The agency also predicts that U.S. households will see the lowest heating oil and natural gas bills this winter in more than a decade.\n\nOn Tuesday the Energy Department lowered its expectations for crude oil and most fuels for this year and next. The department now expects U.S. crude to average $38.54 a barrel in 2016.\n\nBut layoffs across the oil industry are mounting, and bankruptcies among oil companies are expected to soar. BP announced layoffs of 4,000 workers on Tuesday. Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, said as many as half of the independent drilling companies working in U.S. shale fields could go bankrupt before oil prices stabilize.\n\nTHERE'S LOTS OF OIL\n\nA boom in U.S. oil production thanks to new drilling technology helped push global supplies higher in recent years. Other major oil producers and exporters in the Middle East and elsewhere have declined to reduce their own output in an attempt to push prices back up. Iran, trying to emerge from punishing economic sanctions, is looking to increase exports in the coming months, which could add further to global oil stockpiles.\n\nThe Energy Department said U.S. crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years. It says global supplies exceed global demand by about 1 million barrels per day on average. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas believe excess inventories won't begin falling until 2017.\n\nThe higher supplies and lower prices haven't translated into rising global demand. Most of the increase in world oil demand over the past several years has come from China, but signs are pointing to much slower economic growth there, which in turn reduces demand for fuels made from crude.\n\nDisappointing reports last week about China's manufacturing sector and a fall in the yuan's value triggered a global stock sell-off and an even more dramatic decline in the price of oil and other commodities.\n\nThe first five days of the year marked the worst start of a year for oil in history, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, and oil has only fallen further since.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS\n\nMotorists are saving every time they fill up. The Energy Information Administration figures that the average U.S. household saved about $660 on gasoline last year compared with 2014, and that the average price for gasoline this year will be $2.03 a gallon, the lowest since 2004.\n\nAirlines, big users of jet fuel, have posted record profits, and other businesses are saving too from cheaper energy.\n\nBut workers in the oil patch have paid the price. About 17,000 oil and gas workers in the U.S. lost their jobs in 2015, but if you include oilfield support jobs the number is about 87,000, according to Michael Plante, an economist at the Dallas Fed who has written about the effect of oil prices on the economy.\n\nEven so, economists say low oil prices are still a net benefit for the U.S. economy.\n\nConsumers have more money in their pocketbooks, said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy consultant who teaches at the University of California, Davis. And for businesses, I can hire more people or buy new equipment because I no longer have to spend that money on energy.\n\nWHEN DOES IT END?\n\nOil traders and Wall Street analysts expect further declines in oil prices in the coming weeks. Several have predicted that prices will fall well below $30 a barrel.\n\nThere are wild cards that could result in a sudden rise in oil. A perennial threat is fighting in the Middle East, which has destroyed production facilities in the past.\n\nJust as $100 oil encouraged the new production that contributed to this plunge in prices, $30 oil is discouraging the big investment needed for exploration and production for the future. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. has fallen by more than two-thirds, to 516 last week from an October 2014 peak of 1,609, according to a closely-watched count by the drilling services company Baker Hughes.\n\nEventually, analysts say, the supply will fall below demand and prices will rise. Oppenheimer's Gheit thinks oil will eventually rise and settle into a range between $50 and $70 a barrel -- but not anytime soon.\n\nThe longer it remains low, the more violent the reaction to the upside is going to be, he said.
As the opioid epidemic continues to wreak havoc on communities across the country, new data looks at where drug abuse is most pronounced and which geographic areas in the United States are most at risk.\n\nThe report from personal finance website WalletHub ranks the 50 states and the District of Columbia across more than a dozen key metrics, ranging from the rate of opioid prescriptions to arrest and overdose rates and meth-lab incidents per capita.\n\nAccording to the report, the 10 states with the biggest drug use problems include:\n\nDistrict of Columbia Missouri New Hampshire Michigan West Virginia New Mexico Indiana Rhode Island Kentucky Pennsylvania\n\nTo determine which states have the biggest drug problems, WalletHub ranked the states in three overall categories: drug use and addiction; law enforcement; and drug health issues and rehab. These categories included 20 relevant metrics that were weighted and averaged to calculate overall score. Among other data points, the metrics included the share of teenagers who used illicit drugs in the past month, overdose deaths per capita, drug arrests per capita, share of adults who needed but didn't receive treatment for illicit drug use in the past year, and the number of substance abuse treatment facilities per 100,000 people.\n\nThe report also includes interviews with experts in the fields of medicine, psychology, criminal justice, and public health policy on ways to combat the opioid epidemic -- indicating just how complex the problem is and how difficult any solutions will be.\n\nThere won't be a silver bullet that will solve this epidemic, said Courtney R. Yarbrough, an assistant professor at Emory University Rollins School of Public Health.\n\nMark Concordia, an associate professor of criminal justice at Roberts Wesleyan College, calls for a multiprong holistic approach that prioritizes treatment over punishment while aggressively pursuing drug dealers with more serious charges.\n\nSharon Levy, MD, president of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA) and an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, points out that it's important to understand addiction as a medical condition rather than bad behavior -- destigmatizing the problem and making it easier for someone suffering to get help.\n\nAddiction is a chronic medical disorder in which patients lose control over drug use, Levy said. It is a treatable condition.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, is expected to announce her plans to form a presidential exploratory committee on Tuesday's Late Show with Stephen Colbert, according to a person familiar with her planning.\n\nGillibrand is scheduled to appear on the CBS late night program on Tuesday night. If she announces her exploratory committee, as expected, she would become the second U.S. senator — and second female senator — to announce plans to begin the legal process of running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. The 52-year old is one of the most active and outspoken critics of President Trump and she earned acclaim from party activists when she began voting against all of the president's cabinet and senior government nominees in early 2017.\n\nGillibrand would join a Democratic presidential field beginning to take shape. Over the weekend, former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary Julián Castro formally launched his presidential bid, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, launched an exploratory committee on New Year's Eve. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said over the weekend that she plans to form an exploratory committee in the coming days. Several other senators, current and former governors and mayors, and former Vice President Joe Biden are still mulling potential campaigns.\n\nSpokespeople for Gillibrand declined to comment. In recent days, she has announced that her Senate chief of staff, Jess Fassler, and Meredith Kelly, a former communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), would be joining the senior staff of her prospective campaign.\n\nGillibrand is the junior senator from the state of New York and was appointed to the seat in January 2009 to replace former Sen. Hillary Clinton, who had stepped down to serve as secretary of state. Previously, she was known as a moderate Democrat representing New York's North Country who openly touted her support of gun rights. But her positions on many policy issues took a decidedly liberal turn once she began serving the Empire State and she became an outspoken proponent of stricter gun laws, comprehensive immigration reform and women's rights. She won her first full term to the Senate in 2012 and was reelected this past November.\n\nIn the Senate, she's used her perch on the Armed Services Committee to push for the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy that banned gay men and lesbians from serving in the military. Last year she was the first Senate Democrat to call on former Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, to resign amid accusations of inappropriate behavior towards women. She also sits on Senate committees focused on agriculture, aging and the environment.\n\nBefore running for Congress in 2006, Gillibrand once served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and later as a Manhattan-based attorney who worked for a firm that represented Philip Morris, the cigarette company.\n\nGillibrand graduated from Dartmouth College and received her law degree from University of California Los Angeles. She is the author of the book Off the Sidelines: Speak Up, Be Fearless, and Change Your World, and a children's book named Bold & Brave: Ten Heroes Who Won Women the Right to Vote.
While all eyes were on the impeachment trial in the Senate on Thursday, the House passed a pair of bills intended to constrain President Trump's ability to launch attacks on Iran. However, the White House has issued veto threats for these bills, even if they are taken up and approved by the Senate.\n\nThe first bill, introduced by Congressman Ro Khanna, was modeled after an amendment which was stripped from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) during negotiations last year. The bill would prohibit Mr. Trump from using government funds to engage in conflict with Iran without the express permission of Congress.\n\nThe second bill, sponsored by Congresswoman Barbara Lee, is a repeal of the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq (AUMF), which the Trump administration used as part of its justification for the strike which killed Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani earlier this month. The legislation targeted Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction he was believed to have, but it also allowed for use of force as a part of the prosecution of the war on terrorism.\n\nWe need to reassert our congressional authority, Lee said in an interview with CBS News on Wednesday. She called the 2002 AUMF a terrible, terrible authorization which was based on lies by the Bush administration.\n\nThe repeal of it is long overdue, Lee continued.\n\nThe White House issued veto threats against the bills proposed by Khanna and Lee on Monday. In a statement of administration policy, the White House said Lee's bill would undermine the president's ability to defend United States forces and interests in the region against ongoing threats from Iran and Iranian-sponsored proxies. However, Mr. Trump appeared to send a conflicting message with a tweet on Wednesday, urging representatives to vote their heart.\n\nOn the Iraq War Resolution being voted on tomorrow in the House of Represenatives [SIC], we are down to 5000 soldiers, and going down, and I want everyone, Republican and Democrat, to vote their HEART! Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nLee said that even if the Senate chose not to vote on Khanna's bill or hers, she would not be deterred.\n\nWe don't play by their rules, Lee said, condemning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for not bringing House-approved to the Senate floor. We can't allow their collusion together on such matters of national security to drive what we do.
WASHINGTON - Since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from record lows last month, the global picture has darkened. Stock markets have plunged. Oil prices have skidded. China's leaders have struggled to steer the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nAll of which raised a delicate question: Did the Fed err in raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade?\n\nDon't expect the central bank to answer or even acknowledge that question when it issues a statement after its latest policy meeting ends Wednesday. But in their meeting, the Fed's policymakers will surely grapple with whether -- and, if so, how -- to respond to an altered economic landscape.\n\nNo one thinks the Fed will suddenly reverse course and roll back the quarter-point increase in its key short-term rate it announced Dec. 16. But some analysts say the Fed might signal that the pace of three or four additional rate increases that many had expected this year could become more gradual -- with perhaps only two rate hikes this year and not starting until midyear.\n\nPeople are just scared right now, said David Wyss, a former Fed staff economist and now an economics professor at Brown University. It isn't just China weighing on things. Europe hasn't solved its problems, we have geopolitical risks in the Middle East and in the United States there is a lack of confidence in the political parties and the candidates.\n\nThe most visible sign of the economic fear has been the sharp fall in the stock market. Even after a gain of 211 points Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average shed more than 7 percent of its value in the first three trading weeks of 2016.\n\nChina has unnerved investors because of an economic slowdown that Beijing seems incapable of managing properly. The country's decelerating growth has shrunk global commodity prices and the emerging market countries that have supplied them to China. Last week, the price of oil reached a 12-year low of $28.15 a barrel before rebounding to around $32 on Friday.\n\nMany see the Fed's December rate hike as a key factor in the stock market's tumble. The move amounted to only a small rise in the Fed's still-extremely low target rate for overnight bank lending. But it signaled that a seven-year period of near-zero rates was ending and that while borrowing costs wouldn't be rising fast, they would be headed steadily up.\n\nThe Fed's critics had warned for years that by keeping rates so low for so long, it was fueling dangerous bubbles in assets such as stocks. Some now see the falling stock prices as the correction that they had forecast would occur after the Fed started raising rates.\n\nOthers say the market's swoon seems hardly due to a small increase in the Fed's benchmark rate. They point instead to China's economic troubles, the slide in oil prices and weakness in some key areas of the global economy. Still, some economists suggest that if the Fed could have foreseen what has ensued in the month since it raised rates, it might have reconsidered.\n\nAt the time they raised rates, it seemed like a reasonable decision, and it certainly has been supported by the strong employment numbers we have seen, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. But starting at the beginning of the year, it seems all hell broke loose. The rather inept handling by Chinese authorities of the stock market troubles in that country has really bothered global markets.\n\nA prolonged drop in the stock market can sometimes -- but certainly not always -- signal an impending recession. Most analysts note that the 6½-year-old economic expansion has lasted longer than most. Yet they don't see a recession as imminent. Behravesh said he puts the possibility of a mild recession starting later this year at around 20 percent. But he said his firm's forecast is for the economy to rebound from a slow final three months of last year to growth of around 2.5 percent this year.\n\nAnd what should the Fed be doing?\n\nAnalysts expect no course shift this week. The Fed may make some slight changes to its policy statement to express concern in particular about intensified global pressures. That could assure investors that the Fed will weigh such developments in deciding when to next raise rates.\n\nThe Fed will probably acknowledge that global economic conditions have deteriorated since the December meeting, but they will balance that by saying U.S. economic conditions have not changed, suggested Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at the Martin Smith School of Business at California State University.\n\nBut, he added, They don't want to be changing policy significantly every month.\n\nSohn foresees only two quarter-point rate hikes this year. But some other analysts think the Fed could stick with the four rate increases that officials had signaled could be coming this year.\n\nI still see four Fed rate hikes this year, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. I believe the market turbulence will abate. The labor market has not been damaged by the turmoil, and job growth will be sufficient to achieve full employment by the middle of this year.
WASHINGTON -- Anyone can book an event at a Trump golf club or hotel, and profits can go to President Trump through his trust. So, who's doing this?\n\nTurkish Airlines, half-owned by the Turkish government, paid for its annual tournament at President Trump's Doral golf course in Miami in April.\n\nLast month, a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates and Turkish Airlines were among the sponsors of a Turkish-American conference at Trump International Hotel, just a few blocks from the White House.\n\nAnd just a month after the inauguration, the government of Kuwait financed a National Day celebration. The site: that same Trump Organization-owned hotel in Washington.\n\nThe president still owns his company, so he still benefits from business generated at his properties.\n\nBut some legal experts say money from foreign governments, like Turkey and Kuwait, spent at Trump properties, might run afoul of the Constitution.\n\nBecause Donald Trump was unwilling to sell his businesses, and he continues to own them, foreign governments continue to have a way of channeling money to him in an effort to influence him and U.S. policy, said Kathleen Clark, who teaches government ethics at Washington University Law School.\n\nThe emoluments clause, which forbids foreign governments from funneling money to the president, was designed to prevent presidential bribery.\n\nSheri Dillon, one of Mr. Trump's attorneys, spelled out how she'd avoid a violation, back in January.\n\nHe is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury, Dillon said.\n\nFlags fly above the entrance to the new Trump International Hotel on its opening day in Washington, D.C. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nThe Trump Organization says it will make that donation at the end of its fiscal year. It created a glossy handout to guide its finance team, but some legal experts say the guidance is ridden with loopholes.\n\nIt says banking, defense, energy, health care and other sectors may not be reasonably identifiable as foreign government entities and therefore may not be included.\n\nKathleen Clark CBS News\n\nThe pamphlet that the Trump Organization put together regarding the emoluments clause, that portion reads like a road map to foreign governments on how to channel money to the president, Clark said.\n\nCBS News asked the Trump Organization if they consider money from Turkish Airlines to be from a foreign government, but it didn't respond.\n\nThe Justice Department says the emoluments clause shouldn't apply to Mr. Trump's situation because it was an existing business and customers are paying market rates.
Amid a parabolic push by big tech stocks this week -- briefly lifting the Nasdaq above 6,100 on Monday for the first time -- Wall Street is bracing for the start of another two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting on Tuesday.\n\nWhile no rate hike is expected as policymakers gauge the effect of their quarter-point rate hike in March, the third increase of this tightening cycle that started in December 2015, all eyes will be on how officials interpret recent unevenness in the economic data.\n\nConsider that first-quarter GDP growth slowed to just 0.7 percent amid the worst consumer spending performance since 2009 during a time of ebullient post-election confidence (as measured by a multitude of surveys) and record stock prices. Consumers, investors and businesses say they're geared up and ready to spend, invest and hire.\n\nBut the on-the-ground reality says something different. And that presents a policy conundrum for the Fed.\n\nAt its last policy meeting in March, the Fed updated its economic projections (forecasting 2 to 2.2 percent GDP growth for 2017) and dramatically quickened the pace of policy tightening: From just two quarter-point hikes in two years, it unleashed its next increase after just three months in response to the post-election surge of confidence and resulting financial market gains.\n\nMoreover, in recent months Fed officials have increasingly discussed the need to reduce the size of the central bank's asset holdings after multiple iterations of bond-buying stimulus since the financial crisis. From around $800 billion before the crisis, the Fed's balance sheet now totals more than $4 trillion.\n\nIn retrospect, this may have been too much too fast. Key leading indicators like loan growth have rolled over dramatically -- with the decline in commercial and industrial lending happening at a pace associated with the last three recessions. CoreLogic recently noted that loan performance -- a key indicator of typical economic expansions and recessions -- is beginning to deteriorate.\n\nConfirming all of this were first-quarter earnings reports out of the financial sector over the past month. Quarter-over-quarter lending at the largest U.S. regional banks declined in the period for the first time since 2013's first quarter. Commercial loan balances didn't change at JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, with Wells Fargo getting dinged for lower mortgage activity as well.\n\nAnd early reads on the second quarter don't look much better: A weaker-than-expected ISM manufacturing index for April suggests the weakness may be continuing. The reading for new orders fell to 57.5 from 64.5, while employment dropped to 52 from 58.9. While any measure over 50 indicates month-to-month growth, this is a rather dramatic slowdown suggesting the post-election confidence boost is fading.\n\nConsumers continue to hunker down as well: The savings rate increased to the highest level since last August in April.\n\nNo wonder then that according to the CME's FedWatch tool, which measures rate hike expectations based on futures trading, the market sees only a 4.8 percent chance of a rate hike this week.\n\nBut the current economic unevenness is expected to fade: For the Fed's June meeting, the market assigns 70 percent odds of at least a quarter-point hike. By the end of the year, short-term interest rates are forecast to be somewhere around 1.5 percent, up from 0.9 percent now. Hope springs eternal, it seems.\n\nWhile the Fed's policy statement will likely be light on detail when it's released Wednesday afternoon, watch for additional insight from Fed officials, including Vice-Chair Stanley Fischer and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Both will speak at an event on Friday at Stanford University. Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at a conference on Friday as well, but according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts, she isn't expected to comment on policy.
BEIJING -China is consolidating its ability to censor the Internet by drafting rules requiring businesses that serve domestic Internet users to register their Web addresses inside the country, a move seen as targeting Chinese companies but that has raised concerns among foreign businesses.\n\nIn its most draconian interpretation, the proposed requirements could also further limit access within the Chinese network, analysts said. That appears to be the latest step by the ruling Communist Party to erect cyberbarriers in the name of what some officials call Internet sovereignty.\n\nThis expands control over domestic Internet operators and contributes to the gradual buildup of the capability underpinning Internet sovereignty, said Rogier Creemers, an expert on Chinese media policy at the University of Oxford.\n\nUnder the draft regulations released this week by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, any firm that provides services to Chinese users must register its domain, or Web address, with a Chinese provider. The rules are found in Article 37 of the ministry's proposed update to a set of decade-old Internet laws.\n\nAnalysts said the main targets appear to be Chinese Internet companies that store their content domestically but keep their Web address registered overseas with reputable, international firms for security purposes.\n\nRequiring them to shift their registration to a domestic provider under Chinese government control would allow censors to react more quickly in blocking access to certain sites, said Long Weilian, an info-tech consultant based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen who has blogged extensively on the issue.\n\nBefore, they had to contact the server, get the address, talk to the manager and then ask them to censor something, Long said. If the domains are all domestic, they can directly stop traffic going to your domain with a command.\n\nJacob Parker, vice president for China operations with the U.S.-China Business Council, which lobbies the Chinese government on trade policy, said his group was concerned that the rules would block the free flow of information.\n\nAny kind of restrictions would undermine China's broader economic development goals, Parker said.\n\nConcerned that a borderless, U.S.-led global Internet could weaken its political control, China's government has repeatedly issued Internet regulations that have drawn criticism from Western trade groups. Following pushback from the White House last year, China dropped a provision in a cybersecurity law that would require companies to keep Chinese user data at facilities in China, allowing the government access to personal information.\n\nQuestions remain about the new rules' true purpose and how strictly they would be enforced. The ministry is currently soliciting feedback on the proposed registration regulations, and Chinese laws are often softened during the revision process.\n\nFang Xingdong, the director of a top Chinese technology think tank, said he believes Chinese leaders are seeking to enhance their control, but not to wall China off from the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the current wording, all this is doing is integrating large Chinese Web service providers under a more rigorous supervision framework, while most small businesses won't be affected, said Fang, whose organization regularly submits opinions to the government on Internet issues.\n\nAny attempt to seal off the Chinese Internet would hurt China as much as America, he said.
As the coronavirus pandemic shuts down business across the county, a surge in newly laid off workers is crashing states' unemployment websites.\n\nIn Ohio, more than 48,000 people applied for jobless benefits during the first two days of this week — 26 times the amount from the week before.\n\nIn neighboring Pennsylvania, about 70,000 people sought unemployment aid in a single day — six times the total for the entire previous week.\n\nIn Kentucky, the state's unemployment assistance site and phone lines went down amid a fourfold surge in applications.\n\nOregon's unemployment website went down on Monday, just as the state's governor was announcing a closure of bars and restaurants.\n\nNew York State on Tuesday received 21,000 calls from people asking about unemployment benefits — a tenfold increase from the week before. Website visits tripled, periodically crashing the system.\n\nGenna Guglietta said she spent two days trying to apply for unemployment benefits in New York. The first night I couldn't even get past logging in, she told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nGuglietta waits tables at a restaurant in Hudson, New York, and lost her job when the restaurant closed its doors to comply with a statewide ban on eat-in dining. Her boyfriend, a sous chef at the same restaurant, was laid off, too.\n\nOn Tuesday, she was finally able to file for benefits, giving her a bit of relief but adding fresh worries. I have no idea how much I'll be receiving, Guglietta said.\n\nIn a typical month, the $1,825 she spends on rent, utilities and car payments takes up about half her paycheck. Her landlord has discounted her rent for the time being, she said, but she's waiting to see if she can cover her bills.\n\nThe full scale of layoffs from coronavirus is not yet known. Some 4 million hospitality workers could lose their jobs this summer, according to an estimate from the outplacement firm Challenger Gray and Christmas. The Economic Policy Institute estimates 3 million laid-off workers by this summer. The Travel Industry Association estimates 4.6 million workers in that field alone will lose their jobs this year.\n\nThe number of workers filing for unemployment could exceed the 660,000 a week reached during the Great Recession and even the 695,000 hit during the recession of 1982, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a global accounting consultancy.\n\nGiven the three shocks—supply, demand, and financial—that are cascading in the real economy as we speak, we are likely to exceed the all-time high sometime in next two months, Brusuelas said.\n\nThe federal government is scheduled to release unemployment claims data on Thursday, but that number is likely to be incomplete. Because unemployment insurance is handled by states, which set their own procedures, it can take anywhere from two to four weeks for that information to be reported and collected into federal data.\n\nThere's not one uniform rule that frames how somebody applies, and how long it takes to get them a check. It's all done 50 different ways, Brusuelas said. This is going to be a rolling exercise in estimating the damage to the labor market due to the crisis.\n\nAccording to a Marist poll conducted late last week, nearly 1 in 5 workers reported that someone in their household has lost their job or had their hours cut.\n\nAlready, some states are raising concerns about having enough money stockpiled since the last recession to tide over laid-off workers until the crisis ends. Some fear the demand for help could outpace the states' ability to pay claims, the Associated Press reports.\n\nOur unemployment insurance fund is getting hit pretty hard right now, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo told the AP. In that state, coronavirus-related jobless claims went from zero to nearly 18,000 in a single week.\n\nRaimondo, a Democrat, told the AP the state already needed to start replenishing its fund and is appealing for help from the federal government, which she said needed to step up.\n\nMinnesota, meanwhile, is preparing for the largest unemployment payout in the state's history, Twin City Business Journal reported.\n\nWe have had these unemployment crises in the past, and the government has learned to respond to them effectively. But this is not just an unemployment crisis, it's a social crisis, said Michael Merrill, a labor historian at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations in New Jersey.\n\nMerrill is one of many calling for the government to go beyond sending Americans checks: He's asking for a large-scale mobilization of laid-off workers — akin to that during the Great Depression. He pointed to reports that the Trump administration was planning for the pandemic to last as long as 18 months.\n\nA $2,000 check isn't going to do it. It's a help, but it's a very short-term plan, he said. It isn't just an economic panic. It's a war that requires total mobilization.\n\nWith reporting by the Associated Press.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church, the biggest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States, announced Thursday it is pulling as many as 185,000 older youths from the organization as part of an effort to start its own scouting-like program.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said the move wasn't triggered by the Boy Scouts' decision in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders, since Mormon-sponsored troops have remained free to exclude such adults on religious grounds.\n\nBut at least one leading Mormon scholar said that the Boy Scouts and the church have been diverging on values in recent years and that the policy on gays was probably a contributing factor in the split.\n\nCBS affiliate KUTV in Salt Lake City, Utah, reports the LDS Church said it doesn't believe young men between 14 and 18 years old are not being served well by the Varsity or Venturing programs.\n\nThe church said the decision will affect 185,000 teens; the Boy Scouts put the number at 130,000.\n\nThe loss is only a fraction of the 2.3 million youths in the Boy Scouts of America, but the organization has been grappling with declining membership for years and has enjoyed an unusually close bond with the Mormon church for more than a century because of their shared values. Joining the Boy Scouts is practically automatic among Mormon boys.\n\nBoy Scouts of America spokeswoman Effie Delimarkos said the organization is saddened by the decision but understands the church's desire to customize a program.\n\nAbout 280,000 Mormon boys ages 8 to 13 will remain in the Scouts while the church develops its program, the Mormons said. The Boy Scouts estimated their number at 330,000.\n\nKUTV reports the church will continue through 2018 to make the same payment to the Boy Scouts of America for registration of its young men.\n\nLike other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nIn Thursday's announcement, the church said that it learned recently that the Boy Scouts are considering admitting girls, but that its decision was made independently of that.\n\nMatthew Bowman, a Mormon scholar and history professor at Henderson State University, said the schism reflects the two organizations' diverging values, with gays and girls among the issues on which they are moving apart.\n\nThe church is wedded very much to traditional gender roles and they see the Boy Scouts of America increasingly move away from that, Bowman said. That means that they have come to see it as less of a hospitable place.\n\nThursday's announcement represents a first step toward something that has been in the works for years: a Mormon-run scouting-type program that could be used in congregations around the world. The church has 15.8 million members, nearly 6 in 10 of them outside the U.S. and Canada. Scouting is available only in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe long game here is the church looking forward to a time when Americans are even more of a minority in the church than they are now, Bowman said.\n\nMormon teenagers who want to continue working toward the Eagle Scout rank will be able to do that on their own while also participating in the new program, said church spokesman Eric Hawkins.\n\nThe Boy Scout movement has been entrenched in Mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nIn 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the faith's alliance with the Boy Scouts.\n\nA Boy Scout training complex in West Virginia is named after Mormon church President Thomas S. Monson, a longtime member of the Boy Scouts' executive board and a major supporter. Charles Dahlquist II, a Mormon, holds the top volunteer position with the Boy Scouts.\n\nBecoming an Eagle Scout is an especially proud badge of honor within Mormon culture. Many Utah lawmakers list it on their resumes. Social media was buzzing with jokes Thursday about Mormon women adjusting their hopes of finding a husband who was an Eagle Scout.
NEW YORK -- For 108 years, the Boy Scouts of America's flagship program has been known simply as the Boy Scouts. With girls soon entering the ranks, the group says that iconic name will change. On Wednesday, the organization announced a new name for its Boy Scouts program: Scouts BSA. The change will take effect next February.\n\nChief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh said many possibilities were considered during lengthy and incredibly fun deliberations before the new name was chosen.\n\nWe wanted to land on something that evokes the past but also conveys the inclusive nature of the program going forward, he said. We're trying to find the right way to say we're here for both young men and young women.\n\nThe parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts -- its program for 7- to 10-year-olds -- will keep its title, as well.\n\nBut the Boy Scouts -- the program for 11- to 17-year-olds -- will now be Scouts BSA.\n\nA Boy Scout works on a canoe at camp Maple Dell on July 31, 2015 outside Payson, Utah. George Frey/Getty Images\n\nThe organization has already started admitting girls into the Cub Scouts, and Scouts BSA begins accepting girls next year.\n\nSurbaugh predicted that both boys and girls in Scouts BSA would refer to themselves simply as scouts, rather than adding boy or girl as a modifier.\n\nThe program for the older boys and girls will largely be divided along gender-lines, with single-sex units pursuing the same types of activities, earning the same array of merit badges and potentially having the same pathway to the coveted Eagle Scout award.\n\nSurbaugh said that having separate units for boys and girls should alleviate concerns that girls joining the BSA for the first time might be at a disadvantage in seeking leadership opportunities.\n\nSo far, more than 3,000 girls have joined roughly 170 Cub Scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace will intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled Scout Me In.\n\nThe name change comes amid strained relations between the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts of America.\n\nGirl Scout leaders said they were blindsided by the move, and they are gearing up an aggressive campaign to recruit and retain girls as members.\n\nAmong the initiatives is creation of numerous new badges that girls can earn, focusing on outdoor activities and on science, engineering, technology and math. The organization is expanding corporate partnerships in both those areas, and developing a Girl Scout Network Page on LinkedIn to support career advancement for former Girl Scouts.\n\nGirl Scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls, said Sylvia Acevedo, the Girl Scouts' CEO. We are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents who want to provide their girls opportunities to build new skills ... and grow into happy, successful, civically engaged adults.\n\nThe Girl Scouts and the BSA are among several major youth organizations in the U.S. experiencing sharp drops in membership in recent years. Reasons include competition from sports leagues, a perception by some families that they are old-fashioned and busy family schedules.\n\nThe Boy Scouts began as a movement in England in the early 20th century. It took off in America almost immediately as a way to keep young men (as the Scout Oath puts it) physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight. Tens of millions of American boys have taken that oath, and only the most determined attain scouting's highest rank: Eagle Scout, an elite group of American men, from billionaires like Michael Bloomberg to presidents like Gerald Ford.\n\nSince the early 1970s, the Boy Scouts have lost two-thirds of their annual membership -- some four million boys. And that's a tradition they want to change while still preserving almost everything else.\n\nThe Girl Scouts say they have about 1.76 million girls and more than 780,000 adult members, down from just over 2 million youth members and about 800,000 adult members in 2014.\n\nThe overall impact of the BSA's policy change on Girl Scouts membership won't be known any time soon. But one regional leader, Fiona Cummings of Girl Scouts of Northern Illinois, believes the BSA's decision to admit girls is among the factors that have shrunk her council's youth membership by more than 500 girls so far this year.\n\nShe said relations with the Boy Scouts in her region used to be collaborative and now are very chilly.\n\nHow do you manage these strategic tensions? she asked. We both need to increase our membership numbers.\n\nSurbaugh said BSA's national leadership respected the Girl Scouts' program and hoped both organizations could gain strength.\n\nIf the best fit for your girl is the Girl Scouts, that's fantastic, he said. If it's not them, it might be us.
With great fanfare, U.S. equities have climbed out of their Feb. 11 low, reversing what was the worst-ever start to a year and ending a very scary test of last August's market lows. The Dow Jones industrials index climbed back above the 18,000 level for the first time since August and moved within a few hundred points (less than 2 percent) of last May's record high.\n\nWith all that, many have started wondering if the long sideways crawl in stocks that started in late 2014 could finally be ending -- despite fundamental headwinds like weak earnings (first-quarter results expected to be the worst since 2009 and the fourth consecutive quarterly decline in profitability) and tepid GDP growth (the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow first-quarter estimate stands at just 0.3 percent).\n\nWhether a breakout is at hand I can't say one way or another. But here's something worth mentioning: America's stock market rally stands alone. Markets around the planet are much less ebullient, with the MSCI World Index (minus the U.S.) down nearly 15 percent from its high last summer. That suggests caution is warranted.\n\nFirst, the Dow Jones industrials are constrained in a three-year trading range between 16,000 and 18,000 (chart above) as investors struggle to balance catalysts like Federal Reserve policy tightening, the ups-and-downs in crude oil, a stronger dollar, earnings and GDP growth.\n\nSecond, take a look at Japan's Nikkei average, which remains 16.1 percent off of its summertime high and is still well below its 50-week moving average (chart above). GDP growth remains slow, at just a 0.7 percent annual rate. And despite negative interest rates and an aggressive asset-purchase program from the Bank of Japan, inflation is dancing on the edge of negative territory. The specter of deflation is dangerous because of Tokyo's 229 percent government debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nThird, China's Shanghai Composite is still recovering from a dramatic bubble boom-and-bust cycle from 2014 through 2015, which has seen share prices fall nearly 43 percent from their highs (chart above). A two-year-old pattern of lower highs and lower lows remains in play as the Chinese economy grapples with currency volatility, overreliance on credit, capital outflows and a bungled transition away from exports and fixed-asset investment toward services and consumption. And what's happening in China is a big concern for the U.S. Fed, so keep a close eye on that.\n\nFourth, Germany's DAX is down nearly 16 percent from its high last summer as the eurozone contends with a recent flare up of sovereign debt risk, tepid GDP growth (just 1.6 percent annualized), low inflation and still-high joblessness in peripheral countries, like Spain's 20.9 percent currently.\n\nFinally, consider the U.K.'s FTSE index, which is down nearly 10 percent from its high last spring. While GDP growth here is better (at 2.1 percent), recent economic data like retail sales have disappointed (worse performance since January 2014). That suggests headwinds related to Britain's possible exit from the European Union.\n\nCan the U.S. once again be an island unto itself? Investors are about to find out.
LONDON -- Police arrested a protester Monday after he interrupted a campaign event held by British Prime Minister Theresa May. Save our wildlife, kill May the protester shouted as the prime minister arrived at a rally in Wales.\n\nThe man was protesting fox hunting, which May's government has promised to bring back up for a vote should her Conservative Party win national elections on June 8 to remain in power.\n\nThe bloodsport, which was a mainstay of British upper-class society for hundreds of years, was banned 12 years ago.\n\nAs the Conservative's election manifesto, the official party document laying out their policy proposals, is scrutinized, another contentious wildlife policy has emerged -- or rather, disappeared.\n\nThe previous British government, also led by the Conservative Party, or the Tories, as they are commonly known, maintained an official policy of working for a total ban on ivory sales.\n\nThe Independent newspaper reports that Mrs. May's manifesto has quietly dropped that line, and replaced it with a generic call for the protection of endangered species.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is the multi-million-dollar illegal trade in ivory, mostly taken from African elephants by poachers who leave the animals to die. As CBS News' Holly William reported, the trade is making the poachers and traders rich, but so many elephants are being slaughtered that scientists warned in 2014 the species could be completely wiped out within 100 years.\n\nAccording to that study, 100,000 elephants were killed for their tusks over the course of just three years, and more contemporary estimates suggest as many as 20,000 are killed for their ivory every year.\n\nSince 1979, the African elephant's range has shrunk dramatically. The animals have reached what the study's authors call a tipping point -- with more elephants killed each year than there are born.\n\nAny sale or purchase of newly-poached ivory is strictly against the law, including in Britain, but a loophole in British law makes trade in antique ivory items (created in 1947 or earlier) legal. According to the Independent, lax verification required by the law to prove an item's age makes it difficult to enforce.\n\nFor that reason, the previous Tory government policy was to close the 1947 loophole and make all ivory trade illegal – a policy backed by conservation and animal welfare groups.\n\nThe director of PETA, Mimi Bekhechi, told The Independent that her organization would keep pushing for an outright ban.\n\nAs long as animals continue to be beaten into performing in circuses, slaughtered for their ivory, or face being torn apart on fox hunts, PETA will continue to stand with the majority of the British people and urge any future government to do the right thing, whether it pledges to do so in its manifesto or not, she told the newspaper.\n\nMay's Tories have a solid lead over Jeremy Corbyn's rival Labour Party in the polls ahead of the June 8 vote, but the margin has narrowed slightly in recent days.\n\nA significant diversion from a manifesto pledge -- on funding for elderly care -- announced by May on Monday in Wales threatened to further erode her comfortable lead.
Washington — Former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan condemned efforts by a group of Republican lawmakers to reject the electoral votes from some states, saying Sunday that it is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act.\n\nEfforts to reject the votes of the Electoral College and sow doubt about Joe Biden's victory strike at the foundation of our republican, Ryan, a former GOP congressman from Wisconsin who retired in 2018, said in a statement. He called the expected action from House and Senate Republicans a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of Americans.\n\nThe fact that this effort will fail does not mean it will not do significant damage to American democracy, Ryan added.\n\nAt least 100 House Republicans are expected to object to the electoral votes cast in a handful of battleground states when Congress convenes for a joint session Wednesday to tally the votes and certify the election results. On Saturday, a group of 11 Republicans in the Senate said they, too, intend to reject electoral votes from disputed states unless a commission is appointed to conduct a 10-day audit of the results from those states. GOP Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said last week he also intends to object to the certification of electoral votes.\n\nFederal law allows for written objections to a state's electoral votes to be made during the joint session, but they must be signed by at least one senator and one member of the House. Once an objection is properly made, the House and Senate then meet separately to debate for a maximum of two hours before reconvening to vote on the objection. A simple majority in each chamber is needed for the objection to be sustained and the challenged state's votes tossed out. Because Democrats control the House, it's highly unlikely the lower chamber will vote to uphold an objection, and President-elect Joe Biden's win is expected to be reaffirmed despite the challenges from Republicans.\n\nThe last time an objection was made was in 2005, when Democratic Ohio Representative Stephanie Tubbs and California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer challenged the Ohio's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election. Neither chamber voted to sustain the objection and toss the votes, with the Senate voting it down 1 to 74. Multiple house members objected to Florida's electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election, but no senators signed onto the challenge.\n\nRyan joins several other Republicans, including Senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, in criticizing the expected challenges of electoral votes from GOP lawmakers. A group of conservative House members led by Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky also broke with their Republican colleagues and said in a statement Sunday that the electoral votes submitted to Congress by the states should be tallied.\n\nThe text of the Constitution is clear, the seven GOP lawmakers said. States select electors. Congress does not. Accordingly, our path forward is also clear. We must respect the states' authority here. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals. We must count the electoral votes submitted by the states.\n\nStill, the White House has thrown its support behind the efforts from the GOP lawmakers to toss out the votes.\n\nWe're now at well over 100 House members and a dozen Senators ready to stand up for election integrity and object to certification. It's time to fight back, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tweeted Saturday.\n\nMarc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, said in a statement the vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people. Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities, Short said.\n\nDespite repeated baseless claims of fraud and irregularities by various Republican lawmakers and officials, no evidence of widespread voter fraud has been found. Former Attorney General Bill Barr told The Associated Press on December 1, To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election. Christopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the 2020 election was the most secure in American history.\n\nMultiple lawsuits brought by the president's allies alleging fraud in various states have all been thrown out. Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, while arguing a case in Pennsylvania court challenging that state's election laws explicitly stated, This is not a fraud case.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday decided to allow the Trump administration to enforce its ban on transgender troops while litigation over the ban continues, granting the administration a stay. The high court split 5-4 in allowing the plan to take effect, with the court's five conservatives greenlighting it and its four liberal members saying they would not have. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissented.\n\nA U.S. District Court judge had issued an injunction in December 2017 blocking the ban, but the Supreme Court's stay stops that ruling from taking effect for now. The case is still pending in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court will not weigh in on the constitutionality of the ban itself until after that ruling.\n\nAs always, we treat all transgender persons with respect and dignity, Lt. Col. Carla Gleason said in a statement. DoD's proposed policy is NOT a ban on service by transgender persons. It is critical that DoD be permitted to implement personnel policies that it determines are necessary to ensure the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world. DoD's proposed policy is based on professional military judgment and will ensure that the U.S. Armed Forces remain the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world.\n\nUntil a few years ago service members could be discharged from the military for being transgender. That changed under President Barack Obama. The military announced in 2016 that transgender individuals already serving in the military would be allowed to serve openly. And the military set July 1, 2017 as the date when transgender individuals would be allowed to enlist.\n\nBut after President Donald Trump took office, the administration delayed the enlistment date, saying the issue needed further study. While that study was ongoing, Mr. Trump announced via tweet in July 2017 that transgender individuals would be banned from the military, surprising many. LGBTQ advocacy groups filed a lawsuit in Seattle in 2017 challenging the constitutionality of the ban.\n\n— CBS News' Steven Portnoy contributed to this report
TOKYO - The Bank of Japan on Friday said it will charge lenders that leave too much cash on idle deposit with it, introducing a negative interest rate policy for the first time as it seeks to shore up a stumbling economic recovery.\n\nThe surprise move rattled stock market investors, with the Nikkei 225 index swinging between gains and losses after the announcement. It closed 2.8 percent higher, but the Japanese yen slid, with the U.S. dollar rising to about 120.70 yen from about 118.50 earlier in the day.\n\nThe central bank said it's imposing a 0.1 percent fee on some new commercial bank deposits with the BOJ, effectively a negative interest rate. It hopes that will encourage commercial banks to lend more, rather than keeping cash at the BOJ, and stimulate investment and growth in the world's third-largest economy.\n\nThe BOJ said in statement that Japan's economy is still recovering, but risks from volatile global financial markets could undermine confidence and slow progress toward the central bank's 2 percent inflation target.\n\nBank deposits with the BOJ will be divided into three tiers. Existing current account balances will earn a 0.1 percent positive interest rate. Required reserves held at the central bank by financial institutions will earn zero interest. Any additional current account deposits would incur the minus 0.1 percent rate, the BOJ said.\n\nThe bank will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary, it said.\n\nIt said the policy would continue as long as needed to achieve its inflation target. In the meantime, the BOJ pushed back its timeframe for achieving that goal from late 2016 to mid-2017.\n\nWe think there is an increasing risk that an improvement in the business confidence of Japanese firms and the conversion of deflationary mindset may be delayed, and that the underlying trend in prices might be negatively affected, BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said at a news conference.\n\nThe European Central Bank has already imposed negative interest rates, after leaving interest rates near zero failed to entice banks into seeking higher returns through lending.\n\nIn Japan, keeping interest rates near zero has likewise failed to yield the desired results, raising doubts about the credibility of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policies announced by BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda in April, 2013.\n\nData on Friday showed Japan's core inflation rate for 2015, excluding volatile food prices, at 0.5 percent.\n\nThat and other figures show the economy remained anemic last year, as stagnant incomes, the slowdown in China and the mixed blessing of lower oil prices hobbled Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recovery strategy.\n\nConsumer spending fell 4.4 percent in December from a year earlier, as households chose to save rather than splurge on any gains from the low oil prices that are slowing inflation. It was the fourth straight month of year-on-year spending declines.\n\nIndustrial output fell 1.6 percent in December from a year earlier, partly due to slower demand for machinery and electronics components and devices in China.\n\nToday's activity data were disappointing and suggest that Japan's economy barely grew last quarter, Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary.\n\nAbe took office three years ago vowing to get growth back on track through massive injections of cash by the government and central bank, and by sweeping reforms to boost competitiveness.\n\nThe central bank said Friday it would also persist with its quantitative easing purchases of about 80 trillion yen (about $660 billion) of government bonds a year.\n\nThe aim is to end a long spell of deflation, or falling prices, that is thought to be discouraging corporate investment. Indeed, corporate profits have soared as massive stimulus weakened the Japanese currency, making earnings made abroad worth more when converted into yen. But investment and wages have lagged.\n\nAverage incomes fell 2.9 percent from a year earlier in December. Even though unemployment was steady at 3.3 percent and the job market remained tight, companies wary over the economic outlook are opting not to raise pay.\n\nSome economists contend that the Abenomics focus on inflation as a spur to growth is misplaced. Pushing the banks to lend will work only if companies borrow and invest.\n\nCorporate Japan has accumulated substantial cash on balance sheets, while the Japan labor market is getting tighter, Ajay Kapur of Merrill Lynch said in a recent report.\n\nThe key is to recirculate Japan's corporate cash to Japan's household-labor sector via wage increases, he said. Otherwise, 'Abenomics' is likely to fail in generating self-sustaining growth.
President Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Sunday the U.S. military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and on Turkey assuring the safety of Kurdish fighters allied with the United States.\n\nBolton, who traveled to Israel to reassure the U.S. ally of the Trump-ordered withdrawal, said there is no timetable for the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria. He also insisted it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nThose conditions, he said, included the defeat of remnants of ISIS in Syria, and protections for Kurdish militias who have fought alongside U.S. troops against the extremist group.\n\nBolton's comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as Mr. Trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks. The U.S. military has already received orders on the drawdown.\n\nMr. Trump announced in mid-December that the U.S. will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in Syria. Mr. Trump's move has raised fears over clearing the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters in Syria who fought alongside American troops against IS extremists. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nBolton, who is to travel on to Turkey on Monday, said the U.S. is insisting that its Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS are protected from any planned Turkish offensive. He is to deliver a warning to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton tours the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019. Reuters/ZIV SOKOLOV/U.S. EMBASSY JERUSALEM\n\nOne potential issue is whether Erdogan would actually commit not to attack Kurdish allies, who considers terrorists.\n\nWe don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, Bolton said. He said in meetings with Turkish counterparts, he will seek to find out what their objectives and capabilities are and that remains uncertain.\n\nMr. Trump has stated that he would not allow Turkey to kill the Kurds, Bolton said. That's what the president said, the ones that fought with us.\n\nBolton said the U.S. has asked its Kurdish allies to stand fast now and refrain from seeking protection from Russia or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. I think they know who their friends are, he added, speaking of the Kurds.\n\nHe said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford would continue negotiations with his Turkish counterparts this week to seek protection for America's Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nAdditionally, Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who has been serving since August as the special representative for Syrian engagement and was named last week as the American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, is to travel to Syria this week in an effort to reassure the U.S.'s Kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned, Bolton said.\n\nBolton said U.S. troops would remain at the critical area of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region. He defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's Constitutional authority, adding I'm a strong believer in Article II.\n\nThe U.S. is also seeking a satisfactory disposition for roughly 800 ISIS prisoners held by the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition, Bolton said, adding talks were ongoing with European and regional partners about the issue.\n\nBolton is to have dinner Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Sunday evening to discuss the pace of the U.S. drawdown, American troop levels in the region, and the U.S. commitment to push back on Iranian regional expansionism. Bolton was expected to explain that some U.S. troops based in Syria to fight IS will shift to Iraq with the same mission and that the al-Tanf base would remain.\n\nBolton also was to convey the message that the United States is very supportive of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets in Syria, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss Bolton's plans before the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBolton on Sunday also toured the ancient tunnels beneath the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City. He watched a virtual reality tour of the historic site and dined there with his Israeli equivalent, as well as U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer.\n\nVisiting American officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east Jerusalem, which is contested between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Trump himself, however, also toured the area in a previous visit.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem after capturing it from Jordan in the 1967 war, a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
After years of rape, beatings and persecution from notorious gangs in their home countries, 12 Central Americans fled to the United States last year to seek asylum. But then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had just issued a policy change: Domestic and gang violence would not be grounds for asylum.\n\nThey sued, and in December, a federal judge said the policy change was unlawful, and those individuals would get a second chance. But six of them had already been deported back to their native countries and, per the judges orders, ICE agents are responsible for bringing them back. All of six remain in Central America, and the government blames the shutdown.\n\nAmong the plaintiffs still stuck in Central America is Nora, an El Salvadorian women who survived years of beatings and rape by her partner, a known gang member. When Nora attempted to end the relationship in May of last year, her partner's gang targeted her, threatening to rape her and kill her children.\n\nIn May, when Nora was walking home with her three young children, [her partner's friend] pursued her down the street and told her that he knew she lived alone with her children and that he would come to her house at night to have sex with her, according to the original complaint against Sessions' new asylum policy. He showed her a gun in his waistband and then looked to her son, indicating that he would kill them both if she did not submit to his demands.\n\nShortly after the threat, Nora and her son fled El Salvador, seeking asylum in the U.S. Even though an immigration officer believed her story — hers is a typical experience for women in Central America — she did not pass her credible fear interview because of the new policy.\n\nGenerally, asylum is available to anyone who fears persecution in their home country because of their affiliation with one or more of five accepted groups: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or particular social group.\n\nIn his December ruling on the lawsuit, the judge called the policy change arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the immigration laws insofar as those policies are applied in credible fear proceedings.\n\nOf the 12 plaintiffs in the case, Grace v. Whitacker, six had already been deported to Central America, five had been released from detention centers as they awaited removal, and one remains detained, according to Jennifer Chang Newell, an attorney with the ACLU's immigrants' rights project who worked to strike down Sessions' asylum policy.\n\nThe judge ordered that the six who had been removed be brought back to the U.S. for immigration proceedings. But the partial government shutdown has restricted ICE agents' ability to follow through, according to a status report filed by the government Jan. 18. Although ICE agents have been able to locate Nora and her son in El Salvador, they haven't been successful bringing them back to the U.S. yet.\n\nDue to the lapse in appropriations, the normal process for paying departure and passport fees has become complicated, the report said.\n\nSome of the plaintiffs have had to pay their own travel document fees — despite the judge's order saying that would be the government's responsibility — and told that they would be reimbursed eventually, according to the report.\n\nThere's been a few logistical issues getting them back, things like travel documents, passports, parental consent and travel fees, said Newell in a telephone interview with CBS News on Friday.\n\nAs they wait, six of the plaintiffs remain in the countries and situations that prompted them to seek asylum in the first place. Nora and her son continue to fear for their lives, according to the original complaint.\n\nThough the plaintiffs will get a second chance at asylum, thousands others won't.\n\nIf someone has already been removed because of the Sessions decision and they weren't part of the lawsuit, they're just out of luck, said Anne Dutton, an attorney at the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies who also worked on the case, in a telephone interview with CBS News on Friday.\n\nNew asylum seekers won't be held to Sessions' struck-down policy on domestic and gang violence, and have the potential to seek refuge in the United States on those grounds thanks to the ACLU's lawsuit. However, the relief may not last; the government appealed the decision last week.\n\nWhat exactly happens to the plaintiffs next isn't clear. And last week's status report said part of the delay in returning the asylum seekers is because the parties do not agree on the process that will be applied to the Plaintiffs once they are returned to U.S. soil.\n\nThe government argues that upon their arrival in the U.S., Nora, her son and the other four should be detained until their credible fear interview, which could take months to schedule. Lawyers representing the Central Americans, however, believe that they should be able to begin that process without being held in a detention center.
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Tuesday rejected the Justice Department's claim of executive privilege used to withhold certain documents tied to the Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal from release to a congressional committee.\n\nHouse Republicans sued in federal court in 2012 to obtain thousands of emails related to the botched effort by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to track guns across the Southwest border.\n\nRevelations of the operation created a political firestorm and set off a documents dispute between former Attorney General Eric Holder and Congress that resulted in Holder being held in contempt of Congress.\n\nThe Justice Department had already produced tens of thousands of pages of documents, but Congress continued to seek additional records that the department argued it was entitled to withhold.\n\nIn her decision Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson Berman said it was inappropriate for the Justice Department to make a blanket assertion of executive privilege in part because the agency had already disclosed through other channels much of the information it wants to withhold.\n\nSince any harm that would flow from the disclosures sought here would be merely incremental, the records must be produced, the judge wrote.\n\nShe said disputes over documents that the Justice Department has withheld on other grounds, such as for foreign policy and privacy concerns, are best left to the process of negotiation and accommodation.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has been seeking the documents, said the judge's ruling will help the committee advance its investigation.\n\nWhile the decision doesn't give us access to all the documents, it is an important step forward. We will continue investigating until we get to the truth, he said in a statement.
Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Canó has been suspended for 80 games for violating Major League Baseball's drug policy. Canó tested positive for Furosemide, a diuretic, in violations with the league's Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, the league said Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, Canó accepted the suspension and said the drug is used to treat various medical conditions in the United States and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThis substance was given to me by a licensed doctor in the Dominican Republic to treat a medical ailment. While I did not realize at the time that I was given a medication that was banned, I obviously now wish that I had been more careful, he said.\n\nCanó was already set to sit out for a substantial time period after breaking his hand Sunday. He was struck by a pitch thrown by Detroit Tigers pitcher Blaine Hardy.\n\nMLB network reporter Mark Feinsand says his suspension will be concurrent with his time on the disabled list, which means he won't be out for the season.\n\nIn his statement, Canó issued an apology to his family, fans and the Mariners organization.\n\nI am extremely grateful for the support I have received during this process, and I look forward to rejoining my teammates later this season.\n\nThe Mariners said they were disappointed in Canó but will support Robinson as he works through this challenge.

The American economy's steady expansion stepped up in February as U.S. companies added to their head count at a surprisingly robust pace.\n\nThe Labor Department on Friday reported the U.S. economy created 313,000 jobs last month, far exceeding Wall Street expectations for 200,000 new jobs. The previous two months were upwardly revised by 54,000. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent and wage growth stalled, with the previous month's sharp spike in pay revised lower.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose 68 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $26.75 in February from a year earlier. January's gain was revised lower to a 2.8 percent annualized gain from 2.9 percent previously. On a month-to-month basis, average earnings rose 4 cents in February after a 7-cent gain the prior month.\n\nToday's strong jobs report marks 89 consecutive months of positive job gains for the economy, an all-time record since the 1930s, Glassdoor economist Andrew Chamberlain offered in emailed commentary. Our current economic expansion has now hit 104 months, which is the third-longest American expansion on record since the 1850s.\n\nGus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, called the February numbers excellent, and noted the increase in payrolls marks the biggest one-month gain in more than two years.\n\nThe data portrayed a healthy labor market while the wage numbers were dialed back from a pace that spooked Wall Street last month. Sharply higher wage growth in January had sparked investor concerns about a potential pick-up in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to boost interest rate rates at a more rapid pace than had been expected.\n\nThe latest economic report comes less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve meets on monetary policy, and the accelerated job growth cemented the view that the Federal Open Market Committee would raise its federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.50 to 1.75 percent.\n\nThe FOMC will try to let some of the steam off the economy, concerned that an overheating labor market will push inflation past the committee's 2 percent goal, Faucher wrote in a client's note.
BEIJING - Global stock markets rose Monday as investors looked to this week's meeting of finance ministers from major economies for reassurance about threats to world growth.\n\nIn early trading, Germany's DAX gained 1.3 percent to 9,513.61 points and France's CAC-40 added 1.2 percent to 4,273.55. On Friday, the DAX lost 0.8 percent, while the CAC-40 and Britain's FTSE 100 both declined 0.4 percent.\n\nWall Street looked set for gains, with futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 both up 1.1 percent. On Friday, the Dow declined 0.1 percent and the S&P lost a fraction of a point. The Nasdaq composite index added 0.4 percent.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.3 percent to 2,927.18 points and Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 added 1 percent to 5,001.20. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 0.9 percent to 16,111.05 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.9 percent to 19,464.09. India's Sensex added 0.5 percent to 23,835.99 and Taiwan, Singapore and Jakarta also advanced. Seoul's Kospi was unchanged at 1,916.36 and New Zealand declined.\n\nInvestors are hoping this week's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 major rich and developing economies will spur moves to shore up global growth. Japan's center bank governor has called for the officials meeting Friday and Saturday in Shanghai to commit to coordinated action. But private sector analysts say fiscal and monetary policy options are limited following repeated rounds of stimulus.\n\nThe weekend meeting of G20 Finance Ministers will be the major focus this week with global growth woes likely to be the event headline, said Stephen Innes of OANDA in a report. Don't expect any magic bullet solution to appear but a policy consensus among ministers might go a long way to shoring up investors' sentiment.\n\nA measure of Japanese manufacturing showed activity fell to an eight-month low this month, due largely to weak export demand. The Nikkei Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed production grew at its slowest rate in 10 months and new export orders fell to a three-year low. The data suggest business sentiment has suffered from the sharp falls in the equity market and the stronger yen, Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a report.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude gained 53 cents per barrel to $32.28 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.18 on Friday to close at $31.75. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 46 cents to $33.47 per barrel in London. It fell $1.27 on Friday to close at $33.01.\n\nThe dollar advanced to 112.92 yen from Friday's 112.60 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1111 from $1.1133.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.—The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.\n\nWe are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire, says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.\n\nThe mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.\n\nAs President Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.\n\nEPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.\n\nPractically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation wholly depends on the length of the shutdown.\n\nUnless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site, Bellow said.\n\nIn north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.\n\nBut long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. My main concern is the health of the people out here, said Brown, who has asthma. All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.\n\nIn terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site — which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts — but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.\n\nAt the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.\n\nIn Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.\n\nWith most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.\n\nBut it's the agency's work at Superfund sites — lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities — that gets much of the attention.\n\nAbsent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed, the EPA said in a statement.\n\nSites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens, the agency said.\n\nFor federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nAt Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.\n\nBellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.\n\nIn East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.\n\nThe EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.\n\nDuring a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.\n\nThe EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.\n\nLeaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.\n\nCalls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.\n\nLocal critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an environmental justice community — a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.\n\nThe EPA has a special obligation when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.\n\nIn North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of people living in and around the Superfund site had already just got tired and fed up.\n\nPowell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.\n\nCan I say hell? Powell said when asked what residents have been through.\n\n___\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.

Despite increasing demands for the Department of Justice to temporarily close all the nation's immigration courts due to the coronavirus pandemic, most courts remain open. Some courts have even reopened after the department confirmed people who were there tested positive for the virus.\n\nGinnine Fried, a government lawyer who represents a union of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attorneys, called the decision to keep most immigration courts open absolutely outrageous.\n\nNow that people keep popping up positive, you can't claim plausible deniability. Now it's conscious disregard for human life and safety, Fried, a vice president of the American Federation of Federal Employees' Local 511, told CBS News.\n\nOn Tuesday, 12 immigration courts were closed. Two of them — the ones in Varick Street, New York, and Elizabeth, New Jersey — were closed because individuals who were there received a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the Justice Department branch that oversees immigration tribunals. But by Wednesday morning, both facilities were again open for business.\n\nThe decision to reopen the Varick Street location is also drawing ire on Facebook. One commenter on the EOIR's Facebook page wrote, Instead of taking the necessary preemptive measures suggested by the CDC, the EOIR's policy is to wait until staff contracts the virus and then close for a day. Shameful.\n\nFederal immigration judges are also expressing concern.\n\nI have never seen such callousness and cluelessness in an agency leadership, Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIC), another union, told CBS News.\n\nHearings for immigrants who are not detained by ICE have been suspended until April 10. The Justice Department also postponed hearings scheduled through April 22 for asylum-seekers returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols program. But hearings for detained immigrants and asylum-seekers are still moving forward and some support staff are being required to go into the office.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Justice Department opened six immigration courts that had been closed, including locations hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic in New York and California, for the limited purpose of accepting filings made by lawyers.\n\nFailing to close all of the nation's Immigration Courts, both non-detained and detained settings, now will exacerbate a once-in-a-century public health crisis and lead to a greater loss of life, Tabaddor said.\n\nWhile EOIR discourages continuances in cases involving detainees, except under the most extenuating of circumstances, sources say they do routinely happen. If immigration courts were to close, non-violent detainees could be released on a type of parole or could be in detention for a longer period of time. In the latter case, there is the potential for immigrants with delayed hearings to file for habeas corpus, or unlawful detention. To avoid that, immigration law groups urging the DOJ to close the courts have recommended that priority matters be completed over the phone and electronically. Something that, they say, is not happening now.\n\nIn a letter to EOIR on Monday, the Association of Deportation Defense Attorneys wrote: Requests for telephonic hearings are not being approved expeditiously, or are simply not being acted upon despite a timely request having been made.\n\nMost if not all, non-detention hearings are already being rescheduled. These types of cases usually involve asylum or relief from deportation. Sources say non-detainment hearings are frequently postponed, often for several years, since the immigration courts' backlog is currently over 1.4 million cases. As a result, all non-detained immigrants with scheduled hearings will likely see a delay in removal proceedings.\n\nThere is also concern that by keeping the courts open, people will have to violate orders put in place by their local or state governments. One person posting on Facebook wrote, I am an attorney doing a case pro bono in Denver. I have a filing due April 8. In order to effectuate the filing I will have to violate my city's shelter in place order in order to make the required copies and then again to mail the documents or deliver them in person. I am in a r=high (sic) risk category and you are endangering my health and those of the employees at the courthouse and at the copy place. Shame on you.\n\nEarlier this week, the NAIJ and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) sent a letter to Congress asking for a sense of Congress resolution in the next stimulus legislation that calls for a complete and temporary closure of all 68 immigration courts.\n\nIn the face of inadequate national testing, the letter read, it is irresponsible to do anything other than close our courts until sufficient testing has been conducted.\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, the EOIR closed more than 275,000 cases, the second highest number of completions in the agency's history.\n\nThe Department of Justice did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.
With borrowing limit approaching, Republicans' lack of unity could deprive them of leverage in negotiations with Democrats\n\nWith borrowing limit approaching, Republicans' lack of unity could deprive them of leverage in negotiations with Democrats\n\nThe U.S. officially exhausts its borrowing authority Friday, and the Treasury Department will be forced to resort to so-called extraordinary measures to prevent a default on the debt – a tactic that will work until late February, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has said repeatedly.\n\nBut the deadline has been greeted with nonchalance on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have been plotting to demand something in return for raising the debt ceiling – they're just not sure what. And even though they couldn't agree on something, lawmakers shrugged, packed their bags, and left town for the weekend.\n\nI think that we're still looking for the pieces to this puzzle, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters Thursday morning. But listen, he assured them, we don't want to default on our debt and we're not going to default on the debt.\n\nThe folks up the way on Pennsylvania Ave. were similarly unalarmed by the impending deadline, and seemed content to stand back and let House Republicans sort out their strategy.\n\nWe certainly believe Republican leaders who say that we have to raise the debt ceiling. It's the responsibility of Congress to ensure that bills that have already been incurred are paid in a timely fashion so that the United States doesn't default, said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.\n\nCarney maintains the administration's position has not changed – they will not negotiate. We are not going to pay ransom in return for Congress fulfilling this basic responsibility, he said.\n\nBoehner and President Obama have tried and failed to negotiate on fiscal issues time and time again – over the debt ceiling once before, tax and entitlement reform, the grand bargain, and the government shutdown. This time, they aren't even trying to get together to talk (though this would violate the administration's no-negotiations policy).\n\nThat leaves Boehner to sell his conference on deal the president hasn't had a hand in crafting. But so far, Boehner isn't having much success among his fellow Republicans.\n\nEarlier this week, House Republican leaders pitched two possible trades for a year-long debt ceiling extension: approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline or repeal the risk corridors in the Affordable Care Act, a provision that which enables the government to share in the risks and gains of the marketplace. If the cost of insuring people is lower than expected, insurers pay into a pool, and if it's higher than expected, they can draw from that pool.\n\nBut just a day later, neither had enough support, and both ideas were ditched.\n\nNow, they're kicking around a few possibilities that could even get some Democratic support: patch the reimbursement formula for doctors who treat Medicare patients, known as the doc fix; change the congressional budgeting processes and undo cuts to the cost-of-living formula for military retirees that were part of the budget deal negotiated last year.\n\nIt's unclear that any of those options will pass, and the Republicans might end up having to approve an unconditional debt ceiling increase, which some members say is inevitable.\n\nWe've had three years of fighting over the debt ceiling, [and] unfortunately we have not been victorious in many of those fights. I think that this year the speaker should just allow the Democrats to pass a clean debt ceiling, the Democrats can own it, they can explain to the American people why they want to continue to increase the debt without any major reforms and we can go to the American people and we can tell them that if they get rid of [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid we will actually make the reforms that are necessary for America to be strong again, said Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, at a regular forum featuring conservative lawmakers Wednesday morning.\n\nThat leaves Boehner in his usual position: at the head of a fractious group of lawmakers, trying to piece together enough votes to keep the government running.\n\nAt least he has a sense of humor about it.\n\nMother Teresa is a saint now, but if the Congress wanted to make her a saint and attached that to the debt ceiling we probably couldn't get 218 Republican votes, he said Thursday.
President Donald Trump has long been an unlikely sweetheart for conservative and evangelical voters. Now, in the lead-up to the midterm elections, the thrice-married former Democrat who used to describe himself as very pro-choice is offering catnip to conservative voters with a new administration push to strip funding from Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics.\n\nThe initiative, announced last week, has arrived just in time for Mr. Trump to highlight it Tuesday night when he speaks at the Susan B. Anthony List's annual Campaign for Life Gala. It is aimed at resurrecting parts of a Reagan-era mandate banning federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, or sharing space with abortion providers.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, says the move will help tremendously in the midterm elections.\n\nIt's also the latest evidence that as he frets over the Russia investigation and prepares for a planned summit with North Korea, Mr. Trump has also been focused on fulfilling campaign promises and tending to issues that galvanize his base: holding a series of events to rail against the dangers of illegal immigration, pulling out of the Iran-nuclear deal and wading anew into the fight over abortion rights.\n\nMr. Trump is far from a natural fit for conservative voters. He recently admitted to reimbursing his lawyer for paying pay hush money to a porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump (a charge that he denies). And Mr. Trump has bragged about groping women without their permission. During the campaign, he sometimes had trouble articulating his views on abortion, at one point suggesting women should be punished for having abortions. His campaign later walked back the statement, saying that if abortion were ever outlawed, he believed that doctors who perform them should be punished.\n\nNonetheless, white evangelical voters overwhelmingly supported Mr. Trump in 2016, and that support has only grown. A PRRI survey released last month found white evangelical support for Mr. Trump at an all-time high, with 75 percent of those polled holding a favorable view of the president and just 22 percent holding an unfavorable view. Support for Mr. Trump within the general population in the poll stood at just 42 percent.\n\nReligious groups like the Catholic Medical Association approve of a series of actions Mr. Trump has taken, beginning with his appointment of judges who oppose abortion rights, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Trump's reinstatement of the global gag rule that bars federal funding for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion referrals.\n\nMr. Trump has also surrounded himself with staffers with deep ties to conservative groups, including counselor Kellyanne Conway and Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp.\n\nRalph Reed, chairman of the private Faith & Freedom Coalition, also pointed to the president's dismantling of the Iran nuclear deal and his decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as steps that have played especially well with evangelical voters. But he said the president's actions on abortion hold special sway, in part because of Trump's early struggle with the issue.\n\nOn a policy level, I see it as a series of promises made and promises kept. And in this case, a pro-life promise made and pro-life promise kept. And I would argue those are the most important promises to keep because he was someone who was believed, accurately or otherwise, as a recent arrival to conservatism and someone who had an ideologically mixed past, Reed said.\n\nReed added that as president, Trump has done everything that he can to keep faith with the faith-based voters that provided him with his margin of victory in 2016.\n\nWhen it comes to the midterms, Reed said, I expect Donald Trump to be rewarded for these efforts by a similarly historic turnout among evangelical and other pro-life voters.\n\nDannenfelser, whose group works to elect candidates who want to reduce and ultimately end abortion, is planning to raise and spend $25 million this cycle, up from the $18 million the group spent in the lead-up to the 2016 elections.\n\nShe said the president's latest move would play especially well with voters in states like Missouri, where Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley is challenging Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, as well as in Indiana and North Dakota, where Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nHe has proved himself refreshingly predictable, Dannenfelser said of Trump's record on abortion issues.\n\nThe other side, meanwhile, is preparing for a potential legal fight against Mr. Trump's latest action and aiming to build support for candidates who support abortion rights.\n\nWe have to fight back in the best way we know how, the group Emily's List wrote in a fundraising email, electing pro-choice Democratic women who will always protect reproductive freedom.
Washington — Joe Biden has an Iran problem. And, it's getting more complicated by the day.\n\n\n\nThanks to provocative moves by Iran and less-than-coherent actions by the outgoing Trump administration, the president-elect is facing an increasingly uncertain situation when it comes to Iran, a decades-long American nemesis that has been a target of blame for much of the Middle East's instability.\n\n\n\nIn the past week alone, President Donald Trump's team has dispatched B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf in response to alleged Iranian attack planning and reversed an order to bring home the USS Nimitz, the only U.S. aircraft carrier in the region.\n\nOn Monday, Iran not only announced it had resumed advanced uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal but also seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker and its crew. This combustible combination coming just two weeks before the president-elect's inauguration threatens to derail or at least delay Biden's hopes to return the U.S. to the nuclear accord that Trump withdrew from in 2018.\n\nBelow is a look at the latest developments:\n\nDangerous escalation?\n\nConcerns have run high for some weeks about Iran stoking tensions, particularly around the January 3 one-year anniversary of the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq. U.S. officials have been on heightened alert for possible retaliation from Iran, including from allied militia in Iraq that have previously launched rockets at U.S. facilities in the country.\n\nOn Monday Iran said it had ramped up its enrichment of uranium to 20% purity – not high enough to make a nuclear weapon, but a significant step closer to that level.\n\nIt is a move in a concerning direction, particularly because a state that can enrich to 20%, which technically qualifies as high-enriched uranium, can go all the way to what is called weapons-grade uranium, which is usually 90-plus percent, Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told CBSN on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the enrichment upgrade meant that Iran has done the lion's share of the work to get closer to a weapon.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran seized a South Korean chemical tanker this week, claiming it was posing a danger to the environment. Taleblu said there was a clear precedent of Iran seizing vessels ahead of diplomatic meetings with foreign officials to try to extort states for money.\n\nThe South Korean ship was seized ahead of a planned visit by South Korea's president to Tehran. As Taleblu explained, South Korea controls a significant sum of Iranian state money in an escrow account, but has adhered to U.S. sanctions and not allowed Tehran to access it.\n\nThis is Iran both trying to put pressure on South Korea to release the funds, as well as trying to get U.S. partners… who are reliant on Persian Gulf oil, on Persian Gulf trade, to put pressure on Washington to cease this policy of sanctions, he said.\n\nAlthough neither the enrichment announcement nor the seizure of the South Korean ship appeared linked to the death of Iran's general in Iraq, the two moves did raise tensions in the region, which has long been unpredictable.\n\n\n\nPart of the worry is that a single wrong move — or intentional provocation — has the potential to trigger war.\n\n\n\nThere is no sign the U.S. is planning an attack on Iran, although Trump has said he would respond to any attack by Iran or its affiliated militias in Iraq that resulted in the death of an American. The U.S. military has long had a wide variety of weapons and troops in the Middle East that could be called on if hostilities broke out. But Trump himself has derided the idea of getting further mired in Middle East wars.\n\n\n\nThe scenario that worries U.S. military officials is Iran conducting an attack, either inside Iraq or elsewhere in the Gulf region, that would prompt Trump to retaliate, leading to escalation that could spark a wider war. That is part of the reason the U.S. has kept an aircraft carrier in the region on a near-continuous basis since May 2019, when the White House first asserted that Iran was planning attacks on U.S. personnel.\n\n\n\nUSS Nimitz sent back\n\nThe highly unusual Nimitz flip-flop by the acting secretary of defense, Christopher Miller, seemed to undercut U.S. Central Command's efforts to convince Iran that it would not pay to launch an attack on U.S. forces.\n\n\n\nThe huge vessel, with a complement of attack and support aircraft, was literally leaving the region when it received word to turn around and head back.\n\nThe aircraft carrier USS Nimitz Phil Mislinski/Getty\n\nSending the Nimitz home had been on the table for weeks, since the carrier was on a lengthy deployment and was scheduled to be home by the end of 2020. Its tour was extended by a few weeks to provide backup for U.S. troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. But as tensions with Iran rose in mid-December, Central Command wanted to keep the Nimitz nearby. Instead, on December 31, Miller announced that he had ordered it to return home. Three days later, he reversed himself and said it would stay.\n\n\n\nCancelling the go-home order for the Nimitz took some defense officials by surprise, suggesting that the decision may have been made at the White House rather than as a result of new arguments from military officers.\n\n\n\nWhy B-52 bombers are flying\n\nThese long-range bomber flights aren't commonplace, but they've become a bit more routine in recent weeks as a show of military might. There have been three B-52 bomber missions to the region in less than two months, most recently on December 30.\n\n\n\nThe roundtrip flights from the United States are meant to show how quickly bombers can get to the area. They can be equipped with either conventional or nuclear missiles.\n\nA missile, in white, launches from a B-52 bomber during a weapons test. Mike Cassidy/U.S. Air Force\n\nMarine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, made the message clear this week, saying: We do not seek conflict, but no one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack.\n\nWhat it means for Biden\n\nBiden's transition team has declined to comment in detail about the latest developments and what they may mean for their plans, but Biden and his top national security aides have laid out their approach to Iran in broad strokes.\n\nTop of that list is bringing Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal and then expanding that pact to take into account non-nuclear behavior that wasn't covered by the initial agreement.\n\nIran, however, has said it will only return to compliance if the U.S. rejoins the deal and rescinds sanctions that Trump reimposed over the past two years. At the same time, Biden aides have said Iran cannot win sanctions relief unless and until it respects the deal.\n\nIran's latest actions, coupled with the Trump administration's movement of forces, complicate diplomacy and raise the risk of miscalculation, particularly as tensions continue to run high between Iran and its neighbors.\n\n\n\nThe increased tensions, which have triggered the highest alert levels for U.S. personnel in Iraq, may make it difficult for the incoming Biden administration to pivot the military more aggressively toward Russia and China.
The daughters of an American man detained in Syria for nearly two years are speaking out and publicly asking President Trump to bring their father home. Majd Kamalmaz was arrested in Damascus in 2017. Since then his daughters, Ula and Maryam, have been working quietly with the State Department to find their father.\n\nMajd Kamalmaz\n\nWe are pretty confident he is still alive, and I feel that he is still alive in my heart, Maryam told CBS News' Janet Shamlian.\n\nMaryam and Ula pray every day for their father's safe return.\n\nKamalmaz, a 61-year-old therapist and grandfather, was last seen in war-torn Syria while crossing a government checkpoint where he was detained. Ula said she couldn't think of any reason why he might have been stopped.\n\nHe went into it with his U.S. passport. He knew that he was going in to see relatives. I mean that's what we know, Ula said.\n\nThe Kamalmaz family has been largely silent about their father's disappearance out of fear that bringing attention to his case might put him in danger. But after two years without any leads, the family is now making a public appeal to President Trump.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's success rate at returning detained prisoners, we have faith that he's going to be able to do the same with our father, Maryam said.\n\nThe family sent the president a letter in October, pleading for his help in getting Kamalmaz out of Syria. They said the White House received the letter, but the president has not responded.\n\nThe only other identified American held in Syria is journalist Austin Tice.\n\n\n\nThe Syrian government, like I suppose many adversarial governments to the U.S., want leverage against the U.S., want ways to put pressure on the U.S., foreign policy expert Paul Salem said.\n\nSalem, president of the Middle East Institute, said the hostile relations between the U.S. and Syria make the cases for Tice and Kamalmaz more difficult.\n\n\n\nThe Syrian regime probably detained him in order to get Washington's attention and perhaps to negotiate towards normalizing relations with Syria, Salem said.\n\nKamalmaz immigrated to the U.S. when he was six years old and became a dual-citizen.\n\n\n\nWe're American in every way possible. Don't let this fool you. I mean, my father always taught us that this is your country, we're not going anywhere. We were all born and raised here, Maryam said.\n\nA therapist who's offered free counseling to victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Indonesian tsunami, Kamalmaz traveled the world – but his family wants him back here in the States.\n\n\n\nDad, we love you. We miss you. And we're working hard to bring you home, Maryam said, choking up with emotion.
In a rare split between two Democratic candidates who have so far been friendly on the campaign trail, Senator Elizabeth Warren on Sunday said that she's disappointed by a report that Senator Bernie Sanders' campaign had prepared a negative script for volunteers to use about her. Sanders appeared to dismiss the criticism, calling it a bit of a media blow-up.\n\nPolitico first reported on the script, which has not been challenged by Sanders or his campaign. According to Politico, campaign volunteers were told to say people who support her are highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what and that she's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.\n\nWarren, who was campaigning Sunday in Iowa, told reporters that she was disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me.\n\nBernie knows me, and has known me for a long time, Warren said. He knows who I am, where I come from, what I have worked on and more, and the coalition and grassroots movement. We're trying to build Democrats we want to win. In 2020, we all saw the impact of the factionalism in 2016, and we can't have a repeat of that.\n\nSanders has been dogged by criticism since 2016 of sowing division within the Democratic party, but Warren has so far avoided taking part in that particular line of attack. Sanders and Warren, the leading candidates on the left, have so far refrained from attacking each other on the campaign trail and at the debates. They both will be at Tuesday's debate, along with former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer.\n\nSanders, who was also campaigning in Iowa, on Sunday called Warren a very good friend of mine and said no one is going to trash Elizabeth.\n\nWe have hundreds of employees, Sanders said. Elizabeth Warren has hundreds of employees. And people sometimes say things they shouldn't.\n\nWarren's campaign Sunday night sent out a fundraising email focused on Sanders.\n\nThis type of attack isn't about disagreeing on issues — it's about dismissing the potency of our grassroots movement, campaign manager Roger Lau wrote. Let's be clear: As a party, and as a country, we can't afford to repeat the factionalism of the 2016 primary.\n\nI have all the respect in the world for Bernie Sanders, but when talking about our movement, his campaign has it backwards, the email continues. I hope he reconsiders what he's encouraging.\n\nSanders and Warren are locked in a tight race in Iowa, which will caucus on February 3. A Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released earlier this week had Sanders leading with 20%, followed by Warren at 17%, Buttigieg at 16% and Biden at 15%.\n\nThe Sanders campaign, meanwhile, focused this weekend on Biden. In South Carolina, where Biden has a sizable lead, campaign surrogate Nina Turner wrote an op-ed in the newspaper The State titled While Bernie Sanders has always stood up for African Americans, Joe Biden has repeatedly let us down. Senior campaign adviser Jeff Weaver attacked Biden campaign surrogate John Kerry for saying Biden wasn't voting for war in the 2002 Iraq vote.\n\nIt is appalling that after 18 years Joe Biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong on the Iraq War, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history, Weaver said.\n\nSanders's campaign said Sunday that he approved Weaver's statement. For his part, Sanders said Sunday that he wanted voters to look at Biden's record.\n\nCompare and contrast records. Nothing wrong with that. That's what a serious campaign is about, Sanders said.\n\nZak Hudak and Cara Korte contributed reporting.
Beijing - The U.S. and China gave no indication of their next step after wrapping up talks aimed at resolving a tariff fight that threatens to chill global growth.\n\nThe two sides will maintain close contact, China's Ministry of Commerce said Thursday. But they announced no agreements or date for meeting again during the 90-day truce declared on Dec. 1 by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in their fight over Beijing's technology ambitions.\n\nThat uncertainty dampened investor sentiment. Stock markets in Germany, France, Japan and China fell back after rising Wednesday, following Trump's comment on Twitter that the talks were going well!\n\nNegotiators focused on China's pledge to buy a substantial amount of American agricultural, energy, manufactured goods and other products and services, the U.S. Trade Representative said.\n\nHowever, a USTR statement emphasized U.S. insistence on structural changes in Chinese technology policy, market access, protection of foreign patents and copyrights and cybertheft of trade secrets. It gave no sign of progress in those areas.\n\nIt also said the negotiations dealt with the need for ongoing verification and effective enforcement. That reflects American frustration that the Chinese have failed to live up to past commitments.\n\nA Ministry of Commerce spokesman, Gao Feng, said the talks enhanced mutual understanding and laid the foundation for addressing each other's concerns.\n\nPushing China to change\n\n\n\nPresident Trump hiked tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods over complaints that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.\n\nWashington also wants changes in an array of areas including the ruling Communist Party's initiatives for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics, artificial intelligence and other industries.\n\nAmerican leaders worry those plans might erode U.S. industrial leadership. Chinese leaders see them as a path to prosperity and global influence, and are reluctant to abandon them.\n\nThe two sides might be moving toward a narrow agreement, but U.S. trade hawks want to limit the scope of that agreement and keep the pressure up on Beijing, Eurasia Group analysts Michael Hirson, Jeffrey Wright and Paul Triolo said in a report.\n\nThe risk of talks breaking down remains significant, they wrote.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders expressed optimism to Fox Business Network. She said Wednesday the timing was unclear, but the two sides are moving toward more balanced and reciprocal trade.\n\nQuick political win\n\n\n\nBeijing has tried to mollify Washington and other trading partners by promising to buy more of their goods and open its industries wider to foreign competitors. Mr. Trump has complained repeatedly about the U.S. trade deficit with China, which last year likely exceeded the 2017 gap of $336 billion.\n\nA report from Height Analytics said The focus on near term ag and energy purchases also reflects Trump's need for a quick political win, and bolsters our view that China can successfully buy goodwill with these one off concessions to potentially keep talks going past March 1.\n\nEconomists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies.\n\nWe can confidently say that enough progress was made that the discussions will continue at a higher level, said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. That is very positive.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean a full agreement will be reached by the March deadline. BNP Paribas Asset Management put the odds of the talks continuing beyond March with no further tariff escalation at 70 percent. It also warned that rising costs to US firms, a cooling economy and falling equity markets suggest that US leverage in negotiations may not be as high as the President had thought.\n\nRushing to fill orders\n\n\n\nChinese exports to the U.S. have held up despite tariff increases, partly due to exporters rushing to fill orders before more increases hit. Forecasters expect American orders to slump this year.\n\nChina has imposed penalties on $110 billion of American goods, slowing customs clearance for U.S. companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.\n\nU.S. companies want action on Chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. Those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement.\n\nBeijing is unhappy with U.S. export curbs on dual use technology with possible military applications. Chinese officials said their companies are treated unfairly in U.S. national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\n\nThis week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest of a Chinese tech executive in Canada on U.S. charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions against Iran.
As if it weren't tough enough to get a date as you get older, dating site Tinder also charges more if you're over 30. But now a California appeals court has revived a lawsuit that alleges Tinder's pricing discriminates against older users, who must pay more to access certain features of its service. That ruling was a reversal of a lower-court decision.\n\nAt issue is Tinder's 2015 decision to charge customers 30 and older a $19.99 monthly fee for its Tinder Plus feature, for which younger people pay $9.99 to $14.99. Plaintiff Allen Candelore filed suit seeking class-action status against Tinder, alleging the company's pricing constituted unfair competition and violated California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. A spokesperson for Tinder couldn't be reached.\n\nThe service, where people swipe right on their smartphones to accept a potential match, is part of the internet company Match, also the corporate parent of Match.com and OkCupid. Tinder Plus allows users to change their location so they can find potential dates anywhere in the world and a rewind feature that lets users undo a left-swipe reject.\n\nTinder, which claims more than 26 million matches every day, charged lower rates for younger consumers because its market research showed that they were less able to afford premium services. A three-judge panel of The Los Angeles County Superior Court, however, rejected Tinder's justification for the difference in charges.\n\nNo matter what Tinder's market research may have shown about the younger users' relative income and willingness to pay for the service, as a group, as compared to the older cohort, some individuals will not fit the mold, the 26-page ruling said. Some older consumers will be 'more budget constrained' and less willing to pay than some in the younger group. … Because nothing in the complaint suggests there is a strong public policy that justifies the alleged discriminatory pricing. … Accordingly, we swipe left, and reverse.\n\nCandelore has been involved in other high-profile lawsuits. He is a member of the nonprofit National Coalition for Men (NCFM), which seeks to raise awareness about how men and boys are affected by sex discrimination. Mother Jones reported in 2016 that Candelore and two other NCFM members filed suit in California against business networking and golf events in recent years that were open only to women. Both cases were later settled for an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nAl Rava, who represents Candelore in the Tinder case, also served as counsel in the networking and golf course cases. He has cited the Unruh Act in many of the more than 150 discrimination cases he has filed over the past decade, including a challenge to an Oakland Athletics' giveaway of baseball hats to female fans that was eventually settled.\n\nIn fact, I have been victorious in all my Unruh Civil Rights Act sex-discrimination lawsuits because, as a result of these lawsuits, every defendant stopped its unequal treatment of male and female consumers,' Rava said. He added that the Tinder lawsuit isn't related to the NCFM.

I'm Margaret Brennan. And this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nThe partial government shutdown continues and prospects for a deal look grim.\n\nSENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I have never been more depressed about moving forward than right now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Across the country anger over the shutdown. In Washington, confusion about mixed messages from President Trump about whether he intends to declare a national emergency at the border to build his wall.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Thursday): Probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.\n\n(Friday): I'd rather not do it, because this is something that Congress should easily do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy about why it's not so easy. Plus, former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on what constitutes a national security emergency. Plus, new problems for the President as news reports raise more questions about his ties to Russia. And as the U.S. begins to withdraw troops from Syria, we'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the administration's conflicting statements on the drawdown.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret, the President's guidance is incredibly clear.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Finally--\n\nJULIAN CASTRO: Let's go work. Vamonos.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with the latest candidate to enter the 2020 presidential campaign, former San Antonio mayor, Julian Castro.\n\nAnd as always, we'll have analysis on all the news ahead on FACE THE NATION.\n\nGood morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It's day twenty-three of the partial government shutdown, now the longest in history. And there's no end in sight. Some eight hundred thousand federal workers did not get paid Friday. And even President Trump concedes he has, quote, No idea whether he can get a deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We spoke earlier with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from Abu Dhabi, one of the stops on a nine-country trip through the Middle East.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, we are in the middle of this shutdown, and I know a number of State Department employees are not getting paid, including a quarter of U.S. employees in foreign countries. You've been going to U.S. embassies. What are you telling staff about when they can expect a paycheck?\n\nMIKE POMPEO (Secretary of State/@SecPompeo): Look, it-- it's unfortunate that we're in the shutdown, I-- I wish we weren't, too. I-- I hope that it's resolved quickly and I've certainly told our-- our teams that. But you have to know these great Americans who are working in our embassies around the world. They understand the mission. They understand its importance. They understand that whether the government is open or closed they have a task to do and they are hard at it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I do want to ask you since we are so focused on what's happening with this shutdown here at home, the State Department when it comes to the border issues has issued a report in 2017 about counterterrorism and it says that there is no credible evidence that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States. It adds the southern border is vulnerable, but terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the United States. How does this match with the claim that there is a border security crisis?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret, make-- make no mistake about it, Margaret, keeping our southern border secure is an important national security component, it's-- it's critical that we do that well. There's a real risk to the United States of America. We need to take this seriously. We need to secure our southern border. We need to make sure that those who want to do us harm don't have a way to access us in that way. There are many things we have to do. One of the reasons I'm in the Middle East is to work on prevailing against terror. There are lots of elements of this but border security is a certain and impor-- certainly an important component.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So is the State Department report wrong to say that this is not how terrorists are trying to enter the United States?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret, terrorists try to get into our country lots of ways. One of the ways they can come in is across our southern border. What you saw was an unclassified report. Make no mistake about it, terrorists will always find the weakest link. And we need to make sure that the weakest link in our national security isn't our southern border.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to your trip through the Middle East, but I first want to ask you about this New York Times report that says right after President Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey, the FBI began investigating whether President Trump himself was a potential threat to national security and whether he'd been working for Russia or unintentionally influenced by Moscow. What is your reaction to this?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: I'm not going to comment on New York Times stories, but I'll certainly say this: the-- the notion that President Trump is a threat to American national security is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Just to clarify since you were CIA director, did you have any idea that this investigation was happening?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret-- Margaret-- Margaret, I-- I've answered this question repeatedly indeed on your show. The-- the idea that's contained in The New York Times story that President Trump was a threat to American national security is-- is silly on its face and not worthy of a response.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: One of the reasons you're in the Middle East is to reassure and explain to some of our allies what the U.S. policy in Syria is. So I'd like you to do that for us today because the Pentagon announced yesterday that it actually has begun its withdrawal from Syria. Yet the U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton said that wouldn't happen until two things: one, the U.S. defeated ISIS; and two, Turkey assured us it wouldn't go after our Kurdish allies. Have those two conditions been met?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret, the President's guidance is incredibly clear. The roughly two thousand uniformed soldiers that are in Syria today are going to be withdrawn that-- that activity is underway. We're going to do so in an orderly and deliberate way. A way that protects America's national security, a way that allows us to continue the important mission that they were on--the counterterrorism mission. The effort to make sure that with the destruction of ISIS is not only complete, but that their resurgence is not possible. Our efforts to counter the threat from terrorism stemming from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Those are all real missions. The tactical change we've made in the withdrawal of those two thousand troops is just that--a tactical change. Mission remains the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So has Turkey's president promised you not to attack our Kurdish allies?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Yeah. Look, when President Erdogan and President Trump spoke, they talked about this issue. The Turks have made clear that they understand that there are folks down in Syria that have their rights. We also want to make sure that those in Syria aren't attacking-- terrorists aren't attacking Turkey from Syria. We're fully engaged. Ambassador Jeffrey is in-- fully engaged in conversations with the Turks as well as with the SDF in Syria to make sure that we accomplish all of those missions. We can-- we can do each of those things. Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The SDF among some of the fighters that we were talking about Kurdish allies there. Just to explain for our audience.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: That's right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you here, though--\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --because you know as a diplomat the-- the threat of credible use of military force is what gives you power at the negotiating table. How does taking out U.S. troops from Syria get you any closer to expelling Iran?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret, the United States of America can project military power from lots of places in the world. The absence of a couple thousand soldiers on the ground in Syria in no way materially diminishes the capacity of the United States of America and our amazing armed forces to deliver American power to accomplish our objectives anywhere in the world. That certainly includes in Syria. It certainly includes into Iran if need be. We still have those tools. American diplomats still have that leverage and that power standing behind them. I'm very confident in our military capabilities here in the Middle East.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So by that, are you saying that having U.S. troops in nearby Iraq will fill any kind of vacuum left by pulling out of Syria?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret, we have lots of tools in the arsenal. I was out visiting some amazing warriors out at NAVCENT yesterday in Bahrain. We have an enormous amount of American military capacity. Our-- our ability to achieve what we need to do militarily is there. My task as America's secretary of state is to make sure that we don't have to use that tool. That we get the diplomatic outcomes to secure the Middle East and keep it stable and protect the American people as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to Iran, the Trump admin-- administration has taken some, you know, confrontational tactics here, pulling out of the nuclear accord saying that Iranian threats would be matched here. But we saw this week another American--a Navy vet--Michael White, has been behind Iranian bars since July. So the Trump administration is not stopping Iran from taking Americans hostage. What is happening with this American?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: This administration is proud of the work that we've done to get Americans released all across the world. With respect to that Michael White case, in particular, I can't say much. It's an ongoing consular matter. But the American people should know we take the security of every American, wherever they are traveling in the world as one of our foremost priorities. We will continue to work to get each of them back. And your point-- your point about the Islamic Republic of Iran is spot on. It's why the JCOPA was such a horrible idea. Many Americans are being held there today that were taken by the Iranian regime. These are a group of people who are among the worst terrorists in the world and who have the least respect for human rights in the world. And it's why this administration has taken the very hard line you just described against Iran.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is the Trump administration open to a prisoner swap with Iran?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: I'm not going to talk about something like that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask you because Michael White's mother spoke to CBS and she said she would like the administration to negotiate for her son. She said, What is a human life worth? I would like the U.S. to negotiate. I want him home. What can you tell her you're doing to bring her son home?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: I have great sympathy for the families of those Americans who are wrongfully detained all across the world. And we do everything we can every day to get their return. We use our diplomatic tools in every corner of the world, to reach out to these places to get these young men and women home. We're intent to do that in Iran. We're intent to do that all across the world. We-- we take this-- this obligation as a solemn one. And this administration's had quite a few successes. I hope we have more.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Potentially open to negotiations then?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: We're using every tool that we have in our arsenal to get these Americans back home, wherever we find them.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Bolton said the next summit with Kim Jong-un would be in January or February. We're in that window. When will we see President Trump sit down with the North Korean leader?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: We're working out the details, Margaret. You'll be among the first to know.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know, Sir, you're at the end of this trip, you will be headed to Saudi Arabia. It has been about a hundred days since Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered. Will you raise this issue with Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Of course.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Then what will you say?\n\nMIKE POMPEO: I'll say what-- Margaret, I'll say what we have said consistently. America's position both privately and publicly is the same. This was an outrageous act, an unacceptable murder. Those who were responsible will be held accountable by the United States of America. We're determined to do that. We're determined to get at the facts just as quickly and as comprehensively as we can. We've had a policy that's been remarkably consistent with respect to this. We-- we-- we, we like the rest of the world value human rights all across the globe. And the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was outrageous and we'll hold those responsible accountable. And then we'll talk about all the important things we do with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and all the support they provide to keep Americans in Kansas and Colorado and California and in Washington, DC, safe.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, thank you very much for your time. Safe travels.\n\nMIKE POMPEO: Margaret, thank you very much. You have a great day.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, you're usually in your home state in California when we talk to you so we like having you here in person in snowy DC.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY (House Minority Leader/@GOPLeader/R-California): Thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to this Washington Post report before we talk about the shutdown. It-- it says that the President has tried to conceal the substance of his conversations with Vladimir Putin, even taking away the notes from his translator who sat in-- the interpreter in the room during their talks. Does it concern you that there's no public record of what the president discussed with Vladimir Putin, the leader of the country that interfered in the 2016 elections?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, Margret, what I do know is what this administration, this Congress has done. We've been very tough on Russia. Look at the sanctions that we have taken. With this administration: one, on the election meddling that Russia has done, the movement of Russia with inside Ukraine as well. And I just listened to the President last night. He's more than willing to have an open to what that discussion was about he said on a news show last night. But I know what the President likes to do. He likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship like he does with other world leaders around.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But this was keeping the record of the conversation from the national security adviser. The person who is supposed to be the top adviser to the President.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, in hearing the President last night on the show, he says he was more than willing to let that information go out. So that's what I know right now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress want to see any of this? Or speak to the interpreter?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I'd like to-- the President to be able to build these relationships. I know this administration. I know this Congress is very tough on Russia. And we will continue to be so. But I want this President to be able to build the relationship, even on a personal level with all the world leaders as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know you speak to the President, have you ever asked him about this?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I haven't asked him about this situation, yet, because it just came out. But I did talk to the President yesterday about the shutdown. I know this President is focused on giving this government open. That's why the President is here. That's why I am here in Washington. The challenge has been from the very beginning the President has made numerous offers about this shutdown. Reasonable too, moving further to the Democratic side. And there has not been one offer coming back from the Democrats. It is unacceptable that eight hundred thousand U.S. employees are not being paid. You know what we're arguing over? One-tenth of one percent of the federal budget. And it's not as though we're asking Democrats to do something they haven't done before. They voted for border wall and fencing. We have Democrats, even the new progressives from California. Katie Hill, says she would vote for a wall. You had the chairman--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I think the barrier-- defining the barrier is the point that you're kind of stuck on right now.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I would take the language we had voted on before. The President even said he would add in no concrete--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Fencing Act from 2006?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: No. Just the appropriations bills that we'd taken prior. That would allow us to do the job that needs to be done. You know the chairman of Armed Services, he actually says, walls work and he was supportive of it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: We had our own former President, President Obama in 2014 said there was a crisis on the border.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: The new governor of California Gavin Newsom used it in his-- in his inaugural address said there is a crisis along the border. The only people who believe there is not is Nancy-- Speaker Pelosi--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they agree--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: --and Senator Schumer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in-- in border security funding and offered 1.3 billion for that. It's the how it's spent that it seems to be you're disagreeing on--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, who--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But let me--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, who in America believes in border security, doesn't have some form of a barrier? Because I've heard Democrats say they want a form of a barrier. The President has moved from a concrete to a steel barrier. So I've watched this President look for compromise. There just has been no compromise on the other side.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But should you reopen the government while you have this argument?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: We can have this government reopened. The President is correct. Less than forty-five minutes--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So you would have--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: You know what.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --some sort of CR to open the government--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I've been in--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --and then continue the immigration argument?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I've been in every single one of those meetings. I watched the President turn to Nancy Pelosi and say, okay if I reopen the government right now, in thirty days--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: --could we have border security? She said, No. Not at all. So that--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: --is the real challenge. Who is holding this government up? It's Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the-- the federal government workers are the people paying the price right now.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: They are.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And you have about ten thousand of them in your district.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: And that is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what do you tell them?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: And that is--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When are they going to get paid?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: That is unacceptable. That's why I'm here right now. I'm-- I'm not in Puerto Rico. I'm here because I want to solve this problem.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: And you know what--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Do you know what is happening--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a way to pay those--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: --in each one of those--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --workers while you continue--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: We have just voted--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --arguing over immigration?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: We just voted on Friday and sent it to the President a law to make sure they are being paid when this is done. What we need to have happen--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: For those living paycheck to paycheck now matters.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Yeah, that's unacceptable. And where has the President been this whole time? What-- what those constituents and what your viewers need to understand, before we ever got to this point when the Republicans had the House--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: --they moved a bill to the Senate. In the Senate, it takes sixty votes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Senator Schumer would not come to a compromise. He would not even come for a vote. He left. When we sat during that break--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So should the President--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: --before the new swearing in--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you oppose the President declaring a national emergency? Since what you're describing sounds like you're not going anywhere.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: You know what?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because he-- he's talked about--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: The Emergency Act exists--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --about possibly using money that would be allocated to California for disaster relief. That's your home state.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: The Emergency Act exists for these type of circumstances. But one thing I will tell you, we should solve this legislatively. I-- I agree with what the President said on Friday, we need to solve this legislatively.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Because--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --you don't want--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Listen, it's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --him to declare an emergency?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: It's one tenth of one percent of the federal budget. If we cannot do this together, what else can we not do in the future? This is not that big of a problem. Democrats in the past have voted for fencing and for wall. Why, now, do they disagree? Because it's President Trump? I think the American public understands this. We can solve this in minutes and these-- these workers should be able to be paid. It only takes a few minutes inside the meetings, but when the Democrats will not even make a counteroffer, it's unacceptable.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. I want to ask you about Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King. You called some of his language reckless when he, in an interview with the New York Times, said the term, white nationalists and white supremacists, he didn't know when they became offensive. Some Republicans have come out very strongly here. Jeb Bush--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: As have-- as have I.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Jeb Bush said it's not enough to condemn him, that party leaders actually have to do something. Either support a primary opponent to challenge him, others have said he should be at least censured. Should there be action against Congressman King?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: First, and foremost, I came out at the very moment--that language has no place in America. That is not the America I know and it's most definitely not the party of Lincoln.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Should he be--\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I have--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --punished for it?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I have a scheduled meeting with him on Monday, and I will tell you this: I've watched on the other side that they do not take action when their member says something like this. Action will be taken. I'm having a serious conversation with Congressman Steve King on his future and role in this Republican Party, because--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: As a leader. There is a number of things you'll see that is taking place, but I will not stand back as a leader of this party, believing in this nation that all are created equal--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: --that that stands or continues to stand and have any role with us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Congressman.\n\nWe will be back in a moment with more FACE THE NATION.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: With dozens of Democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid on Saturday the former mayor of San Antonio, Julián Castro, became the latest candidate. Castro gained national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic convention and he was also secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant, Julian Castro has already been endorsed by a Democratic member of Congress, his twin brother, Joaquin. And Julian Castro joins us from the site of his announcement.\n\nThe President visited your home state of Texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO (D-Presidential Candidate/@JulianCastro/Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary): What I believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That's a real tragedy.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do?\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status, so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the President is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law abiding, if they pay a fine, that-- that they can get an earned path to citizenship.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You announced your candidacy and almost immediately the RNC issued a statement. I want to read it here to you. It says, Julián Castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for President. He was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being HUD secretary. This is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate. These are sharp words, but it's the first official attack on you. How do you respond and-- and how do you explain why you are qualified to be Commander-in-Chief?\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: You know they're going to use those kinds of words for every single Democrat that decides to run for president. I wouldn't put too much stock in that. I would just say to the American people directly, I've had executive experience. I have led one of the largest, most diverse cities in the country. I've led a federal agency at HUD and-- and done some great work to expand opportunity. I know what it takes to ensure that we have a government that functions well and to help inspire people. I also have a life experience that I think resonates with a lot of Americans. You know I'm here in my neighborhood that I grew up in. Grew up in a single parent household, went to the public schools here in San Antonio. Was able to go to college and law school and to reach my American dream. And I am motivated to make sure that every American can reach their dreams.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the things you outlined as part of your platform, Medicare for all, universal access to prekindergarten education, a Green New Deal, these put you in the more liberal or progressive wing of the Democratic Party. So one of the challenges for you is how do you attract centrists or people who perhaps were alienated by the President but aren't comfortable with being so reliant on the government as their main provider?\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: What I hear out there is that there are a lot of folks, a lot of people, who want us to invest in universal health care. And I'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like Medicare for all would be easy. But I do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on Earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what is that going to cost taxpayers? You've got to make some real changes there to be able to pay for it.\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: No, you do. There's no question that it's going to take several things. I think it's going to take asking wealthier individuals to pay their fair share.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: We've had basically the-- the last forty years essentially of-- of lower and lower commitment on people at the very top. Same thing goes for corporations. We have corporations-- multinational corporations that are hardly paying anything in federal taxes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You want to increase the corporate tax rate?\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: We need to ask them to pay their fair share. I think that we can consider different ways, different proposals, to be able to raise more revenue from, you know, the wealthiest corporations.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We will be tracking you and your campaign. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There will be more of our interview on our website at FACETHENATION.com. We will be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including our political panel and former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Stay with us.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. For some expert analysis on the government shutdown, the emerging 2020 presidential race and so much more we would like to welcome our political panel. Jeffrey Goldberg is the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Seung Min Kim covers the White House from Capitol Hill for the Washington Post, David Nakamura is a White House reporter for the Washington Post, and Michael Crowley is the White House and national security editor at Politico. Seung Min Kim, let me start with you. Did you hear any signs of progress from what Leader McCarthy talked about today?\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM (The Washington Post/@seungminkim): There is no signs of progress anywhere that we've seen in the last several days. We don't get a way out of the shutdown at least legislatively if three people aren't talking. That's the President, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer. And by all accounts they are not having any discussions right now after the President reportedly stormed out of that meeting in the Situation Room on Wednesday at the White House. And that's why there seems to be sort of a sense of inevitability or at least there was until Friday about the President declaring a national emergency as kind of a way out of the shutdown. Although the President seem to kind of scale that back in his latest comments at the White House on Friday. But there are concerns with that as well. I mean we-- first of all, it's not a guarantee that the government reopens.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: Congressman Mark Meadows, who is a Trump ally on Capitol Hill told us that he's like I don't really know why people think that just because the President does this the government will reopen. So that was kind of a sign for us that perhaps this isn't the easiest way out and also the concern among Republicans about declaring this national emergency. You've gotten some pretty strong pushback from senior Republicans saying this could be an abuse of executive power. Something they talked a lot about under the Obama administration.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Michael, we're hearing, you know, the White House seems to be focusing in on Speaker Pelosi and the opposition in the House. They seem to be seeing an opportunity with some of these new freshmen Democrats who've been elected from districts that otherwise have been supportive of Trump. What do you make of this as a strategy? Can you actually pick them off? Do you get anywhere by doing so?\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY (Politico/@michaelcrowley): Sure. I mean, I guess, it's-- I don't know, if it's arbitrage or the concept where you can exploit a gap between evidence of the President's past support and then a Democrat maybe in theory over performing in that same place. So those are the natural targets you go for. I haven't seen a lot of evidence that they are strategically hitting those targets so far. And I know that we've reported at Politico that there are White House allies who want to see the President, for instance, go in to some of those districts or have White House officials, you know, hold events in these members' districts really put the pressure on them with local media and try to exploit that tension between a district that was pro-Trump in sixteen and maybe one pro-Democrat in eighteen and really put them on the spot. But, you know, fundamentally, what's so interesting here is the President really just seems to be doubling down on this base strategy, the one that he went for in 2018. And it seems like we're kind of setting the stage for the 2020 presidential campaign. And the President may feel that he just absolutely has to keep that base, but that base is fortyish percent. And it's going to be tough for him to win reelection if he doesn't do something more broadly. So it's going to be interesting to see--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: --if he remains dug in on that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and to that point we have some CBS News polling that we've done and it seems that the President's approval rating is low in terms of how he is handling this shutdown, down to about thirty-five percent. Of course, for congressional Republicans it's even lower than that--just twenty-one percent. So this, is it necessarily a political win or could it be?\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA (The Washington Post/@DavidNakamura): Well, that's a great point. The-- we have also a new poll out today from The Washington Post, though, that shows something interesting, which is that, although a majority of the country does blame the President much more than Democrats for the shutdown, it also said that support for a border wall has actually spiked among Republicans at large--by sixteen points over the past year as the President keeps talking about this. And I'm sure the President is seeing that and saying, Look, this is broadly popular, not just among the base of the Republican Party but eighty-seven percent, according to this poll we have out today of the Republicans support it. Seventy percent of Republicans strongly support a border wall. So the President is reading that and he really believes that his strategy is working despite this idea that he is going to take the blame the longer this goes on.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting you say that the CBS News poll, in terms of how you build the wall, shows that about two-thirds, sixty-seven percent of Americans oppose declaring a national emergency to get us there. And-- and it looks like it really breaks down along partisan lines, Jeff.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG (The Atlantic/@JeffreyGoldberg): Right. Right. I mean, a national emergency might actually be the only way out of this impasse because it doesn't seem likely. I was talking this week to one of the new Democrats, going to the opposite of your point.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm..\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: One of the-- not the most famous new Democrat on the Hill, but one of the--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: --one of the new ones. And there is a-- there is a strong ideological feeling that you can't give in on-- on any-- any compromise, even a compromise that gets them DACA or something else, which is a kind of interesting mirror of what you're seeing in the Republican base, which is wall or-- or nothing at all. So you have everybody dug in and you have no negotiating going on. I'm always struck in these moments by the fact that the President, who allegedly is one of the world's great negotiators, isn't much of a negotiator at all. So I just don't-- I don't-- I don't see-- I don't see this resolving itself anytime soon.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: If-- if anything-- we had a-- a year ago, there was a big debate over immigration. This idea, he traded a border wall funding for legalization for these Dreamers. The President then turned that down by all accounts and asked for more. He said, We want to cut legal immigration, we want to speed up deportations, change laws that Democrats didn't agree with and many, even moderate Republicans don't want to change, which is providing some protection legally to immigrant children who're coming across. Since then, he has made it tougher by the policies he's enacted unilaterally--the separations at the border in June of children from their parents, sending troops to the border during the campaign.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: From the Democrats I talked to, they said This has made us even less-- more-- more skeptical of him that he either-- either take a deal. But also his policies are so inhumane, in their mind, We're not going to give him any ground on the wall.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Skepticism. That's even more salient is the skepticism of the core of the Trump's base worrying Ann Coulter-base, let's call it, worrying that he is going to give in. He's extraordinarily sensitive to that. That's why there is really not much hope for negotiating a settlement to this anytime soon because he's so worried about that that core of the core.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Seung Min, when we heard from Senator Graham last week on this show, he was saying one of the things most offensive to him as representative of Republicans was this accusation that somehow in their calls for border security they're being called racists. I thought it was interesting to hear from-- from Leader McCarthy here that when it comes to those accusations within his party right now around this Iowa Republican Steve King that that he wants to take a stand on this.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: I found it really fascinating, as well. I mean, I-- those comments from Leader McCarthy on your show just a few minutes ago was probably among the strongest condemnations that we have heard from senior House Republicans about Congressman King's rhetoric and behavior. And I found it really interesting when he said, quote, actions will be taken against Congressman King--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: -- that he's meeting with him tomorrow to discuss this issue.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like he may be losing his committee memberships.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: That's exact--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There will be action taken against in the meeting. He will be downgraded.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: That was my-- that was my assumption when-- because that's usually what--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: --a party leader can do. The Congressional Black Caucus has called for Congressman King to be stripped of his committee assignments. And it's just interesting because Congressman King has been controversial for a very long time. I mean I'm-- I'm from Iowa, so I'm familiar with his rhetoric. But-- and he said things about immigration during the immigration debate a few years ago. But you are seeing this rise in very vocal condemnations of his rhetoric. I mean, it wasn't just Leader McCarthy, Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa called those remarks racist and said they are not representative of the state.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Tim Scott--\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: Exactly.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --had the bet on it.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: Exactly, as well. So it's-- so the-- the rise in opposition against what he's-- what the Congressman has been saying, you know, frankly for a long time has been interesting to watch.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: And that's really important because we're at a moment in this country where people worry that certain kinds of rhetoric are being normalized and that the--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: --that the parameters of debate are expanding to areas that would have been intolerable a few years ago. And you think about, for instance, what happened in Charlottesville in the degree that there was some-- some-- almost a tacit approval of that or even when the President said there were, you know, find people on both sides in Charlottesville.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: It's nice to see that people are pushing back. They are still to some degree enforcing those norms of conversation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you, Seung Min, to clarify something. Leader McCarthy mentioned, I'm not in Puerto Rico, I'm here in Washington. What was the point he was trying to make there?\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Very subtle point.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: So--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Very subtle point.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: --there is-- yeah. So there is a contingent of congressional Democrats who are on-- in Nevada and Puerto Rico right now for a Super PAC. The optics are great, I will say--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: During the shutdown.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: --during the shutdown. And there is, obviously-- because a lot of the shutdown is a messaging war and optics war. And you-- Leader McCarthy-- Kevin McCarthy made a point of saying, Look, I am here in DC. I am ready to work. He pointed out that he is usually in California when-- when you speak to him.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSEUNG MIN KIM: And there is some unhappiness among Democratic quarters that that trip happened this week.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: I am old enough to remember when people thought that Puerto Rico was a natural Republican stronghold, by the way. But it doesn't seem like the party believes that anymore.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No. If we did-- when we looked at the-- the group, the delegation that did go to Puerto Rico, it looks like Speaker Pelosi decided not to go though she had been originally expected to be there. So it-- it is an optics war, it's a rhetoric war. And, unfortunately, it doesn't sound like there is much traction to getting anything done.\n\nBut I want to take a quick break, come back because there is a lot more we need to sort through here. So we're going to take a short break. Stay with us, more from our panel.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back now with our panel. We started off the show with speaker, excuse me, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo talking about his trip through the Middle East. Jeff, can you tell me what the Syria policy is of the Trump administration?\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: It's the best policy. All the best policies. That's the problem in understanding and probably doing commentary on our foreign policies that we have so many foreign policies at once. This secretary did a-- made a valiant effort to suggest that we are not withdrawing from Syria even though we're actually withdrawing from Syria. And-- and the people who are coming out of Syria, the Americans troops, even if they are coming out in an orderly fashion, as he said, are there to fight terrorists. And it's very, very hard to make the case that you're doubling down your fight against terrorism when you're leaving. The-- the core of the problem is that the President he works for is isolationist by disposition. Doesn't understand why we're in the Middle East at all. Mike Pompeo comes from another tradition, quite the opposite tradition. He believes in a muscular American presence. And we saw his very, very strong speech in Cairo, which is allegedly a repudiation of Obama policy. So it's--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even down just to the-- to the orchestration of it--\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --in Cairo.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. A little bit-- a little bit in your face. I'm going to Cairo and I'm repudiating what you just said in a really unusual way. And-- and so you have so many different foreign policies in-- inside one administration, it's hard to keep them straight.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And--\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: Think about this, though. I was thinking about this, you know, the President's other big gambit on foreign policy is this ongoing dialogue of some, sort of, with North Korea. Think what Kim Jong-un must be seeing here. You have the-- the hawkish secretary of state and National Security Adviser John Bolton with one view of how to approach Iran and stay in Syria.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: And the President is saying, No, you know, I have my own view. I'm just going to do the opposite. You see, now Kim Jong-un continue to send letters to President Trump, very flattering. He wants to deal directly with the President because he sees this sort of a-- a chance, you know, to sort of maybe get some gains. I mean the idea of--\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: But if he's smart--\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: --he might know that that those gains are not durable.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: They are not durable.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yeah. And it-- yeah.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: But-- but, you know, Kim Jong-un's goal is to reduce troop presence, right, in-- in the Korean Peninsula. Look-- look, what's going on here in Syria?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And to cut back all the military--\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --umbrella--\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: Umbrella.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that the United States has in the region. On Iran, to add to Jeff's point, you heard the secretary of state this week say, we are going to try to get every boot, Iranian boot out of Syria. How do you do that when you don't have a military there?\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Can you convince them with strong words? I-- I don't know. You made the excellent point that the threat of military force, obviously is-- is when you couple that with effective diplomacy that's one way to do it. No, it doesn't seem-- I mean, look, this is why the Israelis and many of the Gulf Arabs were so nervous when Trump announced this impromptu policy shift, radical policy shift, because you-- you leave Syria that allows Iran to come in fully. Pompeo's speech in Cairo was a very, very anti-Iran speech.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Nothing is adding up. This is the problem. I mean you have to have policies that actually correspond to the reality on the ground. And so I-- I think it's very, very hard to understand how this works.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: Pompeo did say something today that I've heard him say before that I think could be worth focusing on. He keeps referring to the withdrawal of uniformed American troops from Syria. I don't know exactly what he means. But I am wondering to what degree the administration at least maybe telling (INDISTINCT) officials like Pompeo in defending Trump's policy. We're going to have the CIA and then we might even have--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: --contractors. We know there's been a lot of debate around this administration with the possibility of using contractors. So I think that's something to keep an eye on. I think it's noteworthy that he keeps stressing that word.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It-- it's a good-- good point to (INDISTINCT) because clearly having an intelligence presence is incredibly important in a place that is home to so many terror groups at this point. That's one of the things that Israelis were concerned about--\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Of course.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --losing.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: I mean the other quick point to make on this is that Pompeo's speech was very, very hard on Iran. But one of the reasons it's not flying in the Middle East is that recognizing that all diplomacy is hypocrisy to some degree. There is not a harsh word to be said about Saudi Arabia, and one does not have to think that Iran is anything other than the leading state sponsor of terror. You-- you can still think that but also think that our punitive allies are also human rights violators and authoritarian despotic regimes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: It would be fascinating to watch this week.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Michael, I want to ask you, we-- we did ask both the secretary and Leader McCarthy about these reports in the past few days about the President's relationship with Russia or at least his decision to not make public the notes that he has had from interpreters from private meetings with Vladimir Putin. Why is it important that the rest of the national security establishment be part of this? As leader McCarthy said this is just about a personal relationship.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: Sure. Well, there's the-- there's the sort of traditional reason, which is that the foreign policy machine works better if all the smart people who are looking at it from different angles, people who have regional focuses who have expertise in Putin's psychology who are arms control experts can see the conversation and weigh in. And-- and, you know, referring back to the parsing language, hey, it was really important and significant that Putin use this word. You know, he hasn't used this word in six years. It means that they're interested in this again. Or somebody can point out I can see that he's putting pressure on this issue trying to move us. The President who, you know, is totally new to diplomacy as of two years ago, wouldn't be picking up on those things. That's just how it traditionally works. And you have-- it's almost like crowdsourcing, right, get all the best minds looking at this and then--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: --you get together and talk about it. Okay. So, now the Trump's specific problem is that, you know, we know senior officials in our own Justice Department at one point, a couple of years ago according to the great reporting by the New York Times yesterday, believed it was at least worth investigating whether the President, I can't believe I'm saying these words--\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yeah.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: --on television, it's like am I living in a dream, may have been acting as an agent for the Russian government and Vladimir Putin.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: It's not a dream, it's a bad movie.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: I mean, a bad-- a bad movie, the greatest movie ever made, who knows exactly--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's an extraordinary report.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: It's-- it's stunning. And I want to say, to go back-- and then the Washington Post, by the way, followed up with the great report, that after a meeting he had with Vladimir Putin and only a translator in the room, asked the translator for those notes and took them away. And they were not circulated through the government. Just very quickly, last point, David, to your earlier point about leaders seeing the officials around Trump and going around them--\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: --and going straight to Trump. Lot of reasons, I think there's Vla-- that Vladimir Putin is doing that, whether or not it's some kind of a spy movie running an-- an agent thing or just pure psychology. That's the game he's playing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It's also extraordinary to have the America's top diplomat, the secretary of state, twice clarify that the President is not a national security threat--\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --and laugh-- and-- and say that's laughable.\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. It's worth dilating on this for one moment, that we're in a situation where we're discussing in serious terms whether or not the President of the United States is a Russian intelligence asset. And that's-- that's what's happening in Washington today. And that is truly remarkable thing that we're experiencing right now.\n\nMICHAEL CROWLEY: Yeah.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: And the President's response on this about, you know, keeping this meeting quiet is-- and keeping people out of it, it's not just to have a better relationship with leader like Vladimir Putin. But also that there's been leaks of his other, especially early in his presidencies, from really embarrassing leaks about what he said to other world leaders that made him look foolish, made him look reckless. But now he's sort of created this extra problem that either-- leaders-- because he's not staying on some sort of script or--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: --you know-- you know, going with the talking points that are developed by a national security agency or staff, be prepare for these meetings, sort of ad-libbing and having these sort of embarrassing--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: --leaks come out. Now he's left with a situation where it looks certainly bad if, you know, if he's keep-- if he's taking notes from his translator.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The story is not going away. We'll continue it. But we have to leave the panel here.\n\nDAVID NAKAMURA: Thanks.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back in a moment with former Obama administration Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.\n\nJEH JOHNSON (Former Secretary of Homeland Security): Margaret, thanks for having me.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In addition to being Homeland Security Secretary, before that you had also been general counsel at the Pentagon.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So I know you're very familiar with some of the legal authorities here--\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --that we may need to-- to look at, because the President says that he may declare a national security emergency in order to get border funding for this wall. Take it from other monies that Congress had already approved and use it in a way they didn't approve. Does he have the ability legally to do this?\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Well, first, Margaret, I just have to say there is an emerging crisis in Homeland Security on our border, by taking the very workers we depend upon for our security, land, sea, air, Secret Service, Coast Guard, Border Patrol, customs agents and so forth, and inflicting on them all sorts of stress and anxiety in their personal life about whether they're going to be paid and when. That's the security crisis that I see from the workforce in DHS.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Now when it comes legally to whether or not the President can declare a national emergency to get around the dispute, earlier in the week the administration seemed to be talking about using a Department of Defense authority to take money that's been designated by Congress for military construction toward another project. The law specifically allows for that upon the declaration of a national emergency. But that particular provision is typically used overseas to support the military like building detention facilities or military housing. The lawyers in the administration now seem to have come to a provision that allows for a reprogramming, as we refer to it, taking money from Army's civil works projects here in the United States that were at some point essential to national defense and then redesignating and reprogramming it for some other Army civil works project.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that aid money for Puerto Rico and--\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Correct.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --money for California--\n\nJEH JOHNSON: So, in my view, that's probably slightly more legally plausible. The earlier defense authority was really trying to jam us square peg in a round hole.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: This one is slightly more plausible, but politically highly objectionable because you're taking billions of dollars away from important civil works projects to recover from the hurricanes and the wildfires. And I-- I would predict there'd be huge, huge objection to doing that. Ultimately, this-- this has to be something for our political leadership to work out--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: --to get the government back to work. That's the most basic function of our civilian political leadership, to keep the government open and pay the workers.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and to your point, it is worth what you underscored there, that a number of people who work on national security issues aren't getting paid because of this--\n\nJEH JOHNSON: The people we--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --border crisis.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: --depend upon to find explosives and luggage, to find weapons and luggage, the people we depend upon to secure our borders to look for contraband at ports--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: --to look for narcotics at ports, are the people that are under great stress right now because of this shutdown. It be must be leading-- I think I know this workforce. It must be leading to all kinds of uncertainty, stress and anxiety, and frankly, anger and resentment. We see reports of TSOs calling in sick. And if this is not resolved soon, I predict that that's going to go in the wrong direction and we're going to start seeing longer and longer lines at airports.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: When you were at DHS, I know you said that-- at that time in 2015, you saw the influx and apprehensions of children and family units as an emerging crisis.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Yeah.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Now the Trump administration is seeing record numbers of those family--\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --units coming across the border. They're saying this is a crisis now, and it sounds like the one you saw coming. So this is a unique challenge for them. Are they wrong to call that a crisis?\n\nJEH JOHNSON: It is very definitely humanitarian crisis because of the poverty and violence in Central America. And the way to deal with this problem, frankly, is make a long-term investment in helping to eradicate the poverty and violence in the three countries that are probably the most violent on Earth. That's not a quick, simple, easy fix which Washington likes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Correct. And so we need to make a long-term political commitment to investing and dealing with those push factors, otherwise we're going to continue to deal with this problem for a very long time.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Border wall, what I hear you saying, not the most effective way. Let me get, though, to-- to the nuts and bolts of the family members here. Because the Obama administration faced some challenges on the question of whether they could detain families together--\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --for more than twenty days.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Mm-Mm.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's at the heart of the Trump administration's, you know, defenses as to why they were justifying the separation of families. So what alternatives are there?\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Well, you're referring to the Flores decision--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: --which imposed basically a limit on us to hold people for longer than-- than twenty days. I think that there has to be a range of tools that DHS can go to in-- in a crisis when you see a spike like this. Again, it requires a long-term investment and the push factors. But we need things like-- we, you know, we can always assess whether there is more border security that's necessary. More surveillance, more road, perhaps, fortifying walls. In my judgment, there also needs to be more immigration judges--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: --to move these cases along. But it does require a range of things and a long-term political commitment to dealing with the underlying factors that lead to these crisis.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, do you expect the Supreme Court to uphold the DACA ruling?\n\nJEH JOHNSON: I-- I hesitate to predict what this Supreme Court will do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: I think that there is adequate legal basis for the program.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. At the heart of-- of some of these potential solutions. So thank you very much.\n\nJEH JOHNSON: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
The Trump administration on Monday re-designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, hitting the country with new sanctions that could hamstring President-elect Joe Biden's promise to renew relations with the communist-governed island. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the step, citing in particular Cuba's continued harboring of U.S. fugitives, its refusal to extradite a coterie of Colombian guerrilla commanders as well as its support for Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe designation, which had been discussed for years, is one of several last-minute foreign policy moves that the Trump administration is making before Mr. Biden takes office Jan. 20.\n\nRemoving Cuba from the blacklist had been one of former President Barack Obama's main foreign policy achievements as he sought better relations with the island, an effort endorsed by Mr. Biden as his vice president. Ties had been essentially frozen after Fidel Castro took power in 1959.\n\nAs he has with Iran, Mr. Trump has sought to reverse many of Obama's decisions involving Cuba. He has taken a tough line on Havana and rolled back many of the sanctions that the Obama administration had eased or lifted after the restoration of full diplomatic relations in 2015.\n\nSince Mr. Trump took office, after a campaign that attacked Mr. Obama's moves to normalize relations with Cuba, ties have been increasingly strained.\n\nIn addition to attacking Cuba for its support of Maduro, the Trump administration has also suggested that Cuba may have been behind or allowed alleged sonic attacks that left dozens of U.S. diplomats in Havana with brain injuries starting in late 2016.\n\nHowever, few U.S, allies believe Cuba remains a sponsor of international terrorism, quibbling with either the definition based on the support for Maduro or outright rejecting American claims that Cuban authorities are bankrolling or masterminding international terrorist attacks.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez condemned the U.S. action. The US political opportunism is recognized by those who are honestly concerned about the scourge of terrorism and its victims, he said on Twitter.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Mr. Trump's designation would not help the Cuban people and seeks only to tie the hands of the Biden administration.\n\nThis designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism with less than a week to go in his presidency and after he incited a domestic terror attack on the U.S. Capital ... that's hypocrisy, Meeks said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nNonetheless, cheered on by Cuban American and Venezuelan exiles in south Florida, the Trump administration has steadily increased restrictions on flights, trade and financial transactions between the U.S. and the island.\n\nThe latest sanctions put Cuba alongside North Korea, Syria and Iran as the only foreign nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism. As a result of Monday's actions, most travel from the U.S. to Cuba will be barred as well as the sending of remittances to Cuba from relatives in the United States, a significant source of income for the impoverished island.\n\nBut with dollar-generating business already reeling from the effects of the coronavirus and previous measures like Mr. Trump's ban on cruise ships and cap on remittances, the biggest impact will likely be diplomatic.\n\nThis will really slow any thaw in relations with the Biden administration, said Emilio Morales, an exiled Cuban economist and president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group.\n\nMorales said unwinding the measure will take at least a year and require careful study by the U.S. government. He is also doubtful whether Biden, who played no significant role in the Obama administration's opening to Cuba, would be willing to invest the sort of political capital Mr. Obama did and throw a lifeline to Cuba's leadership without anything in return.\n\nMr. Obama's removal of Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list had been a major target of Mr. Trump, Pompeo and other Cuba hawks in the current administration.\n\nCuba has repeatedly refused to turn over U.S. fugitives that have been granted asylum, including a black militant convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in the 1970s. In addition to political refugee status, U.S. fugitives have received free housing, health care and other benefits thanks to Cuba's government, which insists the U.S. has no legal or moral basis to demand their return.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest change since Mr. Obama's outreach in 2015 is Cuba's strong support for Maduro, who is considered by the a dictator whose pilfering of the oil-based economy has driven 5 million Venezuelans from their homes.\n\nCuba has had a long-standing alliance with Maduro, although it has long denied it has 20,000 troops and intelligence agents in Venezuela and says it has not carried out any security operations. Cuban officials, however, have said they have the right to carry out broad military and intelligence cooperation that they deem as legitimate.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries has grown strong in the past two decades, with Venezuela sending Cuba oil shipments worth billions of dollars and receiving tens of thousands of employees, including medical workers.\n\nIn May 2020, the State Department added Cuba to a list of countries that do not cooperate with U.S. counter-terrorism programs.\n\nIn making that determination, the department said several leaders of the National Liberation Army, a Colombian rebel group designated a terrorist organization, remained on the island despite Colombia's repeated request they be extradited to answer for the 2019 car bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 22 people.\n\nCuba has rejected such requests, saying that turning over the leaders would violate protocols agreed to by Colombia's government for peace efforts that were broken off after the deadly bombing.\n\nIn repudiating the allegations, President Miguel Díaz-Canel has said Cuba was the victim of terrorism. He cited an armed attack on its embassy in Washington last April as one example. Cubans see the blacklist as helping the U.S. justify the long-standing embargo on the island and other economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.
Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez backs the idea of a Green New Deal for the U.S., a plan popular in progressive policy circles under which the federal government would pour billions of dollars into renewable energy. How would the New York Democrat help fund such a costly program? Raise taxes on the rich to their highest level since 1980, just before Ronald Reagan started hacking rates.\n\nThe top tax on the wealthy should rise to as high as 70 percent, Ocasio-Cortez told 60 Minutes on Sunday. That approach stands in stark contrast to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which gave the lion's share of benefits from reducing federal income tax rates to top earners and corporations. Not surprisingly, conservatives are bashing Ocasio-Cortez' ideas. Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist wrote on Fox News that her soaking the rich plan is the opening shot in a renewed war against middle class taxpayers.\n\nRaising the so-called marginal tax rate on the rich would mark a return to the more progressive tax structure of the 1950s and 1960s -- under Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, for instance, the rate on those in the top bracket topped 90 percent.\n\nHere's what you should know about Ocasio-Cortez's plan and how higher tax rates would work.\n\nIt's about higher marginal rates -- not a flat rate\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, R.-Louisiana, tweeted that Ocasio-Cortez's approach would lead to the government taking away 70% of your income. Yet that comment misleadingly suggests that every dollar earned by taxpayers would be docked at a flat 70 percent -- that isn't what Ocasio-Cortez is proposing.\n\nRepublicans: Let Americans keep more of their own hard-earned money\n\nDemocrats: Take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs https://t.co/NxJPSCqvrt — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) January 5, 2019\n\nHer plan focuses on marginal tax rates, a progressive tax system that's the basis of the U.S. tax code. It works by taxing the lowest amount of income at the lowest tax rate, and then increasing it gradually as a person's income rises. The goal is to tax lower earners at lower rates, while assessing higher rates on wealthier Americans.\n\nSometimes lost in the criticism of Ocasio-Cortez' plan is the fact that higher marginal rates are paid only on each dollar earned above a particular tax bracket. For instance, single Americans now pay at a rate of 10 percent on earnings up to $9,525, while any earnings between $9,526 and $38,700 are taxed at 12 percent.\n\nCurrently, the top rate for single taxpayers kicks in at 37 percent for every dollar earned over $500,000 in annual income.\n\nJacking up the top tax rate likely wouldn't impact you\n\nOcasio-Cortez doesn't favor imposing a 70 percent tax on the merely rich. Rather, that rate would be for people with annual income of at least $10 million or so. That's why it's not likely to hit your wallet -- only the top 0.1 percent of income earners are likely to come close to that, as this group enjoys average adjusted gross income of $7.3 million. And only 140,000 tax filers make this much money, compared with nearly 70 million who make up the bottom 50 percent of earners.\n\nThe economy still grew when tax rates were high\n\nThe U.S. economy boomed in the '50s and '60s when, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the top rate ranged between 70 percent and 92 percent. Of course, no time periods in economic history are directly comparable. In the post-World War II era, for instance, the baby boom drove massive spending on the housing market and productivity was much higher than it is today.\n\nBut the point is that higher top marginal tax rates don't appear to cause lower economic growth.\n\nOther developed countries have high tax rates\n\nSeveral advanced economies around the world have top tax rates approaching what Ocasio-Cortez favors, and by many measures they enjoy higher standards of living than the U.S.\n\nWhat we have in mind ... and my policies most closely resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden, she told 60 Minutes.\n\nSweden has a top rate of 70 percent, Matt Bruenig, founder of People's Policy Project, a left-leaning advocacy group wrote in Jacobin magazine. Sweden is ranked No. 11 by the Social Progress Imperative, which looks at the capacity for a country to meet basic human needs. The U.S. ranks No. 25, just below Portugal.\n\nA threat to the profit motive?\n\nOcasio-Cortez's plan echoes findings by economists including Nobel laureate Peter Diamond and Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez, who estimated that the ideal marginal tax rate should be 73 percent. Most other economists (including many conservative and pro-business experts) agree that a fair and productive society includes some form of progressive tax system, even if they vary in their calculations of what that should be.\n\nBut what about the argument that high tax rates dissuade people from working? After all, if Uncle Sam is going to take most of your income, why bother working at all? But that may be looking at the wrong question. Higher taxes on every dollar earned above $10 million isn't likely to lower multimillionaires' drive to remain rich (though it could arguably encourage them to seek ways to avoid taxes).\n\nPerhaps a more relevant question: Whether the tax system could encourage people to enter lower-paying yet socially useful jobs, such as teaching or scientific research. One study found that a radical policy of imposing taxes according to professions -- such as providing tax breaks to teachers while imposing higher taxes on hedge fund managers -- could grow the economy dramatically, its authors wrote in the Harvard Business Review.\n\nOcasio-Cortez didn't address such ideas, but her goal in taxing the extremely rich at higher levels is to guarantee a job for every American at a fair wage. When you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have health care. That is not -- that is not dignified, Ocasio-Cortez said.
Washington — The United States called off last-minute trips by top envoys to visit allies in Europe and Taiwan on Tuesday in a sudden diplomatic turnaround in the chaotic final days of the Trump administration. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been due to make a final official visit to Europe while Kelly Craft, Washington's U.N. envoy, was set to land in Taiwan on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut the visits were suddenly scrapped a week before Democrat Joe Biden takes office and as President Donald Trump faces an all-but-certain second impeachment on a charge of inciting his supporters to storm Congress last week.\n\nThe U-turn encapsulates the turbulent transition period that has enveloped Washington since Biden's November election victory.\n\nBut it also allows both Europe and Taiwan to dodge hosting what could have been potentially awkward delegations from an outgoing administration.\n\nIt was very late in the game to be having a visit of this level, Maggie Lewis, an analyst at Seton Hall Law school who is based in Taiwan, told AFP. It's appropriate to be focusing on the incoming administration instead of the final days of the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo walks on the grounds of the White House, December 11, 2020 in Washington. Getty\n\nThe cancelled trips round off four tumultuous years of foreign policy under Mr. Trump that tested Washington's traditional allies in both Europe and Asia.\n\nThe two-day stay in Europe would have been Pompeo's last foreign trip but the State Department announced he was staying home to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. The U.S. Mission to the UN confirmed to CBS News' Pamela Falk that the State Department travel cancellation would include Ambassador Craft's travel to Taiwan.\n\nPompeo disinvited?\n\nPompeo's trip was already looking of limited diplomatic value with the Secretary of State not scheduled to meet any top EU officials in Brussels.\n\nIn Luxembourg, an official told AFP on condition of anonymity that one leg of Pompeo's trip was cancelled after Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn called Mr. Trump a criminal in comments to RTL radio.\n\nAsselborn described Mr. Trump as a political pyromaniac who must be brought before a court over last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, left, is seen with Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn during a round table meeting of the North Atlantic Council at NATO headquarters in Brussels, in a December 1, 2015 file photo. AP/Virginia Mayo\n\nThe Reuters news agency, citing anonymous European diplomatic officials, reported Wednesday that Pompeo's visits to both Brussels and Luxembourg were called off after Asselborn and EU officials refused to schedule meetings with the top American diplomat.\n\nPompeo had been scheduled to meet in Brussels with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, over dinner on Wednesday, and then to hold a sit-down with Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes.\n\nPompeo has remained staunchly loyal to Mr. Trump despite resignations from a string of his cabinet colleagues and calls to force the president from office over the attack on the Capitol.\n\nHigh stakes ties with Taiwan\n\nCraft's planned visit to Taiwan came at an acutely perilous time for the self-ruled democracy. Authoritarian China regards Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to seize it one day, by force if necessary.\n\nBeijing's saber-rattling has reached new heights with Chinese jets making a record 380 incursions into Taiwan's defense zone last year to signal anger over Washington's burgeoning relationship with Taipei during the Trump years.\n\nThe stakes are high. A wrong move in the Taiwan Strait could spark conflict between two economic, nuclear-armed superpowers, something the Biden administration will need to grapple with.\n\nThe U.S. switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979 but it remains Taipei's leading unofficial ally and is bound by Congress to sell the island weapons to defend itself.\n\nAs Mr. Trump feuded with China on a host of issues, from the coronavirus to trade and national security, Taipei became a way to poke Beijing in the eye.\n\nDuring his tenure, Mr. Trump signed off on some $18 billion in big-ticket arms deals for Taiwan and ramped up the frequency of official visits, including sending a cabinet official last year, the highest-level delegation since 1979.\n\nThen on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared he was lifting complex internal restrictions limiting official contacts with Taiwan. Beijing promptly warned Washington would receive a resolute counterstrike from China over the move and pay a heavy price if Craft visited.\n\nProtecting Taiwan, one of Asia's most progressive democracies, from a Chinese invasion has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington.\n\nBut Biden, who favors a far less confrontational diplomatic style than Mr. Trump, has given few details on what his Taiwan policy might be.\n\nBonnie Glaser, an expert on Taiwan and China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Taipei would be disappointed, but also somewhat relieved by Craft's last-minute cancellation.\n\nTaiwan doesn't want to create friction with the incoming administration, she told AFP.
On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed more than a dozen executive actions, some of which reverse decisions made by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump.\n\nSeveral executive actions will make changes to the U.S. response to COVID-19 and try to ease some of the financial strain on Americans resulting from the pandemic. Other executive actions directly target and undo Mr. Trump's actions on the environment, immigration, the U.S. census, and regulatory changes.\n\nMr. Biden signed three executive orders in the presence of reporters — implementing a mask mandate on federal property, increasing support for underserved communities and rejoining the Paris climate accord.\n\nI thought there's no time to wait. Get to work immediately, he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he signs his first executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday, January 20, 2021, in Washington, D.C. Evan Vucci / AP\n\nMr. Biden said Mr. Trump had left a letter for him, which he described as very generous, but said he wouldn't divulge the contents. Because it was private, I will not talk about it until I talk to him, but it was generous, he said.\n\nIncoming top Biden White House advisers outlined and described the executive actions on a press call Tuesday evening, and Biden aides also promised there would be more to come.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks we will be announcing additional executive actions that confront these challenges and deliver on the President-elect's promises to the American people, including revoking the ban on military service by transgender Americans, and reversing the Mexico City policy, incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.\n\nBelow is CBS News' breakdown of Mr. Biden's first 15 executive orders and the two executive actions he was expected to signed on Wednesday:\n\nCOVID-19 response\n\nStart a 100 Days Masking Challenge, calling for a nationwide face mask and social distancing mandate in federal buildings, on federal lands and by federal employees and contractors.\n\nRestructure federal government coordination to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden White House is bringing back an Obama-era position called the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which was organized with additional staff within the National Security Council after the 2014 Ebola epidemic. This directorate office was dispersed into other roles during the Trump administration, but Biden and his campaign advisers argued the move decreased the preparedness of the federal government for the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Biden will also formally implement a response coordinator who will report to the president on vaccine, testing and personal protective equipment production, supply, and distribution. Mr. Biden has appointed Jeff Zients, who has been overseeing Mr. Biden's COVID-19 team for the presidential transition.\n\nRejoin the World Health Organization (WHO), which the Trump administration was in the process of leaving. Mr. Biden is also looking to reestablish the U.S. as an active leader at the WHO.\n\nFinancial relief for Americans\n\nExtend eviction and foreclosure moratoriums. To do this, Biden will call on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to re-implement and extend the already defunct moratorium until at least March 31. The new president will also call on the Departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs to extend the foreclosure moratoriums for their federally backed mortgages. These emergency measures are important, Mr. Biden's top economic adviser Brian Deese said on the call with reporters, There are more than 11 million mortgages guaranteed by the VA, Department of Agriculture and HUD that would be extended.\n\nContinue pause on student loan payments until September 30. The Biden advisers continue to assert Biden still supports his campaign pledge to cancel $10,000 of student loans, but this will take time as it has to go through Congress.\n\nEnvironment\n\nRejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. The Paris climate negotiations took place under the Obama administration and were led by incoming climate change czar John Kerry when he was secretary of state. This will take 30 days to go into effect.\n\nEnd Keystone XL pipeline and revoke oil and gas development at national wildlife monuments. To do this, Biden's climate adviser Gina McCarthy explained the Biden administration will discard or redo more than 100 harmful presidential proclamations, memoranda or permits signed by the Trump administration that the new administration views as detrimental to the environment.\n\nRevoking permits will effectively nix the Keystone pipeline. Mr. Biden also will reverse the 2020 decision by the Trump administration to allow land development at the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah and at the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine national monuments in New England, which were set aside for wildlife protection by former President Obama in 2016. Other changes include directing agencies to consider revising vehicle fuel economic and emissions standards and placing federal working groups to deal with greenhouse gases, according to an outline of the executive orders.\n\nHuman rights\n\nActions to advance racial equity through the federal government. Incoming Domestic Policy Adviser Susan Rice explained President Biden wants every federal agency to review equity in their programs and actions. For example, with this executive action the Office of Management and Budget will analyze if federal money is equitably distributed in communities of color and other places of need, the outline of the executive action said. Rice also said Trump's harmful 1776 Commission, the 18-member board he formulated in September, will be stopped. The commission's goal was to study the president's concern that the American education system was taking a too liberal approach to American history.\n\nCount non-citizens in U.S. Census again. This reverses President Trump's order in July 2020 to not count undocumented Americans, which would affect federal allocation of money and federal representation. Rice on the Wednesday press call said Trump's was an approach that violates the Constitution and the Census Act and is inconsistent with our nation's history and our commitment to representative democracy. The Biden team's outline of the executive order said Biden will ensure that the Census Bureau has time to complete an accurate population count for each state and that he will then present to Congress an apportionment that is fair and accurate so federal resources are efficiently and fairly distributed for the next decade.\n\nStrengthen workplace discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. At agencies, this broadens the federal protections against sex discrimination to include LGBTQ Americans.\n\nImmigration\n\nDefend Dreamers program for undocumented young Americans. Mr. Biden, in this executive order, calls on Congress to grant permanent status and a path to citizenship to Dreamers — almost a million undocumented young people who were brought to the country as children and shielded from deportation by President Obama. The Trump administration challenged the law but the Supreme Court upheld it.\n\nEnd so-called Muslim travel ban, which in 2017 restricted travel and immigration to the U.S. from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, before adding Eritrea, Nigeria, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Tanzania in 2020. The State Department is also instructed to restart visa applications for these countries.\n\nChange Trump's arrest priorities for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This executive order will repeal the changes Mr. Trump made in the first week of his presidency in 2017 to make interior immigration enforcement much stricter. Few specifics were listed in the outline of the executive order, but the incoming Biden White House team stated the Department of Homeland Security, in partnership with other agencies, will set civil immigration enforcement policies that best protect the American people and are in line with our values and priorities.\n\nStop border wall construction. Mr. Biden will end the national emergency declaration cited by the Trump administration to divert money to the building of the southern wall.\n\nKeep protections for a group of Liberians in the country. Liberians who have been in the United States for many years will be able to remain longer. Their deferred enforcement departure will be extended an additional year, until June 30, 2022. President Trump briefly considered ending this deferment before ultimately extending the program.\n\nRegulation\n\nFreezing last-minute Trump administration regulatory actions. Technically, White House chief of staff Ron Klain will be charged with carrying out this out, and a presidential memo will formally state the regulations to be frozen.\n\nEthics\n\nFormulate Executive Branch ethics doctrine. Mr. Biden wants every executive branch appointee to sign an ethics pledge. The pledge also demands federal employees promise to uphold the independence of the Department of Justice, the executive order outline states.
Taxing electronic cigarettes like regular smokes could result in fewer Americans kicking the habit, some researchers think. A new study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that taxing vaping products at the same rate as cigarettes could deter 2.7 million U.S. adults from quitting over a decade.\n\nAlthough there is no federal tax on e-cigarettes, some 17 states and the District of Columbia have a vaping tax, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts. More than half of those states imposed the levy this year amid growing concerns about the safety of e-cigarettes. The taxes come as the vaping industry faces mounting scrutiny for marketing practices that critics say targets younger Americans.\n\nA deadly spate of lung illnesses tied to unregulated vaping products also had the Trump administration recently mulling a ban on flavored e-cigarettes and Congress this month passing a law to raise to 21 the legal age to buy tobacco or vaping gear.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Minnesota became the first state in the U.S. to tax e-cigs. It initially imposed a rate of 35%, before sharply raising the levy in 2013 to a full 95% of the wholesale price for vaping products. The researchers — economists Dhaval Dave of Bentley University and Daniel Dench, Michael Grossman and Henry Saffer, all of City University of New York — wanted to weigh the impact of these taxes to assess the impact on consumer behavior.\n\nTheir main takeaway: In looking at the state's 600,000 adult smokers, Minnesota's e-cigarette tax deterred more than 32,000 adult smokers from giving up regular cigarettes over a 10-year period. That's because the sharp increase in vaping costs in the state made the products more expensive, discouraging consumers.\n\nNot surprisingly, a nationwide vaping tax like the one imposed in Minnesota could have a larger effect. Should federal policy makers opt to tax e-cigs at the same rate as regular cigarettes, the price of the vaping products would rise about 62%, according to the study. That could deter up to 2.7 million smokers from quitting tobacco cigarettes, the researchers conclude.\n\nRoughly 34 million Americans, or around 14% of the adult population, smoke cigarettes. And despite the potential impact of vaping taxes on smoking cessation, other considerations could still justify the added costs, the researchers said.\n\nThe public health benefits of not taxing e-cigarettes, however, must be weighed against effects of this decision on efforts to reduce vaping by youth, they cautioned.
WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 10: Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) participates in a Senate Foreign relations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, March 10, 2015 in Washington, DC. Mark Wilson / Getty Images\n\nThe top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee is seeking to subpoena a witness tied to the investigation of Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy firm where Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, sat on its board, according to a letter obtained by CBS News.\n\nSenator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sent a letter to committee members Sunday informing them of his intent to schedule a meeting during which they would consider a subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former consultant for the U.S.-based government affairs firm Blue Star, for documents related to his work there. Blue Star was a U.S. representative for Burisma, Johnson said.\n\nTelizhenko is a former Ukrainian diplomat at the center of claims Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAccording to the letter, Telizhenko expressed his willingness to 'cooperate fully' with the Senate panel's investigation into the Bidens and Ukraine, but is subject to a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nAs part of the committee's ongoing investigation, it has received U.S. government records indicating that Blue Star sought to leverage Hunter Biden's role as a board member of Burisma to gain access to, and potentially influence matters at, the State Department, Johnson wrote. The committee has not made records it received public.\n\nJohnson said the committee's ranking member, Democratic Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, disapproves of issuing the subpoena and is concerned that the United States Senate and this committee could be used to further disinformation efforts by Russians or other actors.\n\nAccording to the letter, the Republican-controlled committee has been investigating matters related to Burisma for nearly a year. Congressional records indicate Peters' office was notified on February 24 of Johnson's intent to issue the subpoena. In a letter to Johnson dated February 27, Peters expressed his disapproval of issuing the subpoena and said he requested the committee receive defensive briefings — specifically regarding Mr. Telizhenko — from relevant intelligence community and law enforcement officials, to ensure the Senate is not used to advance any disinformation campaigns.\n\nThe Wisconsin senator wrote that he shares the concern, and said the FBI provided a response that directly addressed the stated concerns.  The subpoena, he added, was narrowly drafted for records from Telizhenko's work for Blue Star as it relates to Burisma.\n\nThe committee recently reviewed relevant State Department documents that corroborate records Mr. Telizhenko already produced to the committee, including correspondence with Blue Star officials not covered by his NDA, Johnson wrote.\n\nJohnson questioned the apparent resistance to pursuing the matter, saying [t]he American people have a right to know how their government officials conducted official business, whether certain parties received special treatment, and whether any apparent or actual conflict of interest unduly influenced U.S. policy.\n\nIt's unclear when the meeting to discuss a possible subpoena will take place, but Johnson said a vote on whether to approve the subpoena will be scheduled in the near future.\n\nJohnson, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham have been investigating ties between Democrats and Ukraine, including possible conflicts of interests between Burisma and the Bidens, for the last few months.\n\nIn early December, the three Republican senators requested records and transcribed interviews between Telizhenko and Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American Democratic operative. They have also sought information from five former Obama administration officials, including David Wade, former chief of staff to Secretary of State John Kerry, and Anthony Blinken, former U.S. deputy secretary of state.\n\nPeters has dismissed efforts by the Republican chairmen to seek information on the unsubstantiated claim Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election and said in a statement to CBS News on Monday that national security and intelligence experts, as well as the Senate Intelligence Committee, show Russia is attempted to interfere in the 2020 elections.\n\nWe need to take every step to ensure the credibility and resources of the U.S. Senate are not used to advance interference efforts by foreign adversaries that seek to undermine our democracy or put our national security at risk, Peters said.\n\nHere's the full letter from Johnson:
The pay gap between male and female workers has been well documented. But there may also be an expectations gap in what men and women think they will earn during their careers.\n\nAccording to a survey released Friday by job services website CareerBuilder, men and women have wildly different expectations for how much they will eventually earn. When asked to estimate the highest annual salary they thought they would earn during their careers, more than twice as many men than women said they expected to make more than $100,000.\n\nSome 44 percent of men thought their salaries would top out at more than $100,000, while only 20 percent of women did the same. About 12 percent of men expected a peak salary of $200,000 or more; just 3 percent of women gave that figure.\n\nFor perspective, only about 14 percent of people who worked full-time in 2015 earned over $100,000, according to Census data.\n\nThe upshot: Men's average peak salary was nearly double the women's, CareerBuilder found.\n\nThose divergent expectations are not surprising considering that women are often paid less than men for comparable work and tend to cluster in lower-paid occupations, said Ariane Hegewisch, program director of employment and earnings at the Institute for Women's Policy Research.\n\nYou dream in context, and the context is what you observe others making, she said.\n\nAlthough there is debate over just how much less women earn than men, most economists put the figure at around 80 cents to the dollar for comparable work. That gap has narrowed only modestly in recent decades, from 75 percent in 1997.\n\nWomen who think about their own careers often use their mother or other women as a reference point, rather than men, who are often in higher-paying fields.\n\nA similar pattern was evident when men and women were asked the top title they expected to achieve in their career, though the difference between the sexes was smaller.\n\nIt's unclear if the CareerBuilder data focused on a specific age group -- if it includes many women farther along in their careers, especially those with families, it could reflect reality more than expectations. However, even lowered expectations can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, Hegewisch said.\n\nSo much of how much you earn, particularly in the higher-paying jobs, is influenced by negotiation and you past salary history. And not dreaming big also means you negotiate less.
Hong Kong — Hong Kong police arrested 53 former lawmakers and democracy proponents on Wednesday, including an American human rights lawyer, for allegedly violating a new national security law by participating in unofficial election primaries for the territory's legislature last year. The mass arrests were the biggest action against Hong Kong's democracy movement since the law was imposed by Beijing last June to quell dissent in the semi-autonomous territory.\n\n\n\nThe operation today targets the active elements who are suspected to be involved in the crime of overthrowing, or interfering (and) seriously destroy the Hong Kong government's legal execution of duties, said John Lee, Hong Kong's security minister, in a news conference.\n\nAmerican human rights lawyer John Clancey, center, is arrested by police in Hong Kong, January 6, 2021. AP\n\nHe said those arrested were suspected of trying to paralyze the government through by gaining a majority of seats in the legislature and thus creating a situation in which the chief executive had to resign and the government would stop functioning.\n\n\n\nIn a video posted to the Facebook page of former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, police are seen turning up at his house and telling him he's suspected of violating the national security law, subverting state power. Police told those recording the video to stop or risk arrest.\n\n\n\nThe legislative election that would have followed the unofficial primaries was postponed by a year by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who cited public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic. Mass resignations and disqualifications of pro-democracy lawmakers have left the legislature largely a pro-Beijing body.\n\n\n\nLee said the police would not target those who had voted in the unofficial primaries, which were held in July last year and attracted more than 600,000 voters even though pro-Beijing lawmakers and politicians had warned the event could breach the security law.\n\nWho was arrested?\n\nAll of the pro-democracy candidates in the unofficial primaries were arrested, according to tallies of the arrests being reported by the South China Morning Post, online platform Now News and political groups.\n\n\n\nAt least seven members of Hong Kong's Democratic Party — the city's largest opposition party — were arrested, including former party chairman Wu Chi-wai. Former lawmakers Lam, Helena Wong and James To were also arrested, according to a post on the party's Facebook page.\n\nBenny Tai, a key figure in Hong Kong's 2014 Occupy Central protests and a former law professor, was also arrested, reports said. Tai was one of the main organizers of the primaries.\n\nThe home of Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist who is serving a 13 1/2-month prison sentence for organizing and participating in an unauthorized protest last year, was also raided, according to a tweet posted from Wong's account.\n\nU.S. human rights lawyer detained\n\nAmerican human rights lawyer John Clancey was also arrested on Wednesday. Clancey was the treasurer of political group Power for Democracy, which was involved in the unofficial primaries.\n\n\n\nWe need to work for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong, Clancey said as he was being led away by police, in a video posted by local online news outlet Citizen News.\n\n\n\nPolice also went to the headquarters of Stand News, a prominent pro-democracy online news site in Hong Kong, with a court order to hand over documents to assist in an investigation related to the national security law, according to a livestreamed video by Stand News. No arrests were made.\n\nThe sweeping arrests drew condemnation from Anthony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State nominee for the upcoming Biden administration, who said on Twitter that it was an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights.\n\nThe sweeping arrests of pro-democracy demonstrators are an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights. The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy. https://t.co/nSj8dr3OEg — Antony Blinken (@ABlinken) January 6, 2021\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy, Blinken wrote in his tweet.\n\nAlleged plan for mutual destruction\n\nLee also pointed to a 10 steps to mutual destruction plan among those arrested, which included taking control of the legislature, mobilizing protests to paralyze society and calling for international sanctions.\n\n\n\nThat plan was previously outlined by former law professor Tai. He predicted that between 2020 and 2022, there would be 10 steps to mutual destruction which includes the pro-democracy bloc winning a majority in the legislature, intensifying protests, the forced resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam due to the budget bill being rejected twice, and international sanctions on the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\n\nThe concept of mutual destruction — in which both Hong Kong and China would suffer damages — is popular among some protesters and pro-democracy activists.\n\n\n\nThe plot is to create such mutual destruction that if successful ... will result in serious damage to society as a whole, said Lee. That is why police action today is necessary.\n\n\n\nSenior superintendent Steve Li from the national security unit said in a news conference that 53 people — 45 men and eight women aged between 23 to 64 — were arrested in an operation that involved 1,000 officers.\n\n\n\nSix were arrested for subverting state power by organizing the unofficial primaries, while the rest were arrested for allegedly participating in the event, Li said. He said more arrests could be made and investigations were ongoing.\n\nA mounting crackdown\n\nIn recent months, Hong Kong has already jailed several pro-democracy activists including Wong and Agnes Chow for their involvement in anti-government protests, and others have been charged under the national security law including media tycoon and outspoken pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai.\n\n\n\nThe security law criminalizes acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers to intervene in the city's affairs. Serious offenders could face up a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam had said at the time of the unofficial primaries last year that if their aim was resisting every policy initiative by the Hong Kong government, the election may fall under subverting state power, an offence under the national security law.\n\n\n\nBeijing had also called the primaries illegal and a serious provocation of Hong Kong's electoral system.\n\n\n\nFollowing the handover of Hong Kong to China by the British in 1997, the semi-autonomous Chinese city has operated on a one country, two systems framework that affords it freedoms not found on the mainland. In recent years, Beijing has asserted more control over the city, drawing criticism that it was breaking its promise of Hong Kong maintaining separate civil rights and political systems for 50 years from the handover.\n\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch said the arrests suggest Beijing has failed to learn that repression generates resistance. HRW senior China researcher Maya Wang said in a statement that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government.\n\n\n\nIn further remarks to The Associated Press, Wang said it wasn't clear what provisions of the law were being cited to justify the arrests, but that local authorities seem less concerned with legal substance.\n\n\n\nThe very nature of the national security law is as a draconian blanket law allowing the government to arrest and potentially imprison people for long terms for exercising their constitutionally protected rights, Wang said.\n\n\n\nThe veneer of rule of law is also applied in mainland China stripped of any meaning. Hong Kong is looking more like mainland China but where one ends and the other begins is hard to discern, she said.
It's increasingly trendy for restaurants and stores to refuse cash in favor of only accepting cashless payments — such as Apple Pay or credit cards — but that will soon be illegal in New York City.\n\nThe City Council on Thursday passed a bill that bans local businesses from not accepting cash. The bill also prohibits enterprises from penalizing customers who pay with cash by charging them higher prices. Businesses that violate the law could face fines of up to $1,500.\n\nIntentional or not, cashless retail has a discriminatory and exclusionary effect on New Yorkers who lack access to credit and debit cards, according to city councilman Ritchie Torres, who introduced the bill forbidding cashless-only payment. The practice of banning cash has sparked outrage against retailers like trendy restaurant chain Sweetgreen, which had moved to a cashless policy in 2016, citing improved employee safety and speed of service.\n\nLast year, Sweetgreen said it would again start accepting cash, explaining that the policy had the unintended consequence of excluding those who prefer to pay or can only pay with cash.\n\nThe new New York law will protect consumers who might lack access to banking services, but also reinforces the rights of those who want to pay with hard currency, Torres said.\n\nEven if you have access to credit and debit, there are some New Yorkers, especially senior citizens, who prefer cash because it's a familiar or habitual form of payment, Torres told CBS MoneyWatch. Whatever their reasons, consumers ought to have the right to choose their preferential method of payment.\n\nTorres acknowledged that cashless transactions can help businesses run more smoothly, but said the bill strikes a balance between equity and efficiency.\n\nThe bill will take effect within nine months after Mayor Bill de Blasio signs it into law.\n\nCash conversion machines\n\nThe law includes an exemption for businesses with machines that convert cash into a card that never expires, does not charge a fee and doesn't require a minimum deposit greater than $1. Having the ability to install machines allows business to preserve their electronic approach, Torres said.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 New York households are unbanked or underbanked. Nationally, about 6.5% of American households lack any bank accounts, while another 18.7% are underbanked, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Underbanked consumers may have a traditional bank account, but often turn to sources of financing outside the banking system, such as payday loans.\n\nWe in the City Council have real concerns that an increasingly cashless marketplace would have a real-world discriminatory effect on low-income communities — especially communities of color that lack access to credit or debit, Torres said at a press conference ahead of the vote Thursday.\n\nHe said the law protects those New Yorkers who are undocumented or homeless and face deeply entrenched barriers to accessing credit.\n\nPeople would hide in bathrooms\n\n\n\nWhile there's no formal tally of the number of cashless businesses in New York City, data from Square, a credit card processing system, shows that Americans are making fewer cash purchases than four years ago. From 2015 to 2019, the share of purchases under $20 made with cash declined from 46% to 37%.\n\nSome business owners are pushing back on the legislation, claiming it could slow the pace of service, reduce profits and jeopardize the safety of employees who are required to handle cash at night. Restaurant owner Michael Ryan said safety concerns motivated him to go cashless at his West Village taqueria Flip Sigi in 2015.\n\nPeople would hide in bathrooms, and managers who were there alone late at night with cash were robbed, he said.\n\nIt also made sense from an efficiency and cost perspective. Managers were spending 20 hours a week counting money and going to the bank, Ryan said.\n\nRyan said he'll likely invest in a cash machine that allows patrons to load their cash onto a card that can be used for payment.\n\nOther cities and states, including New Jersey, Philadelphia and San Francisco, have approved similar bans. Massachusetts has since 1978 required all retailers to accept cash.
Ben Crump, an attorney for Jacob Blake's family, spoke out Wednesday against the Kenosha, Wisconsin, district attorney's decision to not charge the officer who shot Blake in the back, saying it does nothing to help this issue of mistrust.\n\nWe have to have transparency and accountability to get that trust, Crump said on CBSN Wednesday.\n\nWe are going to file a civil rights excessive use of force 1983 civil rights lawsuit against the Kenosha Police Department, he said.\n\nPolice Officer Rusten Sheskey, who is White, was responding to a domestic dispute on August 23 when he fired his weapon seven times as Blake, a Black man, attempted to get inside an SUV. Blake survived, but was left unable to walk.\n\nThe shooting sparked nationwide outrage in a year that saw intense scrutiny of systemic racism and how police officers treat Black Americans and communities of color. That outrage was rekindled Tuesday when the district attorney announced that Sheskey would not be charged.\n\nTo try to say 'We couldn't have used the least intrusive measures to respond in this matter,' but with Black people, it always seems to be — and we saw this play out in 2020 like never before — you shoot first and you ask questions later, he said.\n\nCrump, a noted civil rights attorney who has represented a slew of other families of victims of police violence, compared police treatment of Blake with that of Kyle Rittenhouse, a White teenager who is accused of killing two people in the ensuing protests over the summer and walked past police unharmed.\n\nThey don't see the young White man who just killed people with a gun walking towards them as a threat, but yet you say a young Black man who is running away from you is a threat? Crump said. It emphasizes that there are two justice systems in America — one for Black America, and one for White America.\n\nIn his explanation, prosecutor Michael Graveley claimed Blake was armed with a knife and was twisting toward Sheskey just before the officer opened fire. Investigators have said they found a knife inside the vehicle but his family has denied he was armed.\n\nCrump said Sheskey's claim of self-defense was bogus. Mr. Blake never ever put them in harm's way. He was never an imminent threat to them. When you think about the elements that must be proved for self-defense, you have to prove that you were in imminent threat of bodily harm, he said.\n\nHe dismissed the accusation that Blake had a knife as an attempt to justify the unjustifiable excessive use of force by police.\n\nNAACP head Derrick Johnson said Blake's shooting and the lack of charges underscores the need for a racial equity adviser in President-elect Joe Biden's Cabinet.\n\nThere needs to be someone to review our public policy to ensure there is racial equity, to ensure that there are justices brought against incidents such as this, he said on CBSN Wednesday. This is not justice. This is an unfortunate reality that far too many young Black kids will have to see.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday evening following Graveley's announcement, the assistant attorney general for the DOJ's civil rights division and U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger said a federal civil rights investigation into the shooting of Jacob Blake is ongoing.
BURNS, Ore. -- An Oregon sheriff met Thursday with a small, armed group that has been occupying a national wildlife refuge and asked them to leave peacefully.\n\nHarney County Sheriff David Ward offered the group free and clear escort out of the county to end the standoff, but group leader Ammon Bundy refused.\n\nWard asked Bundy to talk it over with his members and said he would call Friday to find out what they had decided.\n\nThere are some positives that could come out of this, Ward told Bundy during their meeting at the intersection of two remote roads.\n\nBefore this thing turns into something negative, which would ruin all of that, I think we need to find a peaceful resolution to help you guys get out of here, Ward said.\n\nBundy replied that his complaints about federal land management policies are not being addressed.\n\nWe're getting ignored again, sir, said Bundy. I didn't come to argue, Ward said, and Bundy replied neither had he.\n\nWard said he would call Bundy on Friday to talk more.\n\nThe group objecting to federal land policy seized buildings at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon's high desert country on Saturday. Authorities have not yet stepped in to remove the group of roughly two dozen people, some from as far away as Arizona and Michigan.\n\nWard was cheered at a packed community meeting in Bend, Oregon, on Wednesday evening when he said the group needed to leave so local people could get back to their lives.\n\nGroup leader Ammon Bundy has told reporters they will leave when there's a plan in place to turn over federal lands to locals. The group also objects to a lengthy prison sentence for two local ranchers convicted of arson.\n\nOregon Gov. Kate Brown on Thursday called the occupation unlawful and said it had to end.\n\nIt was instigated by outsiders whose tactics we Oregonians don't agree with. Those individuals illegally occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge need to decamp immediately and be held accountable, she said.\n\nBundy's group, calling itself Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, says it wants an inquiry into whether the government is forcing ranchers off their land.\n\nParticipants came from as far away as Arizona and Michigan. Bundy came to Burns to rally support for two local ranchers who were sentenced to prison on arson charges.\n\nThe ranchers -- Dwight Hammond and his son Steven Hammond -- distanced themselves from Bundy's group and reported to prison Monday.\n\nThe Hammonds were convicted of arson three years ago and served no more than a year. A judge later ruled that the terms fell short of minimum sentences requiring them to serve about four more years.
In a first statement since leaving the White House, former President Obama's office released a statement Monday responding to protests that have erupted across the country in reaction to President Trump.\n\nPresident Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country, said Kevin Lewis, Obama's new spokesman. Citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\n\nLewis added that Obama fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.\n\nHe noted that in Obama's farewell address to the nation earlier this month, he spoke about the important role of citizen not just on Election Day, but every day.\n\nThe statement comes amid strong backlash to Mr. Trump's new policy that has blocked all travel to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries -- Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Libya -- for at least 90 days.\n\nIt resulted in more than 100 people being detained at U.S. airports over the weekend. The policy, as part of an executive order he signed Friday, also included the suspension of the U.S. refugee program for Syrian nationals for 120 days.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump's inauguration, Obama and the rest of his family left for Palm Springs, California for vacation. The former president and former first lady, Michelle Obama, will live in Washington, D.C. until at least their younger daughter Sasha graduates from high school.\n\nCBS News' Arden Farhi contributed to this report.
WEST PALM BEACH, Florida-- A Florida zoo official says an employee who waskilled by a tiger earlier this month didn't follow zoo policy.\n\nPalm Beach Zoo CEO Andrew Aiken said in a statement posted Friday on Facebook that zoo policy prohibits zookeepers from entering an enclosure to which a tiger has access.\n\nWe have no indication as to why she entered the tiger enclosure, said Aiken. Stacey was extremely knowledgeable and keenly aware of the strength, stealth and quickness of a mature Malayan tiger.\n\nStacey Konwiser, 38, was killed April 15 when a male Malayan tiger attacked her in the enclosure known as the night house, where tigers sleep and are fed.\n\nAiken said Konwiser entered the part of the night house after it was clearly designated as accessible by a tiger.\n\nAiken said five investigations are under way into the incident.\n\nThe zoo's Facebook page says zookeepers are never to enter into an enclosure when a tiger is present or has access to the enclosure.\n\nAfter the incident, Palm Beach Zoo spokesperson Naki Carter said Konwiser -- whose husband is also a zookeeper at the zoo -- inspired others by her dedication to these animal and desire to keep them from going extinct.\n\nShe was a tiger person, Carter said. Stacey spoke a language it seemed and they spoke a language with her, that was a dialogue that only they understood.\n\nAn undated photo shows Stacey Konwiser and her husband, Jeremy. Palm Beach Zoo\n\nDocuments released by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission dating back to 1990 reveal other tiger incidents at the zoo.\n\nCBS affilaite WPEC in West Palm reported that documents show an February 1990 in which a hired maintenance man got attacked by a monkey. The monkey bit the worker on the back of his hand.\n\nIn February 2008, a tiger at the Palm Beach Zoo bit the tip of the finger of a zookeeper. Susie Nuttall and another employee, according to the report, were training two male tigers, Mata and Rimba, in the night house, the same place Konwiser died.\n\nThe tigers were in separate cages when Nuttall was nipped by Mata as she fed the animal a reward. Nuttall, who had eight months of experience at the zoo, needed stitches to close the wound. The zoo, according to the report, no longer allowed hand feeding.\n\nIn May 2011, investigators said a maintenance worker entered a restricted area to retrieve a DVD. One of the tigers jumped on the mesh of the enclosure and caused minor injuries to the worker's back.\n\nThe zoo was last inspected in January. No violations were found.
Airbnb said Monday that it's reviewing reservations in the Washington, D.C., area ahead of next week's presidential inauguration and will bar any guests associated with hate groups or violent activity. The move comes as some city officials ask Airbnb, VRBO and other rental hosts to take down their listings until the January 20 inauguration is over.\n\nThere's no way to guarantee that your guests are not coming to incite violence, Janeese Lewis George, a Washington city council member, said in a post on Twitter. Please protect your neighbors and the District from more attacks.\n\nAirbnb has had a policy of removing guests who are confirmed to be members of hate groups since 2017, when it blocked guests who were headed to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAirbnb said it will warn all guests in the Washington region that it may bring legal action against them if they are members of hate groups or if they plan violent activities. It's also telling hosts to call a hotline if they suspect guests are violating Airbnb's policy.\n\nAirbnb said it's also banning from its platform anyone who engaged in criminal activity in last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol. The company said it is cross-referencing arrest records to determine who should be removed. The company wouldn't say Monday how many people it had removed so far.\n\nThe San Francisco-based home-sharing company also said Monday that it won't give political donations to the Republicans who voted against certifying the results of the election last week. Airbnb joined Marriott, AT&T and others in taking that stand.\n\nAirbnb's political action committee donated $866,519 to candidates and political parties in the 2020 election cycle, according to Open Secrets, which monitors campaign finance donations.

CLEVELAND -- Troubled Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel is being investigated by police in Texas following a disturbance during which he may have assaulted his ex-girlfriend.\n\nManziel, who has had two tumultuous seasons in the NFL, was identified by Forth Worth police after they were called at about 2 a.m. Saturday to investigate a report of a possible assault at an apartment complex. The officers didn't find the person who called, but they spoke to an unidentified 23-year-old woman who said she was involved in a disturbance with her ex-boyfriend earlier that night in Dallas.\n\nSgt. Steve Enright later identified him as Manziel. Enright told CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca that Manziel had not been arrested. It was unclear if he had yet been questioned.\n\nPolice didn't say if the woman was hurt. An ambulance was called, but she was not taken to a hospital.\n\nThe police report said the woman was uncooperative with officers, who were unable to locate a crime scene. The woman raised concerns about her ex-boyfriend's well-being. Police tried calling Manziel's cell phone and searching for him before it determined he was safe.\n\nFort Worth police are working with Dallas police to determine if a crime occurred.\n\nThe Browns had no immediate comment Saturday.\n\nBeyond the legal matter, Manziel could face discipline from the league. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an email the league is aware and looking into it.\n\nThis is the second time Manziel has been questioned by police following an argument with a girlfriend.\n\nIn October, police in Avon, Ohio, received an emergency call after Manziel and Colleen Crowley were spotted fighting as they drove together near the quarterback's home on the west side of Cleveland. Manziel was not arrested but the matter prompted an NFL investigation to see if he violated the league's personal conduct policy.\n\nCrowley had told police that Manziel hit her and pushed her head against a car window. The couple told police they had been drinking alcohol earlier in the day.\n\nManziel was later questioned by a league investigator and cleared, but it was another mark on his already tainted reputation.\n\nManziel started in six games this season, winning two of them, CBS affiliate WOIO reported. In those six games, Manziel threw for 1,500 yards and seven touchdowns, and adding five interceptions.\n\nThe 23-year-old player's latest off-field problem won't help his standing with the Browns, who seem to be distancing themselves from the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner from Texas A&M.\n\nAs of Friday, new coach Hue Jackson had not yet been in contact with Manziel. The Browns were disappointed when the second-year quarterback, who was taken with the No. 22 overall pick in the 2013 draft, missed a scheduled medical treatment on the final day of the season.\n\nManziel was in concussion protocol at the time, and although he was not required to be at the Browns' home finale against Pittsburgh, the team was not sure of his location as reports surfaced he was partying in Las Vegas. He was fined for not reporting to the team's facility on Jan. 3.\n\nEarlier this week, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam said he thought Manziel's relationship with the team could be saved but his behavior may force the team to release or trade him.\n\nI think Johnny made progress on the field last year. I think that's undeniable, Haslam said Thursday night. We have a certain expectation for our players and that includes Johnny, and he's got to live up to those expectations.\n\nManziel spent more than 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehabilitation facility specializing in alcohol and drug addiction treatment last winter.\n\nIf they want to release Manziel, the earliest they can do so is Feb. 8, the day after the Super Bowl, when the NFL's waiver system begins. Teams can't make trades until the new league year begins on March 9.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James ended his business partnership with Manziel earlier this month.
The Supreme Court on Monday appeared ready to deal a major blow to the power and clout of organized labor as it considers the free speech rights of government workers who say they shouldn't be forced to pay fees to public-sector unions.\n\nThe high court's conservative justices seemed inclined during 80 minutes of oral argument to overrule a four-decade old precedent that allows public-sector unions to collect mandatory fees from non-members to cover collective bargaining costs.\n\nA group of California public school teachers claims these fair share fees violate the First Amendment rights of workers who disagree with the union's positions.\n\nLabor officials fear that union members will leave in droves if they realize they can get all the benefits of representation without paying for it.\n\nBut Justice Anthony Kennedy rejected arguments made by lawyers for the state of California and the California Teachers Association that the current fee system is needed to prevent non-members from becoming free riders - workers who get all the benefits of union bargaining and grievance procedures without paying for it.\n\nThe union basically is making these teachers 'compelled riders' for issues on which they strongly disagree, Kennedy said, noting the political nature of bargaining issues like teacher salaries, merit promotions and class size.\n\nArguing in support of the union, California Solicitor General Edward Dumont said the state needs a reliable bargaining partner that is funded by all the workers it represents. He said the fees for collective bargaining typically apply to non-political issues such as mileage reimbursement, working hours and other mundane issues.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts dismissed that reasoning, saying even routine matters can become politically charged if they involve how the state spends money.\n\nThat's always a public policy issue, Roberts said.\n\nEven Justice Antonin Scalia, who in the past has expressed some sympathy for the free rider argument, said all the items negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement are necessarily political questions.\n\nThe California teachers want the high court to overturn a 1977 case that allows public unions to collect money from members and non-members alike, as long as the money doesn't pay for political action. The court in that case, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, said the arrangement was justified to prevent non-members from becoming free riders.\n\nBut the teachers argue that unions have become more political over time. They say even a push for higher salaries and pension benefits raises political questions about the best use of tax dollars for cash-strapped localities.\n\nA federal district court ruled against the teachers, saying the outcome was clear under Abood. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling.\n\nHalf the states already have right-to-work laws banning mandatory fees, but most members of public-employee unions are concentrated in states that don't, including California, New York and Illinois.\n\nUnion advocates say the lawsuit is part of a conservative agenda to weaken powerful labor unions, known for reliably supporting Democratic candidates and policies. The teachers are backed by the conservative Center for Individual Rights.\n\nArguing for the teachers, Michael Carvin said mandatory fees serve to inflate the union's war chest by people who really have not made a voluntary decision to do so.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan warned that the challengers come here with a heavy burden to overturn a nearly 40-year-old case on which thousands of contracts and millions of employees rely.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer said overturning Abood would require the court to overrule several related cases in which the high court has approved mandatory payments by lawyers to bar associations and mandatory student fees at public universities.\n\nThat's quite a big deal, Breyer said.\n\nCarvin said Abood's rationale is inconsistent with other free speech cases.\n\nArguing for the California Teachers Association, lawyer David Frederick said the First Amendment applies differently to public employees performing their jobs. He said the state has a strong interest in promoting efficiency and avoiding costly workplace disruptions by designating the union as the exclusive bargaining representative for workers.\n\nFor decades, the growth of union workers in government has helped compensate for steep losses in manufacturing, construction and other private industries where unions once thrived. About half of all union members are now in the public sector, which has a membership rate of 36 percent. That's more than five times higher than that of the private sector, at 6.6 percent.\n\nEven if the court doesn't overturn settled precedent, it could still give the challengers a partial victory. The justices are also considering whether public employees should be required to opt in to paying the political portion of union dues. Currently, workers must opt out of the political fees by checking a box on a form.\n\nThe opt in requirement could lead to more workers declining to pay the political portion of union dues, though it typically is a much smaller part of the overall payment.\n\nA decision in the case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, 14-915, is expected by late June.
Alejandro Mayorkas, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), faced probing questions from Senators on Tuesday as he prepares to assume a key role in the incoming administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic, unauthorized migration, domestic terrorism and cyberattacks.\n\nCreated after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, DHS, the third largest federal department, oversees issues ranging from counter-terrorism and border security to immigration policy and disaster management. If confirmed, Mayorkas, the son of Cuban immigrants, would take the helm of a highly politicized 240,000-person department that has seen a succession of temporary leaders during the Trump administration — six in four years, two who were Senate-confirmed, four acting.\n\nThere's no question we need strong and we need stable leadership in the Department of Homeland Security more than ever, Democratic Senator Gary Peters, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said during the hearing on Mayorkas' nomination. Over the last four years, the department has endured some chaos, mismanagement and instability.\n\nAlejandro Mayorkas, nominee to be secretary of homeland security, testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on January 19, 2021, in Washington, D.C. JOSHUA ROBERTS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGil Kerlikowske, who led U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) when Mayorkas was deputy DHS secretary during the Obama administration, described him as a straightforward known quantity at the agency.\n\nHe can be very direct when necessary, particularly during those fraught days, Kerlikowske told CBS News, reflecting on the 2014 surge of unaccompanied minors and families from Central America seeking to enter the U.S. at the Mexican border.\n\nMayorkas would also inherit challenges inside the U.S., particularly the rise of domestic terrorism and anti-government militia groups, on display during the deadly Capitol riot earlier this month.\n\nDays after pro-Trump militias descended on the Capitol, four former homeland security secretaries — two Republicans and two Democrats — penned a letter published in the Washington Post urging the Senate to promptly consider and confirm Mayorkas.\n\nThe president-elect could not have found a more qualified person to be the next homeland security secretary, wrote Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff, Janet Napolitano and Jeh Johnson. Mayorkas needs no on-the-job training and will be prepared to lead DHS on Day 1.\n\nAnd while the former federal prosecutor appears likely to be approved by a simple majority as the Biden administration applies pressure on lawmakers to greenlight its national security team, it is unclear how long the process will take. Democrats will soon assume control of the Senate, but with a razor-thin majority.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Mayorkas faced questions from some Republican senators who expressed concerns over a 2015 DHS inspector general's report that found Mayorkas pushed for the approval of applications for a program for wealthy immigrant investors on the behalf of well-connected Democrats when he served as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\n\nMayorkas defended his involvement in the investor visa program, calling the law his north star. But he conceded in an exchange with Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney that the 2015 DHS inspector general's report taught him to better guard against the perception of impropriety to ensure trust and confidence in the decision making of government leaders.\n\nMayorkas will likely play a key role in Mr. Biden's plans to reverse many of Mr. Trump's immigration changes, which collectively restricted avenues for people to immigrate to and stay in the U.S.\n\nMr. Biden, for example, has pledged to safeguard the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative, a program for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children that Mayorkas implemented in 2012. Mayorkas, the son of Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany and then communist Cuba, will also be charged with helping to fulfill Mr. Biden's pledge to dramatically increase refugee admissions, which Mr. Trump slashed to historic lows.\n\nBut the task at the U.S.-Mexico border would be formidable: reversing Mr. Trump's restrictive asylum policies without triggering a sharp increase in unauthorized migration, which could provide political ammunition for Republicans and derail Mr. Biden's immigration reform bill.\n\nMr. Biden and his immigration advisers have said they want to avert a border crisis and that their plans to reverse Mr. Trump's asylum policies will take time amid the pandemic.\n\nConfronted with a string of questions about thousands of migrants heading north to the U.S.-Mexico border, Mayorkas said his officers would screen asylum-seekers to determine whether they qualify for U.S. refuge.\n\nWe are a nation of immigrants. And we are also a nation of laws, he told Romney.\n\nMayorkas commended CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for playing a critical role in the U.S. immigration system, saying he does not support defunding the agencies.\n\nThe secretary-designate promised to seek legal remedies to halt border wall construction if confirmed, but would not commit to removing barriers built by the Trump administration. Mayorkas also pledged to end the Trump administration's Remain in Mexico policy that has forced tens of thousands of migrants to wait for their U.S. court hearings on the other side of the border.\n\nCiting Mayorkas' statement on border barrier construction, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley announced after the hearing that he would oppose fast-tracking the confirmation process.\n\nBiden transition officials pledged last month to immediately start reviewing asylum cases of the most vulnerable migrants at the southern border. Advocates still intend to keep up the pressure to ensure that Mr. Trump's obstacles to humanitarian protections are dismantled.\n\nIt would be unrealistic to expect that all of the problems that came from the Trump administration and before to be undone in a single day, said Kennji Kizuka, a senior researcher for Human Rights First, but the incoming administration has the legal obligation to follow U.S. law and treaty obligations that the U.S. has taken on to protect refugees.\n\nBut a challenge enveloping all of DHS will be re-establishing trust in the sprawling agency.\n\nDavid Lapan, a retired U.S. Marine colonel who served as DHS press secretary during the Trump administration, remarked to CBS News that, The Department of Homeland Security, the only federal agency whose primary mission is to protect the homeland — became under President Trump, the Department of immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security has not upheld its mission. And I think across the government, we've seen damage to institutions, both in terms of trust and credibility.\n\nAnd Kerlikowske, the ex-CBP head, said, The public trust issue is pretty tough right now in law enforcement generally. But when you look at (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or CBP, I think it's even more critical right now.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, Mayorkas stressed the need to expand intelligence gathering and information sharing with local law enforcement.\n\nThe divide between local law enforcement and the threat of domestic extremism is one of the greatest challenges that the Department of Homeland Security confronts, Mayorkas remarked.\n\nReflecting on the Capitol siege, Mayorkas vowed to take swift action.\n\nI will do everything I can to ensure that the tragic loss of life, the assault on law enforcement, the desecration of the building that stands as one of the three pillars of our democracy, and the terror felt by you, your colleagues, staff, and everyone present, will not happen again, he said.
HONG KONG - For decades, Hong Kong thrived as an Asian business hub, thanks to its killer combination of Western freedoms, independent courts and closeness to mainland China's booming market. Now political and economic ills from the mainland are eroding that edge.\n\nSwedish-Chinese author Gui Minhai was counting on Hong Kong's freedoms when he chose the city as the base for the publishing empire he has built up over the past decade, churning out exposes on elite Chinese politics that were snapped up by visitors from the mainland, where they are prohibited.\n\nBut the recent temporary disappearances of Gui and four colleagues, including his British chief editor Lee Bo, rising political volatility and slowing growth in China are undermining confidence in Beijing's promises to leave the city's freedoms intact for a half-century after taking control of Hong Kong in 1997.\n\nLocal frustrations will likely intensify as the city's pro-Beijing elite prepares to choose a new leader for the specially administered Chinese region next year.\n\nIn unusually blunt comments, Financial Secretary John Tsang predicted recently that Hong Kong's economy would eke out its smallest expansion in four years in 2016.\n\nPolitics and economics are closely intertwined. Political volatility will unavoidably impact on our economy, Tsang said in his budget speech last month. Tension and turbulence have left many in Hong Kong feeling suffocated by a confrontational atmosphere, said Tsang, warning of even greater chaos ahead if tensions aren't resolved.\n\nHong Kong remains wealthier and freer than the mainland, but the city of 7.2 million is riven with inequality and faces growing competition from other Chinese business hubs like nearby Shenzhen and Shanghai. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping has sought to crush dissent in other regions like Xinjiang and Tibet, showing little sympathy for the yearning among many in Hong Kong for greater democracy.\n\nInvestors aren't rushing for the exits yet, but in the financial industry, backbone of the economy, the mood is darkening.\n\nIf Hong Kong is gradually being taken over by all these Chinese business practices -- and also politically there's more and more pressure and influence coming from mainland China -- this will definitely destroy Hong Kong in the end, said Edward Chan, an investment fund manager.\n\nForeign investors might start to think that if Hong Kong does not have rule of law or anything, why don't they just move their investment directly to Shanghai or Beijing? What's the difference? he said.\n\nAs Beijing increasingly opts more for the one country part of the one country, two systems framework guaranteeing its separate legal and financial systems until 2047, Hong Kong is paying a price.\n\nDimming Hong Kong's image as a global financial center, HSBC (HSBC) decided in February not to move its headquarters from London back to Hong Kong despite a restructuring focused on pivoting toward Asia. The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. was founded in the city in 1865 and shifted its headquarters to Britain in the early 1990s.\n\nIn explaining its choice, HSBC did not refer to China, though it lauded Britain's internationally respected regulatory framework and legal system.\n\nOn Mar. 12, credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service (MCO) cuts Hong Kong's outlook to negative from stable, citing rising political risks and China's slowing growth. It had downgraded China's rating two weeks before.\n\nIncreasing political linkages are likely to weigh on Hong Kong's institutional strength, the agency said. In addition, the risks to China's economic and financial stability may also undermine Hong Kong's own economic and financial outlook.\n\nHong Kong's freedoms were on global display in late 2014, when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, blocking busy thoroughfares for 79 days to protest Beijing's plan to restrict elections. The peaceful protests highlighted discontent with China's influence among local youths, but also among older Hong Kong citizens, many of whose families fled past political turmoil in the Chinese mainland.\n\nMore recently, the independent film Ten Years was a surprise hit with its dystopian portrayal of the eradication of the city's Cantonese-language identity under Beijing's rule a decade from now.\n\nActivists defending local culture from mainland Chinese influence clashed with police last month when authorities ordered fishball vendors, a traditional fixture during the lunar new year, off the streets of gritty Mong Kok.\n\nSteve Vickers, chief executive of political and economic risk consultancy SVA, said requests for information and help with crisis preparedness spiked after the Mong Kok riot. Political polarization and the slowing economy are threatening Hong Kong's reputation, while China's slowdown could worsen tensions by pushing up unemployment and hurting property prices, he said.\n\nAny economic weakness would surely stoke political anger, given the social grievances that underpinned recent protests, Vickers said.\n\nThe bookseller disappearances shocked many Hong Kongers because of suspicions that mainland Chinese security agents snatched Lee and spirited him across the border, violating Beijing's promise to stay out of most local affairs including law enforcement. Gui apparently was apprehended in Thailand and taken to mainland China.\n\nMany ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong hold foreign passports as a sort of insurance policy in case of a crisis. The difficulties Britain and Sweden faced in getting consular access to Lee and Gui raised doubts about that strategy.\n\nChan, the investment fund manager, holds a Canadian passport. Now it's totally useless, he said. This passport is not going to protect me in any sense if the Lee Bo case is going to re-occur again.\n\nThree of Gui and Lee's colleagues are now free on bail in the mainland, but the pair appear to be still detained without charge. They both surfaced briefly on Hong Kong-based pro-Beijing Phoenix TV, where Lee said he was aiding an investigation while Gui tearfully confessed to an old crime -- having fled overseas to avoid a suspended two-year prison sentence for a fatal drunk driving accident. Their Causeway Bay Bookstore remains shuttered.\n\nThe booksellers' case shook the relatively freewheeling publishing industry in Hong Kong, whose status as a base for independent-minded financial research could suffer if investment banks with business interests on the mainland avoid releasing reports critical of Chinese state-owned companies or the economy, said Chan.\n\nSimon Baptist, chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, whose latest global cost of living survey ranked Hong Kong No. 2, said companies would likely pay closer attention to Hong Kong's fragile press and judicial freedoms when deciding whether to deploy staff or investment here.\n\nHong Kong is still one of the freer places in Asia, Baptist said, but perhaps that gap, that advantage it has, is narrowing.
Seoul, South Korea — North Korea displayed new submarine-launched ballistic missiles under development and other military hardware in a parade that underlined lead­er Kim Jong Un's defiant calls to expand the country's nuclear weapons program.\n\nState media said Kim took center stage in Thursday night's parade celebrating a major ruling party meeting in which he vowed maximum efforts to bolster the nuclear and missile program that threatens Asian rivals and the American homeland to counter what he described as U.S. hostility.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves during a ceremony for the 8th Congress of the Workers' Party in Pyongyang, North Korea, January 14, 2021 in this photo supplied by North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA). KCNA/Reuters\n\nDuring an eight-day Workers' Party congress that ended Tuesday, Kim also revealed plans to salvage the nation's economy, hit by U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions, pandemic-related border closures and natural disasters that wiped out crops.\n\n\n\nThe economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with President Donald Trump, which derailed over disagreements about sanctions relief in exchange for North Korean denuclearization steps, and pushed Kim to what is clearly the toughest moment of his nine-year rule.\n\nKim's comments are likely intended to pressure the incoming U.S. government of Joe Biden, who has previously called the North Korean leader a thug and accused Mr. Trump of chasing spectacle rather than meaningful curbs on the North's nuclear capabilities. Kim has not ruled out talks, but said the fate of bilateral relations depends on whether Washington abandons its hostile policy toward North Korea.\n\nMilitary spectacle\n\nNorth Korean state TV on Friday aired edited footage of the parade which showed thousands of civilians and troops roaring and fireworks exploding overhead as Kim stepped out of a building and took his spot at a podium in Kim Il Sung Square, named after his grandfather and the country's founder.\n\n\n\nKim, wearing a black fur hat and leather trench coat, waved and smiled widely as his troops chanted Let's defend Kim Jong Un with our lives! and Protect with our lives the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee led by Great Comrade Kim Jong Un!\n\nReports and video from state media suggested that Kim did not make a speech during the parade.\n\nHis defense minister, Kim Jong Gwan, said in a speech that North Korea's military would pre-emptively marshal our greatest might to thoroughly punish hostiles forces if they threaten the North's safety.\n\nMobile missile launch vehicles are seen during a military parade to commemorate the 8th Congress of the Workers' Party in Pyongyang, North Korea, January 14, 2021, in a photo supplied by North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA). KCNA/Reuters\n\nMilitary aircraft flew in formation across the dark sky, using what appeared to be flares to form the symbol of the Workers' Party — a hammer, brush and sickle.\n\nFlag-waving spectators, unmasked despite a fervent domestic campaign to fend off the coronavirus, cheered as troops rolled out some of the country's most advanced weapons, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles described by the official Korean Central News Agency as the world's most powerful weapon.\n\n\n\nThe new type of submarine-launched missiles displayed were larger than the ones North Korea has previously tested.\n\nAn image from North Korean state TV shows trucks taking part in a military parade through Pyongyang, January 15, 2021, carrying what the Kim Jong Un regime claims to be new submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) dubbed the Pukguksong-5. KRT/Reuters\n\nThe North also displayed a variety of solid-fuel weapons designed to be fired from mobile land launchers, which potentially expand its capability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. military bases there.\n\nKCNA said the parade featured other missiles capable of thoroughly annihilating enemies in a pre-emptive way outside (our) territory. But it wasn't immediately clear whether the description referred to intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nGreat concern, but not there yet\n\nPhotos and video released by state media didn't appear to include weapons that could be definitively identified as ICBMs.\n\n\n\nDuring a previous military parade in October, North Korea unveiled what appeared to be its biggest-yet ICBM. Its previous long-range missiles demonstrated a potential ability to reach deep inside the U.S. mainland during flight tests in 2017.\n\nNorth Korea has been developing submarine-launched ballistic missile systems for years. Acquiring an operational system would alarm its rivals and neighbors because missiles fired from under water are harder to detect in advance.\n\nStill, Kim Dong-yub, an analyst at Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies and a former military official who participated in inter-Korean military talks, said the North's presumably new submarine-launched missiles could possibly be engineering mockups that require further development before they are ready to be tested and deployed.\n\n\n\nWhile Kim Jong Un vowed during the congress to develop nuclear-powered submarines capable of firing nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, it would take considerable time for North Korea to overcome financial and technological difficulties and produce such systems, the analyst said.\n\n\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the way North Korea featured the submarine-launched missiles in the parade suggests that a test related to them could be North Korea's first provocation for the Biden administration.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that it is studying the weapons displayed by North Korea but didn't immediately release a detailed assessment.\n\n\n\nJapanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Tokyo is monitoring North Korean missile developments with great concern.\n\n\n\nNuclear-powered submarines were just one of many advanced military assets on Kim's wish list during the congress, which also included longer-range ICBMs that could potentially target the U.S. mainland more reliably, new tactical nuclear weapons and warheads, spy satellites and hypersonic weapons.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear whether North Korea is fully capable of developing such systems. While the country is believed to have accumulated at least dozens of nuclear weapons, outside estimates of the exact status of its nuclear and missile program vary widely.
New York - Welcome to the brave new world of investing, where every day in the stock market can feel like bedlam.\n\nInvestors have been careening from fear to relief and back again as they react to morsels of news about the health of the economy and corporate profits, the global trade war and when the Federal Reserve will next raise interest rates.\n\nWith each mood shift, stock prices have swung wildly. Unusually big moves -- both up and down -- have come at a frequency not seen in years.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 index soared 3.4 percent following a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report, news of trade talks between Washington and Beijing and comments from the Fed seen as helpful for stocks.\n\nIt was a sharp reversal from just the day before when investors saw the glass decidedly half empty. On Thursday, the S&P 500 plunged 2.5 percent after a disappointing U.S. manufacturing report raised fears about a possible recession and Apple warned about weak iPhone sales in China. That two-day whiplash followed 2018, a year when the S&P 500 had 20 days where it swung by at least 2 percent, twice as many as any of the prior six years.\n\nThe market has gotten so topsy-turvy that when Friday's jobs report first came out, about an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, some investors wondered if it would cause relief or panic. The numbers were strong, but were they so strong as to push the Fed to raise rates faster, which would be bad for stocks?\n\nI did find myself wondering how the market is going to react to this: Are people asking, 'Is this good?' said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. It just shows the environment we're in. It's uncertain how the market reacts, or overreacts.\n\nExpect the jitters to continue. Reports are coming that will give investors clues about whether their fears of a possible recession are warranted, as well as updates on interest rates and trade policy. Among the approaching milestones that could be the next to roil Wall Street:\n\nEarnings season\n\nStarting next week, companies will begin reporting their profits for the last three months of 2018, and expectations are high. Analysts are forecasting 11.4 percent growth for S&P 500 companies, which would be the fifth straight quarter of gains topping 10 percent, according to FactSet.\n\nThose numbers are key because stock prices tend to track corporate profits over the long term. But even more attention will likely be paid to what CEOs say about future profits.\n\nWe're going to have a nice, solid double-digit number for fourth-quarter earnings growth, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. I think the market's bigger concern is how big the 2019 deceleration is.\n\nExecutives generally talk with analysts and investors immediately after their companies' quarterly earnings are released. Stock prices could swing depending on what they say about how moderating economic growth, U.S.-China trade tensions and interest rates could affect their upcoming results.\n\nApple's warning last week about slow iPhone sales in China, the world's second-largest economy, shocked the market and sent Apple's stock down nearly 10 percent. On the same day, Delta Air Lines fell nearly 9 percent after it trimmed its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue.\n\nOrlando said he expects earnings growth will remain positive in 2019, just slower than last year, much like the economy. He nevertheless expects stocks to claw back their recent losses and return to a record by the end of the year, though with a lot of volatility in between.\n\nU.S.-China trade talks\n\nA U.S. delegation began talks in Beijing on Monday aimed at resolving a trade dispute that has alarmed global investors and threatens to drag down worldwide economic growth.\n\nThe world's two biggest economies are battling over U.S. allegations that Beijing uses predatory tactics to acquire advanced technologies, potentially undermining American technological dominance. According to a March report by the U.S. trade representative, China hacks into American companies' computer networks to steal trade secrets and forces foreign firms to share technology as the price of admission to the Chinese market.\n\nThe standoff will be difficult to resolve before a March 1 deadline. That's when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports are scheduled to jump to 25 percent from 10 percent. Chinese leaders have signaled their willingness to address U.S. complaints about America's massive trade deficit with China by buying more soybeans, natural gas and other U.S. products.\n\nBut they're likely to resist pressure from Washington to scrap or scale back technology policies they see as vital to China's future prosperity and strength.\n\nFederal Reserve meeting\n\nThe next Fed meeting comes in the last week of January, but most economists don't expect much action from it. The central bank is likely to leave rates alone after raising them four times last year.\n\nInvestors instead will be more interested to hear what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says in his news conference following the meeting. Markets have parsed every word Powell has said in public, hoping to divine clues about the path of interest rates. Higher interest rates can forestall inflation, but they can also slow economic growth and drive buyers away from stocks.\n\nAfter Powell's news conference in December, for example, the S&P 500 slumped 1.5 percent on worries that the Fed seemed set on raising short-term rates three times into 2020 and letting its portfolio of bond purchases shrink on automatic pilot.\n\nThe Street is looking for some definitive evidence that this [Fed] board of governors gets it and that three more rate hikes and [an inflexible approach to] balance-sheet shrinkage is too aggressive, Orlando said.\n\nInvestors heard some of that Thursday when Powell said the Fed will be patient in raising rates and not rigid about unwinding the balance sheet. Starting this month, Powell will hold a news conference following each Fed meeting, so investors will have plenty more opportunities to parse his words.
President Trump marked the launch of his Evangelicals for Trump coalition at El Rey Jesus Church in Miami Friday, the day after he ordered a deadly strike on Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds military force and one of the most powerful figures in the Islamic Republic.\n\nSoleimani has been killed and his bloody rampage is now forever gone, the president said during his speech at the church, adding Soleimani had been plotting attacks but they've been stopped for good.\n\nHe was planning a very major attack, and we got him, the president told a supportive audience.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Mr. Trump addressed reporters, insisting, We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.\n\nEvangelicals, particularly white evangelicals, were a critical voting bloc in propelling the thrice-married president who says he's never asked God for forgiveness to the White House in 2016. And the president said he thinks he can improve upon that performance among evangelicals in 2020.\n\nI really do believe we have God on our side. I believe that, I believe that, the president said from the stage.\n\nThe president's speech comes as the commander-in-chief is ensuring his grip on the evangelical vote, after a widely circulated Christianity Today editorial denounced him in December. The day after that editorial ran, the Trump campaign announced the launch of the Evangelicals for Trump coalition in Miami.\n\nWanda Albritton, of Miami Springs, Fla., raises her ams in prayer during a rally for evangelical supporters at the King Jesus International Ministry church, Friday, Jan. 3, 2020, in Miami. Lynne Sladky / AP\n\nThe president appeared to take the critique from one of his strongest voting blocs personally, mocking the magazine, which was founded by Billy Graham, and retweeting supporters of his who also blasted the publication. Mark Galli, the editor in chief whose name was attached to the editorial, is retiring.\n\nAt the coalition launch, Mr. Trump recognized a number of the evangelical leaders who were at the event supporting him, including Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham. The president said that Franklin Graham had a special family and thanked him for having fought very hard for us over the two weeks since the editorial was published.\n\nOn Friday, the president repeated his line that he has been a better president for people of faith than anyone else. He also issued his usual warning that anyone on the radical left who takes the White House will eliminate any policy gains for religious people.\n\nFor America to thrive in the 21st century, we must renew faith and family as the center of American life, the president told the crowd.\n\nThe president also touted his work in weakening the Johnson Amendment, which has long restricted tax-exempt churches from endorsing or denouncing political candidates.\n\nThe president addressed the recent attack on Jews in New York, condemning anti-Semitism and insisting his administration will continue to stand up for Israel.\n\nMr. Trump has been largely holed up at his Mar-a-Lago resort since the Friday before Christmas, making frequent golf outings. While in Florida, the president has been tweeting and retweeting tweets about the impeachment process, which, at this point, is stalled. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the articles of impeachment passed by the House to the Senate.\n\nThe Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!), the president tweeted Thursday morning. If this...had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!\n\nFundraising for the Trump campaign remained strong through the impeachment process. The campaign raised $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nGrace Segers contributed to this report.
Washington — Former Secretary of State John Kerry accused Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders of distorting fellow candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden's record on the war with Iraq and said Sanders lacks the foreign policy experience Biden has.\n\nSanders has ramped up his attacks on Biden over the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with the most recent escalation coming Saturday when Sanders' campaign claimed Biden was trying to rewrite history.\n\nKerry, a surrogate for the former vice president, defended Biden and said his 2002 vote in favor a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting Saddam Hussein back to the ... inspections.\n\nI think that Bernie, regrettably, is distorting Joe's record, Kerry said Sunday on Face the Nation. I mean, he doesn't have what Joe Biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the National Security Council and demonstrating his judgment.\n\nKerry, who served in the Senate alongside Biden and also voted for the resolution, said it was very clear that those who supported the resolution were listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy, that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. The resolution gave President George W. Bush the authority to use military force to ensure Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nBiden has long faced criticism for his 2002 vote, including from Sanders, who voted against the resolution as a member of the House. But as the country sees tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalate following the drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani earlier this month, Biden's defenders have sought to use foreign policy experience as a way to differentiate him from the other Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nI think Bernie is trying to drive a wedge in there, Kerry said. I understand that, but I think the vice president has unparalleled, demonstrated accomplishment and success in foreign policy as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president. And he, in my judgment, is the one person running for president who the moment he takes office, has the ability to be able to address a lot of questions, including the credibility of the United States.\n\nBiden and Sanders will both appear on stage Tuesday for the seventh Democratic presidential debate, alongside four other candidates. The debate is the last before the Iowa caucuses February 3.\n\nThe most recent CBS News Battleground Tracker placed Sanders, Biden and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg in a first-place tie in Iowa, with each at 23% as the first choice nominee.
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -Saudi Arabia unveiled a bold economic reform plan on Monday aimed at weaning the country off its addiction to oil in a bid to prepare the next generation of Saudi leaders for the domestic pressures of youth unemployment and revenues eroded by lower oil prices.\n\nThe project, which includes plans to float a stake in the world's largest oil company, Aramco, and set up one of the world's biggest government investment funds, is meant to provide a blueprint for sweeping reforms to steer the OPEC kingdom away from its decades-long reliance on cheap-to-produce oil.\n\nKing Salman said in a televised announcement that the Cabinet approved the plan, known as Vision 2030, and called on Saudis to work together to ensure its success.\n\nBut it was left to the king's powerful son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to spell out details in an interview aired shortly after the announcement on Saudi-owned broadcaster Al-Arabiya.\n\nThe 30-year-old second-in-line to the throne also serves as the country's defense minister and chairs a committee to oversee economic policymaking. That committee, the Council on Economic and Development Affairs, has been focused on reorienting the kingdom away from its heavy reliance on fossil fuels, creating jobs and boosting foreign investment.\n\nThe plan is ambitious. Beyond selling state assets, it includes trimming government perks, like the estimated $61 billion spent annually on energy subsidies that Saudi citizens have become accustomed to and which have helped secure political patronage for the Al Saud ruling family. Just this week, the king sacked the country's water and electricity minister after complaints by citizens online over how increases in water tariffs had been implemented. The Internet is one of the few spaces where people can discuss sensitive issues since there are no political parties and protests are banned.\n\nThough the plan stresses the importance of Saudi women in the economy and expanding their job opportunities, it contained little to suggest the kingdom would accelerate its cautious pace of social reforms. Women were granted the right to vote and run in local council elections for the first time last year, but they're still banned from driving and need the approval of a male relative -- usually a husband or father -- to travel abroad.\n\nLower oil prices pushed Saudi Arabia into a budget deficit of nearly $100 billion last year and a projected deficit this year of $87 billion. Despite efforts to limit reliance on its main export, oil accounted for more than 70 percent of the state's revenue in 2015.\n\nMasood Ahmed, International Monetary Fund director for the Middle East and Central Asia, said the plan's objective of diversifying the economy away from oil is exactly the kind of transformation that an economy like Saudi Arabia needs.\n\nI think the real issue is going to be how to make sure that these very sensible and ambitious objectives can be translated into real changes, he said.\n\nIn Monday's wide-ranging interview, the deputy crown prince described the kingdom as having an addiction to oil that had hurt development in other sectors and said a planned partial initial public offering of the state-owned oil giant Aramco was part of the reform program.\n\nThe vision is a road map of our development and economic goals, he said. Without a doubt, Aramco is one of the main keys of this vision and the kingdom's economic renaissance.\n\nHe put the estimated value of Aramco at more than $2 trillion and said less than 5 percent would be offered to public shareholders. Subsidiaries of the company would also be part of the share sale, he said.\n\nThe Aramco shares would be listed on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, and on an international exchange, possibly in the U.S.\n\nAramco boasts the world's largest oil reserves and produces some 10 million barrels of crude a day, giving it outsize influence over world energy markets. It traces its history to a 1933 agreement between the kingdom and the Standard Oil Company of California to develop the country's oil reserves, and has been known as Aramco -- an acronym for the Arabian American Oil Co. -- since 1944. The Saudi government took full control of the company in a series of buyouts that ended in 1980.\n\nThe prince also outlined plans to develop Saudi Arabia's $160 billion public investment fund and turn it into a $2 trillion sovereign fund that would go into developing the kingdom's cities. It would include cash generated from the Aramco IPO, an existing $600 billion in reserves and state-owned real estate and industrial areas estimated to be worth $1 trillion, he said.\n\nJason Turvey, Middle East economist for Capital Economics, said because plans for the fund reflect a shift of balance sheets rather than any new assets, it will not reduce the government's dependence on oil revenues.\n\nWe don't buy into Mohammed bin Salman's assertion that Saudi Arabia will no longer be dependent on oil by 2020, he wrote.\n\nA Bank of America Merrill Lynch report said the changes under King Salman may herald a much more assertive role for royals in energy policy and cautioned that the concentration of power with the deputy crown prince could raise a succession risk going forward.\n\nAnother major obstacle facing the Saudi monarchy is unemployment, currently at 11.7 percent. The kingdom said it plans to reduce that to 7 percent by 2030 and to boost the private sector to alleviate pressures on the government to absorb its growing workforce.\n\nMore than half of Saudis are under the age of 25, and in coming years millions will be looking for work and affordable housing. Currently, 70 percent of Saudis work in the public sector, where the government spends heavily on wages.\n\nThe deputy crown prince said another way to drive up nonoil revenue is by boosting the kingdom's own military production. Saudi Arabia was the world's third-largest arms buyer last year, with purchases of more than $87 billion, yet only 2 percent was for locally produced weaponry.\n\nVision 2030 sets out a goal of localizing more than half of Saudi Arabia's military spending and creating a military industries holding company that would be initially fully owned by the government.
A psychological operations officer who the Army is investigating for leading a group of people from North Carolina to the rally in Washington that led up to the deadly riot in the U.S. Capitol had already resigned her commission, CBS News correspondent David Martin reports. Commanders at Fort Bragg said they were reviewing Captain Emily Rainey's involvement in last week's events in the nation's capital, but she said she acted within military regulations and that no one in her group broke the law.\n\nEmily Rainey via Facebook\n\nI was a private citizen and doing everything right and within my rights, Rainey told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nA Defense official told CBS News the Army is investigating how many soldiers from Fort Bragg accompanied Rainey to Washington. Rainey had resigned her commission after receiving a career-ending letter of reprimand for her actions at an earlier protest in the Fort Bragg area, Martin reports.\n\nBecause the process takes time, Rainey was still on active duty when she led a group of protestors to Washington and is due to leave the Army next month. Officials at Fort Bragg are now working to determine what other soldiers went to Washington and whether they were part of the mob that stormed the Capitol, Martin reports.\n\nRainey said she led 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom, which describes itself online as a nonpartisan network promoting conservative values, from North Carolina to Washington to stand against election fraud and support Trump. She said the group attended the rally but she didn't know of anyone who entered the Capitol and that they were headed back to their buses hours before an emergency curfew took effect.\n\nRainey, 30, is assigned to the 4th Psychological Operations Group at Fort Bragg, according to Maj. Daniel Lessard, a spokesman for 1st Special Forces Command. Known as PSYOPS, the group uses information and misinformation to shape the emotions, decision-making and actions of American adversaries.\n\nRainey made headlines back in May after she posted a video online of her pulling down caution tape at a playground that was closed under North Carolina's COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nPolice in Southern Pines, a community about 30 miles west of Fort Bragg, charged her with injury to personal property over the incident. The police told WRAL-TV that they let her off with warnings twice before after she tore down the tape closing off the playground.\n\nIn Washington on Wednesday, insurrectionists took over the House and Senate chambers, smashed windows and waved Trump, American and Confederate flags. The riot followed the rally where Trump repeated false claims that the election had been rigged against him and said he and his supporters are going to have to fight much harder to protect democracy.\n\nSo far, at least 90 people have been arrested on charges ranging from misdemeanor curfew violations to felonies related to assaults on police officers, possessing illegal weapons and making death threats against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nRainey said that her group and most people who traveled to Washington are peace-loving, law-abiding people who were doing nothing but demonstrating our First Amendment rights.\n\nMembers of the U.S. military are permitted to take part in political organizations and events out of uniform. However, there are caveats. The Department of Defense directive prohibits active-duty servicemembers from sponsoring partisan organizations. It is unclear if Rainey's participation with her group on Wednesday went against DOD policy.\n\nRainey said she attended the Trump rally while on leave and didn't advertise that she was an Army officer. She said Sunday afternoon that her commanders had not inquired about her time in Washington, but she did not immediately respond to a subsequent inquiry about the Army's investigation.\n\nI told my bosses before I went that I was going, and I told them when I got back, she said.\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona who is an Iraq war veteran, tweeted Monday that Rainey needs to be removed from her job.
The U.S. economy is booming, unemployment is at a 17-year low and wages appear to be picking up. So what's not to like?\n\nIf you're one of the approximately 65 million Americans in low-paid service jobs, getting a share of that economic prosperity may be unbearably difficult. Jobs may be plentiful, but finding one that pays better than your current gig is much more rare than commonly believed, according to new research paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nIf you start in one of those low-wage occupations, you have a higher probability of becoming unemployed than moving up the career ladder, said Todd Gabe, a co-author of the paper, titled Can Low-Wage Workers Get Better Jobs?\n\nThe answer seems to be, With extreme difficulty.\n\nThe authors looked at 175,000 workers in so-called low-quality jobs -- with low pay, unpredictable scheduling and few or no benefits -- and examined how those people's jobs changed over a six-year period ending in 2017. Of this group, only 5.2 percent were in a higher-paying job one year later, the authors found. By contrast, more than 10 percent left the workforce and 6.7 percent became unemployed.\n\nIn other words, a low-wage worker was three times more likely to stop working altogether than to move to a better job in a given year.\n\nAmong those who did move from low-wage to higher-wage work, some common threads appeared. Typical jobs they upgraded to included work as nursing aides, customer service representatives, administrative assistants or wholesale and manufacturing sales. None of the better jobs typical for workers leaving low-wage work were in production, the paper notes.\n\nThe single most common better job that low-wage workers moved into was truck driving. About one in 300 made this move. That's in line with other research that has found some kind of truck driving a common opportunity job, paying around the national average and accessible to people without college degrees. Other opportunity jobs included clerks, automotive technicians and repair workers.\n\nThose who had a four-year college degree and were younger were also more likely to move into higher-paid work than their peers. Don't underestimate the value of getting an education, Gabe said.\n\nThese findings directly contradict the rosy discussion of today's job market. Those who favor minimal regulation and oppose raising wages for service jobs often say such jobs are short-term and entry-level, providing workers with a first step on the ladder up job mobility.\n\nThe New York Fed study's authors say, If low-wage jobs are simply a stepping stone to higher-quality jobs, then the problem of low-wage work can be solved via the labor market. But, they added, If, on the other hand, people tend to get trapped in low-wage jobs that are difficult to escape, then some more proactive policies may be warranted.\n\nHowever, proactive policies don't seem to be coming. Instead, public policy is pushing more people into the workforce while rescinding many protections working people have previously enjoyed.\n\nStill, the role of low-paid work in the U.S. is important. Nine years after the Great Recession began, the largest and fastest-growing sector of the economy is in low-paid, service class jobs.\n\nLabor advocates and some academics have argued that rolling back economic polarization requires upgrading the jobs at the very bottom. As Richard Florida, a co-author of the New York Fed paper, said in another paper he co-wrote: The only way to create a large number of family-supporting jobs that will rebuild the middle class is by upgrading the millions of precarious, low-skill, and low-wage service class jobs we already have.
WASHINGTON -- More Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, but their numbers remained low enough to suggest that layoffs are rare and the job market is healthy.\n\nThe Labor Department says the number of people seeking jobless aid rose by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000, highest since the end of January. The less-volatile four-week moving average slipped by 1,750 to 270,250, lowest since late November.\n\nThe figures, released a day before the government's February report on job creation and unemployment, show the U.S. job market remains resilient in the face of economic weakness overseas and turmoil in financial markets.\n\nFriday's monthly report will be in play when the Federal Reserve starts a two-day monetary policy session March 15. While the Fed is not expected to hike interest rates at this month's meeting, after an initial increase from near zero in December, expectations have recently been revived for one to two additional moves this year.\n\nThe U.S. economy is resilient amid slowing global growth, but parts of the country are seeing a weaker expansion, the Fed's Beige Book, released Wednesday concluded.\n\nUnemployment is at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. On Wednesday, the payroll processor ADP reported that U.S. businesses added a healthy 214,000 jobs in February, up from 193,000 in January.
The Trump administration's $4.8 trillion budget has a number of winners, including NASA and defense spending. But among the losers would be social safety-net programs that are relied on by many low- and middle-class Americans alike.\n\nAmong the programs that would face cuts are Medicaid, which provides medical insurance to low-income households, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. Cuts are also directed at spending on people with disabilities and the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, which provides funding for uninsured children whose families earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nWhile the Trump budget has little chance of being enacted in its current state by Congress, the proposal can be viewed as a blueprint for the administration's priorities, experts say. The plan would cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and Affordable Care Act premium tax credits over 10 years, pare assistance to people with disabilities, and slash food-stamp spending by about $180 billion over the next decade, according to the the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe proposed budget is stunningly harsh, Robert Greenstein, president of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a statement. It would take health coverage away from millions of people and cut aid to millions of families and individuals struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIn some cases, the administration may not require budgetary changes to pare spending. Take the food stamp program, which has been targeted by new and proposed rules from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. About 5.3 million households could lose or see reduced food-stamp benefits under those new rules without any budget vote by Congress.\n\nThe Trump Administration has disregarded Congress before when it comes to funding priorities: Congress passed a bipartisan Farm Bill that protected SNAP, and then the Administration used three rule changes to make the cuts they wanted in the first place, said Lily Roberts, director of economic mobility at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nUnder the proposed budget, spending for the SNAP program would be pared by almost $182 billion through 2030. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said the food-stamp reforms will help workers become more self-sufficient.\n\nThe cuts would come at a time when the program's already shrinking. The program's costs have dropped from a peak of $80 billion in 2013 to about $58 billion in 2019 as the economy gained its footing following the recession, bringing more Americans into the labor market.\n\nHarvest boxes\n\nThe budget also revives the Trump administration's plans for Harvest Boxes, which it describes as American-grown foods provided directly to households delivered in a box for food-stamp recipients, rather than allowing them to buy their own groceries at food stores with the benefits.\n\nStates would maintain the ability to provide choice to their participants, including by using innovative approaches for the inclusion of fresh products, the budget says.\n\nThese boxes aren't a new idea, having been proposed two years ago by the administration. Critics have called the idea condescending and demeaning by taking away recipients' ability to make their own food choices.\n\nMedicaid, CHIP\n\nThe budget also calls for cuts to Medicaid, partly by adding work requirements for able-bodied, working-age individuals between the ages of 18 to 65.\n\nMedicaid spending will grow at a more sustainable rate by ending the financial bias that currently favors able-bodied working-age adults over the truly vulnerable, the Trump administration's budget states.\n\nSpending in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers 8.9 million U.S. children, would be reduced by $193 billion over 10 years. Together, Medicaid and CHIP provide health coverage for about 4 of 10 children, the American Hospital Association says.
Miami — A federal facility for unaccompanied migrant children in Homestead, Florida, is set to nearly double in size and is rushing to bring on hundreds of new employees.\n\nThe Homestead facility's mid-January expansion was announced by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on December 26, the same day the agency disclosed that a larger temporary facility in Tornillo, Texas, would soon close.\n\nAt a job fair in a small Holiday Inn Express conference room in Miami on Thursday, a steady stream of candidates were asked to wait in rows of seats before being directed to laptops where they filled out applications. They sought jobs ranging from case worker to travel chaperone.\n\nRepresentatives of Comprehensive Health Services (CHS), the company that is paid by HHS to manage the facility, stood by with a stack of contingent job offer letters.\n\nApplicants at a job fair held in a Miami Holiday Inn Express conference room on Thursday, Jan. 10, seek employment at the nation's largest facility for unaccompanied migrant children, in nearby Homestead, Florida. Graham Kates\n\nA Facebook post advertising the event states, We will be extending offer letters on site to qualified applicants!\n\nThe letter indicates the offers are dependent on successful drug and background screenings.\n\nEmployees at the Homestead facility must undergo the FBI's fingerprint criminal history check, but the federal government has granted a waiver allowing the facility to bypass Florida's child abuse and neglect background check system, according to HHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Mark Weber. The waiver was granted to Virginia-based CHS because companies that are not regulated by the state's child welfare and foster care authorities are not allowed to access its Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System database.\n\nIn an email to CBS News, Weber said the FBI fingerprint background checks conducted on employees would show relevant information.\n\nHowever, FBI checks would not surface what state policy refers to as verified maltreatment findings that are not necessarily prosecuted, but are logged in the system because a preponderance of credible evidence exists to support the allegations of abuse, neglect or abandonment.\n\nThat means there could be important information in potential employees' pasts that CHS is missing, according to Stacie Schmerling, a Partner at Talenfeld Law, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based firm that specializes in child abuse cases.\n\nThe FBI search won't have the same information as the (state child abuse and neglect) database, Schmerling said. This is a facility for unaccompanied children, so you'd want to approach it like foster care, where you try to gather as much information as possible about someone's history.\n\nIn June, CBS News reported that because Homestead and the Tornillo facility are on federal land, they are not subject to the stringent child welfare inspections required for all other shelters for unaccompanied children, which are on state land.\n\nCHS, and all employers across the country, also cannot access the Department of Homeland Security's E-Verify platform, which checks eligibility to work in the United States.\n\nThe facility is expanding amid the partial government shutdown. In its contingent job offer letter, CHS indicates that the shutdown may have affected human resources staffing.\n\nDue to the temporary government shutdown, we have limited personnel available to assist with your onboarding, the letter states.\n\nAsked about the letter's onboarding claim, an HHS representative referred CBS News to CHS. A spokesperson for CHS' parent corporation, Caliburn International, did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe shutdown does not appear to be slowing the rate at which new staffers are being hired. An employee of the Homestead facility, who asked not to be identified, told CBS News applicants were being hired on the spot at the job fair — as promised in the company's Facebook flyer. The employee complained that new hires were being brought on for supervisory positions, instead of those with seniority.\n\nThey're hiring so many people with no experience. Some are getting jobs better than me, the employee said.\n\nCaliburn did not reply to a question about the experience levels sought for youth care workers, case managers, clinical counselors, educational instructors, drivers, and travel chaperones at the facility.\n\nCaliburn has also repeatedly declined to speak with CBS News about the Homestead facility's rapid expansion. According to HHS, the facility currently employs 1,600 people while holding 1,250 children. It ultimately will fit 2,350 children, and will have to staff up to meet that need. The site is required to have no more than 12 children for every one adult supervisor, 24 hours a day, according to HHS, plus security, medical, case management and operations personnel at all times.\n\nIt is not clear how much Caliburn is paid to operate the facility, but the revenue is not without risk, according to an October 9 SEC filing.\n\nIn the past, we have received negative publicity for this work with (HHS), and it is possible that we may be subject to such negative publicity in the future as well, the company wrote. Allegations of impropriety or reports mischaracterizing our activities or criticism of the missions that we are supporting have the potential to cause us reputational harm.\n\nIt was a concern echoed by the employee who spoke with CBS News.\n\nThe kids are treated good in there. It's not like the media portrays it. We treat them well, he said.
Before any international traveler enters the United States, they will now be required to present proof of a negative coronavirus test. The new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) policy takes effect on January 26.\n\nTesting does not eliminate all risk, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the CDC, said in a statement Tuesday. But when combined with a period of staying at home and everyday precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations.\n\nA passenger must get a viral test within three days of their flight to the U.S., providing either documentation of test results or proof of recovery from the virus to the airline. Airlines are required to deny any passenger who does not adhere to these guidelines.\n\nA negative test is required for all passengers, regardless of whether or not they have been vaccinated. It is not yet clear whether vaccination prevents transmission of the virus.\n\nThe CDC said that testing before and after air travel is critical to slowing the spread of COVID-19. It cited the possibly more infectious variants of COVID-19 and the surging cases in the U.S. as evidence for stricter travel limitations.\n\nThis strategy is consistent with the current phase of the pandemic and more efficiently protects the health of Americans, it said.\n\nThe CDC also recommends getting tested again three to five days after travel, as well as isolating at home for seven days.\n\nTighter travel restrictions come as a variant of the disease has been detected in several U.S. states. The new travel policy expands upon a similar one introduced specifically for U.K. passengers late last month.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the U.S. has had more than 22 million cases of COVID-19, and more than 375,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Twitter says it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts associated with the far right QAnon conspiracy theory following last week's U.S. Capitol riot. The move comes after a mob of pro-Trump loyalists tried to violently storm the Capitol Building.\n\nIn another move to tamp down on conspiracy theories, Facebook also said it had removed content with the Stop the Steal phrase to stop misinformation and content that could incite further violence during these next few weeks, according to a Monday blog post from Facebook executives Guy Rosen and Monika Bickert.\n\nThe content purge comes after both Twitter and Facebook suspended President Donald Trump from their platforms, with Twitter citing the risk of further incitement of violence. Mr. Trump is accused of helping to incite the deadly riot, which is linked to five deaths and dozens of arrests.\n\nGiven the events last week, Twitter said it is taking action against online behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm. In many cases, a single individual operated numerous QAnon-linked accounts, driving up the total number of affected accounts, the company said in a blog post.\n\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory is centered on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against deep state enemies and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals. Twitter has previously tried to crack down on QAnon, removing more than 7,000 accounts in July.\n\nThese accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service, Twitter said.\n\nFacebook said it was prompted to act due to continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that can lead to violence ahead of President-Elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20.\n\nTwitter's sweeping purge of QAnon accounts, which began Friday, is part of a wider crackdown that also includes its decision to ban Mr. Trump from the service over worries about further incitement to violence. The suspensions mean some Twitter users will lose followers, in some cases by the thousands, the company said.\n\nTwitter said it's also stepping up enforcement measures and starting Tuesday it will limit the spread of posts that violate its civic integrity policy by preventing anyone from replying to, liking or retweeting them. The policy prohibits attempts to manipulate elections and spread misleading info about their results, with repeated violations resulting in permanent suspension.
The following is a transcript of an interview with Representative Adam Schiff that aired Sunday, January 12, 2020, on Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Good morning to you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Good morning.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are part of the Gang of Eight, so you're part of that group that received the very classified briefing that the Defense Secretary was referring to. He said the intelligence was exquisite, and it was incredibly detailed. Do you quibble with his characterization of what you were told?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: I don't quibble with it. I think it's just plain wrong. There was no discussion in the Gang of Eight briefings that these are the four embassies that are being targeted and we have exquisite intelligence that shows these are the specific targets.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What about U.S. embassy, Baghdad?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: It- it—\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He said that was specifically referenced.\n\nREP. SCHIFF: --Well, I don't recall, frankly, in that briefing there being a specific discussion about bombing the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. The brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that Secretary Pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when. That was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. In the view of the briefers, there was plotting. There was a- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. And so when you hear the president out there on FOX, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the Secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. When Secretary Pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking Soleimani out would improve our security and not- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging. That's not an intelligence conclusion. That is Pompeo's personal opinion. Intelligence--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a polite way of saying they're lying?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: Well, you know, you could certainly put it that way. But frankly, I think what they are doing is they are overstating and exaggerating what the intelligence shows. And when you're talking about justifying acts that might bring us into warfare with Iran, that's a dangerous thing to do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But to be fair, because you are the Intel Committee chairman, you know, the Intel Committee often or- the Intelligence Committee works in assessments, in judgments, in putting together mosaic pieces of information to come to a conclusion. When Esper is working in beliefs and projections, isn't that just how it works? Impossibilities and not necessarily always having one conclusive piece of the exact place and time?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: Well, that's exactly right. But that- that means that you need to be very clear about what you're saying the intelligence shows and what it doesn't. If we were to ask the intelligence agencies, will taking Soleimani out make us safer or less safe? They would say to us, Congressman, that's a policy judgment that the policy makers need to make. What we can tell you is if you take him out, here are the likely repercussions. Those repercussions that we were briefed about were far more dangerous to this country than anything that Soleimani was plotting, as far as I can tell. And so when you're talking about taking out a top government official of another nation, an act that might bring us into outright warfare, the burden of imminence, of showing imminence with very great specifics, I think is very high.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So I- I just want to button up, because the Defense Secretary also said that in that Gang of Eight briefing, when he said there was sensitive information shared, though he said he wasn't in the room, that it was the Gang of Eight's decision not to share the information with the rest of Congress. He said he'd be okay with it if sensitive bits were taken out.\n\nREP. SCHIFF: Well—\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Is this is a political decision?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: He said a couple things. He said that what he was told by the briefers is that most or all of the members were completely satisfied. That's not correct. I can tell you I wasn't, and there were other members of the Gang of Eight who were equally unsatisfied with the proof of imminence. In terms of the- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts. And so if the intelligence showed that there were four embassies being targeted that should have been shared with the members. It wasn't because I don't believe that is what the intelligence showed.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Have you heard from members of the intelligence community that they objected to what the administration did?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: They're not going to volunteer that. In other words, the intelligence community doesn't want to get crosswise with the White House and with—\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've spoken to CIA director Gina Haspell?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This was, it appears, according to Esper's description, also her assessment.\n\nREP. SCHIFF: Well, I don't know whether Esper has represented that the CIA director supported or didn't support a strike on Soleimani. The job of the CIA director is to say, this is what our intelligence shows, this is what our intelligence analysts tell us will be the repercussions if you take Soleimani out. That is the principal role. It's the president's call whether that justifies taking a strike, but that should be done in consultation with Congress and approved by Congress. And neither of those things happened here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Should other IRGC leaders be targeted?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: I think that we have escalated enough, and--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Even though Iran says its standing down and the president has used that phrase?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: Well, I think what we're likely to see, at least in the near term, is the end of Iran's overt attacks, like the missile attack on our bases. I don't think that we conclude- conclude at all that we've seen an end to the- their use of Shia and other proxies. And so the risk to American troops and to American civilians continues, I think is- is greater now as a result of the administration's actions. Iran has been humiliated by- by this taking out of their top leadership, but also by their disastrous shoot down of this civilian aircraft.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREP. SCHIFF: That makes them, I think, more dangerous and provocative in the sense that we may very well see covert retaliation against the United States.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch gears, because in your role, you were also playing a key- a key- you are a key figure in the impeachment investigation up to this point. I'm wondering if you have a sense about whether you'll be an impeachment manager when this goes to a Senate trial?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: Well, that'll be the speaker's decision. I don't want to get ahead of her--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to be?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: --thinking. I've told the speaker that I will play whatever role that she and the caucus believe would be useful.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And the speaker was on another network today and seemed to leave open the idea of subpoenaing John Bolton, the former national security adviser to the president. Is that something you would be looking at? Are you looking at?\n\nREP. SCHIFF: You know, it's certainly something that we are considering. But look, Americans want to see a fair trial in the Senate. They want to see a trial that's fair to the president and they want to see a trial that's fair to the American people, that brings all the facts forward. There's little sense in bringing Bolton in to the House and not allowing the senators to see his testimony. If they're going to be the triers of fact and they will be they should hear from the witness directly. He has offered to come forward and testify. There is no reason not to have him testify unless you just want to cover up the president's wrongdoing. If McConnell succeeds in making this trial a trial without witnesses, it will be the first impeachment trial in history where the subject of the trial didn't resign, mid trial where they didn't have witnesses. That's not a fair trial. That's a sham. That's a cover up. And I think one of the things that holding on to the articles has succeeded doing is --\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nREP. SCHIFF: --fleshing out McConnell and the president's desire to make this a cover up.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will get to what that trial might look like with Mike Lee, senator from Utah, a Republican ally of the president. He'll be with us soon.
Washington — The Senate's top Democrat is calling on the Justice Department to investigate whether Richard Grenell, the acting director of national intelligence, failed to inform the department about work he did for foreign entities before joining the Trump administration, possibly in violation of federal law.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter Tuesday to John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, asking his office to immediately investigate reports of Grenell's work in support of the Hungarian government and a Moldovan politician.\n\nFailure to disclose that work as a foreign agent to the Justice Department could be a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires those who lobby in the U.S. on behalf of foreign entities to disclose their efforts. A search of FARA filings shows Grenell did not register.\n\nClick here to view related media. click to expand\n\nIf the reports regarding the nature of Mr. Grenell's undisclosed work with foreign entities are accurate, he may be subject to potential civil and criminal liability as well as vulnerable to blackmail in his new position in the Intelligence Community, Schumer wrote in his letter.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nPresident Trump selected Grenell, the current U.S. ambassador to Germany, to replace Joseph Maguire as the acting director of national intelligence last week. A vocal ally of Mr. Trump's, Grenell is expected to serve in a temporary capacity until the president names a permanent director to lead the office that oversees the nation's 17 intelligence agencies.\n\nGrenell has come under scrutiny in the wake of his appointment for consulting work he did before he was confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to Germany in 2018. ProPublica reported last week that Grenell wrote op-eds in 2016 defending Vladimir Plahotniuc, a Moldovan politician, and allegedly failed to disclose payments for his work on behalf of the oligarch.\n\nPlahotniuc was barred by the State Department from entering the U.S. last month due to his involvement in significant corruption.\n\nAdditionally, the Washington Post reported Monday that in 2016, Grenell's public relations firm did media outreach for a U.S. foundation funded primarily by the Hungarian government. The Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on U.S. foreign policy, also reported Monday on Grenell's public relations work for the nonprofit.\n\nCraig Engle, an attorney representing Grenell, told ProPublica and the Washington Post separately that in the instances involving the Moldovan politician and nonprofit tied to the Hungarian government, he was not required to register under FARA.\n\nDuring his confirmation process to serve in Berlin, Grenell was asked by Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland about his op-eds on Moldova and whether he was paid for his writings.\n\nGrenell said at the time he did not receive any compensation for his work and believes strongly in confronting threats to democracy, and all of those views were my own opinion.\n\nHe also denied having written the op-eds on Moldova at anyone's request or direction.\n\nMy motivation in writing or speaking on any particular subject is because I think it's important, Grenell said.\n\nSchumer told Demers in his letter Grenell may have misled Congress during his confirmation hearing.\n\nThe New York Democrat said it's imperative for the Justice Department to examine whether Grenell broke the law. If he did, Schumer added, Grenell should be referred for enforcement action.\n\nAny illegal activity would obviously disqualify him from serving as the director of national intelligence or in any position of public trust, Schumer said.\n\nA congressional source told CBS News that Grenell did not mention the work on his SF-86, a form used by the federal government in conducting background investigations, during his confirmation process for his role as U.S. ambassador to Germany. Had he registered under FARA, he would have been required to disclose it.\n\nSenate Republicans appeared to hold back in the immediate wake of Mr. Trump's selection of Grenell to serve as acting director of national intelligence. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, remained mum on Grenell's appointment until Tuesday, when he told CNN he supported the pick. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not mention him during a floor speech Monday praising Maguire for his career.\n\nSenate Democrats, meanwhile, have criticized Mr. Trump's selection. Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said Grenell lacks the intelligence experience needed to lead the nation's intelligence community and accused the president of attempting to sidestep the Senate's constitutional obligation to advise and consent on such critical national security positions.\n\nThe Justice Department has in recent months stepped up enforcement of FARA in the wake of Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nPaul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, pleaded guilty to violating FARA after failing to report his work for the Ukrainian government. Federal prosecutors also accused Gregory Craig, former White House counsel for President Obama, of lying to Justice Department officials responsible for overseeing registrations under FARA about his work for the Ukrainian government. He was acquitted in September.\n\nClare Hymes contributed to this report.
BURNS, Ore. -- A judge who planned to host a community meeting Monday over the standoff at an Oregon wildlife refuge has canceled it due to safety concerns.\n\nHarney County Judge Steve Grasty said in a news release authorities had become aware of plans to protest the meeting and block the entrance to the county senior center, where it was to be held. Earlier Grasty had said that a no-guns policy would be strictly enforced at the meeting.\n\nPreparations to protest and block entrance to the Senior Center have led me to determine that it's time to take a time out, Grasty wrote, according to CBS affiliate KOIN. Cancellation of this meeting seems prudent in order to maintain the safety of our community.\n\nA spokeswoman for the county said Sunday afternoon she didn't have further information about the safety concerns or specifically who intended to block the senior center entrance.\n\nAn armed group led by Ammon Bundy has been occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge since Jan. 2 to protest federal land use policies. Oregon lawmakers have been increasing their pressure on federal authorities to step in and end the occupation.\n\nBundy, who has begun speaking with the FBI, joined hundreds of area residents at a tense community meeting last week - listening quietly as many loudly chanted at him to go!
Brownsville, Texas – It was about 8:30 in the morning when 15 migrants were led single file into one of six hearing rooms at the U.S.-Mexico border crossing in Brownsville, Texas. They were from El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, Guatemala and Cuba.\n\n\n\nSomething they all had in common, beyond the desire for asylum in the United States, was the absence of shoelaces. It is Customs and Border Protection's policy to remove laces from migrants' shoes for the safety of the guards and the migrants, including from the shoes of children, out of fear they could be used as weapons or in a suicide attempts.\n\n\n\nThe hearing rooms at the Gateway Port of Entry are a collection of metal trailers linked together by white-tent corridors. Even though it was January, the air conditioning was on. And jackets were needed to stay comfortable during the three-hour session. On this particular morning, the migrants, including three young kids, were filing into hearing room A.\n\nWe were told to sit in the back.\n\n\n\nMembers of the public and the press were not allowed to attend the hearings in Brownsville until about a month ago.\n\nThe complex is at the base of the International Gateway Bridge that spans the Rio Grande and connects Brownsville with Matamoros, Mexico.\n\nWe waited in an area with seating for 60 people, 10 porta potties and a heater that seemed as loud as a jet engine. It struck us that we were the only two observers present. Twenty minutes passed before we were led to a second waiting area. It had fewer chairs and porta potties but was equally deafening.\n\n\n\nThe rules for the public to attend the hearing are basic: no cellphones or cameras allowed. A security officer told us we were prohibited from speaking with the migrants.\n\nThe complex of hearing rooms in Brownsville, Texas, on January 29, 2020. Guy Campanile\n\nThe point of the hearing on that day was for an immigration judge to explain the asylum process to the migrants, including their rights under U.S. immigration law. Many of the people in the room had crossed into the United States illegally last fall. They were subsequently sent back across the border to wait in Mexico until their asylum hearings, in line with the United States' Migrant Protection Protocols, more commonly known as the Remain in Mexico policy.\n\n\n\nThis was their first opportunity to face a judge. But it would not be in person.\n\nEveryone faced a large video monitor. On the screen was Judge Sean Clancy in a courtroom 30 miles away.\n\n\n\nClancy is with the Justice Department agency that oversees immigration courts. Accompanying him in the closed circuit broadcast was a Spanish interpreter and a court clerk. A Department of Homeland Security lawyer was seated off-camera. He spoke only six times and said no more than a couple of short phrases. The migrants never saw his face.\n\n\n\nJudge Clancy began by asking the group, through his interpreter, if there was anyone in the room whose first language was something other than Spanish. A 30-year-old man named Alberto raised his hand. He was there with his seven-year-old son, Carlos. The child looked small for his age.\n\nAlberto explained in halting Spanish that he spoke K'iche, a Mayan language common in the central highlands of Guatemala.\n\nWithout missing a beat, Judge Clancy dialed a number on a speaker phone and asked the attendant who answered to provide a K'iche translator. After less than a minute of the kind of hold music you would hear if you called a dentist, a cheerful man with a soft Texas accent got on the line and began to speak to Alberto in K'iche.\n\nAs Clancy explained the asylum process to migrants, he was clear about the obstacles ahead.\n\nThe nature of these hearings is adversarial, he said. The Department of Homeland Security will supply reasons why you should not enter the United States.\n\nDHS will treat you as someone who is attempting to enter against U.S. law, he said.\n\nA camp in Mexico where 2,500 migrants await hearings across the border at the complex in Brownsville, Texas, on January 29, 2020. Guy Campanile\n\nClancy then reviewed the documents and evidence that Alberto would need to prove that he and his son should be granted asylum. The application for asylum and supporting papers must be in English, accompanied by copies in Spanish.\n\nI recognize this possesses obstacles and difficulties but there is no way around it. It is what the law requires, Clancy said. My role is to make sure you have a fair hearing.\n\nJudge Clancy also told Alberto and the other asylum seekers they would be given a list of legal aid organizations that could help them with their paperwork, but it would be the migrants' responsibility to pay for their own attorneys.\n\n\n\nWe were told by immigration lawyers in the area that the vast majority of asylum seekers ultimately end up representing themselves at these hearings.\n\nAlberto said he understood the judge but he was fearful of returning to Mexico with his son because he did not speak Spanish well.\n\n\n\nSee what you can get done on the application and we'll see where we can go from there, Clancy said in a businesslike tone that was consistent throughout the hearing. The few times he did try to crack a small joke, they seemed lost in translation.\n\n\n\nAfter Alberto was given a date for his next hearing, Clancy offered the same explanations on the process to the others with the help of his Spanish interpreter. Seven-year old Carlos, who up to that moment had been remarkably patient for a child his age, began to hum. One of the guards won his silence with a small bag of snacks.\n\n\n\nOnce Clancy finished with his rundown of what was required of the asylum applicants, he asked how many people were afraid to return to Mexico. One hand went up. That was followed by six others. A woman who was there with her 11-year-old daughter was the last to haltingly raise her hand.\n\n\n\nSome of us are afraid to say we are afraid to go back to Mexico because we don't want to be sent to Central America, she said. The woman was referring to new agreements the U.S. has with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to send migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. to those countries instead. The only agreement implemented so far is the one with Guatemala.\n\n\n\nJudge Clancy asked if she was afraid to wait in Mexico.\n\n\n\nHonestly, yes, the woman replied.\n\n\n\nJudge Clancy confirmed with the DHS lawyer just off-screen that he'd noted the migrants' fears of returning to Mexico so that they may have an interview about their reasons for being afraid. It was unclear to us when that would happen.\n\n\n\nThe only asylum applicant who had a lawyer present was a 75-year-old woman from Venezuela. She left her home country in October and took a plane to Panama, then flew to Mexico and illegally crossed the Rio Grande into the United States. She did not say why she wanted asylum.\n\n\n\nThe young lawyer who represented the woman was doing so pro-bono. She had only become aware of the woman's case at 11 o'clock the night before and was not fully acquainted with all the details of her asylum claim. As she leaned over to ask her client a question, Judge Clancy's interpreter began to translate the private conversation. Judge Clancy recognized it was a private attorney-client exchange, stopped his interpreter and apologized to the lawyer.\n\n\n\nA lot of things would be easier to deal with if you are here, he noted about his closed circuit courtroom and the distance between all involved. Then the screen temporarily went to black on his end.\n\n\n\nI thought I lost you, Clancy said with some relief once the live picture returned.\n\n\n\nThe judge gave everyone in the group a final opportunity to ask questions. They all declined. The next court date for most of the asylum seekers was scheduled for April 30. That's when they would be able to make their best case to stay in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe group then began to file out of the room and head back over the bridge to Mexico, where they will wait three more months for their next appearance before Judge Clancy.\n\n\n\nThe only one who seemed satisfied by the proceedings was little Carlos. The Guatemalan boy looked back into the room and smiled. The security guard had given him a second bag of snacks.\n\n\n\nGuy Campanile is a producer for 60 Minutes.

Facebook is working to quickly remove false information about the coronavirus from its platform, according to its Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The social networking company also announced it will give $100 million to 30,000 small businesses in more than 30 countries as owners grapple with the economic effects of the pandemic.\n\nThese are unprecedented times, maybe the defining time of a century, Sandberg told CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview. Small businesses all around the world are really struggling. They are worried that their doors are closing, unable to make payroll.\n\nThe $100 million will be in grants, mostly cash and some ad credits on Facebook, she said.\n\nBusinesses were reaching out directly to Facebook for help, Sandberg said. And we're very close to small businesses because, you know, so many — 140 million small businesses use the Facebook platform.\n\nAny small business that would like to apply for a grant can go to facebook.com/grantsforbusiness.\n\nWe're going to ask you to tell us about your business. We're going to ask you to tell us what your plans are to weather the storm and how you're going to use this money, and we're going to try to help, Sandberg said.\n\nFacebook also partnered with the World Health Organization to make sure that the information about coronavirus on its platform is correct.\n\nWe want people to get accurate information, Sandberg said. So from the beginning, we've been working with the WHO to take down any harmful information, debunk claims that are false. But also get their information in front of people.\n\nSandberg didn't say how much false information has been removed, but said the company is always vigilant.\n\nIn this area, we've gone one step further and we're removing things quickly if they're harmful, she said. I also think there's a lot of information people need. They need information about local school closings. They need information with local health organizations.\n\nFacebook has been criticized for not taking the same approach with political ads that have inaccurate information.\n\nI wanna be really clear. For this crisis, any fake information is down. It is down no matter who the source is. It can be a politician, it can be anyone. If it's harmful and it's fake, it's down, Sandberg said.\n\nBut the company's policy on campaign ads and political speech is different.\n\nWhat we've really done is made sure that anything that's harmful can't be put on the site in terms of regular content or groups or ads. When it comes to generalized political speech, whether that's in ads or that — we really think that, as one company, being the arbiter of truth is too much power and something that kind of sounds like we should do it, but as soon as we started doing it, everyone would be, like, 'Oh my God, Facebook's deciding what's true and false,' Sandberg said. And political speech is very heavily scrutinized. One politician says something, they run it in an ad, they say it in a speech. The person running against them says it's false, and that process we think continues and needs the full-throated opportunities people have.\n\nFacebook also has its own cases of coronavirus.\n\nThey're young. They're doing well so far, from what I know, Sandberg said. We're protecting people's privacy. We're not announcing our number of cases. For me, the employees that have allowed me to know who they are, I've been directly in touch. Some have wanted their privacy, and I've respected that, and we're just doing everything we can to help people.\n\nThe company has recommended its employees work from home, made sure everyone is still being paid and gave all their full-time employees an extra cash benefit of $1,000, Sandberg said.\n\nWe told everyone, everyone's going to get their bonus for this half. We're actually giving it higher than the full bonus, she said. We also feel very strongly about this. We're paying everyone. We pay our contractors, we pay our employees. Whether you're sick, whether you're healthy, whether you can work, whether your job can go home, we're paying people.\n\nAsked if those measures are an attempt to redeem the company after some unflattering press, Sandberg said, I think this is an attempt to take the responsibility we have and do everything we can, and I think this is a moment where everyone needs to do that. This is not about what will feel good. This is about what will make a difference.
WASHINGTON - The Federal Reserve is figuring out when to start unloading much of its $4.5 trillion in bond holdings, a major turning point for an economy still healing from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSome Fed officials want to announce the beginning of the process within a couple of months, according to minutes of the U.S. central bank's June meeting. Others pushed for more time to first see how the broader U.S. economy fares during the second half of 2017.\n\nWhat Fed officials all agreed upon in June was to publicly unveil its plan to gradually reduce the portfolio of bonds that build up after the Great Recession -- part of an effort to make long-term borrowing more affordable and spur growth. Economists with IHS Markit expect the Fed to start shrinking its balance sheet at its September 19-20 policy meeting.\n\nThe Fed voted in June to raise short-term rates by a quarter point to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent, the third quarter in a row the bank has lifted rates.\n\nA move to start putting the central bank's finances in order could be complicated if the economy doesn't respond as policy makers expect. Inflation, in particular, has proved difficult to nudge closer to the Fed's 2 percent target, while in the first three months of the year the economy grew at a rate of only 1.4 percent.\n\nThe slow start to the year has led some economists to caution against additional interest rate hikes this year. The debate within the the Fed about how fast to normalize monetary policy, including selling off bonds, was reflected in the latest account of its June policy meeting.\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee – the Fed's rate-setting panel – generally reiterated their support for continuing to gradually raise rates, according to the minutes. But some participants said they were less comfortable with the pace of tightening.\n\nThe Fed expects to lift rates once more this year and three times in 2018.\n\nFed members went back and forth on the state of the economy, with some agreeing that the drop in the unemployment rate is tinder for eventual inflation while others were less worried, said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst with The Lindsey Group, in a client note.\n\nThe nation's unemployment rate fell in June to 4.3 percent, the lowest level since 2001.
A big financial loss may shorten your life, a new study suggests. Middle-aged Americans who experienced a sudden, large economic blow were more likely to die during the following years than those who didn't.\n\nThe heightened danger of death after a devastating loss, which researchers called a wealth shock, crossed socio-economic lines, affecting people no matter how much money they had to start.\n\nThe analysis of nearly 9,000 people's experiences underscores well-known connections between money and well-being, with prior studies linking lower incomes and rising income inequality with more chronic disease and shorter life expectancy.\n\nThis is really a story about everybody, said lead researcher Lindsay Pool of Northwestern University's medical school. Stress, delays in health care, substance abuse and suicides may contribute, she said. Policymakers should pay attention.\n\nOverall, wealth shock was tied with a 50 percent greater risk of dying, although the study couldn't prove a cause-and-effect connection. The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nResearchers analyzed two decades of data from the Health and Retirement Study, which checks in every other year with a group of people in their 50s and 60s and keeps track of who dies.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 people in the study had a wealth shock, which researchers defined as a loss of 75 percent or more in net worth over two years. The average loss was about $100,000.\n\nThat could include a drop in the value of investments or realized losses like a home foreclosure. Some shocks happened during the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Others happened before or after. No matter what was going on in the greater U.S. economy, a wealth shock still increased the chance of dying.\n\nWomen were more likely than men to have a wealth shock. Once they did, their increased chance of dying was about the same as the increase for men. Researchers adjusted for marital changes, unemployment and health status. They still saw the connection between financial crisis and death.\n\nThe effect was more marked if the person lost a home as part of the wealth shock, and it was more pronounced for people with fewer assets.\n\nThe findings suggest a wealth shock is as dangerous as a new diagnosis of heart disease, wrote Dr. Alan Garber of Harvard University in an accompanying editorial, noting that doctors need to recognize how money hardships may affect their patients.\n\nThe findings come at a time when U.S. life expectancy has dropped for two straight years.\n\nWe should be doing everything we can to prevent people from experiencing wealth shocks, said Dr. Steven Woolf, director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Society and Health, who was not involved in the study.\n\nWhat exactly to do, however, may take more research, said Katherine Baicker, dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at University of Chicago, who also was not involved in the study.\n\nWe don't yet know whether policies that aim to protect people's savings will have a direct effect on mortality or not, Baicker said. But that's not the only reason to try to protect people's savings.
DETROIT - Toyota is killing its Scion brand after years of slumping sales.\n\nBeginning in August, 2017 model-year Scion vehicles will be rebadged as Toyotas. The FR-S sports car, iA sedan and iM 5-door hatchback will be a part of the Toyota line-up. So will the C-HR, a small SUV concept that debuted in November, if Toyota decides to make it. The tC coupe will have a final release series edition and end production in August, according to Toyota Motor Corp.\n\nScion was formed in 2003 to attract younger buyers. It was known for its funky designs, like the boxy xB, and was the brand Toyota used when it wanted to experiment with new kinds of marketing, like pop-up test drives at the mall, or no-haggle pricing.\n\nTwelve years ago, Scion was courting Generation X buyers, who didn't like their parents' brands and didn't trust traditional marketing, said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of U.S. operations. But as those buyers matured, they started buying Toyotas.\n\nNext came the Millennials. For a while, that generation delayed car buying because they were underemployed and had too much student debt. But when they did buy, they liked their parents' brands and wanted Toyotas, too.\n\nFor those buyers, frankly speaking, Toyota as a brand is more aspirational than Scion was, Carter said.\n\nThere were other issues. Scion's small, oddball lineup never connected with buyers and cost a bit more, since features like touchscreens that were optional on other cars came standard on Scions. Scion's best-seller, the tC coupe, starts at $21,330, or $2,600 more than a Honda Civic. Scion also doesn't have any SUVs, which are rapidly becoming the most popular style of vehicle in the U.S.\n\nAt the brand's height, in 2006, sales of all Scion models combined reached just over 173,000. Sales stood at 56,167 in 2015. By comparison, Toyota sold more than 363,000 Corolla sedans.\n\nToyota says it achieved what it had hoped with the Scion, including attracting younger buyers. Half of the 1 million Scions sold were bought by people under 35, Carter said, and 70 percent were new to the Toyota family.\n\nPaul Harris bought his first car, a Scion xD, subcompact, in 2010. Harris, a 34-year-old employment lawyer in Houston, said he wanted something inexpensive and fun to drive. He also trusted Scion's quality because of its connection to Toyota.\n\nHarris has been happy with his Scion. And - key for the company - he thinks his next car will be a Toyota.\n\nCarter said the company will bring some of its experiments at Scion to its other brands. The Toyota Care maintenance program, which provides two years of free maintenance, originated with Scion, he said. Lexus is currently running a no-haggle pricing pilot borrowed from Scion, and Toyota will soon offer an express purchase program. Scion taught Toyota that consumers want transparent pricing and want to spend less time buying.\n\nScion was the test bed, Carter said.\n\nSarah Wall, a 39-year-old marketing and communications executive in San Francisco, said she bought a Scion xD in 2010 because of Scion's no-haggle pricing policy. The car is distinctive, easy to park and has low maintenance costs, she said.\n\nWall said she's devastated that Scion will no longer be a separate brand. But she says she would consider a Toyota in the future, especially if the brand adopts no-haggle pricing.\n\nToyota's decision will have minimal impact on dealers and owners. Scion, which is only sold in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, has no stand-alone dealerships. The brand is sold through 1,004 Toyota dealerships, which will continue to service the cars.\n\nIt's not unusual for automakers to kill a brand or pull it out of a particular market. Ford Motor Co. killed its Mercury brand in 2010, and multiple brands, like Izusu and Renault, have left the U.S. market. But Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said this is the first time a U.S.-specific brand launched by a Japanese manufacturer has been killed.\n\nBrauer says Scion was a victim of the success of the Toyota brand. The Toyota Camry sedan has been the best-selling car in the U.S. for 14 years, and the brand has a full lineup that appeals to Millennials and Baby Boomers alike.\n\nEven Toyota can't compete with Toyota, Brauer said.\n\nScion's demise doesn't necessarily spell trouble for other small car brands, like BMW AG's Mini or Daimler AG's Smart, said Ivan Drury, an analyst for Edmunds.com.\n\nThose brands differentiated themselves from their parent brands more than Scion ever did, he said.
YouTube is banning content that promotes dangerous pranks or challenges, following a blindfold challenge inspired by hit Netflix movie Bird Box.\n\nThe Google-owned company previously had a policy barring harmful or dangerous content, but updated its policies to explicitly prohibit videos that encourage people to engage in risky challenges or pranks. The move comes after a series of popular videos spurred copycats in which people were injured.\n\nBird Box stars Sandra Bullock as a mother fleeing from a sinister force that turns anyone who sees it suicidal, prompting her and her children to wear blindfolds to make their escape. That sparked the Bird Box challenge, where people wrap blindfolds around their eyes and walk around or even attempt driving. In one case, a woman nearly burned herself on a heater, and another boy repeatedly crashed into furniture with his tricycle. One toddler slammed into a wall.\n\nWe've updated our external guidelines to make it clear that challenges like the Tide pod challenge or the Fire challenge, that can cause death and/or have caused death in some instances, have no place on YouTube, the company said in a blog post.\n\nThe Bird Box challenge isn't the first to spark controversy. The Tide Pod challenge last year sparked a government watchdog to express concern over the prank, which involves teenagers putting Tide detergent pods in their mouths. The social media fad led to injuries, including chemical burns in teens' mouths.\n\nYouTube stressed that it isn't banning funny pranks or challenges, like Jimmy Kimmel's terrible Christmas present challenge.\n\nYouTube is home to many beloved viral challenges and pranks, but we need to make sure what's funny doesn't cross the line into also being harmful or dangerous, the company said.
Acknowledging that the Obama administration took too long to retool its immigration enforcement priorities, former Vice President Joe Biden announced at Sunday's Democratic debate that he would implement a 100-day freeze on deportations of undocumented immigrants if elected.\n\nAsked about his recent concession that the more than three million deportations during President Obama's tenure were a mistake, Biden said his administration would initially institute the temporary moratorium on removals, and then focus on removing undocumented immigrants convicted of felonies from the country, while effectively shielding everyone else from deportation.\n\nWe can be a nation of immigrants, as well as a nation that is decent, Biden said at the CNN-Univision debate in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring their first one-on-one debate, Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's hardline immigration agenda, proposing sweeping reversals of current immigration enforcement and asylum policies.\n\nAfter the moderators asked about fears some unauthorized and legal immigrants may have about seeking medical care during the escalating coronavirus pandemic due to Mr. Trump's policies, Sanders proposed ending raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency in charge of apprehending and deporting undocumented immigrants. Sanders suggested such a move would alleviate fears in immigrant communities.\n\nJoe Biden and Bernie Sanders take part in the 11th Democratic Party 2020 presidential debate in Washington, D.C., on March 15, 2020. MANDEL NGAN\n\nICE has regularly conducted enforcement operations to apprehend undocumented immigrants in communities and worksites, and it's unclear how a Sanders administration would pause them while maintaining an immigration enforcement regime. He and Biden also expressed support for limiting cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE.\n\nBoth candidates said they do not want local authorities to turn in undocumented immigrants, suggesting they would look to limit the use of so-called detainers, which are requests made by ICE for local and state law enforcement to hold on to immigrants it detains, even if only briefly, until the federal agency can come and arrest them.\n\nAs they've indicated before, both Biden and Sanders pledged to back immigration reform legislation that includes a pathway to U.S. citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.\n\nBiden vowed to revamp the current asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border, where the Trump administration has implemented a series of restrictive policies designed to deter U.S.-bound migrants. He promised to end the so-called Remain in Mexico policy, which requires asylum-seekers to wait in northern Mexico for their chance to see a U.S. immigration judge, saying the program has forced thousands of migrants to live in squalor on the other side of the border.\n\nThe former vice president also touted a plan to hire more immigration judges to adjudicate asylum claims at the southern border, and seemed to make a bold promise to abolish the civil detention of migrants seeking humanitarian protections. As part of its deterrence policies, Mr. Trump's administration has expanded the practice of detaining asylum-seekers for the duration of their cases.\n\nNo one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing, Biden said.\n\nAsked if their proposed asylum changes could be criticized as open border policies, Sanders strongly pushed back, saying most Americans support a humane immigration agenda.\n\nNo one is talking about open borders, he said.
NEW YORK -- The New York Police Department says a sergeant has been stripped of her gun and badge and charged internally in the July 2014 chokehold death of Eric Garner.\n\nSgt. Kizzy Adonis was one of the supervising officers at the scene of Garner's death on Staten Island during an arrest on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.\n\nOfficials said Friday Adonis was charged with failure to supervise.\n\nSgt. Ed Mullins is the head of her union and calls the charge ridiculous and political.\n\nAdonis was recently promoted to sergeant while she was on probation, and NYPD policy dictates that officials had to act on the charges within 18 months.\n\nLast year, a grand jury declined to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the white officer who applied the chokehold on Garner, who is black.\n\nHe remains on modified duty and has yet to face departmental charges. A federal probe is continuing.\n\nThe grand jury decision sparked protests and the chant I can't breathe, some of Garner's last words, which were captured in a video of part of the incident.
Discrimination in auto buying is alive and well more than 40 years after the Equal Credit Opportunity Act outlawed discrimination in lending.\n\nThe National Fair Housing Alliance said it sent eight pairs of car buyers -- one white, one not -- to shop separately at car dealerships in Virginia. Despite the fact that all the nonwhite test buyers were better qualified for loans, 62.5 percent received more costly pricing, which would have caused them to pay an average of $2,662.56 more.\n\nThree-quarters of the time, white buyers also were given more financing options than buyers of color, according to NFHA's report, released Thursday.\n\nIt is upsetting to find that in 2018, consumers of color are still facing discriminatory practices when making major financial purchases, said Lindsay Daniels, associate director of economic policy for UnidosUS in a prepared statement. Being charged more for credit despite being financially qualified for better rates, especially on big-ticket items like a car, can have devastating impact on a family's monthly budget and financial stability.\n\nThe report was more a confirmation of earlier studies than a revelation about discrimination in lending. Discriminatory practices have been chronicled frequently since the 1990s, when a Yale law professor came up with the idea of sending identically situated testers of different races car dealerships to see how race factored into eligibility for loans. Since then, dozens of studies have been conducted with the same results.\n\nHowever, advocates said some progress was being made, thanks to a crackdown by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that started in 2013. The consumer watchdog, which won settlements from both Honda and Toyota's financing arms two years ago, is now under new leadership, and pending legislation would restrict the agency's ability to penalize violators.\n\nThis study points to the need for having a watchdog on the beat that is empowered to do their job, said Delvin Davis, senior researcher for the National Fair Housing Alliance.\n\nWith the CFPB's continued commitment to fair lending unclear, car buyers would be wise to protect themselves. Fortunately, new and improved tools put consumers in the driver's seat, providing more pricing transparency and negotiating power. What should you do if you're in the car market, regardless of your race?\n\nKnow your credit score\n\nThe best financing terms go to buyers who have high credit scores. Generally speaking, a score of 720-740 (depending on the scoring system) should win you the best rates on auto loans.\n\nConsumers can get free credit scores in a number of ways. Many credit card companies, including Capital One (COF), Chase (JPM), Citi (C) and American Express (AXP), will provide free credit scores to their card holders. Discover (DFS) will provide a free credit score to anyone who asks. Website CreditKarma also provides free scores and advice on what might be holding your score back.\n\nGet pre-approved\n\nBefore you walk into a dealership, check with your own bank or credit union and get pre-approved for an auto loan, suggested Jack Gilles, director of public affairs for the Consumer Federation of America and author of The Car Book. The car dealer, which may have access to subsidized rates from the manufacturer, could still beat that rate.\n\nHowever, if the dealer can't or won't give you a better deal, a pre-approval means you don't need to accept higher-cost financing.\n\nCheck prices online and negotiate via phone\n\nWebsites, including KBB.com and Edmunds.com, can give you a good read on what a car should cost loaded with all of the extras that you want. These services will also link to specific car offers, including the list prices at various dealerships.\n\nThis can be a good starting point to shop online and over the phone, calling -- or emailing -- the relevant dealerships to begin your negotiating process. Be sure to ask about the all-in price, including taxes, destination fees and any other mandatory dealer add-ons. Email multiple dealers, asking for their best price on what you want. When dealers know they're competing, you often get better prices.\n\nGet the VIN\n\nParticularly if you're buying a used car -- each of which is unique because of wear and tear, options and mileage -- make sure you get the VIN (vehicle ID number) for any car you've negotiated down to a price that you find appealing. This can reduce the chance that the dealer will claim your specific car just sold, giving the dealer the ability to restart the negotiating process in person.\n\nConsider a car-buying service\n\nIf you're a Costco (COST) member, the club offers a free car-buying service, where the prices have been pre-negotiated at a discount to manufacturer's suggested retail. For a $250 fee, CarBargains.org will also negotiate with five dealers for you.\n\nHowever, you may be able to do even better by using these services and then expanding the list of dealerships that you price-check via email, using the pre-negotiated prices as your starting point and only buying when you get an even better deal.\n\nWalk\n\nIf you have good credit, you have bargaining power. The best way to exercise it is to walk away when you feel the dealership is being dishonest or disrespectful. When finalizing your deal, be sure to read the financing documents and make sure they conform with the deal you negotiated.\n\nThere are thousands of car dealers. Take your time and find one that treats you fairly and doesn't throw in unexpected costs when you're about ready to sign on the dotted line.
T-shirts that celebrate the attack on the U.S. Capitol and falsely accuse President-elect Joe Biden of pedophilia were still being sold on Tuesday at Amazon, eBay and other online retailers.\n\nOutside sellers on the e-commerce platforms, as well as sites such as Noelfashiontees.com, are offering T-shirts that read Battle for Capitol Hill Veteran, for example. Teespring.com is selling a T-shirt that says Biden Likes Minors, with the letters B, L and M set off in reference to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nOther retailers that were selling politically charged or insensitive merchandise related to the January 6 Capitol riot, such as Etsy and Zazzle, moved to remove the items shortly after critics pointed them out. In most cases, retailers took down the T-shirts after saying the material violated company policies against hate speech or inciting violence.\n\nAmazon did not respond to requests seeking comment. It appeared to have taken down the shirt, which remained available as of Tuesday morning, by the afternoon. After being made aware of the Biden Likes Minors shirts, a spokesperson for eBay told CBS MoneyWatch the retailer would be reviewing and removing those shirts.\n\nA screenshot captured January 19, 2021, shows a T-shirt promotes the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. CBS MoneyWatch\n\nAt eBay, we have a strict policy against hate and discrimination to ensure our platform remains a safe, trusted and inclusive environment for our global community of buyers and sellers, eBay said in a statement, adding that it prohibits items that promote or glorify hatred, violence or discrimination.\n\nThe eBay spokesperson noted that the company has also removed merchandise that supports far-right conspiracy theory QAnon.\n\nSoon after the Capitol attack, Shopify removed President Donald Trump's campaign store and said the merchandise being offered violated the Canada-based company's policy against sellers promoting violence. Mr. Trump's Make America Great Again hats, Trump 2020 buttons, flags, pennants, T-shirts and bobbleheads are still up for sale on Amazon by third-party sellers.\n\nAmazon recently removed QAnon merchandise from its site. Last August, Amazon removed a T-shirt seller who sold offensive sweatshirts referring to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n\nAmazon, through its web-hosting company, earlier this month also pulled the plug on conservative social media site Parler because it featured what Amazon described as violent content. Soon after, Google and Apple removed the Parler app from its stores.\n\nThe Battle for Capitol Hill T-shirt on Amazon had been available on Zazzle, but the online retailer removed it last week, the New York Times reported. Etsy also cited promotion of violence when it recently removed a T-shirt that read Camp Auschwitz, making light of the more than 1 million people who died in the Nazi concentration camp during World War II.
Online-store platform Shopify has removed all of President Donald Trump's campaign merchandise from its platform, saying those web pages violated the Canadian company's policy against sellers promoting violence.\n\nBoth Trump merchandise websites — trumpstore.com and shop.donaldjtrump.com — were disabled Thursday. Soon after, Shopify said in a statement that it does not tolerate actions that incite violence.\n\nBased on recent events, we have determined that the actions by President Donald J. Trump violate our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibits promotion or support of organizations, platforms or people that threaten or condone violence to further a cause, said Shopify, which had been hosting Trump's store.\n\nThe removal comes one day after violent protests at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of President Trump breached the building while lawmakers were trying to tally Electoral College votes and certify the results of the November election won by Joe Biden. Four people died soon after the event.\n\nMAGA hats, T-shirts, bobbleheads and more\n\nWhen active, both Trump online stores offered Make America Great Again hats, Trump 2020 buttons, flags, pennants, T-shirts, bobbleheads and more. Sales from Trumpstore.com flowed to the privately held Trump Organization while shop.donaldjtrump.com funded the official Trump campaign, NPR reported.\n\nTrumpstore.com generated $107,186 in income in 201 alone, according to a ProPublica investigation that cited a Trump financial disclosure.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nShopify marks the latest in a growing list of tech platforms Mr. Trump has been blocked from this week.\n\nSnapchat suspended Mr. Trump's account on Wednesday while Twitter barred Mr. Trump from using the @realDonaldTrump account after deleting some of his posts. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that Mr. Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts have been suspended indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.
LONDON -- The British press on Friday accused President Obama of launching an unprecedented verbal attack on British Prime Minister David Cameron in a magazine interview.\n\nIn a lengthy interview with The Atlantic, Obama faults Cameron and other European allies for shortcomings in dealing with Libya after the 2011 ouster of longtime dictator Col. Muammar Qaddafi.\n\nThe Times newspaper said Obama's criticism was extraordinary and said Obama was blaming Cameron for the Libya mess.\n\nThe Independent front page headline says Obama savages Cameron over Libya.\n\nIn the magazine interview, Obama said Cameron had been distracted by other issues after Qaddafi's fall.\n\nBritain and other European nations had joined the U.S. in military action there to prevent a massacre of civilians. Obama told the magazine he had expected European nations to take a more active role in helping Libya during its reconstruction.\n\nWhen I go back and I ask myself what went wrong there's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up, he said.\n\nObama also criticized former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for taking too much credit for France's military role.\n\nLibya has since descended into chaos and emerged as a potential safe haven for Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) extremists.\n\nU.S. officials have tried to squelch the controversy by telling British media that the United States places a high priority on Britain's support.\n\nPrime Minister Cameron has been as close a partner as the president has had, and we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives which reflect our special and essential relationship, spokesman Edward Price told ITV News.\n\nThe two countries have long been close allies with a so-called special relationship exemplified by the close cooperation between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt during World War II.\n\nTies between Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were also exceptionally close near the end of the Cold War, and President George W. Bush relied on Tony Blair to back the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.
San Juan, Puerto Rico — Award-winning playwright and musician Lin-Manuel Miranda is widely revered in many parts of Puerto Rico, where the New York City-born Hamilton creator traces his roots. His family's hometown of Vega Alta, west of the capital, is adorned with several colorful murals of him and even a museum dedicated to his artistic and philanthropic work.\n\nBut after planning a three-week run of his Broadway hit on the island, Miranda and his musical encountered some unexpected hostility. As a result, Miranda and his team announced in December — just three weeks before the show's opening on January 11 — that the production would relocate from a historic theater at the University of Puerto Rico's Río Piedras campus to another theater in San Juan.\n\nThe university has a policy of limiting police presence on campus, which the Hamilton team believed was necessary because of potential protests during the production.\n\nIn recent months, the university has been roiled by student demonstrations against educational cuts, faculty layoffs and tuition hikes that were ordered by the federal fiscal board, which Congress established through the 2016 Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act — known as PROMESA.\n\nAlthough Hamilton ticket sale proceeds will go to a charitable arts fund established by the Miranda family, some Puerto Ricans seized on the musical's symbolism as a celebration of American government to continue their criticism of the unpopular federal oversight board, which Miranda supports.\n\nThe protests reflect the student and local discontent with America's foreign policy, which affects us negatively, Carlos Ariel Ortiz, a 43-year-old business administration professor at Ana G. Méndez University, told CBS News. It is a communal cry of protest.\n\nOrtiz said many Puerto Ricans feel like they have no voice and no vote to stop austerity measures imposed by the board, known locally as the junta. Since it was established in 2016 to deal with the growing debt-crisis in Puerto Rico, the board has directed the island's government to make budget cuts to several welfare programs, as well as the educational system.\n\nThe relationship between the islands's residents and the junta, Ortiz said, resembles a colonial system.\n\nPuerto Rico has been under the control of the fiscal board for some time. It's a federal entity which governs local politics. This highlights our colonial status. We are the only colony in the world, he said.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda's father, Luis Miranda, who studied at the University of Puerto Rico, said he supports students' right to protest, mainly because he's a longtime activist.\n\nI do it all the time — I did it all my life, he told CBS News' David Begnaud on Wednesday.\n\nBut Miranda said the venue change was warranted.\n\nWe had security concerns because the university doesn't have its own police, it's difficult for police to go in, he said. So, if anything were to happen — even if the possibilities were remote — we didn't want to run that chance.\n\nMiranda said one of his and his son's foremost goals was nevertheless achieved.\n\nBut we leave behind what we set to do, which is to leave a first-class theater on the island, he said.
U.S. military officials told CBS News that Iran and its militias may be planning to act against a U.S. embassy or military base in the region. Iran has vowed revenge for the U.S. airstrike that killed General Qassem Soleimani a year ago.\n\nWith tension mounting, CBS News spoke to Xiyue Wang, an American recently released from an Iranian prison after spending three and half years there. His son was just a toddler when Xiyue was imprisoned in Iran on fabricated charges of espionage. He maintains that he's just a scholar and was targeted because he's American.\n\nXiyue said his interrogator very explicitly told him they had imprisoned him in hopes that the U.S. would make a deal.\n\nThe Ministry of Intelligence interrogator told me clearly that they need me as a spy to convict me so that they can do a deal with the United States, he said.\n\nYou're not the first American and you can be assured that you're not the last American to be in Iranian jail, the interrogator said, according to Xiyue.\n\nIn 2019, President Trump swapped a jailed Iranian scientist for Xiyue.\n\nThey didn't get everything they had hoped for, Xiyue said, adding that the Iranians wanted money and for the U.S. to unfreeze their assets.\n\nAt least three other Americans are still being held, one of which Xiyue said he met in prison.\n\nPresident-elect Biden wants to try out diplomacy with Iran over its nuclear weapons program, but expert Suzanne Maloney says that shouldn't be the only issue. The Biden team has offered to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal, which would lift sanctions worth billions.\n\nThere needs to be negotiations around the nuclear issue. But that doesn't mean subordinating the other sets of concerns, particularly the lives of Americans who are held in Iranian prisons, said Maloney, the director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution.\n\nXiyue is urging Mr. Biden to make the release of Americans held hostage his first priority.\n\nWithout their return: no deal with Iran, he said.
The Trump administration has faced criticism over the availability of coronavirus test kits in the United States. Vice President Mike Pence has said any American would be able to get tested for the disease it causes, COVID-19 — but acknowledged this week, as the government raced to distribute tests, that the capacity wasn't there yet.\n\nSo what should someone do if they want to get tested?\n\nAccording to the American Hospital Association, people who think they have the coronavirus should call their physician to see if a test is warranted. If so, they will direct you to an appropriate testing site.\n\nClinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested, reads the CDC's website.\n\nThe CDC guidance urges doctors to consider local epidemiology — who the person came in contact with and their travel history — as well as a patient's symptoms. It also strongly encourages them to test for other causes of respiratory illness, such as the flu, before moving forward with a coronavirus test.\n\nThat guidance may evolve as the virus is better understood.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of Infectious Disease at Massachusetts General Hospital, someone could potentially have the coronavirus and the flu at the same time.\n\nWhat we don't know is about people who are asymptomatic ... where in the course of the disease does it turn negative, and where does it turn positive, Walensky said.\n\nTesting for the virus involves both a nasopharyngeal (nose) and oropharyngeal (mouth) swab, which provide labs with upper respiratory tract specimens. The CDC also recommends – though does not require — that health care providers collect lower respiratory tract specimens — sputum or phlegm — if available.\n\nThe time it takes to get results varies.\n\nTest results processed by the CDC initially took four to five days due to constraints on personnel and the number of tests available, according to Walensky. Now, she said, the turnaround from the CDC is usually one to two days.\n\nHow long it takes to get results from other labs depends on where tests are conducted.\n\nTesting in California, where the most cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the United States, takes about 48 hours, according to the California Department of Public Health. CDC kits are already being used by 11 public health labs in California, and will expand to 20 labs in the coming weeks, the department said Thursday.\n\nDr. Sarah Turbett, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said labs in Massachusetts are able to determine results within 24 hours.\n\nIn Washington, where 13 people have died from coronavirus, testing is taking place daily at the state's public health laboratory. According to the Washington State Department of Health, the laboratory performed 209 tests for 91 people as of Wednesday.\n\nAs of Friday, 245 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in the United States — a figure that could jump as more people are tested.\n\nThe availability of tests is expected to jump within the next few weeks as the CDC sends out a new batch and independent manufacturers ramp up production.\n\nAn initial coronavirus test distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a faulty reagent that prompted labs to report problems, delaying testing across the country. For one month, the CDC was one of only a handful of labs able to run a diagnostic test, according to the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n\nReporters pressed Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar Thursday on why the U.S. response hasn't matched that of countries like South Korea, which has a large outbreak and has tested over 100,000 people.\n\nAzar said more production will put availability of testing in the U.S. far ahead of similarly impacted major countries around the world.\n\nOn Friday, Azar said as many as 4 million tests will be sent to public health labs, the private sector, and hospitals by next week.\n\nThe CDC sends kits to laboratories designated as qualified by the CDC, according to its website. These include U.S. state and local public health laboratories, Department of Defense laboratories and select international laboratories.\n\nAzar added that Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT, a manufacturer that works with the CDC, will make a million of its own tests available by the end of next week.\n\nHe also noted that an FDA policy change that allows CDC-qualified labs to create its own tests before the FDA has completed its review will radically expand availability of tests.\n\nOne such lab, Quest Diagnostics, said in a press release Thursday that it would be able to provide testing as early as Monday.\n\nThe new service is expected to employ respiratory specimens collected in appropriate health care settings, such as hospitals and physician offices, reads the statement. ... Patients suspected of, or confirmed to have, COVID-19 should consult with a physician regarding the best way to provide a specimen for testing by Quest.\n\nIt's unclear which states and facilities will receive the new tests. Right now… it is a challenge if you are a doctor wanting to get somebody tested, said Azar.\n\nOn Friday, Azar said Washington and California have received all the tests they've requested.\n\nBy this weekend, that broad network of hospitals, other labs, will be receiving from IDT those million tests that we referred to… So that experience will get better within the next week, week and a half, two weeks, he said.\n\nBut do not be surprised if you hear concerns of doctors saying 'I have a patient I don't know how to get this done.'\n\nWith more tests will come better data.\n\nWe're only testing people who are the sickest so it does make the mortality rate look quite high, Turbett said.\n\nAn uptick in testing could be a double-edged sword, Walensky said. The mortality rate will likely go down, but the number of confirmed cases could also go up.\n\nI sort of like to think about it as turning the lights on, she said.
The best way to describe the source of President Donald Trump's broad economic and political impact is to take him out of the equation altogether, says economist Mark Blyth.\n\nThe first thing to do is stop focusing on Trump if you want to understand this, the Scotland-born Brown University professor said on the latest episode of The Takeout podcast. The bigger picture is simply a story of the breakdown of that regime, if you want to call it that, from the '80s through to the financial crisis, where basically a huge amount of wealth was generated globally, and it went into very few hands locally.\n\nOver breakfast tacos at food-truck-turned-restaurant, District Taco, across the street from the CBS News DC bureau, Blyth told CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett and Political Director Steve Chaggaris that Donald Trump is a phenomenon on both the right and the left -- and not only in the U.S., but also in other countries across the globe.\n\nAnd what it is, essentially, is a huge amount of dissatisfaction with the people who have been running the world for the last 30 years.\n\nIt's like the ubiquitous fast food chain McDonald's, he says, drawing an extended metaphor: It's hard to find a bad McDonald's in the United States, but if you eat there all the time, bad things can happen.\n\nSo a large part of the United States has been eating McDonald's for 30 years. And they figured out that there's a kitchen on the coasts serving lobster.. and they're not invited.\n\nBlyth thinks that the ultimate tragedy of the Trump presidency is that he may not be able to fix this imbalance. Will Trump's moment be a political one, absent the policy relevance needed to deal with the grievances his supporters elected him to solve?\n\nSadly, I think that's shaping up to be most likely outcome – that ultimately what you've got is someone who's portrayed himself as people's champion, Blythe said. And he's come along and said, 'You know, we need to protect coal jobs.' All right, great sympathy for the people who are there who are doing this. But coal mining in the developed world is shutting down everywhere.\n\nDownload new episodes of The Takeout podcast Friday mornings on iTunes, Stitcher and Google Play.

HONG KONG - China's economic growth slowed in the first quarter to 6.7 percent, largely in line with expectations, but its slowest pace since the global financial crisis.\n\nData reported Friday showed that the annualized growth rate for the world's second-largest economy ticked lower from the previous quarter's 6.8 percent.\n\nBut carefully targeted stimulus helped to prevent it from slowing even further, analysts said, raising hopes that growth may be stabilizing.\n\nA prolonged slowdown took annual growth last year to 6.9 percent, the weakest annual expansion in a quarter century. The communist leadership is seeking to steer the economy toward greater reliance on services and private consumption, and away from a growth model based on export manufacturing and investment.\n\nOfficials were cautious.\n\nThe economy is at a critical stage of climbing uphill and getting over the structural adjustment's hurdles and the pain of the adjustment process persists, National Bureau of Statistics spokesman Shen Laiyun said at a press conference. In the meantime the real economy is still in relative difficulty. Therefore the downward pressure on the economy cannot be ignored.\n\nStill, the latest numbers matched most economists' expectations and suggest the economy is on track to meet the official full-year growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent. Growth was the most subdued since a 6.2 percent pace seen in the first quarter of 2009 during the global financial crisis.\n\nFixed asset investment expanded 10.7 percent in the January-March period while industrial output grew 5.8 percent and retail sales increased 10.3 percent, according to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nOn a monthly basis, those categories improved in March from the previous two months, indicating that momentum is building. Inflation came in at 2.1 percent.\n\nThe recent data has been too strong to pin on seasonal factors alone and leave us hopeful that growth has now bottomed out for the time being, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in Singapore said in a report.\n\nResorting to their usual policy tools, Chinese officials have cut interest rates repeatedly and lavished money on public works construction to counter the unexpectedly sharp downturn over the past two years.\n\nData from the investment-industry nexus show that the tried and tested stimulus measures of recent months have stirred up the physical part of the economy, especially towards the end of (the first quarter), while consumption remained relatively robust, said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics.\n\nWhile such measures slow progress toward the goal of cutting reliance on investment, they reduce the risk of politically dangerous increases in job losses.\n\nLast month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang outlined market-opening reforms, seeking to reassure investors that Beijing can keep growth on track after a tumultuous year of stock selloffs and gyrations in the value of the yuan.\n\nLi also outlined plans to shrink bloated steel and coal industries, part of a sweeping effort to reduce capacity, cut the government's role in business and improve efficiency. About 1.8 million workers will lose their jobs at unprofitable government-owned companies, but leaders say they will be retrained for new work.\n\nChina's exports grew for the first time since last summer in March, in annual terms, while private and official surveys of factory purchasing managers showed activity rebounded strongly. Auto sales jumped by 10 percent.\n\nWhile China's economy has slowed from the breakneck, double-digit boom of the previous decade, it remains a key driver of the world economy and the envy of advanced nations grappling with stagnation.\n\nEarlier this week, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its outlook for global growth, lowering it to 3.2 percent from the 3.4 percent forecast in January. At the same time, it cited China as one of the few global bright spots thanks to its resilient consumer spending and thriving service industries.
North Korea: Hermit country seen from space\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA Earth Observatory If any image can tell the story of North and South Korea in one frame, it's this shot taken by an astronaut aboard the International Space Station in January 2014. The nighttime view shows South Korea lit up with electric lights. Seoul is so bright as to be nearly washed out. With a 2017 gross domestic product estimated at $1.4 trillion by the International Monetary Fund, South Korea is among the dozen most prosperous countries in the world. North Korea's GDP is estimated at around $25 billion. According to one 2016 estimate, the per-capita GDP of North Korea was $1,013 in 2015, lagging behind even undeveloped countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh. By Stephanie Pappas / Originally published on LiveScience\n\nMythological mountain NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens This volcano on the border of China and North Korea is Paektu, or Baekdu, Mountain. It has long been a sacred place in Korean mythology and was said to be the birthplace of Dangun, the founder of the first Korean kingdom. North Korea's Kim dynasty has seized on this mythology and claims that Kim Jong Il, the country's supreme leader between 1994 and 2011, was born there under a newly formed star. (According to Soviet records, Kim Jong Il was actually born in the former Soviet Union.)\n\nEmpty country NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen and Robert Simmon This 2012 image shows another stark nighttime view of North Korea and its more prosperous southern neighbor. In 1953, when the armistice ending the Korean War was signed, North and South Korea had similar levels of economic development. While South Korea has since nurtured high-tech industries and economic growth, North Korea has faced chronic economic problems under the repressive Kim dynasty, according to the CIA World Factbook. A widespread famine in the 1990s, exacerbated by the Kim policy of self reliance and the closed economy that prevented food imports, killed between half a million and up to 3 million people, according to different estimates.\n\nAgricultural fires NASA image courtesy of Jeff Schmaltz/LANCE/EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response Team at NASA GSFC An image taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite in April 2014 shows pinpricks of fire across North Korea. Some may have been wildfires, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. Others, particularly those near rivers, were probably agricultural fires, set by farmers growing crops in mountainous, marginal land.\n\nEngorged river NASA images courtesy of the MODIS Rapid Response Team at NASA GSFC The Yalu, or Amnok, River runs for 490 miles (790 kilometers) along the border of North Korea and China. This image, taken by the MODIS instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite, shows the river in August 2010, after weeks of rain swelled waterways and caused flooding and mudslides.\n\nBaekdu in winter NASA A gorgeous view of Mount Baekdu and its crater lake, Heaven Lake. In Chinese, the peak is called Changbaishan (translates to ever-white mountain), a name that seems appropriate for this image captured on April 4, 2003. Mount Baekdu last erupted in 1903. In around A.D. 946, the mountain exploded in one of the largest-known volcanic eruptions in human history, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program, depositing rock fragments as far away as northern Japan.\n\nFire scars NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen and Robert Simmon This 2014 image from NASA's Advanced Land Imager on its Earth Observing-1 satellite gives a sense of North Korea's rugged terrain as well as its agricultural practices. Burn scars seen near the river running down the center of the image are probably agricultural burns, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. Farmers struggling to grow food in poor, mountainous land focus their efforts alongside river valleys and burn away debris from the previous year at planting time.\n\nMonster storm NASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz, MODIS Rapid Response Team Tropical Storm Tembin blankets the entire Korean peninsula in this true-color image taken on Aug. 30, 2012, by the MODIS instrument on the Aqua satellite. The storm hit just days after another storm, Typhoon Bolaven, made landfall. Prior to hitting the Korean peninsula, Tembin had hit Taiwan twice — first on Aug. 23 and then after looping back again on Aug. 27.\n\nHazy day NASA image by Jeff Schmaltz, MODIS Rapid Response Team A hazy day in South Korea is clear in the North. This image from Feb. 6, 2007, was taken by NASA's MODIS instrument on the Aqua satellite. The haze emanates from China, which has struggled with air pollution issues as its population becomes more car-dependent.\n\nNo man's land NASA image created by Jesse Allen This false-color image shows the Korean Demilitarized Zone, a buffer between South and North Korea that was established in 1953 as part of the armistice that suspended the Korean War. Troops are stationed along both sides of this border, and burn scars in this image show some of the changes that both militaries have wrought on the DMZ in the context of patrolling and surveillance, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.This image comes courtesy of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensor on NASA's Landsat-7 satellite.\n\nLine of truce Image courtesy Jesse Allen/NASA's Earth Observatory Another view of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in real color. The 2.5-mile-wide (4 kilometers) buffer is a mixture of mountains to the east and grasslands to the west. This image combines Landsat-4 and Landsat-5 satellite data from between 1989 and 1991 to get a cloud-free view of this largely depopulated swatch of land.\n\nA divided penisula Jeff Schmaltz, MODIS Rapid Response Team, NASA/GSFC In this image taken by the MODIS instrument on NASA's Aqua satellite, the Korean peninsula's differences disappear. This view of both North and South Korea shows two small fires burning in the North (red dots).\n\nChina and North Korea Jacques Descloitres/MODIS Land Rapid Response Team/NASA/GSFC Phytoplankton blooms turn the water psychedelic in this November 2001 image captured by the MODIS instrument on NASA's Terra satellite. The Bohai Sea is seen at the far left, with its three bays: Liaodong, Bohai and Laizhoid (from top, counterclockwise). The Korea Sea, part of the Yellow Sea, is visible as the darker region butting up against the Chinese and North Korean coastlines. According to NASA's Visible Earth, the murky sediments seen in the Bohai Sea are full of nutrients feeding the vivid blue plankton blooms.\n\nPeering into Pyongyang NASA GSFC/Landsat/LDCM EPO Team Pyongyang is North Korea's capital city and the home of most of the country's elites. It sits along the banks of the Taedong River and is home to approximately 3.2 million people, according to North Korea's 2008 census. A 2014 GoPro camera tour of the city — approved by the country's government — shows broad boulevards and Soviet-style architecture. Foreign reporters and visitors are rarely allowed outside of Pyongyang.\n\nSnow over North Korea Jeff Schmaltz, MODIS Rapid Response Team/NASA/GSFC A blanket of white snow covers North Korea, dipping across the Demilitarized Zone into South Korea. This image from December 2002 was taken by MODIS aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. North Korea's winters are long, as the CIA World Factbook puts it, bitter. According to Weather-and-Climate.com, average temperatures in January hover around 26 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 degrees Celsius), and there are 37 snowfall days on average in the winter months.\n\nDust plume Jacques Descloitres, MODIS Land Rapid Response Team/NASA/GSFC A tail of dust swirls over North Korea in this image taken by the MODIS instrument aboard NASA's Terra Satellite in April 2002. The dust was blowing from East Asia toward the Sea of Japan.\n\nTyphoon Rusa Jacques Descloitres, MODIS Land Rapid Response Team, NASA/GSFC Typhoon Rusa, one of the strongest to hit the Korean Peninsula in recorded history, made landfall at Goheung in South Korea in August 2002. Its expanse, however, affected the entire peninsula, as this image made with data from the MODIS instruments aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites show. More than 200 people in South Korea died and thousands were left homeless in North Korea, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Efforts.\n\nDense fog NASA image by Jeff Schmaltz, LANCE/EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response A dense blanket of fog curls against the North Korean coast and across the Yellow Sea in a satellite image captured on March 28, 2012. Foggy days are common over the Yellow Sea, according to NASA's Visible Earth. In this case, NASA scientists found that the fog was likely the result of northeasterly winds pushing moist air over the cool sea surface, causing the moisture to condense. Pyongyang is faintly visible as a grey spot in the upper lefthand corner of the image.\n\nA colorful region Courtesy of the SeaWiFS Project, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and ORBIMAGE This zoomed-out view of North Korea, South Korea and the eastern portion of China shows the interaction of sea and land in the region. To the lower left, China's Yangtze river pushes a plume of sediment into the East China Sea. This image was taken by the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) aboard GeoEye's OrbView-2 satellite, which collected data between 1997 and 2010. This shot was taken soon after the satellite's launch in 1997.
On Tuesday, Democrats won both Senate seats in Georgia's runoff election, giving them a narrow majority in the next Senate, with the help of potential tie-breaking votes from Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Having also defended their majority in the House of Representatives last November, the Democrats will have control of both chambers of Congress — as well as the presidency — come January 20.\n\nBut the events in the 24 hours that followed — an insurrection, instigated by the president, that led to the death of five people — largely overshadowed the news.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview this week with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, correspondent Lesley Stahl asked about the Democratic Party's new majority in Congress and how the Speaker intends to use it.\n\nWILL THE HOUSE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP?\n\nThe talk on Capitol Hill currently centers on what action politicians will against President Trump before Inauguration Day. Will the House vote to impeach him? Will the cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment?\n\nBut the questions of how to handle Mr. Trump's involvement in Wednesday's mob do not expire when his term does at noon on January 20. Will the House continue to investigate him after he leaves office?\n\nWe'll see, Speaker Pelosi said. It's not a question of let it go. We're not going to let go an insurrection in our country and the attempt of coup d'état so that we cannot validate the election of the next president of the United States.\n\nThe Speaker said she has told her members to see what opportunity exists and assess what it will accomplish. She also said the House will continue pursuing cases already underway, including the subpoenas they have already issued.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi pointed out that, with regards to potentially illegal activity, those who have surrounded the president could also be exposed.\n\nDo we want to get on with the future? Yes, of course, Speaker Pelosi said. But it doesn't mean that we cannot bring justice to the system as we do so.\n\nPOLICY ISSUES & USING RECONCILIATION\n\nNow that Democrats are set to control both the House and Senate, Speaker Pelosi is looking ahead to policy priorities she thinks her party will be able to pass, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs and rebuilding American infrastructure.\n\nWe have an array of issues, of legislation, that have been sitting over on Mitch McConnell's desk that passed in a bipartisan way in the House but that he would not bring up Speaker Pelosi said. So the power of bringing up legislation makes a big difference.\n\nThere are also bills the Senate can now pass without needing any Republican votes, through a legislative process known as reconciliation. Budget reconciliation applies to certain tax, spending, and debt legislation and allows the bills to pass in the Senate with a simple majority, which the Democrats will have. Most other legislation requires a majority of 60 Senate votes and provides senators with the ability to use the filibuster to indefinitely prevent a bill's consideration. The Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 through reconciliation.\n\nGeorgia was like winning ten votes from the standpoint of reconciliation, Speaker Pelosi told 60 Minutes.\n\nTHE RUSSIA HACK AND TRUMP'S TAXES\n\nOne of the subpoenas the House is pursuing involves President Trump's tax returns, which Speaker Pelosi said may reveal the extent of the president's ties with Russia.\n\nThis week, top national security agencies confirmed that Russia was likely responsible for a vast hack of U.S. government departments, contradicting Mr. Trump's unsupported claim that China was potentially to blame. Speaker Pelosi said that, rather than asserting authority over Russia, Mr. Trump was instead a handmaiden for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Speaker also said she agrees with Sen. Mitt Romney, who said the cyberattack amounted to an invasion.\n\nWe have to go forward to make sure we have the proper protection in terms of cybersecurity for our country because this was a very major assault, she said.\n\nThe Speaker said she has not received a full briefing on what happened and said the intelligence community may not have the full picture yet.\n\nBut what we do know is the president is, once again, in his Putin denial, the Speaker said. What is it that Putin has on him?\n\nTo watch Lesley Stahl's 60 Minutes interview with Speaker Pelosi, click here.\n\nThe videos above were edited by Will Croxton.
When Mother's Day became a national holiday in the U.S. more than a century ago, women were a relative rarity in the workforce. Today's mom, by contrast, is largely a working mom.\n\nIn half of American households, women are either the primary breadwinner or contribute more than 40 percent of the income. For most families, the added income from women going to work is the only thing that's kept family income steady, as individual worker wages have stagnated for the better part of four decades.\n\nSo while moms nationwide might appreciate the usual bouquet of flowers or other gift to recognize their efforts, for this Mother's Day we look at public policies that could lift their spirits -- and economic security.\n\nRaise the minimum wage\n\nMore women than men work in lower-wage jobs -- think health care, retail and administrative work. More than half -- 56 percent -- of minimum-wage workers are women. The sex differences are even starker among tipped workers, two-thirds of whom are women (and many of whom, according to a federal law last updated in 1991, have a baseline pay of only $2.13 an hour.)\n\nBut the effect of raising the minimum wage goes beyond just low-paid workers. Raising the wage floor also tends to lift the wages of higher-paid workers because their employers must compete with other companies offering higher pay.\n\nTo be sure, there is a tradeoff. Research shows that raising the minimum wage can suppress job growth, since making something more expensive (in this case, hiring) leads to people doing less of it. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the effects of increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 a few years ago, it found that 16.5 million workers would see higher earnings, while about half a million who otherwise would have had jobs wouldn't get work.\n\nMany states and localities have raised regional minimum wages since that study, and those increases haven't had a discernible effect on employment.\n\nBoost parental leave\n\nThe U.S. is unique among developed countries in not requiring businesses to provide any maternity or paternity leave for workers, paid or otherwise. (The Family and Medical Leave Act requires some businesses to provide unpaid leave, but it leaves out about 40 percent of workers.)\n\nThe situation creates what is an untenable choice for millions of working moms, who effectively must choose between being with their children or keeping their job, which they need to help support the household. And a lack of paid leave, combined with increasingly expensive child care, forces many women to stop working.\n\nWomen's participation [in the labor force] would be 6 percent higher if we had the same policies as other OECD countries, Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, told CBS MoneyWatch earlier this year, alluding to the 35 wealthier nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThough lower-wage moms (and dads) are disproportionately affected by the absence of paid-parental leave in the U.S., it hurts higher-income women (and dads), too. According to research from former President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, most women who don't take leave report having too much work.\n\nOffering paid family leave nationwide would remove the stigma for many workers. And research shows it's good business. Paid leave increases the likelihood that workers will return to work after childbirth, improves employee morale, has no or positive effects on workplace productivity, reduces costs to employers through improved employee retention, and improves family incomes, found one study from the Institute for Women's Policy Research.\n\nMake schedules boring\n\nBusinesses are increasingly setting workers' schedules using software that tracks the flow of customers, diners or patients. While such technology may help companies cut their labor costs, the advent of on-call scheduling often makes it hard for employees to predict their work hours. That's a particular problem for workers with family obligations, leaving parents scrambling to arrange child care to pick up a shift they learned about only days, or sometimes hours, in advance.\n\nEvery corporate retailer uses some sort of workforce management technology to schedule their workforce, said Carrie Gleason, director of the Fair Workweek Initiative at the Center for Popular Democracy, a group that advocates for workers, including laws that would require businesses to post schedules at least two weeks in advance and allow workers more input into their hours.\n\nAs a result, working families are scrambling for last-minute childcare, and can't set up regular routines because they're working different shifts from one week to the next. Workers who turn down last-minute shifts can often find themselves penalized or find their overall hours cut, Gleason noted, making it harder for them to advance.\n\nMaking health care cheaper\n\nIt's hard to point to workers -- male or female -- who wouldn't gain from cheaper and more accessible health care. But women in particular would benefit, because they're disproportionately hurt by the current system.\n\nNew research from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shows that health catastrophes, defined as something that requires an extraordinary medical payment, affect 1 in 6 families in the U.S. But the effect of those payments hurts women more than men. Women were in a weaker financial position than men to withstand an extraordinary medical payment, the banking giant found. One year after the medical payment, women had nearly 10 percent more debt than men.\n\nWith universal health care -- the system of choice for most developed nations -- seemingly off the table it the U.S., other policies could partly address the disproportionate impact of medical emergencies on women by tackling health issues that specifically hurt women. That could include reducing the cost of pregnancy, allowing access to family planning and providing social services for assault victims, to name just three.
LONDON - Another big reverse on China's main stock index weighed on markets around the world Wednesday ahead of the latest policy statement from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nIn Europe, France's CAC-40 was down 0.6 percent at 4,333 while Germany's DAX fell 0.6 percent to 9,762. Britain's FTSE 100 was 0.4 percent lower at 5,889.\n\nWall Street looked set for a lower open, with Dow futures down 0.3 percent, and the broader S&P 500 0.5 percent lower.\n\nHow the U.S. markets actually fare could well hinge on the statement from the Fed following the conclusion of its latest meeting. The U.S. central bank raised rates last month for the first time in nearly a decade following a raft of upbeat economic data, notably with regard to jobs. But the recent strength of the dollar, low oil prices and jitters over China's outlook have prompted warnings against raising rates too fast.\n\nFed-watchers will be examining the statement for signs of a shift in tone that might confirm the markets' recent lowering of expectations of the trajectory of U.S. rate increases during the course of 2016, said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital.\n\nThe foreign exchange markets could well see the biggest moves after the Fed's statement. Ahead of it, trading was subdued, with the euro up 0.1 percent at $1.0874 and the dollar flat at 118.33 yen.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index fell 4 percent by midday before recovering to end down 0.5 percent at 2,735.56, adding to Tuesday's 6.4 percent loss. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 2.7 percent to 17,163.92 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1 percent at 19,052.45. South Korea's Kospi gained 1.4 percent to 1,897.87.\n\nOil prices were sliding again, more or less reversing the previous day's gains. Benchmark U.S. crude was down $1.06 at $30.39 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oils, fell 60 cents to $31.20 per barrel in London.
Wielding control of the House and a new set of investigative powers, Democrats are preparing to bring Education Secretary Betsy DeVos under the sharpest scrutiny she has seen since taking office.\n\nDeVos has emerged as a common target for Democrats as they take charge of the House and its committees, which carry the authority to issue subpoenas and call hearings. At least four panels are expected to challenge DeVos on her most polarizing policies, among them her overhaul of campus sexual assault rules and her rollback of for-profit college regulations.\n\nWe are going to hold Secretary DeVos accountable for, in so many ways, failing to uphold federal protections for our students, said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat leading an appropriations subcommittee that oversees the education budget. It has to do with hurting student borrowers, protecting predatory for-profit schools and, above all, moving toward privatizing public education.\n\nHouse Democrats are increasing scrutiny of several top federal officials, but few have drawn as much attention as DeVos. Along with the appropriations committee, DeVos is likely to see pushback from panels that oversee education, veterans' affairs and government oversight.\n\nWithout control of the Senate, Democrats will have a tough time forcing DeVos' hand through legislation, but they can press her through subpoenas, hearings and the budgeting process. In contrast, DeVos was called before the House's education committee just once over the last two years of Republican control.\n\nMuch of the new scrutiny will come from Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the education committee, who said he will call DeVos to testify as often as necessary.\n\nWe have not been getting answers to most of our questions, Scott said in an interview, recalling when Democrats were in a minority. It's kind of hard to do oversight when they're not answering our questions.\n\nScott is particularly interested in exploring whether the Education Department is allowing states to skirt federal rules requiring them to address achievement gaps between students of different races.\n\nEducation Department spokeswoman Liz Hill countered that DeVos has been responsive to requests for information from Congress and will continue to be.\n\nShe's ready to work with any member of Congress who wants to rethink education and do better for America's students, Hill said.\n\nPresident Trump has dismissed Democrats' scrutiny of his administration as nothing more than harassment. But Scott said he plans to work with Republicans on his own initiatives, including a push for federal money to update the nation's aging school buildings.\n\nThe majority has certain powers, but hopefully we would have an ongoing dialogue, Scott said. Some of the hearings become spectacles that really don't add to solving problems.\n\nPart of the problem for Democrats will be picking their battles. They have opposed DeVos on nearly all of her major initiatives, including her proposed rules on the handling of campus sexual assaults, her support for arming school staff members and her revocation of federal guidance on school discipline.\n\nBut DeVos' greatest opposition could stem from her rollback of rules targeting for-profit colleges. As Mr. Trump pursues a broader effort to scale back regulation, she has sought to undo policies that the previous administration crafted to rein in for-profit colleges accused of deceiving students. Among them are the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute chains.\n\nA federal judge blocked DeVos from scrapping a policy that makes it easier for defrauded students to get loans erased. But her department has not enforced a separate rule meant to weed out shoddy for-profit colleges. Most recently, DeVos drew criticism in November when she reinstated an industry accrediting group that federal officials shut down in 2016 over lax oversight.\n\nScott has already vowed to dig into DeVos' decision on the accreditor, and he's joined by several other lawmakers concerned about for-profit college regulation.\n\nRep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat chairing the veterans' affairs committee, plans to hold hearings on the impact of DeVos' policies on military veterans. Takano said looser oversight has allowed predatory schools to recruit veterans and collect their GI Bill funding while ultimately leaving them with poor job prospects.\n\nHe also aims to investigate how for-profit colleges recruit on military bases.\n\nWhere Secretary DeVos has been insidiously effective is in undermining rules and undermining protections for students, he said.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said he, too, will conduct rigorous oversight of the Education Department and for-profit colleges, and explore whether DeVos exposed student borrowers to predatory practices and jeopardized their educational goals.\n\nThere's also debate among Democrats about how closely to examine potential conflicts of interest within the Education Department. DeVos has hired several former executives from the for-profit college industry, which some Democrats say is ripe for investigation. But Scott said he would rather focus on policies than the people behind them.\n\nWe've found a lot of confusion between potential bias and conflict of interest, Scott said. So long as they have no financial ties now with the industry, it would be hard to find a conflict of interest.\n\nBeyond oversight, some House Democrats are optimistic they can reach a deal on the Higher Education Act, a sweeping federal law that governs student financial aid and could be revised to address topics like campus sexual assault and student debt forgiveness.\n\nThe law has remained unchanged for a decade, but there's new interest in renewing the bill in the Senate before the chairman of the education committee, Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, retires after 2020.\n\nDemocrats also aim to boost money for public schools that serve low-income students and those with disabilities. They're bracing for a fight if DeVos renews her push to fund vouchers for private schools.\n\nNinety percent of our students are in public schools, and they need more resources to succeed, said Rep. DeLauro, the Connecticut Democrat on the appropriations committee. We should not be siphoning off taxpayer dollars, which are in demand, to pay for vouchers.
The Internal Revenue Service wasn't just letting calls go unanswered last tax season, the agency was also auditing fewer tax returns: 22 percent less than five years earlier.\n\nThat's according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that analyzes the impact of federal and state government policies.\n\nBecause of budget cuts that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has blasted as penny wise but pound foolish, the government's tax-collection arm no longer has the manpower to conduct as many audits of high-income taxpayers and businesses as in years past, the center found.\n\nIn 2010, the IRS audited 1.2 million taxpayers, or 1.1 percent of individual returns, a count that declined by more than 350,000, or 0.8 percent in 2015, the lowest level in a decade, the center said in an update published earlier this month. Given the agency's funding level is $900 million lower in fiscal 2016 versus five years earlier, there's little reason to believe the trend won't continue.\n\nAnd while some tax payers may breath easier knowing the odds of having the tax collector at their door has lessened, others might be annoyed that the reduced enforcement means some are getting away with cheating Uncle Sam.\n\nAudits recovered about $30 billion, or 30 percent, less in the past five years than in the prior five years, the center said, while citing Treasury estimates that every additional $1 invested in IRS tax enforcement yields $4 in increased revenue. Or, as IRS Commissioner John Koskinen summarized, Essentially, the government is losing billions to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars.\n\nThe agency has been operating in an extremely difficult budget environment for several years, Koskinen said in written testimony submitted Thursday to a House panel.\n\nThe IRS is not collecting about $6 billion a year in money owed, due to the agency's staffing shortages, the commissioner said in a March 24 speech to the National Press Club:\n\nThese staffing losses have translated into a steady decline in the number of individual audits over the past six years. Last year, in fact, we completed the fewest audits in a decade. Plus, our audit coverage rate in 2015 was the lowest since 2004. That trend line of fewer audits will continue this year.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee is preparing to replace numerous guardrail parts after the state determined that a certain model of end piece didn't work as intended in at least two fatal crashes.\n\nThe Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Tennessee plans to remove and replace Lindsay X-LITE guardrail ends around the state.\n\nSince June 2016 in Tennessee, four people have died in three crashes in which the vehicles hit the ends of guardrails that included that model, according to the newspaper. One of the people killed was a teenage girl whose family was mistakenly billed $3,000 for the guardrail earlier this year.\n\nAt the time, her father told CBS Knoxville affiliate WVLT-TV the state knew this was dangerous and that it wasn't performing well. They should have removed it, but their policy was to leave it on the road, playing Russian roulette with people's lives.\n\nB.J. Doughty, Tennessee Department of Transportation communications director, said the guardrails did not perform as they were intended to in two crashes that resulted in three deaths.\n\nDoughty said the X-LITE worked the way it was supposed to in the accident that killed the teenage girl in November 2016, but it impaled her car because of the angle of the crash.\n\nGuardrail ends are generally designed to telescope or slide into each other when struck, absorbing some of the impact of a crash and preventing the metal end from penetrating the vehicle.\n\nHowever, the state Department of Transportation found the X-LITE guardrail end didn't always work that way when hit at speeds higher than about 62 mph. Tennessee officials have begun accepting bids for contractors to remove and replace most of the 1,700 or more X-LITE ends on roads where speed limits exceed 45 mph.\n\nThe department made its concerns known to federal officials in an April 4 letter that also discussed its intention to replace the pieces.\n\nDoughty said the total cost could top $3.6 million. The work is slated to be completed by June 2018.\n\nThe part's manufacturer, Lindsay Corp., told the newspaper the X-LITE model has passed crash and safety tests and remains approved for use by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nIt is widely recognized that there are impact conditions that exceed the performance expectations of all safety equipment, and equipment's inability to singly prevent every tragedy does not indicate a flaw or defect, Scott Marion, president of the company's infrastructure division, said in a statement. While federal crash testing is intended to assess a variety of conditions, no test can replicate every possible scenario and factors, including severity of an impact, type and size of a vehicle, the installation and maintenance of the product, the angle at which a vehicle makes impact, vehicle speed, highway design, and many more.\n\nDoughty, of Tennessee's transportation department, said, If you hit anything going 70 plus mph, it is probably going to be a devastating type crash. ... These devices are not a pillow for you to hit to gently stop your car.\n\nState officials in Virginia and Missouri told the News Sentinel the model of guardrail end was involved in crashes that killed three people, but those officials didn't make clear if the parts performed as designed in those cases.
The White House held a hastily-arranged conference call with reporters Sunday evening to explain the president's extreme vetting executive order issued Friday, after visa holders from countries included in the order were detained at U.S. airports this weekend.\n\nThe new restrictions do not apply to green card holders -- or legal permanent residents -- from the seven countries covered by the order, a senior administration official said.\n\nLegal permanent residents are exempt from the executive order because it is in the national interest of the United States, the official told reporters.\n\nGreen card holders may be subject to additional screening but can continue traveling between the U.S. and their home countries freely, as long as no derogatory information is uncovered in the screening process.\n\nCustoms and Border Patrol agents process roughly 325,000 visitors to the U.S. each day. In the 24-hour period after order took effect, 109 prospective entrants were detained under the provisions of the executive order, but all were eventually allowed into the U.S. after extra screening (and rulings from federal judges). Some 170 legal permanent residents were allowed into the U.S. after applying for and receiving entry waivers.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, at least 348 people were told by their airlines that they were not allowed to board their flights to the U.S. as a result of the executive order. Officials told CBS News that there were also 394 legal permanent residents, or green card holders, who arrived at airports. Of that group, 392 people were admitted to the U.S. For the two that were denied entry, one walked back across the Canadian border and the other was arrested on an outstanding criminal charge.\n\nAfter the executive order was issued, over the weekend, the Pentagon was given the opportunity by the White House to provide a list of names of Iraqi translators, drivers and others who had supported American forces past and present, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis. He would not say, however, whether Defense Secretary James Mattis was aware of the contents of the executive irder before it was released and would not say whether the Pentagon had initiated the request to provide the list of Iraqis.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, had raised the issue of Iraqi pilots training in Arizona and Davis said the Pentagon is looking into that but thought they were in the U.S. on a special type of visa.\n\nAs for non U.S. citizens serving in the military, Davis said that there are roughly 18,700 Green Card holders serving in the U.S. military, but only a small fraction of them are from the seven countries affected by the ban.\n\nOn Saturday night, a federal judge issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to Mr. Trump's travel ban, saying travelers who had been detained had a strong argument that their legal rights had been violated. The White House argued the judges' decision applied only to the people detained Saturday at U.S. airports.\n\nThe White House claims that issuing waivers for legal permanent residents was always how its program was intended to work. The senior administration official complained that the media and protesters are overreacting to a very small percentage of entrants impacted by the new policy.\n\n[E]very false, misleading, inaccurate, hyperventilating, confused, misguided or other kind of report, again covers a fractional, miniscule percentage of travelers to our airports on any given day, the official said to reporters on the call, dismissing the detention of the travelers at airports across the country over the weekend as an extremely minimal disruption.\n\nThe president's order bans visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. These countries were also named by the Obama administration as potential sources of terrorism.\n\nAccording to the senior Trump administration official, the executive order was drafted by immigration staffers on Capitol Hill during the transition and refined over the last several weeks.\n\nBefore the order was signed Friday by the president, the senior administration official said the Justice Department's Office of Legal Council signed off on the executive order. And it also underwent review by the National Security Council, Homeland Security Council. Senior staff at DHS were also briefed.\n\nThe White House stressed the U.S. is under no obligation to admit foreign nationals from any country and called previous screening procedures woefully inadequate.\n\nRemoval from the banned list will -- according to the official -- depend on the ability of countries to comply with the Trump administration's requests for information. Within 30 days, the administration will lay out what we expect countries who participate in our immigration programs be able to provide about their nationals, the official said.\n\nAfter that, countries will be have 60 days to comply with the updated requirements.\n\nCBS News' Andres Triay and David Martin contributed to this report.
Income inequality is creating what charity Oxfam International calls a deeply shocking trend: Billionaires are not only growing wealthier and adding to their ranks, but the poorest half of the world is losing wealth at a time when the world's economy is expanding.\n\nThe economic climate is accruing outsized gains to billionaires, whose fortunes rose by 12 percent last year, while the poorest half of humanity — 3.8 billion people — saw their wealth decline by 11 percent, Oxfam found. Its report will be released at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which begins Tuesday and draws billionaires like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, policymakers and corporate leaders.\n\nWith the benefits of the economic expansion shifting to the world's richest people, billionaires are adding $2.5 billion in wealth each day. And every two days, a millionaire jumps into the ranks of the billionaire class, Oxfam said.\n\nOxfam, which has been studying the dynamics of wealth inequality since 2011, said the latest findings suggest that a new economic approach is needed to help recenter the wealth distribution. Many policy makers and economists have believed that economic growth will lift all boats, but that isn't playing out for billions of people across the globe. One reason: Tax rates have dropped to recent historic lows, allowing the rich and corporations to hold on to more wealth, said Paul O'Brien, vice president for policy and advocacy at Oxfam America.\n\nThe economic figures are going in the wrong direction. This isn't just another year of the same old reality -- it's getting worse in terms of the accumulation of extreme wealth, O'Brien said. It's deeply shocking to us.\n\nTax cuts and trickle-down theories\n\nThe top-heavy distribution of wealth has coincided with a drastic reduction in tax rates for the world's richest, Oxfam said. It found that the top rate for the rich in developed countries plunged from 62 percent in 1970 to 38 percent in 2013. In 2017, President Trump reduced tax rates for individuals and corporations, a decrease that favors the rich and businesses.\n\nThe leadership we've had has put in place the policies that widen the inequality gap, O'Brien said. What we are calling for is leadership and policies that slow the gap.\n\nTo be sure, conservative policy makers believe that lowering tax rates on the rich and businesses will spur growth, eventually providing more jobs and higher wages to middle- and lower-income workers. Yet there's little economic evidence that such policies deliver on their promises.\n\nA human economy\n\nInstead of an economy that stresses growth at any cost, Oxfam is pressing for what it calls a human economy.\n\nFundamentally the human economy is built from different principals than the growth economy, O'Brien said. For years, the consensus was, 'Growth solves everything.' But that has fallen apart. Our planet has limited boundaries. We can't burn more, use more, and break through ecological boundaries that are essential for sustaining human life.\n\nThe human economy would provide health care, education and gender equality to people across the globe, he said. All the data show that educating your children is the best way to build a healthy economy and create genuine shared wealth. We need to get kids into quality schools, and get rid of these legal and cultural barriers to women being treated unfairly in the workplace, being burdened and discounted.\n\nRaising taxes on the world's richest people and corporations would help fund those programs, with Oxfam calculating that boosting taxes on the richest by 0.5 percent would raise enough money to educate the 262 million children who currently don't receive an education and provide healthcare that would save 3.3 million people from preventable deaths.\n\nHigher taxes on the rich?\n\nWhether the rich should pay higher taxes entered the political discourse this month after freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the U.S. should raise taxes on the rich to their highest level since 1980, just before Ronald Reagan started hacking rates.\n\nThe top tax on the wealthy should rise to as high as 70 percent, Ocasio-Cortez told 60 Minutes earlier this month. That approach stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nYet higher marginal rates on the richest Americans would mark a return to the more progressive tax structure of the 1950s and 1960s — under Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, for instance, the rate on those in the top bracket topped 90 percent.\n\nWe totally agree with the congresswoman, Oxfam's O'Brien said. We think higher taxes for the extremely wealthy have to be a fundamental element of a healthy economy.
A patio heater that cost $150 on Amazon back in late 2019 had soared to $699 a year later, one of hundreds of products the online marketplaces sells whose price surged during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a consumer advocacy group.\n\nIn an analysis of 750 products sold on the platform, U.S. PIRG Education Fund found that 409 items saw prices jump more than 20% in 2020, while 136 at least doubled in price.\n\nThe spikes largely involved items viewed as necessities during the public health crisis, including surgical gloves, eye goggles, toilet paper and cough syrup. Across 15 product categories examined by U.S. PIRG, the highest price increases ranged from $13.10 to $4,000, with patio heaters showing among the 10 largest price jumps.\n\nIn the past year, 61% of patio heaters sold on Amazon increased in price by at least 20%, and 45% at least doubled. The highest jump was $549, from $150 to $699. Other products that saw similar spikes include oral thermometers, disinfection wipes and hand sanitizers. (See U.S. PIRG chart below.)\n\nOur research throughout the pandemic has revealed massive price spikes on Amazon listings, U.S. PIRG stated.\n\nU.S. PIRG\n\nIt's not meant to imply that this is true in all cases — only to reinforce the point that these price hikes can't always be blamed on heightened demand, Grace Brombach, a consumer watchdog associate and author of the study, told CBS MoneyWatch last week.\n\nWe believe Amazon has the technology and resources to combat this, Brombach said of the company, which reported record sales of $96 billion in the third quarter of 2020, a period that saw its profits tripling to $6.3 billion from a year earlier.\n\n13,000 suspended accounts\n\nAmazon acknowledges that the pandemic has boosted demand — and plumped up its profits — as millions of Americans stepped up their shopping online. But the company said it has both the automated and the manual means in place to ensure prices are fair to consumers.\n\nOur systems are designed to meet the best available price amongst our competitors, an Amazon spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. Sellers set their own product prices in our store. We have a long-standing policy against price-gouging, have processes in place to proactively block suspicious offers and monitor our store 24/7 for violations.\n\nAmazon blocked or removed more than 39 million offers and suspended more than 13,000 accounts for attempted price gouging last year and referred the most egregious offenders to federal and state law enforcement, according to the spokesperson.\n\nAmazon has worked with more than 40 state attorneys general to prosecute bad actors, and the company supports the idea of creating a federal price-gouging standard, he added.\n\nShop around\n\nRetail analyst Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, faulted U.S. PIRG for focusing exclusively on Amazon in its latest report and not looking more deeply at pricing changes on other big venues for third-party sellers like eBay and Walmart. You have to look across the whole industry to be fair, he said.\n\nIts report released last week built on earlier findings released in September that found escalating costs on Amazon while prices on the same product from Walmart, Target and others remain(ed) largely unchanged, the group stated, acknowledging it had not looked at other retailers in its most recent analysis.\n\nThe price of essentials like toilet paper and hand sanitizer did go up, partly due to companies dispensing with offers and deals to discourage volume buying amid product shortages, Saunders explained. Prices are often determined by supply, demand and underlying cost factors, he said.\n\nSaunders points out that no one is forced to buy anything, a sentiment echoed by U.S. PIRG's Brombach, who said: Our biggest advice to consumers is to shop around.
Julián Castro spoke with Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan from San Antonio, Texas, for the Jan. 13, 2019 broadcast.\n\nRead more interviews of 2020 candidates on Face the Nation here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: With dozens of Democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid on Saturday the former mayor of San Antonio, Julián Castro, became the latest candidate. Castro gained national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic convention and he was also secretary of housing and urban development during the Obama Administration. The grandson of a Mexican immigrant, Julian Castro has already been endorsed by a Democratic member of Congress, his twin brother, Joaquin. And Julian Castro joins us from the site of his announcement. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.\n\nJULIÁN CASTRO: Thanks a lot. Great to be with you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president visited your home state of Texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?\n\nCASTRO: What I believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That's a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know - and many of them have said - in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do? Would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?\n\nCASTRO: I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status, so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. And we- we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. So no, I don't agree with that. The other thing I'll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually the exact opposite happened. And so he's failed. He's a failed leader on this issue and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And it's just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been calling immigration system broken for some time and you were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?\n\nCASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You announced your candidacy today and almost immediately the RNC issued a statement. I want to read it here to you. It says, Julián Castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president. He was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being HUD secretary. This is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate. These are sharp words, but it's the first official attack on you. How do you respond and- and how do you explain why you are qualified to be Commander in Chief?\n\nCASTRO: Well first of all, I think they could just dust off those same words, you know they're going to use those kinds of words for every single Democrat that decides to run for president. I wouldn't put too much stock in that. I would just say to the American people directly, I've had executive experience. I've led one of the largest, most diverse cities in the country. I've led a federal agency at HUD and- and done some great work to expand opportunity. I know what it takes to ensure that we have a government that functions well and to help inspire people. I also have a life experience that I think resonates with a lot of Americans. You know I'm here in my neighborhood that I grew up in. Grew up in a single parent household, went to the public schools here in San Antonio. Was able to go to college and law school and to reach my American dream. And I am motivated to make sure that every American can reach their dreams. And then, I have a strong vision for the country's future. I want to make sure that in this century, this 21st century, that we are the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest and the most prosperous nation on earth.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're going to have a- a lot of competition for the Democratic nomination. It looks to be a very crowded field. How are you going to distinguish yourself?\n\nCASTRO: I'm going to articulate a very strong positive vision for the country's future. I'm going to get out there and work hard. I'm gonna make sure that I let people know what I've actually accomplished in the executive experience that I have. And I think that right now people are looking for a leader that can show they can get things done. Being a mayor is all about getting things done. And when I was cabinet secretary I got things done. They want government that functions well now and somebody that's trying to bring people together instead of tear them apart. So I'm going to go out there and make my case. And you know I'm under no illusion right now that- that I'm in the poll position or anything. I'm not a front runner but nobody who grew up here in these neighborhoods, including myself, has ever been a front runner. And I think in this country right now, that there are a lot of people who don't feel like front runners. And I'm going to go speak to them in this campaign.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well some of the things you outlined as part of your platform today, Medicare for all, universal access to prekindergarten education, a Green New Deal, these put you in the more liberal or progressive wing of the Democratic Party. So one of the challenges for you is how do you attract centrists or people who perhaps were alienated by the president but aren't comfortable with being so reliant on the government as their main provider?\n\nCASTRO: What I hear out there is that there are a lot of folks, a lot of people, who want us to invest in universal health care. There are a lot of people- even people that call themselves centrists that think of themselves as- as not necessarily- you know they wouldn't call themselves liberal. But a lot of people are ready for universal health care. I mean look at the polls. When- when it's polled you know it gets over 60, 70 percent of support--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Medicare for all you mean.\n\nCASTRO: And so I think- that's right. And I believe that this country is ready for that. Now you bring up the issue or one- one issue people bring up is OK well you know- of course, you know we're going to put forward a plan. And I'm sure people have other- have their own plans of how we would accomplish that. And I'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like Medicare for all would be easy. But I do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it. And so I believe it is worth it, that that fight is worth it. And whether people call themselves liberal or centrists or conservative, what they want right now is they want to know that- that you're coming at them straight and that you're being honest with them. And I'm going to be honest with folks.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what is that going to cost taxpayers? Because Bernie Sanders, when he ran in the last campaign, had a universal health care call and estimates showed it costing one point four trillion dollars a year. You gotta make some real changes there to be able to pay for it.\n\nCASTRO: No, you do. There's no question that it's going to take several things. I think it's going to take asking wealthier individuals to pay their fair share--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?\n\nCASTRO: --we've had basically the- the last 40 years. Well, I mean I think we've had the last 40 years essentially of- of lower and lower commitment on people at the very top. Same thing goes for corporations. We have corporations - multinational corporations - that are hardly paying anything in federal taxes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You want to increase the corporate tax rate?\n\nCASTRO: --we need to ask them to pay their fair share. I think that we can consider different ways, different proposals, to be able to raise more revenue from the wealthiest corporations. I also think it's interesting, Margaret, you know, that I'm here in a neighborhood that was built up like a not- a lot of neighborhoods by small businesses. Little convenience stores, little restaurants, little dry cleaners. And at the same time, that a company like Amazon, that is one of the biggest companies in the world, can get huge tax- tax breaks, huge abatements, and also only begrudgingly end up paying their- their employees 15 dollars an hour.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well how would you- how would you ask--\n\nCASTRO: We need to change that in this country.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: How would you ask those same people to pay for the Green New Deal you're calling for? Are you going to put a tax on gases and fossil fuels? How are you going to pay for that?\n\nCASTRO: Yeah, so I look forward during the course of- of this campaign to putting forward proposals on each of these things. And- and I think that- that a vast majority of the American people are ready for that.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We will be tracking you and your campaign and more details as you promise them there. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\nCASTRO: Thank you.
With nearly 40 million Americans filing their taxes this week, many are likely wondering: How much does the government need my money, anyway?\n\nThe answer: a lot.\n\nThe federal government took in $3.3 trillion in tax revenue last year. More than 80 percent -- $2.7 trillion -- came from individuals through either income tax or payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare.\n\nCorporate taxes kick in just 9 percent of the government's revenue. After the recent tax cuts, the share from Corporate America will go down even more. The Office of Management and Budget projects corporate income taxes will drop to just 5 percent of government revenue in five years.\n\nEstate taxes make up even less. Last year, less than 1 percent of the government's funding came from taxes on large inheritances (or, as the IRS calls it, taxes on your right to transfer property at your death). Now that the Tax Cut and Jobs Act has made more estates exempt, that tax will also be even less of a money-raiser.\n\nMore than three-quarters of the federal government's income last year came from individuals. The largest single source was the federal income tax; the second-largest was the payroll tax. Business taxes, excise taxes and estate and gift taxes made up the rest.\n\nIndividual income tax affects only half of individuals\n\nA relatively small population makes up the country's tax base: More than half of government revenue comes from just the top 5 percent of income earners.\n\nSome 76 million Americans have no federal income tax liability, according to the Tax Policy Center. That means they either earn too little to pay income tax or qualify for tax credits that cancel out their income tax payments.\n\nThe bottom half of earners together contributes just 3 percent of the total income tax revenue, according to a Tax Foundation analysis.\n\nIn economic terms, this is a progressive tax: Higher earners are taxed proportionately more. Many other taxes, like sales taxes, are regressive, meaning they cost poorer people more as a percentage of their income. Sales taxes are imposed by states, but the federal government has a version called excise taxes, which it levies on alcohol, cigarettes and gasoline. Excise taxes have fallen in importance in recent years, and today make up just 3 percent of government revenue.\n\nWith $3.3 trillion moving from individuals into the Treasury last year, it may surprise taxpayers to hear that the IRS, by its own estimates, isn't collecting all the tax it can. The agency calculated the so-called tax gap two years ago, and it found that it collects about 82 percent of the tax that is actually owed. Americans who fail to file taxes, don't report income to the government or report less than they earned cost Uncle Sam $406 billion in 2010, the most recent year for which detailed analysis is available.
Global stock markets were falling fast after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero Sunday evening to help blunt the economic damage from the fast-spreading novel coronavirus. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell called the actions strong measures but the emergency rate cut — the second in two weeks and an unusually large one-percentage-point cut, at that — seemed to unnerve investors.\n\nStock-market futures indicated the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 would be sharply lower when stocks begin trading in the U.S. on Monday morning. Those futures began dropping almost immediately after the Fed announced the rate cut on Sunday. The central bank also said it was upping what's known as purchases of Treasuries and other bonds by $700 billion, a policy known as quantitative easing, to encourage lending by financial institutions.\n\nThe Fed's latest move does not change our expectation that the economy will slow dramatically in the near term, Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics, told investors in a report after the Fed's rate cut.\n\nStocks cratered in Europe, with shares in Paris plummeting 9%, Spain 8.7%, Frankfurt 7.8 percent and London and Milan 7.6%, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nOn Asian markets, shares in Hong Kong were down more than 4%, China's mainland Shanghai exchange index lost 3.4% and Japan's Nikkei index was 2.5 lower in Tokyo, despite moves by the central bank there to prop up the economy, AFP said.\n\nStocks in Australia nosedived 9.7%, indicating investors there are concerned the coronavirus will continue to slow economic activity in China as well as throughout the region.\n\nSome Wall Street economists were optimistic that the Fed's emergency moves could save the economy from sinking into a prolonged recession, and even spur a market rebound later this year.\n\nBroad fiscal spending and rate cuts are blunt instruments for dealing with the short-term economic impact of the virus, but should provide investors with some confidence that growth can be strong once the recovery gets underway, Mark Haefele, a chief investment officer at UBS's wealth management division, said. We expect the market to end the year at much higher levels than today.\n\nBut that optimism was not widely shared. Bank of America's top U.S. economist, Michelle Meyer, predicted Sunday that the Fed's moves would be not be enough to arrest an economic slide driven by restrictions on public activity.\n\nBusinesses are shutting doors globally and households are moving into quarantine, Meyer wrote in a note to clients on Sunday night. We are already forecasting negative GDP growth in the second quarter but the risk is that it proves to be a much deeper and more prolonged contraction in economic activity.
MIAMI -- Miami Fraternal Order of Police President Lt. Javier Ortiz has been reassigned, removed from the street and placed on desk duty without his gun, CBS Miami reports.\n\nThe disciplinary action stems from a video shot by civilian Claudia Castillo, in which she captured her pursuit of Miami-Dade police officer Daniel Fonticiella. When she finally stopped him, she gave him a classic police lecture. Thousands of people viewed the video.\n\nOrtiz apparently didn't agree with her social media shaming of Fonticiella. Ortiz posted her personal information on his social media accounts. He also posted several photos of Castillo, including a few of her driving a boat with a beer in hand. One of the pictures included the caption, Nobody is above the law except me when I'm driving.\n\nOrtiz's action prompted internal affairs to investigate. After 10 months, they found he violated the rules, but only reprimanded him.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 21, Miami's Civilian Investigative Panel (CIP), which looks into police complaints, found Ortiz guilty.\n\nLt. Javier Ortiz has been relieved of duty and administratively been reassigned with pay pending a court date of a restraining order signed by a judge, police said.\n\nThe CIP reprimanded Ortiz and said he'd broken department policy by posting her personal information, but that was the most they could do.\n\nBoth Ortiz and Castillo were at the CIP hearing at which Ortiz was disciplined. Documents later filed in court reveal that she feared for her safety after testifying.\n\nOn March 21st, 2017, I was at the Civilian Investigative Panel hearing where Javi Ortiz was found guilty of Harassment, Discourtesy and Improper Procedure toward me, Castillo wrote the court. Javi was obviously angered by the decision, and when I attempted to leave City Hall, he followed me toward the parking lot. Javi was visibly upset and was stopped by several individuals including police officers who were present. I had to be escorted to my car because I was in fear for my safety.\n\nOrtiz posted Castillo's personal information after she confronted a police officer who was speeding CBS Miami\n\nThe next day, Castillo filed for an emergency restraining order against the union chief.\n\nHe is a lunatic with a gun and badge. And I fear for my safety. And I don't have a gun or a badge. I don't have anything to protect myself with. And the people who are supposed to be protecting me are on his team, she said.\n\nSpeaking to CBS Miami by phone Friday night, Castillo explained she had no choice but to get the restraining order.\n\nThis scared the crap out of her. It was obviously harassment. He was intimidating her, said Danny Suarez, a candidate for the Miami Commission.\n\nSuarez, who used to sit on the Civilian Investigative Panel, says he escorted Castillo out. He claims Ortiz was doing everything he could to mess with her.\n\nHe is an evil man. He will attack you left and right. This is a guy who tried to boycott Beyoncé for God's sake, he said.\n\nOrtiz's attorney denied any harassment.\n\nToday is just another attack on him because he's a strong leader for his men, said Robert Buschel, Ortiz's attorney.\n\nIn fact, Buschel alleges this may not be about Castillo at all.\n\nCBS Miami obtained a 2012 Miami Police Department incident report which describes a confrontation between an intoxicated Suarez and Ortiz outside a club. The officer wrote that Suarez shouted profanities at Ortiz and said I'm going to get you fired.\n\nWe are going to investigate that. It certainly is a lead we are going to follow up on. And that report explains a lot, he said.\n\nSuarez says he had no recollection of that conversation and that the report is a fabrication.\n\nCastillo maintains Suarez had nothing to do with her restraining order.\n\nI have reason to fear, you know, Castillo said. And nobody has had to coach to me to feel the fear that I feel.\n\nOrtiz is sidelined until an April 5 hearing on the restraining order. However, Ortiz's attorney has filed emergency motion to move the hearing up, so it may happen sooner.
Stocks suffered a second straight day of punishing losses, briefly shutting down markets amid growing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus. The Dow closed down 2,353 points, a 10% loss for the day. That marked the biggest single-day percentage decline for the index since the infamous Black Monday crash on October 10, 1987, when stocks tumbled 23%.\n\nInvestor were pummeled early on Thursday when the S&P 500 fell 8% only minutes after markets opened, temporarily halting activity. The index has three circuit breakers that kick in when stocks decline by 7%, 13% or 20% in a single trading session. It's the second trading halt this week, following a rout on Monday. The measures were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week hadn't been tripped since 1997.\n\nWe're starting to get a sense of how dire the impact on the economy is going to be, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, alluding to efforts to contain the virus. Each day the news doesn't get better, it gets worse. It's now has hit Main Street to a more significant degree.\n\nAlthough stocks briefly revived in the afternoon when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York moved to provide more short-term funding to lenders, markets quickly thudded lower. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell more than 9%.\n\nBoth the Dow and S&P 500 are now in a bear market, meaning both indexes have fallen more than 20% below their peak last month. That has brought the record-long bull run that started in 2009 after the Great Recession to a screeching halt.\n\nThe plunge also suggests investors found little comfort in President Donald Trump's pledge in a Wednesday night speech to offer help to businesses and consumers, according to Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco.\n\nMarkets reacted negatively to what was perceived as a solemn but confused speech that placed blame on other nations, omitted to focus on immediate actions to relieve the most affected individuals, and lacked in concrete fiscal and health measures to address the economic and financial impact of the virus, he told investors in a research note.\n\nThe ban on travel from Europe to the U.S. for the next 30 days will deliver a massive hit to the travel and tourism industries in the U.S., Daco said. About 10 million visitors come from Europe to visit the U.S. each month.\n\nTravel stocks fell sharply on Thursday, with American Airlines tumbling 17%, Delta shedding 21% and United Airlines sliding 25%. Hotel chain Marriott declined 6%, while travel-booking site Expedia lost 15%.\n\nTax filing delay\n\nMr. Trump's fiscal approach to blunting the impact of the coronavirus is also raising questions on Wall Street. Part of his plan is a recommendation that the Treasury delay the April 15 tax filing deadline, which would provide relief to taxpayers who owe the IRS.\n\nA tax deadline delay may not help the workers who most need relief, given that taxpayers who typically owe the IRS are higher-income households, Daco pointed out. About 80% of taxes owed to the IRS stem from workers who earn more than $100,000 per year, while 50% are owed by people who earn more than $250,000.\n\nThere's also concern that a delay in the April 15 tax deadline could result in a delay in tax refunds, which many low- and middle-income taxpayers count on, according to Height Securities.\n\nThere is a concern among tax policy experts we have spoken with that a delay in tax filings could also delay the issuance of tax refund checks, which represent a significant source of income for many Americans, Height Securities noted.\n\nMr. Trump's measures failed to mention some of the remedies that investors believe could provide targeted relief to those most hurt by the disease, Daco said.\n\nFinancial markets were disappointed by the absence of concrete measures targeted at the most affected populations including paid sick leave, enhanced unemployment insurance, free coronavirus testing, enhanced supplemental assistance programs, and support for health care workers, he noted.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
A New Jersey man who authorities said was the ringleader in a scheme that raised more than $400,000 with a bogus tale involving a homeless veteran rescuing a woman from the side of a highway pleaded not guilty Thursday to federal charges. Mark D'Amico appeared in court in Camden to face an indictment handed up last week that charges the 40-year-old with a total of 16 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nD'Amico, former girlfriend Katelyn McClure and homeless vet Johnny Bobbitt have already pleaded guilty in state court, and McClure and Bobbitt have pleaded guilty to federal charges as well.\n\nAuthorities say the trio made up a story in late 2017 about Bobbitt giving $20 to help McClure when her car ran out of gas in Philadelphia. They gave newspaper and TV interviews and eventually raised more than $400,000 online. Authorities began investigating after Bobbitt sued the couple, accusing them of not giving him the money.\n\nThe federal criminal complaint alleges that all of the money raised in the campaign was spent by March 2018, with large chunks spent by McClure and D'Amico on an RV, a BMW and trips to casinos in Las Vegas and New Jersey.\n\nD'Amico's plea Thursday was entered by attorney Mark Davis. Last month, D'Amico pleaded guilty in state court to misapplication of entrusted property and will serve a five-year term under an agreement with prosecutors.\n\nGoFundMe spokesman Bobby Whithorne told CBS Philadelphia in December that all donors who contributed to this GoFundMe campaign have been fully refunded and the organization is cooperating fully with law enforcement.\n\nWe have a zero tolerance policy for fraudulent behavior, he said. If fraud occurs, donors get refunded and we work with law enforcement officials to recover the money.
Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos made the single-largest charitable contribution in 2020, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual list of top donations — a $10 billion gift aimed at fighting climate change.\n\nBezos, the world's richest person, used the contribution to launch his Bezos Earth Fund. The fund, which supports nonprofits involved in the climate crisis, has paid out $790 million to 16 groups so far, according to the Chronicle. According to the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, from March 18 through December 7 of last year, Bezos' wealth on paper surged by 63%, from $113 billion to $184 billion.\n\nThe sum total of the top 10 charitable donations last year — $2.6 billion — was the lowest since 2011, even as many billionaires vastly increased their wealth in the stock market rally that catapulted technology shares in particular last year.\n\nPhil Knight, who with his wife, Penny, made the second- and third-largest donations last year according to the Chronicle, saw his wealth grow by about 77% over the same March-to-December period. Knight and his wife gave more than $900 million to the Knight Foundation and $300 million to the University of Oregon.\n\nFred Kummer, founder of construction company HBE Corporation, and his wife, June, gave $300 million to establish a foundation to support programs at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. It was the fourth largest charitable donation of the year.\n\nFifth place: The Zuckerbergs\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, delivered the fifth-largest donation on the Chronicle's list: A $250 million gift to the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which worked on voting security issues in the 2020 election.\n\nZuckerberg, whose wealth nearly doubled to $105 billion in the March-to-December period according to Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, has been widely criticized and been called to testify before Congress for his company's handling of disinformation in the runup to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn the sixth spot was a $200 million donation made by Arthur Blank, co-founder of Home Depot, through the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, to Children's health care of Atlanta to build a new hospital in his name.\n\nNos. 7 - 10 on the Chronicle of Philanthropy's list:\n\n$100 million: Jeff Bezos gift to Feeding America COVID-19 Response Fund\n\n$100 million: Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan gift to the Center for Tech and Civic Life to ensure safe and reliable voting practices in the 2020 election\n\n$100 million: Stephen Ross, founder of Related Companies, a real-estate firm gift to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor to build part of the Detroit Center for Innovation\n\n$100 million: David Roux, co-founder of Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm, and his wife, Barbara, gift to Northeastern University to establish the Roux Institute\n\n$99.6 million: George and Renee Karfunkel, real-estate investors Congregation Chemdas Yisroel, gift to an Orthodox Jewish Synagogue\n\n\n\n$80 million: Bernard Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot, through his Marcus Foundation, gift to Shepherd Center to expand its neurorehabilitation hospital\n\n\n\n$65 million: Charles Schwab, founder of Schwab Financial Services, and his wife, Helen, gift to Tipping Point Community to build housing for people experiencing homelessness\n\n\n\n$63.5 million: Stephen Ross gift to World Resources Institute to support the Ross Center for Sustainable Cities\n\nBroader scope of beneficiaries\n\nDonors have broadened their philanthropic scope beyond the universities, medical centers and other organizations that typically comprise the year's list of top beneficiaries, according to the Chronicle. Joining the list of top beneficiaries of 2020, were a new environmental grant maker, a nonprofit dedicated to modernizing elections, a network of food banks, and a charity that builds housing for people experiencing homelessness.\n\nTwo billionaires who donated heavily to charity last year — MacKenzie Scott, Bezos' former wife, and Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter — did not make the Chronicle's list because no single donation of theirs was large enough to qualify. Rather than give billions to just one charity, both billionaires opted to make large donations to numerous causes.\n\nDorsey, whose current net worth totals $11.4 billion according to Forbes, announced in an April 2020 tweet that he would be donating $1 billion in equity to his Startsmall LLC to fund global COVID-19 relief. After we disarm this pandemic, the focus will shift to girl's health and education, and UBI, said Dorsey in his tweet.\n\nScott, whose wealth is valued at $57 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said in a blog post in December that she had increased her charitable donations for the year to $4.2 billion, in response to the wrecking ball effect of the coronavirus, which she also acknowledged substantially increased the wealth of billionaires.\n\nHer $4.2 billion was divvied among 384 organizations she describes in her post as having dedicated their lives to helping others, working and volunteering and serving real people face-to-face at bedsides and tables, in prisons and courtrooms and classrooms, on streets and hospital wards and hotlines and frontlines of all types and sizes, day after day after day.\n\nThe nation's 644 billionaires have enjoyed a staggering rise in wealth since the pandemic shuttered the economy in March, with the group gaining almost $1 trillion in total net worth, according to a recent analysis. The spike in wealth coincides with what some economists are calling a K-shaped recovery, with the rich regaining their footing while poorer Americans struggle with lost wages and jobs.\n\nIn February, the Chronicle will publish its list of the 50 biggest donors, which counts cumulative donations, not individual gifts.
The Environment Protection Agency's (EPA) inspector general announced Monday evening he would review employment records pertaining to Samantha Dravis, who resigned last week as the agency's senior counsel and associate director of its Office of Policy.\n\nIn a letter sent late last month, Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, asked the inspector general to investigate Dravis' employment record. According to Carper, Dravis did not attend work or perform her duties for much if not all of the months of November 2017-January 2018. Carper also wrote that he had been informed that Dravis was likely compensated as a full-time employee throughout that time.\n\nEPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox denied Carper's allegations last week. Samantha Dravis has been a senior leader at the EPA and has performed her duties faithfully for her entire tenure, Wilcox told CBS News' Arden Farhi. He continued, It is completely baseless and absurd to assert that someone with her responsibilities and office would have been away from her duties and responsibilities for months at a time, as alleged.\n\nBut in a response to Carper released Monday night, Arthur Elkins, the EPA's inspector general, said that his office had decided to conduct the requested review. Elkins added that while his office lacks what it considers adequate funding for its various assignments, we have determined that the issues raised are within the authority for his office to look into.\n\nLate Monday, Dravis released a statement denying the allegations. Senator Carper should be ashamed that he is responsible for the government resources that will be wasted investigating his baseless and categorically false accusations, she wrote. I am confident that I have worked more hours and accomplished more in one month at EPA than Senator Carper has accomplished during his year-long letter-writing campaign against members of this administration. I have never been absent from work for weeks at a time, nor have I neglected my duties during the time period in question.\n\nDravis added that calendar records and timesheets from the period in question will show that she worked full time. Agency sources said those documents would likely be made public later this week.\n\nThe Senate has a constitutional duty to conduct oversight of any administration, especially when presented with credible information from sources within an agency and amid numerous ethical failings on the part of its leadership, a spokesperson for Carper said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday. Senator Carper will continue to conduct appropriate oversight and looks forward to the outcome of the IG's investigation.\n\nPeople who were in regular contact with Dravis in November, December and January confirmed to CBS News that she was in the office regularly. A source close to Dravis said she took time off around Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nIn December, Dravis accompanied EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt on a trip to Morocco that is now part of a separate investigation into Pruitt's first class travel costs.\n\nPruitt has come under scrutiny for renting a room at a favorable rate from an energy lobbyist and authorizing major raises for two young aides without clearance from the White House. Sources tell CBS News that Dravis, who had been looking to move to the private sector for some time, had no involvement in the scandals, and submitted her resignation before those stories broke.\n\nIt has been an honor to serve in this role at EPA, and I am enormously grateful for the opportunity, Dravis told CBS News last week. I wish Administrator Pruitt and all of the public servants at EPA the very best.\n\nCBS News' Arden Farhi and Julianna Goldman contributed to this story.
A German shepherd is finally back home with his family Friday morning after United Airlines mistakenly sent him halfway across the world. Irgo was supposed to land in Kansas City with his owners on Tuesday, but United flew him to Japan instead.\n\nThat mistake came after an incident earlier this week when a dog died mid-flight after a flight attendant insisted it go in an overhead bin. It's been a costly week for United Airlines, but not just in terms of public relations. United flew Irgo back to the U.S. on a private plane, the average cost for a flight that is more than $90,000, reports CBS News' Vladimir Duthiers.\n\nDespite the mix-up, the Swindle family was all smiles as they reunited with their dog at the Wichita airport Thursday night.\n\nIt feels absolutely amazing to finally have him back. It's been a long four days, said Irgo's owner.\n\nKara Swindle and her family are relocating to Kansas from the West Coast, but when they went to pick up Irgo from the Kansas City airport on Tuesday, United Airlines gave them a different family's dog instead.\n\nI walked over to the kennel and I called his name. And up popped this Great Dane instead of my German shepherd. And it was just instant tears because this wasn't my dog and I had no idea where my dog was, Swindle recalled. It has been the absolute worst nightmare. We already have so much going on and then to throw this into it. I don't know how much more I can take.\n\nUnited transported more than 130,000 animals last year. Eighteen of those died and 13 were injured, a much higher rate than any other airline. United has apologized for the mistake but Swindle says it's not enough.\n\nI hope they somehow put into some policy that this never happens again, just so we can make sure that nobody ever goes through this again, because what I have felt these last couple days, I don't want any other dog owner to ever feel again, she said. Not knowing where your beloved pet is, it really is a nightmare.\n\nUnited Airlines is still investigating how the mix-up happened and have not released any new information. They say the dogs were switched during their connection in Denver. Swindle says that if they travel with Irgo again it will be on a boat, not a plane.
ATLANTA -- Cities all over America are competing to host a new Amazon headquarters and the jobs that go with it. On Thursday, Amazon whittled down the choices from 238 to 20.\n\nFinding a home for Amazon's second headquarters -- the company calls it HQ2 -- became corporate catnip to a frenzy of suitors coast to coast. American communities courted the company with gifts of land and tax incentives worth billions. Stonecrest, Georgia, proposed 345 free acres and even offered to change its name.\n\nDeliberations were secret, but Amazon had a type in mind -- a metropolitan area of more than 1 million people that's a hub for top tech talent.\n\nAtlanta touted its airport, highways and business climate. The city made Amazon's final cut.\n\nThe number of jobs and just how positively it could change the landscape of the city. It is a big deal, said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.\n\nThese 20 names on Amazon's new dance card fell heavily in the Midwest, Southeast and Northeast. Here's why: Amazon, the world's largest internet retailer, proposes spending $5 billion to build HQ2, and create up to 50,000 jobs that average $100,000.\n\nI would hope that cities don't enter into a bidding war, said Amy Liu, an urban policy expert at the Brookings Institute.\n\nLiu warns suitors that overspending is only one potential pitfall. Seattle, home of Amazon's world headquarters, has seen a surge in housing costs and traffic congestion.\n\nIt will stress the housing market, it will stress the wages in the community, including really leaving some parts of the community behind, Liu said.\n\nBut for the 20 finalists, the corporate courtship will only intensify in the weeks ahead. Here in Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal may call a special session of the legislature if necessary to come up with needed sweeteners to reel in Amazon.
The Senate will vote Tuesday afternoon on whether to block a Treasury Department proposal that would lift sanctions on three Russian companies, including Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer.\n\nThe companies are all owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who became the subject of U.S. sanctions last Spring. But the punitive financial measures, triggered by what the Trump administration called Russia's malign activities, had an almost immediate impact on the global aluminum market. Prices of the commodity surged, European allies warned of job losses, and American manufacturers complained about cost increases.\n\nIn response, the Treasury Department worked out a deal to remove three of Deripaksa's companies — Rusal, En+ and EuroSibEnergo — from the blacklist if he agreed to reduce his ownership stake to less than 50 percent.\n\nSenate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, however, says the deal isn't good enough, calling it weak and deeply suspect. He's leading the charge to bring the issue to a vote.\n\nThe senate must consider that Deripaska has deep ties to President Putin and his intelligence apparatus, organized crime and Mr. Paul Manafort, a subject of the Special Counsel's investigation, he said on the Senate floor Tuesday.\n\nUnder the law, the House and Senate have 30 days to consider the sanctions measure and try to block it. Friday is the deadline. Schumer is hoping he can convince enough Republicans to join him and scuttle the deal.\n\nI believe my Senate colleagues will see the wisdom of keeping the current sanctions in place, he said.\n\nBut many of America's closest allies disagree. In November, eight European ambassadors sent a letter to Schumer in support of de-listing Rusal and the other companies. The sanctions, they wrote, had destabilized the European aluminum market and put at risk an estimated 75,000 jobs.\n\nIt is crucial that the sanctions avoid unintended consequences for European companies, they wrote. The delisting will help preserve existing supply chains which would otherwise likely be rerouted to China, further strengthening its global market position in the industry.\n\nTuesday, the Irish Ambassador to the US Daniel Mulhall wrote an article warning that the sanctions could have negative, far-reaching foreign policy consequences for United States.\n\nThe wider ramifications of these sanctions for the European economy would, in my opinion, also be very damaging to transatlantic relations at this critical time when Europeans and Americans need to stand together in the face of rising threats to their shared values and interests, he wrote.
Among the flurry of executive actions that President Joe Biden signed in his first day in office is a requirement that people wear masks inside federal buildings, while Americans are being urged to wear facial coverings for 100 days. The idea is to contain the coronavirus and save lives, but there could be a secondary benefit: a boost to the economy.\n\nA national mask mandate could add $1 trillion to the nation's GDP, according to a recent UCLA study. That's because the spread of infections could be reduced to zero if used universally and in combination with other public health measures such as contact tracing, the authors found. Other research from researchers at Washington University in St. Louis found that communities where mask wearing was mandated benefited from a 5% boost in consumer spending as people felt safer to shop.\n\nBut the question is whether Mr. Biden's mask order goes far enough to make a measurable impact. The mandate doesn't require all Americans wear masks in public; rather, it applies only to federal buildings on federal lands and to federal employees and contractors. Meanwhile, the nation has a hodge-podge of mask regulations, with 37 states requiring people to wear masks while in public, according to the AARP.\n\nI am skeptical about whether this action covers enough workers to have a noticeable effect on the economy, said Raphael Thomadsen, professor of marketing at Washington University in St. Louis and a co-author of the study on consumer spending and masks, told CBS MoneyWatch about Mr. Biden's mask mandate. That said, any small effect is likely to be slightly positive.\n\nBut, he added, if more people start wearing masks because of Mr. Biden's order as well as heed his message that facial covering can help halt the pandemic, the impact could be more widespread — providing greater support for both public health and the economy.\n\nBottom line: Mask mandates are good for the economy and boost spending quite a bit, Thomadsen said. They are only a small piece in managing this pandemic and economic recovery, but given the cheapness of the approach, and the significant positive benefits on spread and spending, they are a no-brainer as far as policy is involved.\n\nPresident Biden's call for 100 days of mask wearing is a smart and practical approach, and one that we are proud to join. - Read the full statement from our President @SuzanneUSCC here: https://t.co/rRopMu4rvS — U.S. Chamber (@USChamber) January 20, 2021\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading business organization, said it supported Mr. Biden's mask mandate and the campaign for Americans to cover up for 100 days.\n\nWith 400,000 American lives now tragically lost, we must join together to fight the pandemic through multiple fronts: masks, social distancing and the vaccine, said Suzanne P. Clark, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a statement.\n\nThe pandemic has now killed more than 400,000 people in the U.S., reaching that grim milestone a little over a month since the death toll hit 300,000. The virus could kill half a million people in the U.S. by sometime in February, experts predict.\n\nThe renewed surge has stopped the recovery in its tracks. Hiring fell in December, its first decline since the pandemic first leveled the job market in April. Businesses in the first week of January continued to cut workers as they coped with rising infection rates, new restrictions imposed by cities and states, and tighter spending at restaurants, bars and other service-oriented businesses as consumers retreated indoors.\n\nOverall, the country still has roughly 10 million fewer jobs than before the virus erupted last spring. Hiring is unlikely to turn the corner until vaccines become widely available later this year, according to Oxford Economics. The economy will likely still be short of 4 million jobs at the end of 2021, Oxford Economics senior U.S. economist Lydia Boussour said in a January 12 research note.\n\nAmong the sectors feeling the most pain are those that rely on in-person services, like restaurants and hotels. As coronavirus rates inch up across the nation, cities such as Los Angeles and New York have tightened their regulations on restaurants to help slow the spread of the disease. Mask mandates could help consumers regain confidence in patronizing those and other businesses, research suggests.\n\nWe find that mask mandates do increase consumer spending by quite a bit: 5%, which is large as far as macroeconomic effects go, Thomadsen said. We find that they help out every sector of the economy that we can find, including accommodation and food services.
Even after the acquittal of the president, his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is pursuing allegations of corruption in Ukraine. This past week, Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department would carefully scrutinize what Giuliani finds. Last July, President Trump made the phone call to Ukraine that led to impeachment. He asked the president of Ukraine to investigate a mysterious Democratic National Committee computer server that Mr. Trump said was hidden in Ukraine. We have found that odd request is a story that has grown over the years and was influenced by Moscow. You may have wondered how the president was impeached over Ukraine of all places. The answer is in the story of the mystery server, a reminder that the U.S. and Russia have been on opposite sides of a war in Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2014.\n\nBill Taylor\n\nFew people understand what's at stake as well as Ambassador Bill Taylor. He led the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine as the Trump administration withheld military aid while pressing for investigations of Democrats.\n\nTaylor's testimony carried the weight of his resume; Westpoint, 101st Airborne in Vietnam, 33 years as a diplomat, and an expert on Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's security is important to our security and the reason I believe that is that Ukraine is on the frontline, Taylor told correspondent Scott Pelley. The Russians are fighting a hybrid war against Ukraine, but it's not just about Ukraine, they are fighting a hybrid war against Europe and against the United States.\n\nThe war that the Russians are fighting in Ukraine, Pelley said to Taylor, We have a stake in?\n\nWe have a stake in, but it's not just the military war, Taylor said. Hybrid war is more than tanks and soldiers. Hybrid war is information war, it's cyber war, it's economic war, it's attacks on elections and as we know they have attacked our elections.\n\nThe Russian attack on the 2016 election included hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee. U.S. intelligence agencies found, …the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton… Former deputy national intelligence officer and CIA Russia analyst, Andrea Kendall-Taylor worked on that report.\n\nThe report itself was based on a large body of evidence that demonstrated not only what Russia was doing, but also its intent, Kendall-Taylor said. And it's based on a number of different sources, collected human intelligence, technical intelligence.\n\nKendall-Taylor said the evidence is convincing and it isn't a close call.\n\nIf you read the intelligence report, it's the consensus view of three intelligence agencies; CIA, NSA and the FBI, Kendall-Taylor said.\n\nAndrea Kendall-Taylor\n\nThe same conclusion was reached by the Republican-led Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The committee's report on Russia interference was unanimously approved by all of its Democratic and Republican members. Democrat Mark Warner is vice-chairman.\n\nThe Russian project was a top down, government-run covert operation that hacked into the DNC and individuals' personal emails, and weaponized that information to release it at the most important times, Warner said.\n\nBut the idea that the Trump campaign was helped by Russia, even unwittingly, was a unanimous judgment Mr. Trump would not accept.\n\nAnd by the way folks just in case you're like, curious, no, Russia did not help me OK? Russia? I call it the Russian Hoax, Mr. Trump said at a rally in Alabama in 2017.\n\nMr. Trump began a campaign to discredit the intelligence community's conclusions. He tweeted, So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? In Mr. Trump's telling, the FBI failed to look for evidence on the Democrats' computer network. The story of the mystery server was born.\n\nSo how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017\n\nRobert Johnston dealt directly with the FBI as an investigator of the DNC hack for CrowdStrike, a leading cyber security company hired by the Democrats. He told us the FBI didn't physically examine the DNC servers because CrowdStrike gave the bureau copies of the data from the servers.\n\nIf there is a server or a computer system of any kind that's involved in the incident you can take an exact bit for bit digital copy of what's on that system. Now that digital copy is just as good as having the real thing, Johnston said.\n\nAs far as you know, the FBI got what it needed and what it wanted? Pelley asked Johnston.\n\nExactly and evidence of that is you don't hear the FBI complaining, Johnston said.\n\nRobert Johnston\n\nHe's right. A former senior government official, familiar with the investigation, told us the FBI would have preferred to work alongside CrowdStrike's investigators, but the Democratic National Committee decided to give the bureau digital copies of its servers instead. The official told us this was acceptable, in fact even typical in FBI investigations.\n\n...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017\n\nDisproven and paid for by Democrats Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election? @foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2018\n\nThe FBI used the data to help indict 12 Russian intelligence agents for hacking the DNC. But Mr. Trump's tweets persisted, Why did the DNC refuse to turn over its server to the FBI… and Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? There were more than 140 servers in the Democrats' network, but Mr Trump created an image of a single box of incriminating information.\n\nWhere is the server? I want to know, where is the server? And what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question, Mr Trump said in a press conference while standing alongside President Putin. My people came to me — Dan Coats came to me and some others — they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin shake hands during a joint news conference after their meeting in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, July 16, 2018. Reuters\n\nThat statement, letting Russia off the hook, forced President Trump to issue a retraction the next day. Through all of this, Vladimir Putin wasn't just standing idly by. He was working to shift blame away from Russia.\n\nWhat we can see is that Russia did what Russia does, and that is piling on, Kendall-Taylor said. They amplify those narratives in ways that then advance Russia's own interests.\n\nThey look for conspiracy theories that are already out there? Pelley asked.\n\nThey're picking up on elements or narratives that already exist in a society and amplifying those narratives that advance Russian interests, Kendall-Taylor said.\n\nThe interest of Putin was to drive a wedge between his enemy, Ukraine and Ukraine's most important ally, the United States.\n\nA successful, prosperous, Western-oriented Ukraine provides a direct threat to Putin's hold on power, Kendall-Taylor said. He can't have a successful Ukraine on his southern border, because then it demonstrates to Russians what is possible.\n\nTwo weeks after Mr. Trump's inauguration, Putin said, in a news conference, it was not Russia that helped Donald Trump but Ukraine that helped Hillary Clinton. Russian media and U.S. conspiracy websites began to spin suspicion of Ukraine. Ultimately, those rumors appealed to Mr. Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was working to discredit the investigations of Russian meddling in 2016.\n\nAnd there were concerns that there was another game being played, another channel that Mr. Giuliani was involved in, Bill Taylor said.\n\nBill Taylor and correspondent Scott Pelley\n\nAs head of the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, Taylor was frustrated that Giuliani was agitating for investigations that were never official U.S. policy. Taylor said no one at the State Department ever directed him to investigate whether there was a server in Ukraine because, no one took it seriously.\n\nNo one, perhaps, except the president. In 2017, for the first time, he added Ukraine to the story of the server. In an interview he said, Why wouldn't … Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.\n\nCrowdStrike? The reporter asked.\n\nThat's what I heard, Mr. Trump said. I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian...\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, shows that CrowdStrike is incorporated in Delaware and based in California. Its largest shareholders are American venture capital firms. Over the years, CrowdStrike has been hired by both the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nSo, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine, Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House in October 2019. I'd like to see the server.\n\nTaylor said that, to his knowledge, there are no links between CrowdStrike and anyone in Ukraine.\n\nWas this something that the embassy was concerned about? Pelley asked.\n\nNo, Taylor said.\n\nPelley asked Johnston if, during the investigation he was leading, CrowdStrike ever sent any of the DNC's computer hardware to Ukraine.\n\nNo, Johnston said. That-- that is-- that is insane. That is not within the realm of reality.\n\nLast July, reality suffered a final blow. The story Mr. Trump first adopted as a server the FBI was blocked from seeing, and then became the server investigated by a Ukrainian company, finally morphed into the server hidden in Ukraine. In the call, after the Ukrainian president asked for anti-tank missiles to defend himself from Russia, Mr. Trump replied, I would like you to do us a favor though… they say CrowdStrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people… The server, they say Ukraine has it. This was the first favor Mr. Trump asked for even before his request that Ukraine also investigate the son of Vice President Biden. This past November, Mr. Trump spoke, by phone, to Fox and Friends.\n\n\n\nThey gave the server to CrowdStrike or whatever it's called which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian and I still want to see that server you know the FBI's never gotten that server, Mr. Trump said. That's a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company, why?\n\n\n\nAre you sure they did that? an anchor on the show asked the president. Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine?\n\n\n\nMr. Trump replied, Well, that's what the word is…\n\nThe word, that Ukraine was involved, was amplified by the president's defenders in the impeachment inquiry. They pointed to a 2016 opinion article and social media posts, written by Ukrainians, that were critical of Mr. Trump, as though they were equivalent to Russia's covert campaign targeting U.S. computer networks, voting systems and social media. Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump's former senior director for Russia on the National Security Council, warned the committee.\n\nSome of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country—and that, perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did, Hill said. This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.\n\nWhat are the chances that this whispering campaign about a Democratic National Committee server in Ukraine is actually a Russian intelligence operation, a Russian disinformation operation? Pelley asked Taylor.\n\nThe Russians are very good at that, Taylor said. It's these fake stories that they have propagated. And that's what they do. They do it pretty well. We have to be on guard against that.\n\nFrom Vladimir Putin's perspective it worked. Last November, as impeachment played out and America's next election season was underway, he said, at a forum, Thank God no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine.\n\nWe reached out to the White House multiple times on this story, but they did not respond.\n\nProduced by Maria Gavrilovic and Alex Ortiz.

Washington — The Trump administration announced on Wednesday it will require Brazilian asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for the duration of their U.S. immigration proceedings, subjecting the first non-Spanish speaking population to the controversial Remain in Mexico policy.\n\nThe move to send Portuguese-speaking migrants to Mexico represents the latest expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program, a policy being challenged in court that has drawn scathing criticism from advocates but which the Trump administration credits for a sharp drop in apprehensions of migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border in the past seven months. Up until now, the U.S. had generally not subjected Brazilians and asylum-seekers from other non-Spanish speaking countries to the MPP program.\n\nMore than 57,000 asylum-seekers from Central America, Cuba, Venezuela and other Latin American countries who would otherwise be in the U.S. have been sent to northern Mexico, where they are often stranded in overcrowded shelters and squalid makeshift encampments, including in crime-ridden cities like Ciudad Juárez and Matamoros, located in a region the U.S. government warns American travelers not to visit due to rampant violence.\n\nThe Trump administration has hailed the policy as a successful tool in curbing migration and Wednesday's announcement is likely designed to deter U.S.-bound Brazilian migrants, who typically journey through Central America and Mexico to reach the U.S. southern border.\n\nIn a statement announcing the move, the Department of Homeland Security said the number of Brazilians reaching the U.S.-Mexico border tripled in just the last year. Border Patrol apprehended more than 6,300 Brazilians between September and December 2019, according to Customs and Border Protection statistics that showed people from Brazil made up the fifth largest group of apprehensions in that time span after migrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.\n\nHaving an outlet for (Brazilians) to wait outside the U.S. for their immigration hearings is super-helpful! Ken Cuccinelli, the second-highest ranking official at DHS, wrote on Twitter, thanking the government of Mexico for accepting the change in policy.\n\nToday is the one-year anniversary of the first person actually waiting in Mexico under MPP, aka, the remain in Mexico program. And on today's 1 year anniversary, the first Brazilians were returned to Mexico to await their U.S. Immigration hearing. Adding Brazilians is BIG! — Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli (@HomelandKen) January 29, 2020\n\nBuzzFeed News and Reuters first reported that officials were planning to subject Brazilians to the MPP policy.\n\nDespite the praise from the Trump administration, advocates and even some of the asylum officers implementing the program have strongly denounced the Remain in Mexico policy, saying it violates international obligations against returning migrants seeking refuge to dangerous places. The group Human Rights First has denounced hundreds of reported kidnappings and assaults.\n\nA CBS News series last summer detailed the due process concerns about the policy, which makes it extremely difficult for migrants to secure U.S.-based lawyers generally needed for successful asylum claims. According to data by researchers at Syracuse University, only about 4% of migrants in the program have had lawyers represent them in proceedings in the U.S. — which, for many migrants, now occur inside makeshift tent-like courts in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nOut of nearly 30,000 completed cases in the program, only 187 migrants have been granted asylum or some other form of protection, according to Syracuse's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). Under an expansion of the policy in early January 2020, some asylum-seekers returned by the U.S. to Mexico will have to travel more than 340 miles by car through territory where cartels often vie for control of the drug trade to attend hearings in a U.S. immigration court.
INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT PAPE\n\nCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL\n\nPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBob, welcome to the show. It is great to have you.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nAnd great to be here, Michael. Thanks for having me.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYou're welcome. So I need to start with a disclosure. The disclosure is I am a member of the advisory board at your research institute which we affectionately call C-Post.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nThat's right.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI don't receive any compensation for serving on that board. But our listeners should still know of my affiliation. And the bottom line here is I carry a bias in favor of C-Post. And everybody needs to know that. Transparency's important. Bob, from my perspective, C-Post is a national security research center housed at the University of Chicago.\n\nBut, to me, it's a special type of national security research center. It does research on important issues. And it develops findings on those issues that have significant, timely application to policy, to intelligence and to law enforcement. And you share this research, I know, with the government in a variety of ways. And I think it's this relevance that makes C-Post so unique and so special and just want to get your sense whether you agree with that and anything else you want to add about the center.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nThank you, Michael. And thank you very much also for serving on our board because the truth is, this isn't just research for research's sake. It's research to matter. And it should matter to our government. There are a number of issues in national security affairs that turn on things that no matter how good our CIA is, no matter how good our government is, they just can't drill into because they're about human beings and how human beings operate such as the motives of suicide terrorists.\n\nSo my first work which started C-Post, I collected the first complete database of all suicide attacks around the world. And it made a prediction. It said if we invaded and occupied Iraq, we would touch off the largest suicide terrorist campaign in modern times.\n\nEven before the work was published, I gave that prediction to Paul Wolfowitz, then, our Deputy Secretary of State in October 2002. Now, of course, we still did the Iraq war. But he did move all of our forces out of Saudi Arabia, started an airbase in Dela, 2004. And also in February 2004, the DOD was the first funder of C-Post which was, then, the Chicago Project on Suicide Terrorism, now the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. And we have been doing wave after wave after wave of policy-relevant research not to duplicate what happens in government but to augment and do things where we can answer some questions especially about how human beings operate that others can't.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhich is a great transition because there's two specific threads of your research that I really want to drill into and talk about. And the first is what you call the American face of ISIS. So tell us about that research and its findings.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nYes. A couple years ago, we got a research project to figure out what inspires people about ISIS propaganda in the United States. Well, we had to start by finding out who was inspired by ISIS in the United States. So we collected the complete set of all individuals who were indicted in U.S. courts or who carried out attacks in the name of ISIS since the ISIS movement began in 2014. That's well over 150 cases. And we have court documents, detailed evidence about who they are.\n\nWell, something jumped right out at us, Michael, that was just super crystal clear which is the core pool of who was attracted to ISIS today and other militant groups has changed fundamentally since 9/11. On 9/11, the 19 hijackers who attacked us and killed 3,000 people that day were all born overseas and radicalized overseas.\n\nThink of them as immigrants. Well, that was the case for Al Qaeda in general. They were well over two-thirds immigrants. And so it was very reasonable to think immigrants were somehow a threat. ISIS is the opposite. Over two-thirds of the ISIS recruits are born in the United States. That other one-third that's not born in the United States, they've been in the United States, many of them, for decades -- no Syrian refugees. It's not--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI think only two refugees in total. Correct?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nTwo refugees in total, an Iraqi and a Bosnian who had been in the country many, many, many years. So they were born in the United States or radicalized in the United States. ISIS did this with video propaganda using the internet to infiltrate videos directly into our homes in Chicago, in the east coast, in the west coast, in the south. This was a fundamentally new threat. We are not waging a war like we did on 9/11. And we've gotta stop fighting the last war.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd to show its application to policy, what does the research on the American face of ISIS mean for something like the Muslim ban?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nIt means, at best, the Muslim ban is irrelevant because if the threat is fundamentally coming from inside, then, banning Muslims from overseas who are not actually causing the threat will, at best, be irrelevant. But it's actually a little worse than that because in ISIS's propaganda that they use to mobilize people already in the United States, they use the travel ban as evidence that it's stage one in a cleansing campaign against Muslims in the United States.\n\nSo it's not just the travel ban the way often we talk about it as, like, a border wall issue or something related to our politics, you know, Democrat, Republican. This is a security issue. And the bad guys are using the Muslim ban to recruit.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay. The second research thread is what you call the ISIS Propaganda Revolution. And this is the one I really want to spend some time on which is, basically, the story of how ISIS has been able to recruit so many Americans. So walk us through that research and its findings.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nSo we have long known that ISIS has been using propaganda. But most people have thought about that propaganda as slick. It's video. It's kind of modern. Somehow it has music associated with it. What I discovered when I got into this, basically, with meetings at the National Counterterrorism Center, is that there were precious few people actually studying the content of the propaganda, why it was so voluminous.\n\nThere were over 2,000 ISIS videos alone. That's 33 solid days of video watching. Well, we at C-Post decided to conquer the content problem and to really get inside what was actually being shown and that people were watching. And what we discovered is that there are narratives not just a theme, but a trajectory of a storyline that ISIS used that no Islamic group, and I've been studying Islamic groups now for over 20 years, no Islamic group has used before.\n\nSo the standard Islamic narrative, it's called, is a narrative where there's a community in peril, the Muslim community. You identify who the attacker is, typically the west. And, then, you identify that you're going to attack the attacker.\n\nAnd it's your duty as a good Muslim. And to be sure, ISIS still has that narrative. But that presupposes you really care about the Muslim community already. What ISIS did is they decided to go for a different mobilization pool, a different pool of people who may have very loose ties to the Muslim community and not know any Muslims hardly at all.\n\nAnd what they did is they took a page right out of the Hollywood, right out of our blockbuster superhero movies called the heroic narrative. And what they did is they focused on a narrative how an ordinary individual can become super empowered to help a community that he or she doesn't really even know. And think of Wonder Woman, she didn't know the people she was helping. And it's because they see their own personal power coming to floor. They're conquering their own inner demons by doing that.\n\nWell, that's a narrative that Hollywood has honed for over 25 years. There are books. There are writers who have specialized in this. And ISIS has taken that, we call it the heroic narrative, to tap into people who are especially prone to take risks.\n\nAnd what we discovered is they especially tapped into a pool that Al Qaeda had not tap into before in the west, criminals, people who have a prior history of incarceration or other backgrounds associated with violence.\n\nThis is a pool of individuals that Al Qaeda did not embrace. And we know this now with great detail. So we can compare who was an ISIS perpetrator versus who was an Al Qaeda perpetrator in the United States, apples-to-apples comparisons.\n\nAnd we can see precious few with a criminal record for Al Qaeda, those couple that do exert no motives here associated with wanting to have personal power. With ISIS, we see a lot more criminals. We see them with people who have very little background either by family or otherwise to the Islamic community. We see them coming out of prison. And we see them with people who are really caught by the idea they can be empowered to do things in the special world of ISIS they can't do here like behead people.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So can you give us an example of one of these heroic narrative on videos?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nYes. So a good example is this video called Abu Muslim. Abu Muslim, the video came out in the summer of 2014. And it's a story. It is a story of an individual who's a Canadian who goes from being an individual, is not born in an Islamic family. He's not Islamic.\n\nHe becomes a convert. He has a criminal background. And, then, through the course of the narrative, he evolves into being what they call in the video one of the few of the few of the few who can really stand up and be brave in the glorious battles to win against all. And this, Michael, looks a lot like our recruiting videos for some of the military.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSounds like the marines.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nIt's the marines. It's a Be all you can be, here. But it's special. The point of this video, the Abu Muslim, is not every Muslim can do this. Not every person can do this. You are one of the few of the few of the few. And that's what you're gaining glory for as you go forward.\n\nFlames of War, that's another very famous video which many of these perpetrators have watched. And we know this from their self-reporting. This is recounting glorious battle and the enthusiasm of the fighters as they feel these glorious battles coming into fruition. Other perpetrators point to beheading videos. They want to be the person that is, I'm sorry to say it so blatantly, cutting off the head. And that's because that's something they can't do in their ordinary world. But ISIS gives them, essentially, a permission or the world in which they can act out these urges.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd thereby, be the hero.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nAnd thereby, be the hero in their own minds.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo but we don't know, right, how ISIS stumbled onto this? Right. Did they actually read these books that Hollywood writers have written over the years about, Here's how you tell a story? Or did they just watch, you know, western movies and say, Hey, here's a pattern that makes sense for us? We don't know. Right?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nWe actually don't, Michael. And the truth is the books-- so there's a man very famous screenwriter in Hollywood who's a Disney executive called Chris Vogler. And in the early '90s, he wrote a very important book on the screenwriting of the heroic journey which he's had, essentially, effectively, students. This is now in-- I just mentioned Wonder Woman. So it's almost in every one of the blockbuster movies in some form or other. And so it doesn't really matter whether they got Vogler's book. It doesn't really matter whether it's coming from Vogler's followers. It doesn't matter whether it's just watching the moves. The key point they're seeing is they're stealing western ideas to recruit people who don't have strong ties to Islam. And they're just living right in western society so that it's not like western society--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBecause I, then, wanted to ask you that because one of your findings, right, is that it's especially appealing to converts to Islam and to people with prior criminal records. You've explained that second piece, right, why it's so appealing to people with prior criminal records. But why is it so appealing to recent converts?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nWell, we have to be honest. Right now, we can't say 100% for sure because one of the things we want to do next, Michael, and we're working with the FBI to do this is we would like to be able to interview, in some depth, some of these individuals to find out a little more. Now, to give you some answer, at a surface level, there's a transformation that has occurred with converts from the pre-convert stage to the post-convert stage which, at least on the surface, tracks with the transformation of an ordinary person going through that heroic journey that I just mentioned to you.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, this is one of those issues where we've done more than scratch the surface. But we haven't been able to give, like, final answers to every little corner. And that's one of the reasons why we're not stopping. We're in the middle of the research not at the end of the research. And one of the things we want to do is sort of learn a little more because we'd like to find out just how important it is that you are a convert because not all of them in our sample fit that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo how easy it is to actually go interview all these people? Do you need the FBI's permission to do that?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nNo. It's not that. You need the prison warden's permission. So we've actually been in touch with the key parts of the prison system, the U.S. prison system here and worked with their behavioral psychol-- they have people with PhDs who overview requests like the kind we make.\n\nAnd we have tried. But fundamentally, it's an issue of explaining the importance of our study to, essentially, the wardens because if you have myself and my team come in and even though it's just, say, a two or three-hour interview but we need to do it, like, a few dozen times, that can be somewhat disruptive. Now, it's not hugely disruptive. But it would be, you know, more than just coming in and doing a half hour interview. And so they have to really be persuaded that it's valuable here for them to have a modest degree of disruption.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd where are you in that process of having that conversation with them -- because this is really important?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nWell, so just before I came in, I'm working with the FBI. I'm planning on coming back to Washington to brief FBI HQ on the stuff that we're talking about here in more depth. I've already briefed their field offices here. And one of the big issues here is trying to have them find value in that further stage of the process.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBob, one of the big changes over the last two years has been the loss by ISIS of its caliphate. Right?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nHave we seen a corresponding decline in ISIS propaganda? Or is it less so? Is it still out there? What's your sense?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nSo two answers to that. First, once propaganda has been produced, it's almost impossible to destroy. The internet was built to survive nuclear war. It was built for that information not to be destroyed in the event of a giant nuclear holocaust. And what that means is all the efforts to try to censor the internet, all the efforts to try to stop it, they can only go so far. So the information that's out there is effectively out there.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo there's hundreds of different narratives that you talked about.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nAre there.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThey're out there. What about new content?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nNew content has shrunk tremendously as the sanctuaries have shrunk. So one of the things that we have discovered is that there is a correlation which many people are finding surprising because when we think about the internet, we think about things that we can do in a small office here.\n\nAnd you and I are just sitting in an office. And this is about to distributed over the internet. And there's only just the two of us. Well, what we're discovering is there's a close correlation between the loss of the Wilayahs, they're called, the provincial level areas of ISIS and the production from those provincial areas so that it looks from what we can see, is that as we have shrunk the sanctuary, we've also shrunk the production capability of the propaganda and done so in a surprising way. People that I've been showing these to are just really stunned that, well, I thought we could just do this anywhere. I didn't know we needed--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. Pick a computer up and take it to Afghanistan instead of Syria or Iraq.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nThe analogy I use is C-Post. So we now have five offices. We have 40 people who work. And the truth is we could not have anywhere near the production and analysis if we tried to distribute that across the United States with 40 people. Having them all come together, I have a research director, Kevin Ruby, having it organized and centralized, we're using the internet, of course. But I think we're discovering that there is some propaganda production that is seriously lost as the sanctuaries decrease.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo the other question, then, is that ISIS, as you know, is not the only jihadist extremist group out there. There are others. So are those others learning from ISIS?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nYeah. So the key answer is yes with two groups. So one is Al-Nusra. So Al-Nusra is a group that is not thought to be currently in conflict with the United States. In fact, we have worked with Al-Nusra. But there are Al-Nusra videos which have adopted and taken hook, line and sinker the heroic journey to attract Brits to come to Al-Nusra. So this is something that's really important to see that there has been a genie that's let out of the bottle. And other groups are starting to-- we're also--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo the point of the Al-Nusra is come to Syria to fight with us?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nIt is, at this point, to come to Syria to fight not to stay in Britain and attack. But that's a later stage in asking them what to do. The first step is recruiting people who wouldn't ordinarily be recruited. And that's the danger part because it's the fighter who's the danger here more than anything else.\n\nSo we need to see that these militant groups, it's not their technology that's a danger. It's their fighters that are the danger. Those are the people that have to execute things and carry things out. So that's why I put a lot of emphasis on the fighters. Al-Shabaab's another story, more development here in especially--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAl-Shabaab in Somalia.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nIn Somalia. They are fast becoming number two in terms of producing video recruitment. But what I have to tell you, Michael, is that we need to take the study that we have done here focused on North America. And we need to replicate this in other areas of the world because the narratives that we've discovered, these, again, trajectories of story plots that are attracting specific sub-pools of individuals. We need to do that kind of analysis in the Middle East, in Europe and even in Africa.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd do you think it might be different in different places?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nIt could well be because the recruitment problem in, say, Iraq is different. So the recruitment problem, and we started to see this in some of the ISIS Arabic videos, the recruitment problem for somebody who already is a Sunni living in Iraq is do they side with the Iraqi government? Or do they side with ISIS?\n\nWell, that's a very different problem than you have inside the United States. And what we're seeing is we're beginning to see what we think of is possibly a third narrative structure that's specifically trying to focus on switching sides. And that's something that's very important because a lot of the way we fight terrorists around the world is try to embrace and partner with local groups.\n\nWell, the bad guys are figuring that out. And they're trying to figure out ways to undermine our strategy. And so that's why it's very important to start to take and replicate parallel studies to what we've done in North America in local regions and, then, also another western region which would be western Europe.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So Bob, just one more question which is you've talked about two areas of future research. Right. You've talked about interviewing the folks who are in jail here in the United States that have been inspired by ISIS to be understand that. And you've talked about doing a similar study abroad. What other research lies ahead?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nYeah. The most important third wave of research, our behavioral studies which are already underway which, in about six months, hopefully, we'll have the first results. I've partnered with world-class psychologists at the University of Chicago to take the video discoveries that we have and to show them to different audiences so that we can truly drill into what are the key elements, psychological or otherwise, that are at work. And these are also not just with doing surveys but with FMRIs and also EEGs so that as individuals are watching the videos, we're getting biofeedback to help us really precisely identify the triggers.\n\nWell, we're also doing this in not just Chicago but also Belgium. Belgium, as you know, is the highest per capita producer of fighters for ISIS, perpetrators for ISIS. And so that means we're doing it in French. So we have French language capability. We are producing the systematic studies. And this is a way to really bring together the narrative analysis and behavioral analysis.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo any early results from this that you can share or too early?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nThe number one result that we have is just a very basic result which is that these two narratives that I'm describing for you, the older Islamic narrative which we call the social narrative and also the heroic--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWas Al Qaeda's narrative.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nThat's Al Qaeda's narrative. And, then, ISIS is new narrative that it turns out with over 150 participants, it's not just Pape who thinks those narratives are different. It's not just some other professor who thinks it. It turns out they're fundamentally different for almost every audience who watches them.\n\nAnd they are not all muddied together. So that's very important because we're, now, proving not just asserting, we're proving there are two distinctly different narratives. And that that's how the viewers watch them. And so this is important if we're going to also, then, later on, and this is the next step, show that there's distinct pools who are attracted to one but not the other.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo I should've asked a question earlier. And I'm going to ask it now even though I said only one more question. (LAUGH) Does our understanding of how ISIS tells its story in these propaganda videos, does that give us insight into how we should push back against them?\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nIt absolutely does, Michael. So one of the reasons we're working closely with the FBI is I've been a supporter for over ten years of STING operations inside the United States. In fact, I'm one of the first terrorism people to support this because they do much better because these people who are inspired often reach out to a terrorist group in the later stages which creates opportunities to intercept them. However, the STING operations--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo they have no contact with ISIS. And they watch these videos. And they get inspired.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nAnd then reach out.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd they reach out.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nAnd they reach out. And we've known that now for a while. That was one of the things I discovered in 2006 here. So that's the first time I told this to the FBI. And so we've been doing quite a bit with STING operations here which is a tradeoff with surveillance because there's only so many people but to our good.\n\nThat's how many of those plots have been disrupted. Well, now, I'm working with the people doing the STING operations to show them the different narrative structures here. And they're finding them very, very helpful. It's not they don't have any inkling at all about this because they're, obviously, on-the-ground field agents, however, very helpful to see the clear patterns and the clear distinctions. So, number one, it's very, very important to improve how we deal with STING operations. Number two, it's very important for--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIn terms of what they say back.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nWhat they say back and also recognizing the different patterns. So we spend so much time in the media talking about Islamic militants as religious nuts, essentially, that we're expecting everything is infused with religion when, in fact, ISIS and other militant groups have since distanced themselves from heavy indoctrination with religion because religion doesn't sell.\n\nSo they're going for what sells, you see. Well, it's very helpful for the folks doing the STING operations to see how ISIS is trying to sell the product here in a tighter way. Also community leaders, so we've been holding conference at the University of Chicago with the city of Chicago police, local community leaders to also give them an education because, see, those folks are not going on the internet. They're not actually seeing this.\n\nAnd they, too, are just watching the little snippets on, you know, Fox News or CNN, you know, which is just focusing on all religion all the time and not really giving a picture of. So if you ask community leaders to try to intercede here, they don't know what the strategy is the bad guys are using to pull their people away, you see. So they're very, very important here.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBob, thank you for taking so much time to be with us.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nAbsolutely, Michael. Thank you.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt was great to have you on the show.\n\nROBERT PAPE:\n\nThis has just been a great pleasure. Thank you so much.\n\n* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *
The novel coronavirus continued to weigh heavily on financial markets Friday, though stocks were mostly higher in Europe after wild swings in Asia. Global stock market losses climbed past $16 trillion since a high on February 19 on fears that the outbreak could lead to a worldwide recession.\n\nEquities rose Friday in Paris, London and Germany but lost 6.1% in Japan. The Nikkei average had plunged as much as 9.5% earlier in the session, echoing Thursday's brutal 10% collapse on U.S. markets, the largest single day decline since 1987's Black Monday.\n\nFutures markets were also hinting that the bleeding might stop, at least for now. After initially indicating the Dow Jones Industrial Average would drop another 500 points, or about 2%, Friday morning and pointing to a similar drop in the S&P 500, Dow futures were up 745 points, or about 3.5% as of 5:23 a.m. Eastern time and S&P futures were 3.6% higher.\n\nA pessimistic Barclays note to clients Thursday night had its economists cutting their GDP estimates for U.S. growth for 2020, saying a recession could start as early as April. They predicted coronavirus hotspots, now largely in California, Massachusetts, New York and Washington, could spread to states that represent as much as 60% of the U.S. GDP.\n\nGoldman Sachs in a note to clients said it expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates a full percentage point when its policy committee meets next week.
NEW YORK -- After a weekend of sledding, snowboarding and staying put, the blizzard-blanketed Eastern U.S. will confront a Monday commute slowed by slick roads, damaged transit lines and endless mounds of snow.\n\nAuthorities cautioned against unnecessary driving, airline schedules were in disarray and commuter trains will be delayed or canceled for many as the work week begins after a storm that dumped near record snows on the densely populated Washington, D.C. to New York City corridor.\n\nMillions of Americans spent Sunday digging out of the snow after the mammoth blizzard sacked the East Coast, whose wide-ranging effects included more than two dozens deaths and mass airline cancellations.\n\nThe heaviest snow began falling Friday evening, and tapered off just before midnight Saturday for East Coast states. Millions heeded calls to stay home, enabling road crews to clear snow and ice.\n\nEven after many roads were cleared, cancellations and delays continued Sunday evening.\n\nHere's a look at the storm's impact and what to expect heading into Monday:\n\n___\n\nGETTING AROUND\n\nAirports began returning to normal on Sunday, and airlines intended to resume service at all Eastern airports by Monday. However, 80 flights have been cancelled for then. Travelers were being urged to check with their airlines before heading to Eastern airports.\n\nTravel bans that restricted non-emergency vehicles from streets all across the region were lifted, but mass transit services faced hurdles.\n\nIn New York, trains started running out of Grand Central Terminal but service on the Long Island Rail Road -- the nation's busiest commuter rail service -- was still suspended.\n\nOfficials for both LIRR and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said almost all mass transit services will be running in time for the morning rush hour.\n\nThe Port Washington, Oyster Bay, Port Jefferson, Ronkonkoma, Huntington, Babylon and Greenport branches will be back in operation effective at 5 a.m. Monday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, reported CBS New York.\n\nPartial service will also be available on the Montauk branch as far as Speonk, the MTA said.\n\nFor all the New Yorkers facing the task of digging their parked cars out from piles of snow, Mayor Bill de Blasio has a message: Don't.\n\nDe Blasio says New York City residents should leave their cars where they are if they can. He doesn't want people to put the snow from their vehicles back into the streets while the city is trying to clear up from the blizzard.\n\nThe city has suspended some parking rules through Friday so people won't have to move their cars.\n\nIn Washington D.C., partial rail and bus service would resume Monday -- for free -- at 7 a.m., officials said.\n\nCBS affiliate WUSA reports that the Metrorail will open with limited underground service on the Red, Orange and Green lines as follows:\n\nOrange Line: Ballston to Eastern Market only\n\nRed Line: Medical Center to Union Station only\n\nGreen Line: Fort Totten to Anacostia only\n\nAccording to Metro, trains will run every 20-25 minutes. Service levels may be upgraded as conditions allow. The system will remain open until midnight. Fares will not be charged on Metrobus on Monday, January 25.\n\nIn Philadelphia, where subways ran through the storm, transit officials began restoring bus and trolley services but most commuter trains were canceled Sunday. Officials said they expected those trains to be operating with delays on Monday morning.\n\nOn the roadways, a section of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Pittsburgh where hundreds of vehicles were stranded reopened in both directions Sunday.\n\nAmtrak operated some trains through the busy Northeast Corridor on Sunday and said they will continue operating a modified schedule on Monday.\n\nAnd traffic was moving again on highways that were shut down by the storm -- including those in Kentucky and Pennsylvania where motorists were stranded overnight.\n\n___\n\nSCHOOL'S OUT FOR WINTER\n\nMany schools canceled classes for Monday, despite the fortuitous weekend timing of the storm. District of Columbia Public School officials said schools would close Monday, as did Baltimore City Schools and the School District of Philadelphia.\n\nArchdiocesan high schools and Catholic elementary schools in Philadelphia will also be closed, CBS Philly reports.\n\nOther students were not so lucky: New York City's nearly 1 million public school students still have classes Monday, despite the record snowfall.\n\n___\n\nWORK WEEK\n\nFederal offices in the Washington area will remain closed on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management said Sunday that the cleanup from 2 feet of snow that fell across the region prompted the decision.\n\nThe office says emergency personnel and employees who work from home or other remote sites should follow their agency's policy.\n\nThe government shut down the offices at noon Friday ahead of the storm, and they remained closed Saturday and Sunday.\n\n___\n\nWHO GOT IT WORST?\n\nGlengary, West Virginia, can boast it took the storm's biggest blow: 42 inches. Several other spots saw more than three feet, according to the National Weather Service: 40.5 inches in Shepherdstown, West Virginia; 39 inches each in Philomont, Virginia, and Jones Springs, West Virginia; 38 inches in both Gainsboro, Virginia, and Redhouse, Maryland; 37 in Clear Spring, Maryland; and 36.9 in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nAmong major cities, New York got 26.8 inches in Central Park. The bulk of that -- 26.6 inches -- fell on Saturday, making that 24-hour period the snowiest on record, according to the NWS. The entire storm was the second-biggest on record for the city, falling just a tenth of an inch short of one from February 2006.\n\nWashington recorded 22.4 inches at the National Zoo. Philadelphia also recorded 22.4 inches -- exactly matching the average snowfall for the entire season.\n\nElsewhere, Baltimore got 16 inches; Richmond, Virginia, got 11.4; and Boston saw 8.2.\n\nThe blizzard also packed some serious winds, gusting up to 75 mph at Delaware's Dewey Beach and Virginia's Langley Air Force Base. Three spots in Massachusetts also tallied winds of 70 mph or more.\n\nThe usually bustling New York City looked more like a ghost town over the weekend. With Broadway shows dark, thin crowds shuffled through a different kind of Great White Way, the nickname for a section of the theater district. And Bruce Springsteen canceled Sunday's scheduled show at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn New Jersey, the storm that dumped as much as 3 feet of snow in places, raising floodwaters.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie said overall his state did well.\n\nWe are looking forward to a regular work week starting tomorrow, he said.\n\nWater receding slowly on bayside, but some roads still flooded & ice-covered. Please don't drive thru flood waters! pic.twitter.com/tNq44NpLOE — Surf City Police (@SurfCityPD) January 24, 2016\n\nAt least 20 deaths have been blamed on the weather nationally. In New York City, three people died while shoveling snow, police said.\n\nMonuments in Washington D.C., that would typically be busy with tourists stood vacant on Sunday. In the morning, the steps of the Lincoln Memorial had not been cleared of snow and looked almost like a ski slope.\n\nOnce the snow stopped, the timeline for digging out was unclear, D.C. emergency management director Chris Geldart told CBS News on Sunday.\n\nThat's the big question for everybody right now, Geldart said. It's a big question for us as well.\n\n___\n\nTHE DAMAGE\n\nThe blizzard's heavy snow, powerful winds and churning high tides collapsed roofs and inundated homes.\n\nA Pennsylvania church held a cyber-only service on Sunday after its roof collapsed in the storm. Pastor Lee Wiggins says it will take about six months to repair the $1 million in damages sustained by Calvary Fellowship Church in Downingtown.\n\nA historic theater in Virginia billed as Home of Virginia's Lil' Ole Opry was a total loss after its roof collapsed on Friday. The Donk's Theater opened in 1947 as a movie house near the Chesapeake Bay and was resurrected as a country music venue after closing in the 70s.\n\nIn Delaware, about a dozen people to be evacuated from the low--lying community of Oak Orchard.\n\nA Maryland farmer who thought he was protecting his cows from the elements by moving them inside lost part of his herd when the structure's roof gave way. Douglas Fink said he and his wife were getting ready to go inside the barn to feed the cows when the roof buckled.\n\nAlong the mid-Atlantic coast, water swept into some communities in New Jersey and Delaware. Restaurants along the Jersey shore were partially submerged by flood waters on Saturday -- one business owner said the water was waist-deep.\n\nThe water in Wildwood, New Jersey, is so high in some places cars still can't get through.\n\nMayor Ernie Troiano drove CBS News through the neighborhoods hit the hardest. He says this storms tides were higher than Superstorm Sandy.\n\nThis gets to be a real mess in here, he told CBS News' Jericka Duncan. There's hundreds and hundreds of cars that were caught in these tides.\n\nRestaurant owner Dave Bannon spent Sunday drying out. He said the water was up to a foot during the height of the storm.\n\nAt one point, more than 18,000 customers in Ocean County lost power. Most shore towns saw minor to moderate flooding.\n\nExperts say the weekend blizzard along the East Coast could have an economic impact of up to $850 million, with restaurants, theaters and other entertainment venues, and some retailers taking the brunt of the hit.\n\nBut one expert says that overall, the impact might be a wash because many businesses will have made extra money from people stocking up in advance on food, shovels and other items.\n\nChris Christopher, a U.S. macroeconomist at data firm IHS Global Insight, says other spending may just be delayed, like car buying and purchases of winter weather apparel, or shifted around. While retail stores and movie theaters were closed over the weekend, Christopher expects more people shopped online and ordered movies via Netflix or cable on-demand purchases.\n\n___\n\nSTORM DEATHS\n\nMore than two dozen weather-related deaths -- from car crashes, shoveling snow and carbon monoxide -- were reported by authorities.\n\nAmong the dead were a 23-year-old New Jersey woman and her 1-year-old son, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning after snow covered the tailpipe of their car. Passaic police said the woman's 3-year-old daughter was also hospitalized.\n\nA 44-year-old U.S. Capitol Police officer died of a heart attack after shoveling snow in front of his Delaware home on Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn Kentucky, a transportation worker died Saturday while plowing snow-covered highways. His plow slid into a ditch.\n\nAuthorities say a Pennsylvania man died after a passing snowplow trapped him inside his running car.\n\nThe Berks County coroner's office says 56-year-old David Perrotto died Saturday night after he was found inside his car in Muhlenberg Township, about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia.\n\nOfficials say Perrotto was apparently trying to dig out his car. Investigators believe he was either in the car to take a break or trying to pull out of the space when the plow came by and buried the car, blocking the exhaust and preventing him from getting out.\n\nAnother person trying to dig out their vehicle found Perrotto's running car.
The new House Speaker doesn't have high expectations for the President Obama's final State of the Union address.\n\nI'm sure he'll have a nice glossy rendition of the last six or seven years. I think he'll talk about what he inherited, how he made it better, House Speaker, R-Wisconsin, told a group of reporters and anchors over breakfast - his first time hosting what has been an annual tradition for House Speakers.\n\nAfter 70 straight months of job growth, Mr. Obama will likely declare that the state of the economy is strong. But Ryan doesn't see it that way.\n\nI think it's a mess, he said. I think the economy is very weak. I think if you look at wages, if you look at income growth, if you look at poverty, it's very weak. He has basically practiced trickle-down economics. Big government, top down, loose money from the Fed -- which helps those of you from New York, it helps the stock market really well, but it's not helping middle incomes.\n\nRyan also predicted that the president would ignore stubborn problems like wage stagnation. I think he'll paper that over. I think he'll put up a bunch of straw man arguments, which to me is the most intellectually lazy form of debate. But we're kind of used to it.\n\nForeign policy? That's a mess too, he said.\n\nThere are no red lines any more. Our word is not known to be what it used to be. The military is inadequately prepared and our word doesn't mean much anymore. You've got the Sunni and Shia at each other in the Gulf. You've got Putin kicking over countries. You've got the Chinese landing planes on islands they now claim, which they don't own. Everybody believes that there's no check on this. So I think it's a real problem, and our allies are very nervous.\n\nRyan, who argued that Mr. Obama has no plan to take on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, was asked what he thinks the president should do in Syria.\n\nNot to pass the buck, but the commander in chief is the one who is supposed to execute foreign policy. It's the commander in chief's job to come up with a plan, he responded. We're not supposed to have 435 generals coming up with our strategies. I asked whether his reluctance to lay out his own proposal had to do with the fact that there are no great options. There are awful options, because of bad decisions made earlier! We kept kicking the can, ignoring the problem, he responded.\n\nThe 45-year-old congressman from Wisconsin was asked which policy areas he things he can make progress with the White House this year. The list was short, and included criminal justice reform and appropriations bills.\n\nThere are bipartisan issues out there, but the silly season is about to start, he said, referring to campaign season, when the two parties often retreat to their corners, making cooperation more difficult.\n\nRyan said he's well aware that the president intends to lay out plans tonight to skirt Congress where he can. I expect him to do about five or six of these kinds of things over the course of the year....to stretch the limits of the constitution, to extend his reach beyond the separation of powers, beyond his powers in the constitution....This is what the progressives think. They think the Constitution is this living, breathing, malleable document that can move. Ryan said he's prepared to take on those executive actions any way he can. Will we be on the floor with legislation? Will we be in court? I assume all of the above.\n\nRyan took over the speakership in October, and this will be his first time sitting behind the president during a State of the Union address. He tried out the poker face he's been practicing on the reporters in the room, joking, I don't do that, I'm kind of an expressive person...I'm an Irish guy, that's just what we do! Lucky for him, he'll be sitting alongside fellow Irishman Vice President Joe Biden, who isn't known for his poker face either.\n\nRyan initially resisted taking on the Speaker's role, but relented at the urging of his fellow Republicans. Two and a half months later, he's glad he took the job.\n\nI like it better than I thought I would, he shared. The job is an honor. I'm honored that my colleagues didn't take no for an answer. And as soon as I resigned myself to doing it, my mind just pivoted over to enjoying it and doing it joyfully.\n\nHis suite of offices has a different look than it did when John Boehner was speaker - and that's out of necessity. Do you what it took to get that smell out of here? Ryan joked, referring to Boehner's well known smoking habit. It took about two weeks just to get it out of here. Two packs a day for five years is...you could smell it a lot. New carpets, new upholstery and a fresh coat of paint solved that problem. They wouldn't let him have oil paintings! Ryan told us. So he had to have photographs.\n\nBoehner also left behind a few cases of his cherished merlot, which isn't Ryan's drink of choice. So I'm thinking about giving gifts out to members who do good things. A bottle of Boehner Merlot every time they do something. So I'm trying to think of a prize.
Months before zero tolerance briefly became the law of the land, formalizing the separation of children from their parents at the southern border, employees in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services raised alarm bells about the scope of separations and the harmful effects on minors in the agency's custody.\n\nAt the highest levels in the agency tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children, those concerns were largely ignored, and employees were even warned not to put their concerns in writing, according to a scathing report released Thursday by the HHS Inspector General. Despite repeated warnings from within, the agency failed to prepare for what its own employees accurately predicted would be a result of family separation: overcrowding and lengthened time in custody for children, a population for whom each day detained is considered deleterious to long-term physical and psychological health.\n\nI said (the Office of Refugee Resettlement) was seeing much higher levels of separation, and that those separations were impacting particularly babies and young children. I said this so many times that I was called a broken record, one employee told the Inspector General.\n\nAs part of its zero tolerance crackdown to criminally prosecute border-crossing parents, U.S. immigration officials separated more than 2,800 families in the spring of 2018. Through a court mandate, most of them have been reunited. Last October, however, the administration revealed it had separated another 1,556 migrant children from their parents between the summer of 2017 and the time zero tolerance was fully implemented across the border.\n\nAnother employee told investigators she warned administrators about the harm separation might do to children.\n\nI told them it was going to traumatize children to separate them unnecessarily. I said that to anyone I could, the employee said.\n\nThe report follows a 2019 exposé by the same Inspector General that found the Trump administration began separating families far earlier than originally acknowledged, in 2017 just months after the president took office.\n\nIn Wednesday's report, investigators examined failures by HHS, which operates the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), to act on warnings and plan for the eventual wave of unaccompanied children — both separated and not — that would overwhelm the agency in 2018 and early 2019. The failures were identified through interviews with senior HHS officials and staff, employees at 45 care provider facilities and review of thousands of internal and interagency documents and emails, according to Thursday's report.\n\nORR staff believed that the UAC Program lacked the bed capacity to accommodate a large increase in separated children and were also concerned about the trauma such a policy would inflict on children. At several points before the zero-tolerance policy was implemented, ORR staff shared these concerns with the ORR Director, the Acting Assistant Secretary for ACF, and the Counselor to the Secretary for Human Services Policy, the Inspector General wrote. OIG found no evidence that these three senior HHS officials took action to protect children's interests in response to the information and concerns raised by ORR staff.\n\nThe response from administrators at ORR was to warn staff against raising these red flags. The Inspector General wrote that staff interviewed recalled receiving repeated, general reminders to be cautious about putting information in writing.\n\nThe Inspector General concluded that these repeated reminders to limit written information may have had a chilling effect on frank discussion about the possibility that larger scale family separation would occur.\n\nSome bosses indicated to investigators that they did not believe family separation would impact basic HHS services. The Inspector General wrote that the ORR Director during that era, Scott Lloyd, said a child that comes into ORR's care as a separated child is treated the same as any child referred to the program.\n\nThe former Acting Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, Steven Wagner, said separated children are not 'materially different' from other children entering ORR care, according to the report.\n\nOne HHS administrator told investigators they were torn. She conceded that it is not great for children to be separated from their parents, but criticized the parents who take the risk of crossing the border with their children.\n\nI do not know what the moral right thing to do is in this situation, the administrator, identified as the Counselor to the Secretary for Human Services Policy, said.\n\nShe also said they felt handcuffed in how to respond to family separations amid a wider law enforcement crackdown on immigration.\n\nThere was tension between HHS and law enforcement, she said, noting that HHS suggestions regarding immigration policy were sometimes interpreted as obstructing law enforcement efforts.\n\nOfficials also said the agency was focused on establishing a controversial memorandum of understanding that would allow sharing of biographic information between HHS and DHS. The agreement called for the fingerprinting of potential sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children — usually U.S.-based family members willing to take them in. It was scrapped months after implementation after officials concluded it led to a prolonged stay for minors in the agency's custody, while not sufficiently safeguarding their safety.\n\nEmployees told investigators their warnings that the memorandum, too, would strain the HHS system were ignored. They accurately predicted that it would dramatically slow down the process by which children were released, and increase the length of time in custody.\n\nThe results were catastrophic.\n\nBy the end of 2018, a system that had for years averaged a stay of between 30 and 45 days for children in custody, increased to an average of nearly 100 days. Meanwhile, the HHS system of facilities for children was pressed to its limits, forcing U.S. Customs and Border Protection — which is generally required by law to transfer unaccompanied children to HHS custody within 72 hours after apprehending them — to hold children for far longer.\n\nChildren that make it to HHS care receive comprehensive medical examinations within 48 hours of arrival. Some Border Patrol facilities were not equipped with even toothpaste and soap for children, and could provide only basic health care. Border Patrol stations, generally designed to hold single adults, also do not provide vaccinations. In late 2018 and early 2019, six children died in U.S immigration custody.\n\nIn a Thursday press briefing, Assistant Inspector General for Evaluation and Inspections, Ann Maxwell, said in response to a question from CBS News that child welfare should be the priority when HHS formulates policy.\n\nWe have to make sure that children's interests are prioritized and represented in decisions affecting a key program both internally discussions and decisions within HHS, Maxwell said.\n\nThursday's report also detailed how top HHS leadership was reluctant to play a vocal and active role in shaping immigration policy, seeing it as a task for the Homeland Security and Justice departments. The acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families division of HHS believed the department should not seek to affect immigration policy regardless of its impact on the UAC program and that it should adapt to whatever policies are put in place, the report said.\n\nOur participation in immigration policy is very limited and well-defined. Our job is to have a bed available for the next child that is brought to us by ICE or CBP. That is what our role is and what we focus on. Our role is limited to that, the acting assistant secretary said, according to the report.\n\nIn a response included in the Inspector General's report, Assistant Secretary for Children and Families Lynn Johnson defended the agency and said it was beholden to decisions made by other agencies.\n\nJohnson said HHS does not have a role in shaping upstream immigration enforcement policy... In some instances, the Department of Justice of DHS may not communicate with HHS for law enforcement or other legitimate legal or policy reasons.\n\nHHS' Administration for Children and Families said in a statement after the report was released that, We treat the children in our care with dignity and respect, and deliver services to them in a compassionate and organized manner while we work expeditiously to unify each one with a suitable sponsor.\n\nAs noted in the report, ORR is already taking steps toward implementing recommended changes that are within its statutory authorities, the agency said.
Starbucks wants people to know: Just because folks can now use its bathrooms without buying anything does not give all carte blanche to disrupt others.\n\nOr, as Starbucks Executive Chairman Howard Schultz recently told the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C.: We don't want to become a public bathroom.\n\nStill, the coffee chain is going to run that risk, in light of its new policy of opening its space to all, whether paying customers or not.\n\nWe're going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the (bathroom) key, said Schultz, discussing rules that took effect during the weekend.\n\nA company spokesperson further clarified to CBS News on Monday: The key piece here is that we are asking customers that when using a Starbucks space, we respectfully request they behave in a manner that maintains a warm and welcoming environment by using spaces as intended, being considerate of others, communicating with respect [and] acting responsibly.\n\nSeparately, a Starbucks procedure manual for employees offered detailed instructions on what to do if someone is behaving in a disruptive manner. It said disruptive behaviors include smoking, drug or alcohol use, improper use of restrooms and sleeping.\n\nThe new rules come more than a month after a manager at a Philadelphia Starbucks called the police on two young black men, one or both of whom asked to use the washroom but had not purchased anything.\n\nAfter a public backlash that included protests, boycotts and accusations of racism, Starbucks said it would close more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. next Tuesday for racial-bias training for its almost 175,000 employees. Schultz recently told CBS This Morning the manager in Philadelphia, who is no longer employed by Starbucks, was likely acting on her own unconscious bias.\n\nStarbucks last week apologized after a customer at a store in California found a derogatory term for Mexicans printed on his coffee drink.\n\nStill, the company's new policy includes instructions for employees to call 911 if they feel someone is a safety threat, and adds that customers can be banned from Starbucks stores if they're disruptive.\n\nThe policy includes a stipulation that spaces be used as intended, which could rule out some of the behavior that prompted some Starbucks employees in New York to lock bathroom doors during a short-lived revolt in 2011 as a worker protest against having to clean up after people who left bathrooms a mess.\n\nIn recent years, Starbucks largely left bathroom policies to individual locations.
President Trump gave what he called a major announcement about the southern border and the partial government shutdown on Saturday. In his speech, Mr. Trump cited the humanitarian crisis at the border, where he said young children were being exploited by coyotes and women were being sexual assaulted. He did not distinguish between illegal migration and asylum seekers.\n\nThe lack of border control provides a gateway -- and a very wide and open gateway -- to allow illegal criminal and aliens to get into the United States, Mr. Trump said, adding that he would keep to the promise he made as a candidate to fix this crisis.\n\nMr. Trump then presented what the White House believes could be a deal to end the shutdown, saying he was speaking to break the logjam.\n\nIt is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy at our southern border, Mr. Trump said about his planned deal, said he hoped Democrat lawmakers would provide their enthusiastic support.\n\nThe radical left can never control our borders. I will not let it happen. Walls are not immoral, in fact it is the opposite of immoral, Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe deal Mr. Trump laid out included $800 million in immediate humanitarian aid, $805 million for improved drug detection technology at legal ports of entry, hiring 2,750 new border agents and 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce court backlogs -- all of which Democrats support. The deal also includes new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries.\n\nHowever, it still contained the $5.7 billion demand for the wall, which he said would not be a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea, but would instead be steel barriers. He said that a wall would be built along 230 miles of the border.\n\nHe also said that he would extend protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) for three years, as well as an extension of the legal status of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders. Mr. Trump announced that he planned to hold weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House to discuss immigration reform.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he would bring this legislation to the floor this week. The Senate reconvenes on Tuesday. GOP Sen. Marco Rubio also said that it sounded like a reasonable deal.\n\nHowever, Democrats seem unlikely to take the deal. A senior House Democratic aide told CBS News that Democrats do not truly consider this a compromise, as Mr. Trump still wants full funding for the wall. They also believe that the deal does not offer full protection to Dreamers and is a temporary fix.\n\nPelosi said in a statement before the speech that based on reports of the deal, she would not support it, calling it a nonstarter which was unlikely to pass the House.\n\nUnfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives, Pelosi said. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin also said in a statement that he would not support the rumored deal before the speech.\n\nFirst, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must open the government today. Second, I cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the Senate. Third, I am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues, Durbin said.\n\nSome conservatives also voiced their opposition to the deal. Right-wing commentator Ann Coulter tweeted: Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!\n\nMr. Trump announced that he would be making the speech on Twitter Friday evening.\n\nI will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, Mr. Trump tweeted Friday evening. He had originally said it would be at 3 p.m. but his schedule later noted it would take place an hour later. He is giving the speech after presiding over a naturalization ceremony for immigrants at the White House.\n\nSaturday marks the 29th day of the longest government shutdown in history. Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats are currently deadlocked over funding for a border wall. Mr. Trump refuses to sign any government funding bill that does not include money for a wall, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate while the government is shut down. Around 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay since the shutdown began.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Trump has considered declaring a national emergency, which would enable him to build the wall without congressional approval. Mr. Trump said earlier this month that I can do it if I want. So far, he has not. I think we might work a deal, he has said. But Mr. Trump went on to threaten, And if we don't, I may go that route. I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want.\n\nMr. Trump's announcement will coincide with women's marches across the country that both protest Trump administration policies and try to draw attention to other policy priorities for women.\n\nArden Farhi, Major Garrett, Rebecca Kaplan and Ed O'Keefe contributed reporting
Efforts to solve the five-year Syrian civil war reached a new roadblock Monday when opposition representatives pulled out of the talks in Geneva. Increased fighting in Syria in recent days indicates a possible crumbling of the partial cease-fire, brokered by the United States and Russia in February.\n\nOn Monday President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone about the crisis.\n\nIs there a coming together in terms of ideas about peace and the ceasefire and who can do what to make Syria a better place? CBS This Morning co-host Charlie Rose asked Mr. Obama in an interview at the White House, soon after the leaders' conversation.\n\nMy call today to him was to indicate that we're starting to see it fray more rapidly. And if the United States and Russia are not in sync about maintaining it and getting a political track and transition moving, then we could be back in a situation we were three, four weeks ago. And that would serve neither of our interests, Mr. Obama explained.\n\nHe added that he thinks the Russians are also very much committed to maintaining the structure of the Syrian state, which in theory, we don't object to either.\n\nWhere we have continually butted heads -- and this has been true for six years now -- is his insistence that he cannot back unilaterally the removal of [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] -- that that's a decision that Assad and the Syrians have to make, he said.\n\nIn the last year of his two-term presidency, Mr. Obama also reflected on his foreign policy doctrine, which he said he has always shied away from labeling under one banner.\n\nWhat I believe is that the United States as the world's singular super power has an obligation in all areas of the world, where there's mayhem and war and conflict, for us to try to be a positive force, Mr. Obama said. But that does not mean that we should be deploying troops everywhere where a crisis is taking place, that we have to be judicious about how we use military power.\n\nHowever, some have criticized the president for thinking too much and not doing enough. Mr. Obama acknowledged he had heard that argument.\n\nWhen we sat down together back in 2009 when I first came into office, we were still in the midst of two active wars, Mr. Obama told Rose. And since that time, we've been able to wind down active combat in those two theaters. Those countries are by no means in great shape. ... Al Qaeda at core has been dismantled. Bin Laden is dead. ISIL is losing territory. And so I've shown no hesitance to use our military where necessary to protect American lives, American interests.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Obama said Assad regime's use of chemical weapons would be the red line that could move the U.S. closer to military intervention in the Syrian civil war. But he was criticized again for not attacking Assad directly, which some say resulted in the country's current devastated state where hundreds of thousands of people have died in the civil war.\n\nI think there's no doubt that there are many in the Middle East who would've preferred me taking a shot at Assad, Mr. Obama said in response to the criticism. But the reason is not because of some abstract notions of red lines. ... Assad is a horrible leader, horrible dictator who has shattered his country. And it continues to be our position that we need to get him out of there.\n\nYou have said more than one time that we're the strongest military, we have the best economy. You've mentioned the culture ... America should own the 21st century -- your words. What could stop us? Rose asked.\n\nWell, a couple things could stop us, Mr. Obama said. Number one is if our political system continues to be dysfunctional. It's fascinating the degree to which the single most important question I'm asked these days from other world leaders is, 'What's going on with your elections?' ... The current presidential election just is the tip of a broader iceberg of dysfunction that we've seen.\n\nAs the president reflected on what he has learned during his presidency, he shared that big breakthroughs are typically the result of just a lot of grunt work.\n\nThere's a lot of just blocking and tackling. ... What is important is making sure that you've got an organization that has integrity, that is clear about its mission, that is doing things the right way and not taking shortcuts, Mr. Obama said. That you're not thinking in terms of short term politics or PR, but you're in for the long haul, and when you do that, than ultimately, you're going to get the good outcome.
Ellen DeGeneres and Alicia Keys are standing behind a black teenager from Texas who was told that he would not walk at graduation this spring if he doesn't cut his dreadlocks.\n\nDeAndre Arnold, an 18-year-old student at Barber Hills High School in Mont Belvieu, was told he won't be able to participate in his graduation ceremony unless he cuts his dreadlocks, which fall past his shoulders.\n\nThe school's policy states that male students' hair must not extend below the top of a T-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes when let down.\n\nAfter the policy controversy gained steam across the country, Arnold was invited to appear on The Ellen Show on Wednesday.\n\nI'm here for you, DeGeneres said.\n\nYou get good grades. You've never been in trouble, ever, DeGeneres said. This is the first time anything has come up. And now, you haven't been in school for weeks because of this situation.\n\nDeGeneres then asked Arnold if there were girls at his school with long hair.\n\nThere's plenty of girls with long hair at my school, he responded. If girls can have long hair, why can't I have long hair?\n\nDeGeneres said that was the point of her question and that she did not think the policy was fair.\n\nI just personally think you should be able to wear your hair however you want, especially if there's girls with long hair, she said. What's the difference if girls have long hair and if guys have long hair?\n\nArnold, who has worn dreadlocks since he was in seventh grade, said he styles his hair this way because of his father's culture.\n\nIt's really important to me because my dad is from Trinidad, it's part of our culture and heritage. I really wish the school would kind of be open to other cultures and just, at least let us try to tell you some things. Don't just shut us out.\n\nArnold's mom thinks it's an issue of race.\n\nThere's no people of color on the school board, she told CBS This Morning earlier this month. They don't understand about his hair.\n\nHowever, Superintendent Gregory Poole said the decision is not about race or the style of his hair, it's just about the length and abiding by a 30-year rule.\n\nWe'd love to see DeAndre back in class, and there's no way we would inhibit him from graduating. But we are gonna be fair to the 6,200 other kids that have to comply by the same policy, Poole told CBS This Morning.\n\nDeAndre Arnold\n\nArnold told DeGeneres that if he goes back to school, he faces in-school suspension or alternative school, where students who misbehave are sent.\n\nI've worked for this all my life, he told DeGeneres. I deserve this moment to walk across stage.\n\nDeGeneres then called Alicia Keys on to the set to surprise the aspiring veterinarian with a check for $20,000 to go toward his college education. The audience erupted in cheers and applause.\n\nI want to tell you that, I couldn't believe the story when I heard it, Keys told Arnold. I'm super proud of you for standing up for what you know is right. And I know that the school needs to do the right thing.\n\nDeGeneres then faced the camera to plead with officials to change their minds.\n\nI am begging you. This kid is a good kid. He deserves to graduate, to walk with all the other kids, she said. He's a good guy. I just am urging you to do the right thing. Please, change your mind.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Employers cannot pay women less than men for the same work based on differences in their salaries at previous jobs, a federal appeals court said Monday. Pay differences based on prior salaries are discriminatory under the federal Equal Pay Act, a unanimous 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.\n\nThe decision overturned a ruling last year by a smaller panel of 9th Circuit judges that had been criticized by equal pay advocates.\n\nAllowing pay differences based on previous salaries would perpetuate wage gaps between men and women that are based on discrimination in the job market, Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote.\n\nReinhardt -- considered among the most liberal members of the 9th Circuit -- wrote the opinion before he died last month.\n\nAlthough the (Equal Pay) Act has prohibited sex-based wage discrimination for more than fifty years, the financial exploitation of working women embodied by the gender pay gap continues to be an embarrassing reality of our economy, Reinhardt wrote.\n\nWomen made about 80 cents for every dollar men earned in 2015, according to U.S. government data.\n\nThe ruling came in a lawsuit by California school employee Aileen Rizo, who learned in 2012 while having lunch with her colleagues that male counterparts hired after her were making more money.\n\nFresno County public schools hired Rizo as a math consultant in 2009 for a little under $63,000 a year. The county had a standard policy that added 5 percent to her previous pay as a middle school math teacher in Arizona.\n\nAn email to an attorney for the district's superintendent was not immediately returned.\n\nThe Equal Pay Act, signed into law by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, forbids employers from paying women less than men based on gender for equal work performed under similar working conditions. But it creates exemptions when pay is based on seniority, merit, quantity or quality of work or any other factor other than sex.\n\nFresno County argued that basing starting salaries primarily on previous pay was one of those other factors and prevented subjective determinations of a new employee's value.\n\nThe 5 percent bump encourages candidates to leave their positions to work for the county, it said.
Ratcheting up pressure on the Russia investigation, the White House announced that top FBI and Justice Department officials have agreed to meet with congressional leaders and review highly classified information the lawmakers have been seeking on the handling of the probe.\n\nThe agreement came after President Donald Trump made an extraordinary demand that the Justice Department investigate whether the FBI infiltrated his presidential campaign. It's unclear exactly what the members will be allowed to review or if the Justice Department will be providing any documents to Congress.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump chief of staff John Kelly will broker the meeting between congressional leaders and the FBI, Justice Department and office of the Director of National Intelligence. She said the officials will review highly classified and other information they have requested, but did not provide additional detail.\n\nDuring a meeting Monday with Trump, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray also reiterated an announcement late Sunday that the Justice Department's inspector general will expand an existing investigation into the Russia probe by examining whether there was any improper politically motivated surveillance.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, an ardent Trump supporter and head of the House Intelligence Committee, has been demanding information on an FBI source in the Russia investigation. And Mr. Trump has taken up the cause as the White House tries to combat the threat posed by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nMr. Trump tweeted Sunday, I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!\n\nWith the demand, Mr. Trump entered into the realm of applying presidential pressure on the Justice Department regarding an investigation into his own campaign — a move few of his predecessors have made.\n\nMr. Trump made the demand amid days of public venting about the special counsel investigation, which he has deemed a witch hunt that he says has yielded no evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russia. In response, the Justice Department moved to defuse the confrontation by asking its watchdog to investigate whether there was inappropriate surveillance.\n\nIf anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action, Rosenstein said in a statement announcing the move.\n\nThe Justice Department probe began in March at the request of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and congressional Republicans. Sessions and the lawmakers urged Inspector General Michael Horowitz to review whether FBI and Justice Department officials abused their surveillance powers by using information compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy, and paid for by Democrats to justify monitoring Carter Page, a former campaign adviser to Trump.\n\nHorowitz said his office will look at those claims as well as communications between Steele and Justice and FBI officials.\n\nThe back and forth between the Justice Department and Congress began with a classified subpoena from Nunes in late April. The panel didn't publicize the subpoena, but the Justice Department released a letter it sent to Nunes rejecting the request for information regarding a specific individual. The department said disclosure could have severe consequences, including potential loss of human life.\n\nThe Justice Department said the White House had signed off on its letter, but Nunes wasn't satisfied, and continued to pressure the department. Negotiations between the House Republicans and the Justice department appeared to stall last week ahead of Trump's tweet — an apparent reversal of the White House's initial policy.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has called Trump's claim of an embedded spy nonsense.\n\nHis 'demand' DOJ investigate something they know to be untrue is an abuse of power, and an effort to distract from his growing legal problems, Schiff tweeted. Never mind that DOJ has warned that lives and alliances are at risk. He doesn't care.\n\nMr. Trump's demand of the Justice Department alarmed many observers, who felt it not only violated presidential protocol but also could have a chilling effect on federal law enforcement or its use of informants.\n\nThe New York Times was the first to report that the FBI had an informant who met several times with Trump campaign officials who had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.\n\nThe GOP-led House Intelligence Committee closed its Russian meddling probe last month, saying it found no evidence of collusion or coordination between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia. Schiff and other committee Democrats were furious and argued that Republicans had not subpoenaed many witnessed they considered essential to the committee's work.\n\nSunday was not the first time that Mr. Trump accused his predecessor of politically motivated activity against him.\n\nWithout substantiation, Mr. Trump tweeted in March 2017 that former President Barack Obama had conducted surveillance the previous October at Trump Tower, the New York skyscraper where Mr. Trump ran his campaign and transition and maintains a residence. Comey later testified to Congress that internal reviews found no information to support the president's tweets. Mr. Trump fired Comey over the bureau's Russia investigation.
A growing number of states that have struggled to speedily distribute the COVID-19 vaccine are enlisting the National Guard for help.\n\nWashington is the latest. Governor Jay Inslee on Monday said he would deploy the Guard to set up mass-vaccination sites, with a goal of ramping up to 45,000 inoculations a day from a current daily average of only 12,000. Previously, Like most states, Washington had mostly planned to rely on hospitals and pharmacies to distribute the vaccine around the state. But its distribution numbers have lagged.\n\nAs of January 19, Washington had administered only about 45% of the vaccines it had received from the federal government. That ranks Washington No. 37 among all 50 states in terms of how much of the vaccine it has been allocated to date has actually gone into people's arms, according to the latest available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn all, about 20 states are using their local National Guard troops for everything from leading the vaccination effort to distribution to giving people shots. President Joe Biden has said that he would lean more heavily on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Guard to help accelerate the rollout of the vaccine.\n\nThat's a shift. Many state and federal officials were initially reluctant to rely on the Guard in distributing the vaccine out of concerns that a military presence could scare away people who might fear the government was set to mandate inoculations.\n\nAs recently as October, Paul Mango, the deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, predicted that the military would play almost no visible role in administering vaccines. The overwhelming majority of Americans will get a vaccine that no federal employee, including the Department of Defense, has touched, Mango said at the time.\n\nRethinking the National Guard's role\n\nSome health experts now say that may have been a mistake. Tinglong Dai, who studies health care and operations management at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, thinks using military personnel to speed the vaccination effort is a very smart idea, even if the sight of service members on America's street could jangle nerves.\n\nNobody wants to see their city to look like it is under military occupation, Dai said. Will it scare off some people? I don't think right now. The demand to get a vaccine is very high.\n\nEncouragingly, the pace of daily COVID-19 vaccinations has increased sharply in the past week. Nearly 6.4 million Americans got their initial doses in the past week, or just over 911,000 a day. That was up from a few hundred thousand a day the previous week, although still well short of the 2 million doses a day experts think is necessary for the country to reach herd immunity by late spring.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason for the increase in vaccinations is the mounting public pressure on governors whose states were falling behind, Dai said. That was also the reason more states appeared to be turning to the National Guard for help.\n\nConnecticut National Guard members wait to check in vehicles at the state's largest COVID-19 vaccination drive-through clinic, Monday, Jan. 18, 2021, in East Hartford, Connecticut. Jessica Hill / AP\n\nLast week, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson activated 45 National Guard troops. He also turned over coordination of the state's vaccination efforts to retired Colonel Robert Ator, a former Air National Guard commander who was based in Little Rock.\n\nHutchinson also announced the state would begin distributing vaccines beyond just medical professionals and nursing homes.\n\nI'm not happy with it, and that's one of the reasons we're moving into the first two categories of phase B, Hutchinson said last week at a news conference, according to a report from local CBS affiliate KTHV.\n\nIn New York City, the Jacob Javits Convention Center has gotten its second pandemic makeover. Back in the spring, when the coronavirus was spreading rapidly, the complex on the west side of Manhattan was repurposed by National Guard troops into a COVID-19 treatment facility.\n\nNow the Guard is at work turning the massive convention space into a mass-vaccination site. About 350 troops have been deployed to what is normally the home of the local annual auto show and New York's Comic Con gathering. Those service members will do everything from controlling access to the site and conducting temperature checks at the door to ensuring people are in the right lines. City officials say vaccinations will take 20 minutes to 30 minutes from sign-in to check out once the facility is up and running.\n\nWhile the National Guard has been deployed to help with clean up after hurricanes and other natural disasters, there isn't much history of the military distributing vaccines. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, has voiced concern about using the Guard for vaccine distribution. Plescia said he is worried that deploying the military to speed the process could give people false hope.\n\nMore specifically, the National Guard might succeed in boosting distribution temporarily, but too little vaccine is currently in transit for even 20% of all Americans to get shots, he said.\n\nWe are still a few weeks or months away from having enough supply of vaccine to open up that way, Plescia said. You will have people who want the vaccine and people who are capable of administering it, but you still won't have enough vaccines.
Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pennsylvania, announced he would step down from Congress at the end of January, ensuring a special election in the swing state in coming months.\n\nHaving spent over two decades serving the public, I have chosen to take a position in the private sector where I can use both my legal and business experience to create jobs around the nation, Marino said in a statement.\n\nMarino made national news in 2017 when he was nominated by President Trump to direct the country's drug control policy. He withdrew from consideration after a Washington Post/60 Minutes report found he helped steer legislation which weakened the Drug Enforcement Administration's power to go after drug distributors.\n\nRep. Tom Marino, R-Pennsylvania, seen July 21, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. Getty\n\nMarino represents a solidly Republican district in central and north Pennsylvania. He was elected to the 10th Congressional District in 2010, which was redistricted this year to the 12th Congressional District drawn by a panel of judges last year.\n\nMarino said Thursday he will be stepping down effective Jan. 23 to join the private sector. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has ten days to call a special election after Marino retires. The election must be held within 60 days of Marino's departure.\n\nAlthough Marino represents a conservative region, the district may be in play for Democrats. Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb was unexpectedly elected in a special election in spring 2018, and retained his seat in November.\n\nMarino's departure will leave Republicans with 198 seats in the House.
Havana — Most Cubans think times are tough, and most Cubans believe they're about to get worse thanks to the pending U.S. designation of their country as a state sponsor of terrorism. Worse how? At the most basic level, many say it will make it harder to put food on the table and shoes on their children's feet.\n\nOur economy is a disaster. There is not enough food grown and goods produced to meet the demand. There is no money -people have no money, the government has no money. And how can we attract investors if the U.S. threatens them with sanctions? Michel tells CBS News. The Havana taxi driver says the lack of tourists has left him virtually unemployed already.\n\nThe Cuban economy is reeling. The costs of combating COVID-19 have been astronomical. The economic crisis is, in great part, due to the state's provision of free health care for all citizens, including hospitalizing every Cuban who tests positive for the virus. The situation is getting worse right now, with the capital region and others facing an uptick in infections and, with that, more stringent restrictions being brought back.\n\nA woman walks through Havana, Cuba, January 12, 2021. YAMIL LAGE/AFP/Getty\n\nBut the pandemic hit the island as the Trump administration pursued a no-holds-barred policy intended to wipe out advances in relations made under former President Barack Obama. Monday's announcement that Cuba will be added to the terrorism sponsors list — a dubious distinction shared only by North Korea, Iran and Syria — is like a final nail in the coffin.\n\nIt will, among other things, penalize people and countries for engaging in certain trade with Cuba, and impose controls on some exports.\n\nThe Trump administration had already limited the ability of Cubans in the U.S. to send money to their families back on the island (remittances); put many new constraints on U.S. travellers wishing to visit Cuba; limited commercial flights from the U.S. to a single city — Havana; stopped cruise ships from coming here and effectively barred U.S. nationals from staying in any of Cuba's hotels. And all of that came on top of the long-running, blanket U.S. economic, financial and trade embargo on the island.\n\nVisitors from the U.S. and remittances were an important source of income for the government, but also for normal Cubans — and for the emerging private sector that blossomed when Mr. Obama's policies made it possible for large numbers of Americans to visit.\n\nAll this on top of Cuba's own economic failings, and the pandemic, has meant hardship and shortages for all Cubans. It's been particularly hard for those working in tourism, artists who briefly enjoyed a ready market for their work, private restaurant and B&B owners, to mention just a few.\n\nIt is an outrage and may affect many aspects for the potential traveller, like insurance and, of course, banking, a Scottish woman who's spent about two decades bringing European tourists to Cuba tells CBS News of the new status conferred by the U.S. It will just act as yet another deterrent for those of a nervous disposition, although Cuba remains one of the safest countries in the world.\n\nAmid the intense pressure on state finances, the Cuban government has decided to move forward on economic reforms that have been pending since 2013. These include the long-postponed unification of Cuba's dual currencies and adjustment of currency exchange values. That may all help the government's bottom line, but it also carries the threat of inflation, and that's brought an outcry from nearly every sector of the population.\n\nMany here are so focused on how these domestic measures will hit them that Monday's announcement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo may have come as just the latest, not-unexpected slap in the face to Cubans already spending long hours in line for food and other necessities.\n\nThe government's official rejection of the measure came swiftly, in the form of tweets from the Cuban president and foreign minister and an official statement denouncing the designation as cynical political opportunism.\n\nCuba opposes terrorism: it has been a victim of this scourge, never a sponsor. The discredited Trump administration does everything in its power to hinder and avoid an improvement of relations during Biden's term in office. https://t.co/yeijab63GS — Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez (@DiazCanelB) January 12, 2021\n\nCarlos Fernandez de Cossio, head of the U.S. Department of the Cuban Foreign Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that Cuba does not promote terrorism, but rather has been a victim of terrorism from persons and groups based in the United States.\n\nThese past four years have been the result of unilateral actions by the Trump Administration, aimed at punishing Cuba and aimed at destroying the links between our two countries, de Cossio said. It has an impact on the people of Cuba... it has hurt the well-being of the people of Cuba.\n\nHe said he doesn't believe that President-elect Joe Biden considers Cuba a genuine sponsor of terrorism, and voiced optimism that this would influence the policies of the incoming administration.\n\nBut it may not be a rapid about-face. Emilio Morales, an exiled Cuban economist and president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group, told the Associated Press this week that even if Biden does opt for détente, the terrorism designation will really slow any thaw in relations.\n\nMorales said reversing the measure would take at least a year, the Biden administration would have to carefully consider the political implications given ongoing concern in the U.S. over Cuba's human rights record, and mysterious brain trauma suffered by Americans in the country. He was also doubtful about the level of Biden's own will, given that he wasn't a key player in the Obama administration's Cuba policy.\n\nStill de Cossio wasn't alone in voicing hope for a renewed thaw in relations with Washington.\n\nWe've been praying Biden will reverse all of Trump's sanctions against us, Magaly, a retiree who augments her state pension by cleaning homes for foreigners in her Havana neighborhood, tells CBS News. It gives us a glimmer of hope. Things are pretty bleak right now.
As President Obama travels to Cuba for his historic trip, a majority of Americans support restoring U.S.-Cuba diplomatic ties, according to a new CBS News/New York Times poll.\n\nFifty-two percent approve of the president's handling of relations with the island nation, according to the poll released Monday. Six in 10 Americans think restoring diplomacy with Cuba is mostly good for the U.S., but views are mixed on whether it will lead to more democracy in Cuba.\n\nThe public, however, doesn't share the President's goal of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay: 52 percent want it to remain open.\n\nIn December 2014 Mr. Obama announced that U.S. and Cuba would resume diplomatic ties after more than 50 years. Fifty-eight percent of Americans support this, while just 25 percent oppose it. Most Democrats and independents favor re-establishing diplomacy, while Republicans are divided.\n\nAmericans have long supported this move. When Gallup asked a version of this question back in 1977, 53 percent of Americans thought diplomatic relations with Cuba should be re-established. While diplomacy may have resumed, the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains in effect. Fifty-five percent of Americans favor the United States ending its trade embargo against Cuba.\n\nAs President Obama visits Cuba - the first for a sitting U.S. president since Calvin Coolidge 88 years ago - more now approve of the President's handling of relations between the two countries. Fifty-two percent of Americans approve; a slight uptick from last summer and an increase of eight points since 2014. While Republicans may be split on the restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba, a majority of them disapprove of how the President is handling relations with that country.\n\nImpact of Renewed Relations on Cuba, U.S.\n\nWhen asked what impact restored relations will have on Cuba, Americans are inclined to think it will lead to more democracy (40 percent) rather than less (3 percent). However, half think it will make no difference.\n\nOn the other hand, most Americans think it will benefit the U.S.; sixty-two percent think re-establishing relations with Cuba will be mostly good for the U.S. Republicans are less likely to view it that way than Democrats and independents.\n\nCurrently, Cuban citizens who arrive at a U.S. port of entry and pass an inspection can stay in the U.S. and apply for legal permanent residence after a year. Just a quarter of Americans think this policy should stay in place, while most think Cuban immigrants should now be treated like other immigrants trying to enter the U.S.\n\nViews of Cuba, Travel\n\nOverall, Americans' views of Cuba have grown more positive recently. Fifty-one percent now have a favorable impression of Cuba (similar to what a Gallup poll found in February). Prior to this year, Gallup polling consistently showed more negative than positive views of Cuba. Back in 1996, nearly nine in 10 Americans viewed the country unfavorably.\n\nThere are partisan differences: Most Democrats (56 percent) view Cuba favorably, compared to just over a third of Republicans (36 percent).\n\nAs favorable opinions of Cuba have risen so has interest in taking a trip there. Forty-three of Americans now say they would be very or somewhat interested in visiting Cuba, up 10 points from the fall of 2014. Still, traveling to Cuba doesn't appeal to most Americans - 57 percent have little or no interest.\n\nYounger Americans have a greater desire than older Americans to go to Cuba. Along political lines, Democrats (49 percent) are more interested in such a trip than Republicans (24 percent).\n\nGuantanamo Bay\n\nSince assuming office, it has been a goal of President Obama's to close the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and last month he sent his plan to Congress.\n\nBut the public disagrees with the President on this issue. Fifty-two percent of Americans want to see the prison remain open, including most Republicans and independents. A slim majority of Democrats wants Guantanamo Bay to be closed.\n\nThis poll was conducted by telephone March 11-15, 2016 among a random sample of 1,022 adults nationwide.
Twitter has suspended the accounts of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign attorney Sidney Powell for sharing posts about the web of conspiracy theories known as QAnon.\n\nWe've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm, and given the renewed potential for violence surrounding this type of behavior in the coming days, we will permanently suspend accounts that are solely dedicated to sharing QAnon content, Twitter said in a statement to CBS News.\n\nA short time later, Twitter permanently suspended President Trump's own account due to the risk of further incitement of violence. That followed a 12-hours freeze earlier in the week after he posted a video where he appeared to sympathize with protesters who rampaged through the Capitol and repeated false claims about the election.\n\nQAnon followers believe a nefarious group of global elites, including Hollywood celebrities and Democratic politicians, are engaged in a satanic child trafficking operation, and that only President Trump can defeat them. Critics have likened QAnon to an apocalyptic religious cult, and the FBI has warned of the growing threat of violence from conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists including QAnon.\n\nMany Trump supporters at his rally Wednesday were seen wearing or waving the Q symbol, as were members of the mob that attacked the Capitol that afternoon.\n\nA man and woman with a QAnon shirt and sign at a Trump rally in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021. Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA via AP Images\n\nFlynn and Powell's accounts were suspended in line with Twitter's policy on Coordinated Harmful Activity, which states that when we determine that a group, movement, or campaign meets the criteria for designation as engaged in Coordinated Harmful Activity, we may suspend accounts whose primary use is to propagate and/or encourage engagement in the identified coordinated harmful activity.\n\nPresident Trump pardoned Flynn in November, days after his campaign said it had broken off its association with Powell — who was also Flynn's attorney.\n\nFlynn served in the Trump administration for less than a month before he was fired in February 2017 for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with the Russian ambassador. Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, before retracting his plea.\n\nThe Trump campaign distanced itself from Powell after she absurdly claimed during a Trump campaign press conference that the deceased Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez, among others, participated in rigging the election. The campaign put out a statement saying she is not a member of the Trump legal team, even though the president and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani had previously identified her as being on the team.\n\nMr. Trump continued talking with Powell and even floated the idea of appointing her as a special counsel after a White House meeting in December.\n\nOn Friday, Dominion Voting Systems filed a defamation lawsuit against Powell for spreading conspiracy theories that Dominion was part of a scheme to rig the presidential election. The company is seeking more than $1.3 billion in damages, saying Powell caused it unprecedented harm through repeated baseless accusations that Dominion colluded against the president and fixed elections, claims also spread by President Trump. Election officials in more than two dozen states that use Dominion voting machines have said there is no evidence of any irregularities.
NEW YORK - With new options and conveniences, there's never been a better time for shoppers. As for workers ... well, not always.\n\nThe retail industry is being radically reshaped by technology, and nobody feels that disruption more starkly than 16 million American shelf stockers, salespeople, cashiers and others. The shifts are driven, like much in retail, by the Amazon (AMZN) effect -- the explosion of online shopping and the related changes in consumer behavior and preferences.\n\nAs mundane tasks like checkout and inventory are automated, employees are trying to deliver the kind of customer service the internet can't match.\n\nSo a Best Buy (BBY) employee who used to sell electronics in the store is dispatched to customers' homes to help them choose just the right products. A Walmart (WMT) worker dashes in and out of the grocery aisles, hand-picks products for online shoppers and brings them to people's cars.\n\nYet even as responsibilities change -- and in many cases, expand -- the average growth in pay for retail workers isn't keeping pace with the rest of the economy. Some companies say in the long run the transformation could mean fewer retail workers, though they may be better paid. But while some workers feel more satisfied, others find their jobs are just a lot less fun.\n\nBloomingdale's (M) saleswoman Brenda Moses remembers the pre-internet era, when the upscale store was regularly filled with customers ready to buy. These days, department stores are less crowded, and the customers who do come in can make price comparisons on their phones at the same time as they pepper staff with questions.\n\nYou tell them everything, and then they look at you and say, 'You know what? I think I will get it online,' she said.\n\nMoses has seen her commission rate rise to 6 percent from a half a percent, but her hourly wage dropped from $19 as low as $10 before it came back up to $14. Depending more on commissions means her income fluctuates, and she's competing with her colleagues for each sale.\n\nNow, Moses said, you have to fight to make your money.\n\nThe same could be said for the retailing industry, overall. In 2017, 66,500 U.S. retail jobs disappeared (not taking into account jobs added in areas like distribution and call centers). In the past decade, about one out of every seven jobs have vanished in the hardest-hit sectors like clothing and consumer electronics, says Frank Badillo, director of research at MacroSavvy. Though department stores have suffered the most, smaller businesses also have struggled to compete with online sellers.\n\nMany of the survivors are rushing to adapt. Of the retail jobs that remain, over the next decade as many as 60 percent will either be new kinds of roles or will involve revised duties, says Craig Rowley, senior client partner at Korn Ferry Hay Group, a human resources advisory firm. He estimates the number is about 10 percent now.\n\nHow fast retail jobs will change and what they'll look like depends on three factors, Rowley said: the pace at which online shopping advances; the speed at which robotics and other technology progress; and shifts in the minimum hourly pay.\n\nJobs for workers will get more interesting and be more impactful on the company's business, Rowley said. But the negative side is that there will be fewer entry-level jobs, and there will be more pressure to perform.\n\nSome retail workers at the vanguard of the changes -- like Laila Ummelaila, a personal grocery shopper at a Walmart in Old Bridge, New Jersey -- speak glowingly of their new responsibilities.\n\nWalmart, the nation's largest private employer, has scrutinized every job in its stores as it looks to leverage its more than 4,000 U.S. locations against Amazon's internet dominance.\n\nThe company now has 18,000 personal shoppers who fill online orders from store shelves, and 17,000 check-out hosts whose responsibilities are more extensive than the greeters of old, including keeping the area clean and making sure registers move efficiently.\n\nThe company has also shifted workers from back-room clerical jobs and eliminated some overnight stocker positions in favor of more daytime sales help. The customers like the changes, company officials say, pointing to more than three years of sales growth at its established U.S. stores -- a contrast with other, suffering retailers.\n\nUmmelaila became a personal shopper after joining the company three years ago. To meet her store's goals, she must pick one item per 30 seconds. If she can't find something, she has to quickly get a substitute that's as good or better.\n\nYou start to get to know the customers, you know what they like, she said, how they like their meat ... and how long they keep milk in the fridge.\n\nBest Buy has begun a free service in key markets using salespeople to sit with customers in their own homes and make recommendations on setting up a home office to designing a home theater system. Best Buy said shoppers spend more with a home visit than they do at the stores. The project follows Amazon, which reportedly has been testing a program that sends employees to shoppers' houses for free smart home recommendations.\n\nAt Steve Frederick's townhouse in Chicago, Billy Schuler offered advice about speakers that can be adjusted from a smartphone. Schuler, who had previously worked at Best Buy for 14 years, returned to the company to take on the new role.\n\nCustomers are more relaxed when they're in their home, he said. We can do a walkthrough of the house and see their needs. He likes to break the ice by calling the person and chatting a day or two before the visit.\n\nFrederick, who's spending close to $20,000 on the equipment, describes himself as old-school and said he needed a lot of help. He thinks it was worthwhile.\n\nWhen you're spending that kind of money, you want to have someone come in and explain it, he said.\n\nSchuler declined to give specifics but says he is well compensated. Ummelaila says her pay went up to nearly $12 per hour from $10 when she became a personal shopper.\n\nTarget (TGT) credits its strategy of assigning dedicated sales staff in areas such as clothing, consumer electronics and beauty for helping increase sales, and said having visual merchandisers create vignettes like shoppers would see in specialty stores inspires people to buy. You're making an outfit and telling a story on each rack, said Crystal Lawrence, who works at a Target store in Brooklyn, New York. She likes the variety in her new job, and Target said it plans to keep paying higher wages for those specialized roles.\n\nBut a survey of nearly 300 retail workers -- conducted by the Center for Frontline Retail and Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center -- found that of those workers whose job responsibilities have changed, more than 40 percent said they hadn't received pay increases to reflect that.\n\nWages for hourly retail workers have risen less than 9 percent since 1990, compared with 18 percent for overall workers in the private sector. They've made some progress recently, with some of the biggest retailers, like Walmart and Target moving to increase pay in the face of low unemployment and competition for workers.\n\nFor a long period, these retail jobs were just terrible on average, said Michael Mandel, chief economic strategist at the Progressive Policy Institute. Retail stores have been following one strategy: high turnover, low wages. That strategy is no longer viable.\n\nMandel sees hope in technology, which he said has historically created more and better-paying jobs than it has eliminated.\n\nThe National Retail Federation trade group points to government data showing that even in large supermarket chains where self-checkout has become standard, the number of employees per store has held steady over the 15 years through 2014. And the demand for grocery cashiers increased in the past few years, said Burning Glass Technologies, a company that analyzes labor market data.\n\nMcDonald's (MCD) said the self-serve kiosks it has been rolling out won't result in mass layoffs, but it will mean some cashiers shift roles to accommodate changes like offering table service.\n\nHowever, a report prepared by Cornerstone Capital Group for the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute predicted that more than 7.5 million retail jobs are at risk of being eliminated by automation over the next several years.\n\nAmazon is testing a grocery store in Seattle without cashiers, using cameras and shelf sensors to keep track of the items that shoppers grab and charge them. Eatsa, an automat-style restaurant in San Francisco, lacks cashiers as well -- diners order at kiosks, and workers prepare the food behind an opaque wall, with virtually no interaction between them.\n\nA labor group representing 1.3 million grocery and food workers is trying to combat automation by highlighting that workers' specialized skills -- like the care they take in icing a rose on a wedding cake, or arranging flowers, or the ability of human workers to recognize spoiled food -- provide a benefit to shoppers.\n\nSeparating progress for the consumer, for the worker, for the economy versus the stockholders ... those are completely different things, said Erikka Knuti, a spokeswoman for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.\n\nOthers said automation and happy workers are not necessarily incompatible.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon foresees fewer sales associates at his stores, but they'll be better paid and better trained. Walmart has trained 225,000 supervisors and managers on topics like new apps and better customer service. It said managers who go through the academies have better retention rates than those who do not. Workers who report to those managers stay longer. And entry-level workers who complete a new training program are more likely to remain.\n\nIt's a shift retailers may have to speed up. Government figures show the rate of retail workers quitting their jobs in 2016 was at its highest since 2007.\n\nAlfredo Duran, who started as a sales associate at Gap (GPS) and worked at six retailers over 15 years, left the industry two years ago. As a manager at clothing chain Mango, he was making $75,000 a year. But once the store closed, he had trouble finding another job in retail because no one wanted to pay him for his experience.\n\nIt has gone down. One person is doing three jobs. And you can't move up, said Duran, 38, of Queens, New York.\n\nHe's now a concierge at a Manhattan hotel, making half of what he used to earn -- but happy he left retail.
The Senate confirmed dozens of Trump nominees by voice vote Wednesday evening, the last day of the 115th Congress before the 116th Congress is seated Thursday. The confirmation of 77 nominees was a rare moment of bipartisanship for the Senate.\n\nSeveral ambassadorships positions were filled Wednesday evening, notably one in Yemen, where a Saudi-backed civil war has ravaged the country. The Senate also confirmed a new director of National Drug Control Policy, as well as a Census director for the 2020 Census.\n\nThe upcoming Census has been a contentious issue for some Democrats, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross added a citizenship question. Critics argue this question would leave states with large undocumented populations undercounted -- possibly affecting representation in Congress. The citizenship question is being challenged in court.\n\nMost of the nominees confirmed Wednesday were for executive branch positions. Only a few judicial nominees were confirmed, as Democrats have opposed many of President Trump's nominations to the federal bench.
The odds of being audited by the IRS are shrinking -- and that's especially good news for wealthy taxpayers.\n\nAbout 934,000 returns were audited during Fiscal Year 2017, the lowest number since 2003, according to new IRS data.\n\nAmong households with income above $1 million, just 4.37 percent faced audits. That's less than half the 9.55 percent rate in 2015, and the lowest audit rate for millionaires since the IRS first began tracking it in 2004.\n\nThe audit rate for taxpayers earning $200,000 or less fell to 0.59 percent, the lowest level since 2002.\n\nThe main reason for the decline: The IRS's budget and staff levels have been under pressure for years.\n\nThe IRS is also auditing fewer companies and nonprofit organizations. The audit rate for businesses with assets of $250 million tumbled to 15.2 percent in the most recent fiscal quarter, less than half the 33.8 percent rate in 2013. Less than 1 percent of all tax-exempt organizations were audited in 2017.\n\nLook, we have a voluntary tax system. It relies on people's goodwill and it relies to some degree on their fear of being audited, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Institute, in an interview with CBS.\n\nThe tax legislation passed in December creates new burdens for the IRS, especially by encouraging some businesses to change their reporting structure.\n\nIt creates more opportunities for people to claim business deductions than they might have before, said Gleckman. I don't quite know how the service is going to keep track of them.\n\nMoreover, Gleckman thinks the rules are so badly written than even taxpayers with the best of intentions will mess-up because they don't understand how to comply.\n\nTaxpayers seeking help from the IRS often have difficulties finding it because its staff has shrunk by 20,000 over the past 8 years. The agency's proposed budget is a 1.7 percent increase from last year, but still less than the budget in 2012.\n\nThis is an unsustainable situation for the agency that brings in 93 percent of the nation's revenue, and it will worsen with additional cuts proposed in the Administration's 2019 budget, said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union.\n\nAn IRS spokesman declined to comment.
With more than 5,800 cases and at least 100 deaths, the U.S. is at a critical point in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, according to Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\n\nIn an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell, Adams emphasized that the next 15 days will be crucial for fighting the pandemic in the U.S. He also warned that if Americans don't take it seriously, the nation could face an outbreak like Italy's — in which more than 31,000 people have been diagnosed.\n\nRead Norah O'Donnell's interview with Adams below.\n\nNorah O'Donnell: There is a new study out today from the National Institutes of Health that says the virus can live on surfaces for up to days. Twenty-four hours on cardboard, two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. What do Americans need to know to protect themselves?\n\nDr. Jerome Adams: Well, the most important thing for Americans to know is that they should clean their surfaces frequently and that they should wash their hands frequently because the two ways you're going to transmit coronavirus from a surface is by having a dirty surface around your house and by not washing your hands after you touch that surface.\n\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams seen Tuesday, March 17, 2020. CBS News\n\nThe mayor of New York City said he is considering a shelter in place policy. If major cities did that, would that help slow the spread of this invisible enemy?\n\nWell, I'm glad you brought that up because Tony Fauci and I talk multiple times a day, every day. And as Tony says, if it seems like an overreaction right now, then you're probably about where you need to be.\n\nAgain, it's why the administration put out these guidelines for all of America, not just for certain areas, but for all of America to look at the ways that they can prevent transmission of disease in their communities. And I wouldn't fault any mayor, any governor, for what they're considering in their communities. But at the very least, limit social gatherings to less than 10, stay at home if you can from work and avoid non-essential travel.\n\nLet me ask you as a doctor, what's your message to adults over the age of 60 who are healthy and they say, I'm not worried about getting coronavirus?\n\nMy message is to everyone: Fifteen days, you can do anything for 15 days. Stay at home as much as possible, limit the spread, we do not want to look like Italy does two weeks from now.\n\nI know you're a dad, I'm a mom — many parents have this question: Can my kids have playdates, should they?\n\nWe said no playdates. My wife just finished cancer treatment. She's at higher risk. I actually myself, have chronic medical conditions. I'm pre-diabetic, and it's just not worth the risk to the two of us, but it's not worth the risk of our kids being spreaders and potentially taking it to someone else.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the number of deaths in Italy.
The first 2020 Democratic presidential primary is more than a year away, but candidates are already making history with the number of women in the running. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's entrance into the race this week marked the first time that more than one woman competed for the party's nomination -- and still more are expected to join the fray.\n\nWhat may be more remarkable -- and welcome -- is the variety within the field of women. The fact of their sex is not a consideration in their decision to run. There's not a 'women's lane,' says Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for Emily's List, which recruits and supports typically Democratic female candidates. The upshot? Having multiple women means that hopefully they will not only be judged by their gender, so we can talk about the candidates, says Reynolds.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic field could have as many as five women, including Gillibrand. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first to join the race with the announcement of an exploratory committee on New Year's Eve, and has traveled to Iowa and New Hampshire. Tulsi Gabbard, a 37-year old lawmaker from Hawaii and one of the first two female combat veterans ever to serve in Congress, has also announced a bid.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, the first South Asian-American and second African-American woman elected to the upper chamber, is preparing a run and is currently on a book tour. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is also seriously considering a campaign for the presidency.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton made history as the first woman presidential candidate nominated by a major political party, and she secured nearly 3 million more votes than Donald Trump in the general election, but she still lost her bid for the White House. If that election raised concerns about whether a woman can win the presidency (though there were certainly other significant factors in Clinton's loss), the 2018 midterms--which sent a record number of women to Congress--appears to have helped to put them to rest.\n\nLet's be crystal clear: today, women are the heart and soul of the Democratic base and the fuel that is driving victories up and down the ballot, Ilyse Hogue, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America, recently wrote.\n\nKelly Dittmar, an associate professor at Rutgers University and a scholar at the university's Center for American Women and Politics, said that having multiple women candidates of different ages, race, and ideological positions would push back against the sort of homogeneous ideal type of a woman running for higher office.\n\nI think that any time we have more women running, and greater diversity among those women, it just challenges those monolithic conceptions of what it means to be a woman candidate, Dittmar said.\n\nBut being a woman does not mean that these candidates will be restricted to campaigning on women's issues, which are often narrowly defined by topics like paid family leave and sexual assault.\n\nThey're not all running on being a woman. They are running on their records and their visions, says Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist who advised Cynthia Nixon's gubernatorial campaign in 2018.\n\nI think it's important that we not relegate women to just one set of issues as though they aren't living full lives, Senator Harris told Bustle.\n\nHarris promotes her experience as a prosecutor, which could become a key pitch of her presidential campaign. Warren has built a national brand on economic issues, particularly consumer protection and Wall Street accountability. Gillibrand has made combating sexual misconduct, particularly in the military, a hallmark of her political career since entering the Senate.\n\nDittmar said that the number of women in the race would not necessarily mean introduction of new topics to the national conversation, but would provide new perspectives.\n\nIt's more about the lens by which they're going to be viewing, talking about, and in fact creating their own policy agenda, she said.\n\nThose varying lenses have already been on display. During the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, she asked, Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\n\nKlobuchar also received national attention for her questioning of Kavanaugh. She discussed her own history as a child of an alcoholic father, and asked if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out while drinking. Kavanaugh retorted, No, have you? While male politicians often use their personal histories to make a point, Klobuchar presented a vulnerability in her questioning which is often missing in politics.\n\nWhen talking about economic disadvantages, Warren has invoked the story about how her aunt helped her watch her two kids while she worked. Otherwise she would have had to give up her career. Without child care, I was a goner. And I know how lucky I was because so many working moms don't have an Aunt Bea who can fly in and help out, Warren said at a keynote address to the National Women's Law Center in October.\n\nBut just because more women are running for president doesn't mean the stereotypes and other standards have disappeared. Indeed, the likeability factor that has long been a pesky measure disproportionately applied to women candidates, mustered its way to the national conversation early on.\n\nWarren, to whom critics have drawn misguided comparisons to Clinton, took the issue head on. I hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car! she tweeted from her seat on the Acela.\n\nGillibrand has also drawn comparisons to Clinton, as another blonde senator from New York. Clinton was often criticized as shrill and unlikeable, and female presidential candidates are already drawing unwelcome comparisons. Dittmar said that comparing current women candidates to past ones -- and to each other -- showed how women are still considered outliers in the political field.\n\nWe never assume that Mitt Romney was John McCain, Dittmar said, referring to the 2012 and 2008 Republican candidates for president. We assume and allow greater individuality and separation among male candidates than among women candidates.\n\nDuring a book tour stop at The View, Harris was asked about the likeability factor.\n\nDespite a woman's role in the world, there are still certain myths of what a woman can and cannot do, she said.\n\nSill, at least one candidate plans to lean into a gender archetype during her campaign: Gillibrand is aiming to carve out a niche in the crowded field by embracing the gender issue. I'm going to run for president of the United States because as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own, she said on the Colbert show.
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have taken down a video in which President Trump addressed his supporters as a mob of pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday afternoon. The sites said the video, in which Mr. Trump seemingly sympathized with protesters and repeated false claims about the election, contributed to ongoing violence and violated misinformation policies.\n\nTwitter and Facebook went a step further and locked the president's accounts.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that its block would remain in place through the end of the president's term and potentially indefinitely.\n\nWe believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, Zuckerberg said in a statement. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.\n\nTwitter froze the president's account for 12 hours and required him to take down the tweets. It said if he continues to violate Twitter rules after that, the @realdonaldtrump account will be permanently suspended.\n\nIn the now-removed video, Mr. Trump told his supporters: I know your pain. I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us — a claim he continues to make even after his own attorney general confirmed there was no evidence of such fraud and courts threw out his lawsuits.\n\nThe president continued in the video, But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\n\nWe have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anybody hurt, he said, before reverting to a message of defiance: ...There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country.\n\nBut we cant play into the hands of these people, he told his supporters. We love you. You're very special. You see what happens you see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel, but go home and go home in peace.\n\nTwitter first flagged the video and blocked Mr. Trump's followers from commenting, retweeting or liking the video, before taking it down and then locking his account for 12 hours. The president will have to remove the tweets in order for his account to be reinstated, Twitter said.\n\nAs a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C., we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy, it said in a tweet, adding a link to the policy, which bans manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes or posting false information about them.\n\nAs a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C., we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy. https://t.co/k6OkjNG3bM — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) January 7, 2021\n\nFacebook had initially said Wednesday that Mr. Trump would not be able to post on the platform or Instagram for 24 hours, before extending the ban Thursday.\n\nThe priority for the whole country must now be to ensure that the remaining 13 days and the days after inauguration pass peacefully and in accordance with established democratic norms, Zuckerberg said.\n\nGuy Rosen, who oversees Facebook's work on safety and integrity, tweeted Wednesday\n\nthat the social media site took down Mr. Trump's video as part of an emergency situation.\n\nWe removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence, Rosen said.\n\nThis is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence. — Guy Rosen (@guyro) January 6, 2021\n\nFacebook also stated Wednesday it is searching for and removing any content praising and support of the rioting in Washington, D.C. It is also removing content that calls to bring weapons to locations across the U.S., incites or encourages the events at the Capitol, calls for protests that violate the Washington, D.C. curfew, or attempts to restage violence in the coming days.\n\nWe are appalled by the violence at the Capitol today. We are treating these events as an emergency, Facebook said. Our Elections Operations Center has already been active in anticipation of the Georgia elections and the vote by Congress to certify the election, and we are monitoring activity on our platform in real time.\n\nYouTube told CBS News in a statement that the company removed the video from the president's channel because it violated our policies regarding content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Election.\n\nHowever, the company will allow copies of the video to be uploaded with additional context and sufficient educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA) value.\n\nThe video has remained live on the Trump campaign's Parler page, where it gained 1.3 million views as of Wednesday evening.
In this episode of Intelligence Matters, Michael Morell speaks with Will Wechsler, the director of Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council, about why the region is still of strategic importance to the U.S. Wechsler discusses the perception in the Middle East that the U.S. is withdrawing, the influx of young men in the region and the potential for more negotiations after the Abraham Accords.\n\nHighlights:\n\nWidespread perception of U.S. withdrawal in the Middle East: If I was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of American withdrawal. Now, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of Iraq or Afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. But if you compare it more historically, the United States really hasn't withdrawn. We still have a lot of military forces. Our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. But this perception remains. The perception is not without merit. The perception comes from actions that consecutive U.S. presidents have taken. It comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the United States.\n\nThe most dangerous people in any society: When you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. There are very few things that are true for every country in the world. But one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. Testosterone is a hell of a drug. There are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. They are attracted to destructive avenues.\n\nTies between Israel and the Gulf: What can be done right now are smaller achievements. What can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some Palestinian misery. I think actually over the long run, the Abraham Accords and growing ties between Israel and the Gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune.\n\nDownload, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher.\n\nPhoto provided by Will Wechsler, director of Atlantic Council's Middle East programs\n\nIntelligence Matters: Will Wechsler transcript\n\nProducer: Paulina Smolinski\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Welcome to Intelligence Matters, it is great to have you on the show.\n\nWILL WECHSLER: Thank you very much for having me.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: I should mention that I am on the board of the Atlantic Council, which is where you currently serve. Full transparency here to my listeners. I think that's important. Will, this episode is part of a series of episodes that we're doing between now and the inauguration on the key national security issues that we are facing as a nation and that President-Elect Biden will face. We started the conversation with H.R. McMaster, who gave us an overview of what's going on in the world. We've now done episodes on both China and North Korea. Today with you, we turn to the Middle East.\n\nLet me start by by asking you to explain why the Middle East is still important to the United States, even though we are now, as a nation, energy independent?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: U.S. policies change and presidents change, but our interests remain stable or at least long lasting until there are deep changes. One of those deep changes that has happened is that the United States, thanks to a fracking revolution, has become an exporter of oil instead of an importer of oil. That's a real change and that has important implications. However, that change can be overstated as well.\n\nWhat it really does mean is that, in the absolute worst scenarios, nobody can do to us what we did to Japan before World War Two, which is cut off our source of energy in context of a war. If worse comes to worse, we can go to autarchy. We can produce the energy that we need, at least the oil that we need, in the United States. That's a really good thing. But that doesn't mean that the United States is isolated from the world. It doesn't mean that the price of oil and energy and gas in the world doesn't affect the United States. The reality is that price is a global price and that price is not just dependent on US production. US energy producers do not give Americans a discount for being Americans. American consumers do not pay more for gas when it's produced in the United States. This is a global market.\n\nThe reality is that a very significant proportion of all that energy still comes out of the Middle East. Because of the nature of the sources of energy in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia still is the swing producer and has very disproportionate impact on those global energy prices. We saw that recently when because of a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia, Saudi Arabia decided to push energy prices into negative territory. Something that we have never seen. Thus, demonstrating their clout and their power in the world. These are realities in the world and realities that the United States policies have to take account for.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Are there other reasons why the Middle East is important? One of our key allies, Israel, sits right in the middle of it. Sources of extremism, refugees. Are there other reasons why we need to pay attention?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: Absolutely. The counterterrorism challenges that we all face are at a low ebb at the moment. But we've seen them be at the low ebb previously and we've seen them get much larger and more powerful and more directly threatening before. There's no reason to expect that can't happen again. We have a real concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons in this region, especially Iranian nuclear weapons.\n\nWe have a real concern about Israel. Israel is more secure and more prosperous than it's ever been before. But that doesn't mean that there are no threats to Israel anymore and a lot of which come from Iran and its proxies. We generally, ever since really the Eisenhower administration, have acted as a status quo power, trying to return the region to the status quo when it's been upset in order to build a foundation for general security and general prosperity in the region. Because we believe that overall serves US interests. We have a variety of those interests which aren't going away. Despite the very popular view out in the American public- that's expressed by people on both sides of the aisle in the Congress and almost everyone that was running for president that the United States- that we should do less in that part of the world. That doesn't mean that we should be doing nothing in that part of the world.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Do you find yourself more and more having to explain why the region is still important?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: Absolutely. There's a lot of reasons for that and very understandable reasons for that. For the last 20 years, starting with George W. Bush's war in Iraq, the United States really changed its policy that it had been following for roughly five decades before that. Instead of supporting the status quo, it became one of the most important threats to the status quo. On top of that, the failures and mistakes in the implementation of that policy has led a lot of people in the region and a lot of Americans to ask why are we still in this part of the world? Why should we be spending our treasure? Why should we be having our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines die for this part of the world? What's really in it for us? The president of the United States, President Trump, says this repeatedly, even when probably at the high point of his administration, at least in this part of the world, when he was announcing the recent Abraham accords between the United States and the United Arab Emirates, from the Oval Office, he couldn't control himself. He went off script and said, 'I don't know why we have any of our forces there protecting the energy resources anymore.'\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Big picture. Why has the Middle East been such a mess for so long?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: There are lots of reasons why the region is unstable. The most important of which is that the countries themselves are not natural countries in terms of aligning towards ethnic, tribal, religious lines. They have a lot of internal incohesion to them. They are relatively new countries. Many of them have not too distant colonial pasts, where there were lots of dysfunctions that were built into the colonial architecture that was created. The lines were drawn by European powers, and the minority groups were promoted by those colonial powers intentionally. That is still a destabilizing factor. Almost all these countries are fundamentally nondemocratic, which in the short term sometimes might have some advantages when it comes to stability, but over the longer term is inherently unstable.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: There seems to be a long-term struggle with governance in many of the countries in the region.\n\nWILL WECHSLER: Indeed, many of the leaders did not for many decades see their chief objective as improving the well-being of their populations. That's changed in some of the countries and the region. It will have to change if the region is going to become less stable over time. But when you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is as a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. There are very few things that are true for every country in the world. But one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. Testosterone is a hell of a drug. There are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. They are attracted to destructive avenues.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: How important is the strategic competition between Iran and its Sunni rivals with regard to stability in the region?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: It's very important right now. I can take one step back. I believe that today and actually for the last 5 or 10 years, there are a lot of different factors that are affecting trends in the region, lots of different micro factors that affect individual countries, lots of local rivalries. But if I was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of American withdrawal.\n\nNow, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of Iraq or Afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. But if you compare it more historically, the United States really hasn't withdrawn. We still have a lot of military forces. Our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. But this perception remains. The perception is not without merit. The perception comes from actions that consecutive US presidents have taken. It comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the United States. If you're a country in the region whose security architecture has depended for many decades on the United States, are you going to depend on that in the immediate future? Of course. But looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, these countries are not going to bet the existence of their country on the United States staying the course as it has. They already experienced this. Their fathers, in some cases, experienced this when the British left in the early 70s after promising that they would not leave.\n\nThis widespread perception exists and that perception itself is creating a vacuum that other actors are moving into. China is moving in economically, politically, to a degree. But not yet from a geostrategic point of view, China is very actively not trying to take the United States position, and they would much rather free ride off of our security guarantees for as long as as possible. But they're an important actor to note.\n\nBut aside from them, there are three other non-Arab powers that all have historical legacy aspirations in the region and have all been moving very actively, very aggressively into the region. Those are Iran, Turkey, and Russia. All of whom have advanced their position quite significantly and materially in the last number of years. If you look back historically, when any of those actors have tried to move into this region, they've had to confront the historic Arab powers in the region, those powers in Cairo, in Damascus and in Baghdad. The leaders in those cities were the ones that had the ear of the Arab street. They had the armies. They had disproportionate interest, disproportionate power, not only in their countries, but around the region. All of those places are at very weak moments in time right now. Cairo, Damascus, and Baghdad are unfortunately each closer to being a failed state than they are to being regional leaders.\n\nThe historical European powers with interests in the region are similarly either not capable or not willing largely to play any types of roles with the exception of France. But even France is limited in what it can do and wants to do, mainly to Lebanon and to some degree in North Africa. What's left is a coalition that should have emerged a while ago, but for a number of reasons didn't. But it's finally emerging now between states, Israel and the Gulf, that have largely been interested in their own defense, but not been larger regional players. They are coming together now to position themselves to be able to protect the region against massive encroachment from these non-Arab powers. Quite frankly, that's a good thing because a region that ends up being dominated by Iran or Turkey or Russia is not a region that serves our interests.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Let's start with Iran- its nuclear program, its regional ambitions, its malign behavior. How would you think about a strategy of dealing with the Iranians?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: I think the American strategy of dealing with the Iranians has to look really hard and learn the correct lessons from both the Obama administration and the Trump administration. In my view, the Obama administration was absolutely right to consider diplomacy with Iran on its nuclear program. The results of that diplomacy contributed indisputably to positive outcomes on the nuclear file. But there were some weaknesses with that approach. One of the key weaknesses was the division between the United States and its traditional friends and partners in the region, in particular Israel and the Gulf. A sustained approach to diplomacy has to bring those partners along with it rather than being perceived to be cutting them out. The Trump administration took a very different approach to this, a maximum pressure approach to to Iran. They got out of the nuclear deal formally, which I think was was a mistake. I don't think it was a mistake to add sanctions on Iran at all. In fact, the nuclear deal very specifically allowed for such sanctions to be increased on Iran as long as those sanctions weren't on the nuclear file. Unfortunately, Iran has a lot of other malign behavior in the region that merit sanctions. But the Trump administration decided to go a different path.\n\nThe big strategic problem with the Trump administration's approach was that internally it never really came to a conclusion about what the purpose of its maximum pressure campaign was. At the outset, there were groups in the Trump administration, some groups that just wanted to increase sanctions in order to make it more difficult for Iran to conduct its malign behaviors. There were other groups in the administration, I include the president of the United States in this group, that wanted to increase sanctions in order to get to a 'better negotiated outcome.' There were other groups that really saw this as an opportunity to promote regime change. Unfortunately, the devil is in the details. The way one goes about constructing a sanctions regime differs depending on which outcome you desire. The way that the sanction regime was constructed appears to be most in line with the people who wanted regime change and not in line with people who wanted to facilitate additional negotiations. What I think we should do now, what I hope an incoming Biden administration does, is opens the door for diplomacy, but use the leverage that the Trump administration gives it with the existing sanctions to try to drive a hard bargain that would bring our partners along with it.\n\nOur partners in the region, the Arab countries on the western side of the of the Persian Gulf and Israel, they only one year ago all sent emissaries rushing to Washington because they were terrified that the maximum pressure campaign was driving them in a direction of a regional war with them on the front lines. They want to de-escalate as well. So I hope the goal is de-escalation. I hope the goal is confidence building measures. I'm a little skeptical, quite frankly, about whether or not a new nuclear agreement can be reached. I think that Iran has turned much more hard line. In the interim, windows of opportunity open and close for such things. I hope I'm wrong on that. But I don't see a downside in trying.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Second issue is extremism, ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and al-Qaida in Syria. What should the U.S. role be here?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: The Salafi jihadist terrorist groups are different from other kinds of terrorist groups, are different from other kind of Islamic terrorist groups, are different from other kinds of Sunni Islamic terrorist groups. We find that with terrorist organizations that have this particular kind of ideology, wherever they are able to achieve a degree of physical sanctuary where they believe that they can act with impunity, they have a one hundred percent record of doing external attacks. That's just a sad reality. Our goal should be to deny them that kind of sanctuary.\n\nThe United States has tried a lot of different approaches to achieving that goal. We've tried invading and occupying countries. We've tried dropping hell fires from the sky to take out high value targets. What we've learned is that the most effective way of combating these kinds of terrorist adversaries is indirectly, is working by, with, and through the local actors who can themselves conduct these kinds of counterterrorism missions. Sometimes these are through military channels. Sometimes through intelligence channels. Sometimes these are through law enforcement channels. Sometimes that effort involves the United States doing nothing more than passing information and allowing our friends and partners to take action. But sometimes it takes more. Sometimes it takes efforts to equip these partners, to train these partners, to advise these partners, to assist them in what they do and sometimes even to accompany them on their missions.\n\nAll of these are different fundamentally than direct action, where the United States has to do it on its own and and has to do the finish against these terrorist actors. What I hope is that the United States doesn't look at the world as it is today where al-Qaida and the Islamic State have, thanks to great work that people like you were doing for quite a long period of time, has been diminished. And imagine that current state will be the state in the future. As long as there are underlying Sunni grievances in so many of these places, we will find young men who will be attracted to this Salafi jihadist ideology and we'll need to work with our partners to disrupt their external attacks. At the same time, we need to do the kind of work to prevent the extremism from catching on. Helping our partners change their educational system, provide more economic opportunities. Here, the United States isn't the the largest actor, the most important actor at all. We're not going to be the ones that are going to win the ideological battle for the heart of of Islam. But we can do things to avoid making it more difficult for our partners, and we can assist our partners. That's necessary.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Next is the two-sided coin. That is Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia. One side of the coin being the reformer, the other side of the coin being the autocrat.\n\nHow should the United States should approach Saudi Arabia?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: We can't write off Saudi Arabia, let's just say that out front. We have interests. There are a number of countries around the world where there are challenges to working with them. Turkey is another one. It'd be a mistake to write off any of these countries. I include Saudi Arabia in that category. However, there are real challenges with with Mohammed bin Salman. If I can take one step back, right now, Saudi Arabia, no matter who's running Saudi Arabia, they really have three existential threats. I don't use the word existential lightly. The first threat is from a transition in leadership that is not yet finished. Saudi Arabia, like it or not, is a monarchy. Anybody who has watched Game of Thrones knows the particular dynamics that come into effect when a transition in the monarchy is not finished. This is a particularly challenging transition as compared to other transitions that have happened in Saudi Arabia, because it's a transition to a new branch of the family. It's a transition to a new generation in the family. It's a transition in the fundamental way of doing business in Saudi Arabia from a very consultative, collaborative model to a more centralized model. That's the first existential challenge. Until that's complete, that will continue.\n\nThe other challenges, the need for reform on virtually every aspect of Saudi society. This one, Mohammed bin Salman has recognized in a way that none of his predecessors had. That's a really good thing. It's a really challenging set of problems that they have economically, socially, politically and so forth. When Franklin Roosevelt met with Mohammed bin Salman's grandfather, I think Saudi Arabia had about three million people and now it has roughly ten times that. Saudi Arabia is a rich country, but it's a country that has lots of poor people in it. We've already talked about the challenges of having young men that are aimless. There's a massive need for reform in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe third one is Iran. If you're sitting in Riyadh as compared to 20 years ago, you see Iran vastly expanding its placement and access and encircling you. It trying to- whether it's in Iran, Iraq, Syria or in Yemen- trying to build in Yemen the kind of threat against Saudi Arabia from the South that they've been able to build over the decades against Israel from its north. So these are really huge issues. The person that has to deal with them, Mohammed bin Salman, is somebody who was not trained all his life to deal with these problems. Most Americans know the story of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That was a horrible crime. In the old line in War and Peace, 'It was worse than a crime. It was a mistake.' It really set Saudi Arabia back, but it was not isolated. It was the end to a year and a half of poor, rash decision makings by Mohammed bin Salman on a series of of issues. It wasn't like Mohammed bin Salman was inventing problems, but the the way that he chose to deal with these problems made the individual problem worse. One hopes that MBS, if he is able to move from crown prince to King, that he has learned from that experience because we could all be living in a world where he's going to be the king for many decades to come and our interests will remain there for quite a long time. If he has not learned from that experience that he's had, then we're in for a very bad situation.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: I have two more issues I want to cover. The first is the Israeli-Palestinian issue. How do you think about that?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: There is not a very high probability of a solution for the Israeli-Palestinian problem today. The only real solution, the only lasting solution is a two state solution. That's really clear to anybody who's looked at it. Unless you want to imagine solutions that are really horrific. The challenge is that the circumstances are not set at the moment for those kinds of negotiations to continue. I suspect it's going to require generational change. We've had three U.S. presidents in a row, Bill Clinton, Condi Rice under George W. Bush, and John Kerry under Barack Obama, who spent a wildly disproportionate amount of their time trying to get to a holistic solution to this problem. All of which have failed. I don't think a fourth attempt is going to do any better in these circumstances. What can be done right now are smaller achievements. What can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some Palestinian misery. I think over the long run, the Abraham accords and growing ties between Israel and the Gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: What's the one piece of advice that you would give to President-Elect Biden on the region?\n\nWILL WECHSLER: The one piece of advice is to really understand how much the perception of American withdrawal is affecting the region and how much his personal relationships with leaders there will be able to impact their continued thinking on that subject.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Will, thank you so much for joining us. It's been a real education on the region, which I think is absolutely necessary at this time.\n\nWILL WECHSLER: Thank you so much for having me.
Produced by Alec Sirken, Marc Goldbaum, Paul LaRosa, Chris Young Ritzen, James Stolz and Aimee deSimone.\n\nIt's Friday night in Quincy, Illinois, and thousands have come out to cheer for the home team.\n\nThe Quincy High School Blue Devils is a revered, legendary program. One of the winningest programs in high school history, said local journalist Bob Gough, who swaps his keyboard for a microphone and moonlights as the announcer.\n\nIf you're a local sports star, you know people are always wanting to know about you, he said.\n\nAnd no one was bigger than Blue Devil's Hall of Famer Curtis Lovelace. In the 1980s, he made headlines as a star athlete and scholar at Quincy High School.\n\nCurtis Lovelace was a star student athlete at Quincy High School\n\nCurtis Lovelace was a very hard working kid, smart kid, said Gough.\n\nAnd the University of Illinois gave Lovelace - #54 -- a scholarship to play football.\n\nI mean Quincy, Illinois, doesn't produce a ton of All-Big Ten players, Gough noted.\n\nHe wasn't just any player. Lovelace, who studied business administration, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the Big Ten -- a team captain who lead the University of Illinois to the Big Ten Championship his senior year.\n\nWas two-time All-Big Ten, even got a look in free agent camp in the NFL, Gough explained. Had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn't help the situation. But being a smart kid Curtis already had other goals in mind.\n\nWhile at school, Curtis started a long distance relationship with Cory Didriksen. They met in high school, but only started dating when they left for college. She was studying communications at the University of Iowa.\n\nShe just had a perfect smile, Cory's mother, Marty Didriksen, told CBS affiliate KHQA. And she just smiled at everyone. And she just did stuff.\n\nCory was vibrant, dynamic. A little bit of stubbornness, and she was a pistol and I loved her for that. I think that was her most endearing quality, said friend Steve Belko.\n\nBelko, Beth Dobrzynski and Bret Schrader grew up with Cory and Curtis in Quincy.\n\nCurt was easygoing he was a gentleman, fun loving, intelligent - a gentlemen, said Belko.\n\nDo you think they were well matched? Maher asked the group of friends.\n\nI did. I did. Well, they looked great together, but they had a lot of similarities and they seemed to have fun together, Dobrzynski replied.\n\nIt didn't take long before their relationship became serious.\n\nIt was Thanksgiving. We were sitting up on her bed. And we were just kinda talking about things and she said, 'Oh, by the way, I've met the man I'm going to marry,' said Didriksen.\n\nCurtis and Cory Lovelace Marty Didriksen\n\nIn 1991, just one year after graduation, they were married. Belko was Curt's best man and Dobrzynski was Cory's bridesmaid.\n\nIt was one of the best days, you know, in our lives, said Belko.\n\nCory was beautiful. It was a great night. They were very happy. The pictures you know, you could see on their faces. Whether it was cutting the cake or dancing or walking around and talking to people. It was a magical night, Dobrzynski reminisced.\n\nWith Cory by his side, Curtis Lovelace had grand plans. He attended law school and eventually became an assistant state's attorney in the city they both loved, Quincy.\n\nWhat did Cory want to do with her life? ... What were her dreams? Maher asked Dobrzynski.\n\nCory was all about family. She had a great childhood growing up, she replied. She wanted the big family. ...The happy marriage.\n\nThe Lovelace family Marty Didriksen\n\nThat dream came true in 1993, when their first child, Lyndsay, was born. They would later have three sons: Logan, Lincoln, and Larson.\n\nShe was a beautiful person, Lyndsay Lovelace said of her mother.\n\nLyndsay, now 22, told KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler how she and her mother loved listening to the music group ABBA.\n\nWe would just have girl moments and just dance around and sing 'Dancing Queen.' I still listen to them because it brings me so much joy from that, she said.\n\nLyndsay's dad was a man on the move. In 2005, he opened up his own law firm while still at the state's attorney's office. Years later, he left to concentrate on his own practice. And, if his schedule wasn't busy enough, Lovelace was elected president of the school board. He became a captain in the Illinois National Guard, and an adjunct professor at Quincy University.\n\nHe definitely was a pillar of this community, no question about it, Gough remarked.\n\nBut friends say with power, came ego.\n\nI just felt he kinda started to talk down to me more and more each time I saw him, said Schrader.\n\nWas he arrogant? Maher asked.\n\nHe became arrogant more and more, yes, Belko said. There was a little bit of holier than thou. ...Maybe you were entitled to this living. I think he lost friends over time because of that.\n\nThe situation at home had also been changing. While Curtis had spent years focused on his professional life, the long hours away from Cory and the kids were starting to take a toll on their personal life.\n\nFrom what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said Gough.\n\nNeighbors around the Lovelace house on Kentucky Street say that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between Cory and Curtis. By many accounts, both were heavy drinkers. And in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous amount of turmoil in their home.\n\nShe suffered from bulimia. This is something her family has admitted, Dreasler said. And the rumors started coming out. ...Known alcoholism. The community knew that too. There've been people who've even told me ... I saw her out drinking here or out drinking there. People knew that she had an alcohol problem, but I don't think that they knew to the extent.\n\nCory and Curtis Lovelace Steve Belko\n\nAmazingly, Curtis and Cory managed to keep their problems from their closest friends, like Belko, who years before, had moved away from their small town.\n\nWas there a point in time where any of you started to see things changing between the two of them? Maher asked the friends.\n\nNo, said Belko.\n\nNo indication that there was trouble coming up? Maher asked.\n\nI never had any, Belko replied.\n\nCory was a great person, very confident, she had everything under control. And she wasn't one to you know whine or complain, Dobrzynski said. She could handle it.\n\nBut everything fell apart on Valentine's Day 2006, when Belko got a call from Curtis's father that Cory had died.\n\nHe said, 'Listen I got some bad news.' ...And I just couldn't believe it. No, that doesn't happen. She's my age. She's healthy. This just doesn't come from nowhere, Belko said. Something's wrong. There was no doubt something is terribly wrong.\n\nVALENTINE'S DAY MYSTERY\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2006, love was in the crisp winter air of Quincy, Illinois. At 1869 Kentucky, it was a school day and Cory Lovelace would usually have her hands full.\n\nCory was a stay at home mom, Gough explained. She was always hustling, always trying to get the kids wrangled around and to where they needed to be.\n\nThat morning seemed like so many others. According to Curtis Lovelace, Cory helped get the kids ready. They had breakfast and jumped in dad's car. It was 8:15 a.m.\n\nCurtis then took the three oldest children to school, Gough said. They left the youngest, the 4-year-old, there.\n\nAnd little 4-year-old Larson went upstairs to see his mom.\n\nWent in and he said that he said her name and he thought he poked her. But she didn't answer, Dreasler explained. So he ... sat and waited for his dad to get home.\n\nThen when he got back, the youngest was still there ... said something that he couldn't wake his mom up, said Gough.\n\nBy then, it was about 9 a.m.\n\nCurt went upstairs to use the restroom and glanced back in the bedroom and saw something wasn't right. Went in to see Cory, tried to shake her. And nothing, said Belko.\n\nThat was the moment a normal Valentine's Day morning turned into a mystery. Behavior turned suddenly strange, starting with Curtis Lovelace.\n\nTook the youngest to Cory's mother's house. Gave the youngest child to Cory's mother and said, 'Cory's dead' and left, Gough said. The first call was not to 911. The first call was not to the paramedics. The first call was his boss, the state's attorney.\n\nStill strikes you as odd, Maher noted.\n\nVery much so, said Gough.\n\nWho walks over to their mother-in-law's house, gives them their youngest ... and says, 'Your daughter's dead, here's my child. Take care of him,' Maher commented.\n\nThe whole scenario was bizarre, said Gough.\n\nWas Curtis Lovelace in shock?\n\nPeople do process grief differently, sure. If it was my wife, I think I'd have called 911 screaming and ranting and trying to perform CPR, which he didn't do, said Gough.\n\nThe grim details of the day would be embedded in the minds of those who were there. E.M.T Cole Miller was among the first on the scene.\n\nShe was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest, he explained, holding up his arms to show how Cory's were positioned. And I went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff.\n\nIt was just surreal, said Dobrzynski.\n\nWhen I did find out I was very shocked, said Schrader.\n\nWhat happened in the house that morning, when it happened -- just how long Cory Lovelace had been dead -- would be questions that would haunt a town and destroy a family.\n\nShe'd been dead long enough that there was no need to start CPR. It wouldn't do any good, said Miller.\n\nQuincy Police Detective Jeff Baird would not speak to 48 Hours. But that day he did speak with Curtis, who told his version of events -- a morning Curtis swears to police and to friends, Cory was still very much alive.\n\nWhat did he say happened? Maher asked Steve Belko.\n\nThat Cory had been ill the night before ... had thrown up and wanted some Tylenol and he got her some, he explained. Apparently she did come down to help. He told me he just remembers her at the bottom of the steps, they walked out and he took the kids to school.\n\nAccording to Curtis, his wife Cory was not feeling well that Valentine's Day morning. She came down the stairs and sat down for a while. Detective Baird said that three of the children also told him they saw their mother alive that morning.\n\nHe interviewed the three oldest children. Those interviews were not recorded, video or audio. He just took notes and then turned in a report in which he spoke to the three oldest children individually, without their father being there. And they all told him they had seen their mother that morning, said Gough.\n\nWhy is the time Cory Lovelace died so critical? Ask a man who deals in death for a living, Deputy Coroner James Keller. That Valentine's Day morning, he was there to transport Cory's body.\n\nUpon entering the bedroom, I notice the female lying on the bed on her back with her hands kind of in an upright position, Keller explained.\n\nCan you show me? Maher asked.\n\nHands kind of above her, he said, holding his arms up, elbows bent, in front of his chest. Kind of this direction here ... a very odd position.\n\nHowever long Cory Lovelace had been dead, to Keller it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had set in -- a process he says usually takes close to 12 hours.\n\nShe was in the state of full rigor, said Keller.\n\nFull rigor? Maher asked.\n\nFull rigor, he affirmed.\n\nAlmost like a mannequin? Maher asked.\n\nCorrect.\n\nFully stiff?\n\nFully stiff.\n\nKeller was told that Cory saw the kids off to school, handing one a Valentine's class project. And someone on the scene told Keller Cory Lovelace had died in the morning.\n\nKeller's response to that was, What day?\n\nDid it make any sense to you that they were saying it was that morning? Maher asked.\n\nIt did not, Keller said. It just didn't seem to add up.\n\nOver the years, James Keller has learned one undeniable truth of his trade: the dead do speak.\n\nA body always tells a story the way you find them, he said.\n\nWhat is the story that Cory's body was telling you? Maher asked.\n\nThat she had passed earlier that prior evening or day, Keller replied.\n\nTen to 12 hours earlier, possibly?\n\nCorrect. Yes ma'am, Keller affirmed.\n\nBut that medical assessment of time of death wasn't matching what Curtis and the kids were saying -- that Cory has been alive that morning.\n\nIt was just not what she was telling. It was just not what she was saying, said Keller.\n\nDid you tell anybody about that afterwards and as the inquisition went on? Maher asked.\n\nThere's numerous people ... the coroner Gary Hamilton, he replied. ... everybody had some reservations, maybe concerns.\n\nJames Keller was a deputy coroner at the time, second to sitting coroner Gary Hamilton, who was also at the Lovelace home. An autopsy, including toxicology test, was conducted the day after Cory was found dead, and Hamilton signed off. The cause of death was undetermined.\n\nWell 'undetermined' ... if you don't have a cause ... leaving it 'undetermined' was the right thing to do, said Keller.\n\nDespite the odd position of Cory's arms and despite an unexplained cut on her lip, two days later, at her mother's request, Cory Lovelace was cremated and Quincy police officially closed the investigation.\n\nAnd life went on? Maher asked Gough.\n\nYeah, he said.\n\nNobody cared to look deeper?\n\nNope.\n\nEight years would pass, and then a curious cop followed a hunch.\n\nYou had a detective in the Quincy Police Department, Adam Gibson, Gough explained.\n\nAnd lookin' at the photos ... and with -- with Cory's body bein' in that condition, it just -- it just didn't make sense to me, said Det. Gibson.\n\nA FRESH LOOK AT THE CASE\n\nWithin six months after the mysterious death of his wife, Cory, on Valentine's Day 2006, Curtis Lovelace rekindled his love life and began dating a student in a class he taught at Quincy University. The woman, named Erica, was eight years his junior. They married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, Lyndsay, didn't get along. Lyndsay became estranged from her father.\n\nLyndsay, apparently, didn't have a place in that family. Why, I don't know, said Steve Belko.\n\nLyndsay then moved out of her father's house and in with her grandmother Marty Didriksen, Cory's mom.\n\nCurt chose his second wife over his daughter, said Belko.\n\nMarriage number two fell apart in 2013.\n\nBut once again, Curtis Lovelace didn't stay single for long. He got married for a third time months after his divorce in 2013, this time to his current wife, Christine, whom he had known in high school and reconnected with years later.\n\nChristine and Curtis Lovelace Christine Lovelace\n\nHe is a funny, charming, sweet, kind, compassionate, wonderful husband, she told 48 Hours. We're actually best friends.\n\nWhile the end of 2013 marked a new beginning for Curtis and Christine ...\n\nWe'd go on dates not typical of romantic date nights -- eat fried chicken, go across the bridge to Missouri, have hot fudge sundaes with extra cherries, she said.\n\n... it was around that same time that a newly-promoted detective at the Quincy Police Department, Adam Gibson, took a fresh look at Cory's death.\n\nSometimes it takes fresh eyes to see things, said Det. Gibson.\n\nAnd I was at the office ... just reading old case files, and the Lovelace case popped into my head, he said.\n\nThe more Det. Gibson read about the 8-year-old case, the more he was intrigued.\n\nWhat in that file made you say, 'Huh, I'm gonna go find the pictures and the hard copy of this file? Maureen Maher asked the detective.\n\nJust the general description of the position of her hands, he replied.\n\nAnd when you saw the pictures, what was your first reaction?\n\nIt did not appear to me that could've been a natural death, said Det. Gibson.\n\nA drawing by artist Bill Beard of a graphic photo of Cory Lovelace\n\nThe pictures show Cory's body in bed - lifeless, but with her arms bent at the elbows and bizarrely frozen in the air.\n\nThat didn't really make sense, and there was no real explanation for 'em, said Det. Gibson.\n\nGibson consulted King County Coroner James Keller, who was the deputy coroner in 2006.\n\nIt bothered me for years, said Keller.\n\nSo when you found out that Detective Gibson was moving forward, what was your reaction? Maher asked.\n\nI think it -- it is definitely time to open, Keller replied.\n\nDetective Gibson kept investigating the old case secretly, out of the public eye. He consulted the original pathologist, Dr. Jessica Bowman, who had ruled the death undetermined. Bowman told Gibson she would no longer participate in the case, but sent him for another opinion to another pathologist she knew in Chicago, Dr. Shaku Teas.\n\nShe said basically that she saw nothing suspicious about the death, Det. Gibson said of Dr. Tea's ruling.\n\nSo why wasn't that the end of it for you? I mean, you have Dr. Bowman who says undetermined, you have now Dr. Shaku Teas, who is accredited and is telling you, 'look it's undetermined, I don't see a problem with it,' Maher asked the detective.\n\nBecause I didn't believe that the information that Dr. Teas had given was credible to what I already knew, he replied.\n\nSo Det. Gibson sought yet another opinion. Enter Dr. Jane Turner, an assistant medical examiner in St. Louis.\n\nWhat do you remember as the first thing that struck you about that file? Was there anything in there that you looked at and said, 'Well, that's interesting,' Maher asked Dr. Turner.\n\nYes. It was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the position of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a surface. They were almost suspended in air, which tells me that there was ... an object that had been there previously that had been removed, she replied.\n\nCould you show me, put ... my arms in the position that you saw Cory Lovelace's body in while she was laying down still in the bed? Maher asked Dr. Turner.\n\nSo she was on her back. And her arms were like this. A little bit lower than that, she replied, positioning Maher's arms, as shown in the photo above.\n\nAnd-- if they were stuck in this position, they're in rigor-- what does that tell you at that point? Maher asked.\n\nWell, that more time has passed than the witness stated, Dr. Turner replied.\n\nThe witness being Curtis Lovelace, who said he had talked to his wife less than an hour before finding her dead.\n\nIn my report, I stated 10 to 12 hours. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. And with her arms in that position, which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that position, suggests to me that she was in full rigor, said Dr. Turner.\n\nBased on the photos, the autopsy report and police reports, Dr. Turner pinpointed the cause of death: suffocation at the hands of another.\n\nWhat did you determine would have caused the suffocation? Maher asked.\n\nWell, with the position of the hands, it suggests that there was an object between her hands and her body. ...And it appears that there is a pillow missing, Dr. Turner replied. So I suppose that a pillow was used to suffocate her.\n\nWhile Det. Gibson had a new timeline and a cause of death, he also had one big problem. Remember, the three oldest Lovelace children insisted they saw their mother alive that morning, sitting on the stairs.\n\nThe one thing I do know is, the science of Cory Lovelace doesn't match that story, said Gibson.\n\nGibson believes the children may have simply been mistaken. Maybe that's because they weren't interviewed by the original detective, Jeff Baird, until two days after their mother's death. But if Curtis Lovelace did kill his wife the night before, as Dr. Turner believes, what was his motive?\n\nWas there a life insurance policy, Maher ask Gough.\n\n...he said there was no life insurance, he replied.\n\nWas he having an affair?\n\nI have not heard that, said Gough.\n\nSo what's the motive? What does he gain? Maher asked.\n\n...he told one of the witnesses that their last 90 days of their marriage hadn't been good, Gough replied.\n\nPeople fight and argue all the time, Maher noted to Det. Gibson.\n\nThat's true, he said.\n\nHow did it lead to murder in this situation? Maher asked.\n\nThat's the million-dollar question, Det. Gibson replied.\n\nA new detective ... found a doctor to give him the answer he was looking for. There's not one bit of evidence ... that Cory ... was murdered, said Christine Lovelace.\n\nHow certain are you now that Curtis Lovelace murdered his wife, Cory?\n\nI'm 100 percent certain. The science tells me that, said Det. Gibson.\n\nA BATTLE OF EXPERTS\n\nIn August 2014, eight years after the death of Cory Lovelace, Curtis Lovelace was leaving his law office at lunchtime when police confronted him - and arrested him for his wife's murder.\n\nNobody had any idea that this was, this was happening. None of the local media, said KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler.\n\nThe same day as a grand jury indictment comes down, he's arrested in broad daylight, cuffed and stuffed right outside his law office and taken down to booking, said local journalist Bob Gough.\n\nA good friend who works for a news station in Quincy, he texted me ... said 'Christine, Curt's been arrested for Cory's murder,' Christine Lovelace told 48 Hours. I said,'that makes no sense, Cory was not murdered.'\n\nThere was nothing to prepare us for this, it was probably worst day of my life, she said.\n\nThe former golden boy would spend the next 17 months in jail, held on $5 million bond.\n\nI was a little stunned, friend Steve Belko said. He looked old, haggard. Something I'd never seen before.\n\nCurtis Lovelace pleaded not guilty, awaiting his trial until just over three weeks ago.\n\nA decade after Cory Lovelace's death, the murder trial of her husband was about to begin at the Adams County Courthouse. After hearing all the evidence, it may come down to just one question for the jury: Do they believe Cory's children, who say they saw their mother alive that morning? Or do they believe two medical examiners who insist the science says she was killed the night before?\n\nSome of the jurors who would decide Curtis' fate spoke with 48 Hours.\n\nAnd by show of hands, how many of you knew Curtis Lovelace and his family or knew of them prior to this? Maher asked the group. Four of the six jurors raised their hands. OK, so a majority of who are here.\n\nIs it the trial of century in Quincy? Maher asked Gough. Yes, he replied.\n\nAnd why is that, just because of who he is?\n\nYes. Absolutely, Gough replied. I mean, bigger they come, the harder they fall.\n\nQuincy was consumed with this trial on social media and in the coffee shops.\n\nI don' think the case should've been brought to start with ... all they got is circumstantial evidence, no smoking guns, a resident told 48 Hours.\n\nThe prosecution laid out its dramatic case -- that Curtis Lovelace smothered his wife, Cory, the mother of his four children, with a pillow the night before Valentine's Day.\n\nJurors heard from world-renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Jane Turner. They both testified that Cory had to have died the night before.\n\nIt's the whole picture -- she had drying artifact of her lips. She had drying artifact of her eyes. Again, something that develops with the passage of time after death, Dr. Turner told Maher. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. And with her arms in that position ... suggests to me that she was in full rigor.\n\nThe prosecution uses Dr. Turner to explain how a cut found during the autopsy on Cory's lip was caused by her being suffocated.\n\nThere's a bruise on the inside of the lip and -- and with it a laceration. And that's from blunt force trauma. So some forceful pressure was applied to the mouth, she explained.\n\nBut then, in this battle of the experts, the defense counters with their own, Dr. George Nichols. He says Cory most likely died of causes related to an enlarged liver due to drinking and her bulimia.\n\nI think she died as a result of natural diseases related to her liver disease. But the corroborative tests to confirm that were not performed, so I cannot come to that conclusion scientifically, said Dr. Nichols.\n\nMy opinion is, there's no proof that this woman was murdered, he said.\n\nAnd as to Dr. Turner's claim that the degree of rigor mortis shows she had to be dead 10 to 12 hours?\n\nAs I said repeatedly in there, rigor mortis does not occur at a specific, fixed time. There's huge variability from person to person, Dr. Nichols stated.\n\nFurther, he said, Dr. Turner was only working from photos -- she never actually saw Cory's body in person.\n\nAnd as to that single cut on Cory's lip? Nonsense, says Dr. Nichols.\n\nThat's eliminated, because she does not have sufficient injuries to the inner surface of her lips, he told 48 Hours.\n\nBut she did have that one injury, a 48 Hours producer pointed out.\n\nOne. Not multiple. How many teeth do I have? Dr. Nichols said, showing his teeth. OK? Each of those is capable of making at least one, if not more, injuries to the inside of my lips as I'm fighting back against someone who's holding a pillow over me.\n\nIf the testimony of the dueling pathologists had jurors scratching their heads, it was in stark contrast to the testimony of the Lovelace boys, which clearly pulled at their hearts.\n\nThe kids will be in my mind probably forever, said juror Theresa Tarr.\n\nThe prosecution called the youngest son, Larson, who was 4 years old at the time of his mother's death, who recounts his story about poking mommy to wake her up. Juror Theresa Tarr was struck by the image.\n\nIt was an emotional testimony, she said. Thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional.\n\nMy children have dealt with enough pain in their life for them to feel any kind of pain, an emotional Christine Lovelace said.\n\nThen, the defense called the two older sons, Logan, now 18, and dressed in his military uniform, and Lincoln, now 17. A normally stoic Curtis breaks down when each of the two older boys takes the stand, recounting how Curtis came to school that day to tell them their mother had died.\n\nNews report: This is the first day we saw any real emotion out of Curtis Lovelace as he broke down in tears as his two oldest sons took the stand.\n\nBoth boys emphatically tell the court, they are 100 percent certain they saw their mother alive that morning. Logan said he even remembers asking his ailing mom if he could stay home from school to take care of her.\n\nThere are people who have accused the kids of lying, that's not who the kids are, Christine Lovelace said. Kids will share experiences as they know them, not what they're told to.\n\nAnd then came Lyndsay, the final key testimony for the prosecution. She was 12 at the time her mother died, and now she's the star witness at her father's trial.\n\nSo how important is Lyndsay's testimony? Maher asked Gough.\n\nOh, it's critical. It's the whole ballgame, he replied.\n\nUp until this trial, Lyndsay had always insisted she saw her mother alive that morning. But now, at age 22, and under oath in the courtroom, she says can't be sure about what she remembers from that day.\n\nAnd I've had a long time to think about that and it's almost frustrating not to remember, because you want to, she said in an interview with Dreasler.\n\nAnd yet, immediately afterwards, defense attorneys show a videotape made just two years earlier, where Lyndsay tells Det. Adam Gibson she absolutely remembers seeing her mom alive that morning.\n\nIn the end, if you can't, you can't remember, she said. ...and just say, 'I'm sorry. It was 10 years ago I can't remember.'\n\nWere you surprised by Lyndsay's testimony when she got up and said, Now I don't remember. I can't definitively say anything? Maher asked Det. Gibson.\n\nYeah. You never know what anybody is gonna say, he replied.\n\nLyndsay changing her story, the testimony of her brothers, and the dueling medical experts -- it all had the jurors heads spinning.\n\nShe didn't remember, and that, to me, was very hard. Because two years earlier, she had given a statement to Adam Gibson, that she remembered a lot, said jury foreperson Adam Buss.\n\nIn the course of deliberations, I changed my mind, said juror Mike Hayden.\n\nYou answer one question. But it spawns another question, Maher noted.\n\nRight, another juror agreed.\n\nJURORS WEIGH THE CASE\n\nOn Feb. 4 2016, closing arguments begin. Curtis Lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his own murder trial. His new wife, Christine, says the trial has taken a toll -- especially on Curtis' sons.\n\nWe know that everyday the focus is bringing their father and my husband home, she said. It's so cumbersome to be raising a family while we're still doing all that we're doing. We're managing, it's difficult but we're managing.\n\nFor Det. Adam Gibson, who started it all, the stakes couldn't be any higher.\n\nI want people to remember Cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told Maher. The jury will decide if somebody took that life from her.\n\nAnd you'll live with the decision, whatever it is? Maher asked.\n\nWhatever it is, Det. Gibson replied.\n\nBut that decision may not be so easy.\n\nThe length of time that it takes for rigor mortis to set in, I think I've heard it a half a dozen different ways, so I'm not sure. And if I'm not sure, I'm not sure a jury member is sure, Gough pointed out.\n\nHow many of you thought it boiled down to you either believed the kids, or you believed the science? Maher asked the group of jurors. All six raised their hands.\n\nGoing back on the hands thing, that was the most debated thing in that deliberation room, as far as I'm concerned, juror Adam Buss said. I mean, we had jury members on the floor, you know, just - 'How do we lay? How you know, do we hold the covers?'\n\nJury members got on the floor -- put themselves in this position like this. To try and figure it out, Maher commented.\n\nRight, said Buss.\n\nAnd did that help? Did the show-and-tell of it help you?\n\nIt did. But it--it almost left more questions than answers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile across town, Lyndsay Lovelace -- estranged from her father, stepmother and brothers -- awaited the verdict from the comfort of the home she shares with her grandmother.\n\nYeah, we need a verdict. We need some kind of closure -- some kind, said Steve Belko.\n\nAnd hopefully the boys, the family, the grandparents--that everybody can get back together again someday down in the future, said Beth Dobrzynski.\n\nIf found guilty, Curtis Lovelace could spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nI haven't gotten a lot of sleep in the last year-and-a-half. Every minute is spent thinking about what we could we be doing ... with the goal of bringing Curtis home and proving his innocence, said Christine Lovelace.\n\nAfter 16 1/2 hours of jury deliberations over two days, Lyndsay received that much anticipated call.\n\nBreaking news here inside the Adams County Courthouse. Judge Hardwick did just now declare a mistrial, Jenny Dreasler reported.Curtis' current wife could be seen sobbing ... the three Lovelace boys all holding hands before that verdict was reached.\n\nIt was unreal and ... I felt so empty and out of breathe and the only thing I could do was hug my kids and let them know it is going to be OK and it is going to be OK, Christine Lovelace said of the jury's decision.\n\nThis is just dragging it out more. But if they're hung, they're hung. And there's nothing we can do about it. We just wait for the next round, Lyndsay said of the outcome.\n\nIt's set for retrial. And we plan to retry it, said Prosecutor Ed Parkinson.\n\nIf there's no new evidence, how do you paint it in a different light and not put yourself in a position of a hung jury again? Maher asked.\n\nMaybe not paint in a different light. Might paint it in the same light and with a different jury, he replied.\n\nBut this jury fought until the end.\n\nDid it ever become contentious? Maher asked the six jurors.\n\nIt did. I think, probably five of the jurors said, 'There is no way anybody is ever gonna change my mind.' And two of those, I think, were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror Mike Hayden said. And that just deflated me so much.\n\nJoyce ... you believe he did it? Maher asked.\n\nI believe he did it, said Stevens.\n\nHe's not guilty. And they didn't prove it to me, said Tarr.\n\nI had a feeling, after that first day, we weren't gonna come to a unanimous decision, said Stevens.\n\nWe're stuck, Maher noted.\n\nIt was pretty -- it was pretty obvious, Stevens affirmed.\n\nSteve, do you think that Curt killed Cory? Maher asked Steve Belko.\n\nI don't know. I don't wanna believe it. Because everything I know about Curt, he could not have done it. And -- I don't even know if it would've been done in a crime of passion, he replied. I think of Cory on that. Because I know Cory is -- is one tough cookie. She'd have fought to the death to defend her children.\n\nI don't hear anyone in this little triad saying, 'No way, no how, he didn't do it,' Maher said to the Lovelace's friends. There's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'My friend didn't do it.'\n\nI wouldn't go that far. I'm not entirely sure, said Belko.\n\nI wouldn't go that far, either, said Beth Dobrzynski.\n\nIt's definitely put a huge question in my mind. Was there something-- some reason she died other than natural causes, said Bret Schrader.\n\nAs the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and gossip continue.\n\nThe question everyone has: what does the future hold for Curtis Lovelace?\n\nHow does he get his life back ... in his hometown? said Gough.\n\nBecause in the court of public opinion, you think people will always feel like he did something, said Maher.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And again when this ends ... I just don't see how he's gonna be given the benefit of the doubt, said Gough.\n\nChristine Lovelace says she will never stop fighting to clear her husband's name.\n\nThere's nobody guilty for this crime because there was no crime committed, she said. We will not allow him to sit in that jail cell for one day longer than he has to.\n\n...whatever it takes to make sure my husband is exonerated and the truth is known and that he comes home. That's what matters, she continued.\n\nWith Curtis' fate in limbo, Lyndsay Lovelace and her grandmother, Marty Didriksen, continue to try to move forward while keeping the focus on the cherished life they lost.\n\nYou don't want to lose sight of Cory. She died too young. She left children. There's a family here. I mean, Lindsey and her brothers. So try to put that back together if we can and move forward, she said.\n\nCory Lovelace Steve Belko\n\nI just want everyone to find happiness again. And be able to remember the good times rather than the bad times, said Lyndsay.\n\nShe was an amazing woman ... she loved with the biggest heart. She had a beautiful personality, Lyndsay said of her mother. She touched so many people and that's who she needs to be remembered as.\n\nCurtis Lovelace's new trial date is scheduled for May 31.\n\nHis bail was set at $5 million. He remains in jail.
EAST LANSING, Mich. -- A woman who attends Michigan State University filed a federal lawsuit against the school Monday alleging that three former men's basketball players sexually assaulted her at an off-campus apartment in 2015 and that she was discouraged from reporting what happened. The woman and players are not named in the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids. It seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMichigan State has been rocked for months by a sexual assault scandal involving a former sports doctor that now includes his ex-boss. Three ex-football players also were charged last year with sexual assault.\n\nMonday's lawsuit says the female student was 18 on April 12, 2015, when she met the players at an East Lansing bar -- one week after the team lost to Duke in the Final Four, CBSSports.com notes. She was later taken to an off-campus apartment where she was told a party was going on, according to the lawsuit.\n\nUpon arrival, there was no party as few people were present, the suit said.\n\nThe woman said she was feeling discombobulated and tried to send a phone text, but she could not control her thumbs to formulate a text.\n\nAt some point, the players took turns raping her in a bedroom, according to the lawsuit, which added that she had no intention of having any physical contact with any of the people present at the party.\n\nPlaintiff does not remember anything else until she woke up on the couch a few hours later, the suit said.\n\nShe caught a taxi back to her dorm room and contacted university Counseling Center staff about a week later.\n\nAfter the woman told counseling center staff that basketball players were involved, she said the staff made it clear that if she reported it to police she faced an uphill battle that would create anxiety and unwanted media attention, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPlaintiff was so discouraged by the representations made by the MSUCC Counseling staff she became frightened to the point that she decided she could not report the rape(s) to law enforcement, it continued.\n\nShe also did not seek assistance from the school's Sexual Assault Program until 10 months later.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Michigan State of failing to comply with Title IX requirements by not providing the woman with equal protection under the law and says the school created an unwritten, official policy that created a culture in which male MSU athletes felt entitled and emboldened to commit sexual assaults without consequence.\n\nThe woman's attorney, Karen Truszkowski, told The Associated Press on Monday that she is reserving comment to give MSU an opportunity to get up to speed and go over it.\n\nThey do have it and they have reviewed it, she said of the lawsuit.\n\nA Michigan State spokeswoman declined comment Monday when contacted by the AP.\n\nLast week, three ex-football players pleaded guilty to reduced charges in the 2017 sexual assault of a woman in an apartment bathroom.\n\nDisgraced sports doctor Larry Nassar is spending the rest of his life in prison for sexually assaulting girls and women who came to him for treatment.\n\nFormer College of Osteopathic Medicine dean William Strampel was charged last month with failing to protect patients from Nassar, along with sexually harassing female students and pressuring them for nude selfies.\n\nStrampel oversaw the clinic where Nassar worked.
When a US Army reservist found herself at the center of a conspiracy about the coronavirus earlier this year, her life was upended.\n\nHoax peddlers on the internet falsely claimed that Maatje Benassi was somehow the world's COVID-19 patient zero. Over time, conspiracy theorists posted at least 70 videos across multiple YouTube channels claiming that Benassi had brought the virus into the world. Along with those videos came death threats, which Benassi and her husband, Matt, took seriously.\n\nBut at first, the couple did not know how to respond. Trolls hiding behind aliases on the internet were almost impossible to find, and the Benassis could not sue YouTube for allowing the content to be posted because of a now-controversial law known as Section 230.\n\nSince 1996, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has been a key legal shield for the tech industry. It protects any interactive computer service from liability for the content people post on their platforms. In other words, companies like Facebook and YouTube can't be sued if their users behave badly.\n\nPoliticians and activists have blamed the law for enabling some of the worst activity on the internet. Members of the tech industry, however, say the law is misunderstood — and a vital component for how the internet operates.\n\nStill shaken from their experience, the Benassis are confident that something about the law must change.\n\nSection 230, when that was written, it was probably done with the intent that social media companies would police themselves in some manner, Matt Benassi told 60 Minutes. And social media companies haven't done that very well. They need to police themselves quicker or the government needs to step in figure out some mechanism to make them liable, because making them liable would make them police themselves.\n\nWHY SECTION 230 EXISTS\n\nThe crux of Section 230 amounts to one sentence: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\n\nWhen Congress first established the legislation, their goal was not for online platforms to be neutral outlets where anything goes. Rather, they wanted the platforms to be able to make the judgments needed to moderate content—without risking liability. That's according to US Naval Academy cybersecurity professor Jeff Kosseff, who wrote the book The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet, an in-depth look at the history of Section 230.\n\nPrior to Section 230, distributors — like a newsstand or bookstore — were liable for what they sold only if they were able to know the material was illegal. Companies that actually produced the material — book publishers or newspapers, for example — were liable because they controlled the content they created.\n\nIn the early days of the internet, legal challenges against two service providers, CompuServe and Prodigy, showed the law needed to rethink that distinction when it came to the internet.\n\nCompuServe had decided not to regulate what their users posted, while Prodigy employed moderators to validate content and clean up foul language. Both companies were eventually sued because of content their users posted. CompuServe was found not liable because it was solely a distributor, having no say over what its users posted. Prodigy, however, did not receive the same immunity. Because it actively moderated its content, the court decided it had taken a more editorial role, making its site more like a newspaper's letters to the editor.\n\nThe key precedent the suits set at the time was that online platforms could reduce their liability if they did not moderate users' content. Section 230 was intended to change that.\n\nAn addendum to Section 230 known as the Good Samaritan clause allows platforms to remove content they find objectionable, even if that speech is protected by the First Amendment. This leaves the policing of content to the discretion of websites themselves, while still protecting them from liability.\n\nAccording to Kosseff, Congress did not want to overburden the then-fledgling internet industry with regulation.\n\nIf a service just did not do any moderation, the idea, at least, was that people wouldn't really want to go to it because it would be filled with garbage, Kosseff told 60 Minutes. Or if a site did too much moderation, consumers generally would say, 'Well, I don't really want to use that site because they're deleting everything.' So, let the market decide.\n\nThe government is free to say, 'Hey, this is how you should enforce hate. This is how you should enforce harassment.' We would follow those laws. But we don't see those laws. – YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki\n\nToday, Section 230 covers any website or app that hosts user-generated content. While this includes large, well-established platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, it also applies to smaller websites, like local news websites that allow comments. As a result, Kosseff argued, the law remains necessary.\n\nSection 230 is still important because the industry that's built is built around user content, he said.\n\nThe companies that want to become the next Facebooks and Twitters, they rely on Section 230 heavily. Their practices really could not exist how they do right now without Section 230.\n\nPOLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES WANT IT AMENDED\n\nMore than two decades later, the law has been linked to the proliferation of some of the worst corners of the internet, including hate speech, violent videos, foreign trolls, and revenge porn. Public pressure is increasing to limit the broad leeway online platforms currently enjoy under Section 230, and politicians on both sides of the aisle want to take up the charge.\n\nDemocrats say Section 230 has not done enough, allowing, for example, platforms like Facebook to become a place where foreign governments disseminate propaganda without consequence. Republicans feel the law has gone too far, arguing that, because Section 230 allows companies to judge what content violates their terms of service, they use it to censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden last year said Section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked in an interview with the New York Times. Since then, he has not made many comments about the law, except to respond to an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in May. The executive order requested regulators reinterpret the breadth of Section 230 and clarify when its liability protections apply.\n\nJoe Biden understands that no President should use Executive Orders as menus to abuse the power of the presidency, Biden campaign spokesperson Bill Russo told BuzzFeed News at the time. Vice President Biden believes that social media companies should be held accountable for disseminating content they know to be false, just as any other private company would be.\n\nHowever, while Biden himself has not said much about Section 230, the man he has tapped to be his deputy chief of staff has been vocal in his opposition to the law. Bruce Reed, who was Biden's chief of staff when he was vice president, co-authored an essay calling Section 230 an irresponsibility cloak.\n\nWashington would be better off throwing out Section 230 and starting over, Reed wrote last month, along with co-author James Steyer, the CEO of Common Sense Media. The Wild West wasn't tamed by hiring a sheriff and gathering a posse. The internet won't be either. It will take a sweeping change in ethics and culture, enforced by providers and regulators. \n\nReed's perspective of Section 230 will likely influence the incoming White House team. According to reporting by the New York Times, Reed is leading Biden's team of tech advisers.\n\nThe current occupant of the White House, meanwhile, has made his disdain for Section 230 known. In addition to his executive order earlier this year, President Trump tweeted about the law in the run up to the election, writing REPEAL SECTION 230!!! Last month, he vetoed a defense spending bill because it did not include a provision to repeal the law.\n\nThe House of Representatives and Senate both later voted to override the veto.\n\nPresident Trump's ire for Section 230 stems, in part, from his belief that it unfairly allows platforms like Twitter to label his tweets about the election when they include unsubstantiated or false information. However, Section 230 also allows Twitter to host Trump's tweets without the risk of being sued over their content.\n\nA staunch Republican ally of the president, South Carolina's Sen. Lindsey Graham last month introduced a bill that would repeal Section 230 in two years, unless Congress acts to change it.\n\nThe time has come for these largely unregulated Big Tech giants to either be broken up, regulated, or subject to litigation for their actions, Graham said in a press release. It's time we put the Section 230 protections these companies enjoy on the clock.\n\nWHERE THE TECH INDUSTRY STANDS\n\nNot everyone stands for the repeal of Section 230, which the Electronic Frontier Foundation calls the most important law protecting internet speech.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden and former Rep. Chris Cox, who wrote the law's language in 1996 when they were both Congressmen, wrote an op-ed in the USA Today last month to defend Section 230. Getting rid of the law, they explained, would return us to the legal no-man's land that prohibits even good Samaritan censorship.\n\nIt would also force every website hosting user content to create round-the-clock legal and editorial review teams staffed with hundreds or thousands of people to continually monitor every message, video, photo, and blog, they wrote. Alternatively, websites would face exorbitant legal damages at every turn. That is not realistic.\n\nLeaders in the tech industry also want to see a version of the law remain. The Senate Commerce Committee in October summoned the CEOs of Facebook, Google, and Twitter to testify in a hearing about reforming Section 230, during which Republican senators argued for stripping the protections granted to web companies by the law.\n\nAppearing remotely, the tech giants addressed the proposed changes. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Congress should update the law to make sure it's working as intended, while the chiefs of Twitter and Google cautioned lawmakers about making changes.\n\nAs you think about how to shape policy in this important area, I would urge the committee to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and customers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified in his opening remarks.\n\nTwitter's Jack Dorsey highlighted that the law enables tech companies to police harmful content. Undermining Section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online, he said.\n\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes in November 2019, YouTube's CEO Susan Wojcicki also highlighted the importance of Section 230 in shaping today's online experience.\n\nIt's basically enabled the internet as we know it, Wojcicki said. It's enabled us to have people upload content, not have every single comment be reviewed, not every single video be reviewed. And so, it has enabled new types of communication, new types of community, new types of content that we just wouldn't have had beforehand.\n\nThe freedom of that open platform enables users to upload some 500 hours of video to YouTube every minute, according to company estimates. But with all that content, YouTube's system for monitoring has come under scrutiny.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, YouTube failed to detect more than 1,100 videos that Russian trolls posted, almost all intended to influence African Americans. When a white supremacist in March 2019 killed dozens of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand, he live-streamed the video on Facebook. That video was then uploaded on YouTube tens of thousands of times.\n\nWojcicki said the Good Samaritan clause of Section 230 enables her employees to remove hateful content, like the Christchurch shooting video, from her site. She also said that, if Congress were to pass further laws limiting what content YouTube can host, the company would comply.\n\nHonestly, if there [were] laws that said, 'This is the type of content you can't have,' then we remove it… Wojcicki said. We are making a decision to be responsible because we think it's important for our society right now. And we're allowed to do that because of Section 230. And so, the government is free to say, 'Hey, this is how you should enforce hate. This is how you should enforce harassment.' We would follow those laws. But we don't see those laws. Those laws aren't out there right now.\n\nThe video at the top of the page was edited by Will Croxton. The embedded video was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and Will Croxton, who edited it.
Businesses added just 148,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate stayed unchanged at 4.1 percent, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The figure undershot economists' predictions of about 180,000 jobs added. Hourly earnings continued their modest rise, growing 2.5 percent in December year-over-year.\n\nThe jobs report, which marks the 10-year anniversary of the start of the Great Recession, underlines that the labor market has largely recovered from the 2008 economic collapse, with unemployment is at its lowest level since 2000.\n\nYet those gains haven't diffused across the labor market, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers on the sideline. Muted wage growth has also left experts mystified, given that stronger employer demand for labor is supposed to boost workers' paychecks.\n\nSurprisingly, there are few indications that the tight labor market is leading to stronger wage growth, a disappointment given that the expansion is now more than eight-and-a-half years old, Stuart Hoffman, senior economic adviser with PNC Financial Services Group, said in a note.\n\nBy industry, manufacturing was strong for the second month in a row, adding 25,000 jobs in December after a gain of 31,000 the previous month. Over 2017, the sector gained nearly 200,000 jobs. Construction and food and drinking places also grew robustly, adding 30,000 and 25,000 jobs, respectively. Retail trade lost a seasonally adjusted 20,000 jobs in December and professional and business services added just 19,000.\n\nIt's just striking that you have the service sector not adding as many jobs as you had a few years ago, said Guy Berger, chief economist at LinkedIn. Some of the fastest growth in hiring has been in ... goods-producing industries.\n\nThe year's monthly average of 171,000 new jobs is below the previous year's. [I]t is, notably, the slowest year for job growth since 2010, Elise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said in a note.\n\nHowever, lower-paid and less-educated workers are finally making gains after not seeing much improvement in the past few years, with unemployment ticking down slightly for those with only a high school degree, to 4.2 percent.\n\nThe people with less education in the past year or two have made the biggest gains in the labor market, said Jed Kolko, chief economist of Indeed.com, a job-posting site. To be sure, wages are still higher for people with more education, but the gaps have narrowed slightly.\n\nThe unemployment rate for African-Americans fell to 6.8 percent, the first time in 17 years it has been under 7 percent. The rate for white workers was 3.7 percent and 4.9 percent for Latinos.
You can get bit and not even feel it … at first.\n\nBut be warned. That bedbug, the size of an apple seed, is now part of your life. It will hitch a ride home to live with you as an unwanted reminder of that expensive five-star hotel stay. And it will cost not only you, but the hospitality industry, insurers and cities nationwide a large sum of money.\n\nThey are opportunistic, nondiscriminatory and -- worst of all -- stealthy, warns Calvin Sugiyama, a risk service specialist with Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty Services (AGCS), who handles bedbug claims. You might think you just have a mosquito bite or, because they bite multiple times, a rash.\n\nA unit of Allianz, the largest insurer in the world, AGCS has put a yardstick on the cost of the bedbug invasion in its latest report on liability claims. And for such a little bug, it causes a big problem. Domestic claims involving bedbugs rose 50 percent from 2014 to 2015, and they continue to climb. This figure is supported by the Bed Bug Registry, which confirms that bedbug sightings in New York City hotels alone jumped by 44 percent during the same time frame.\n\nDon't let this happen to you: Bedbug bites all over. Joel Carillet\n\nBut New York City, which receives 50 million visitors a year, isn't this country's worst metropolitan area for bedbugs. That distinction goes to Baltimore, which now sits atop the least-wanted list in a report from pest control company Orkin, which seeks to turn bedbugs into dead bugs. To put this in perspective, bedbugs were virtually unheard of in the U.S. 10 years ago, said Orkin entomologist Ron Harrison.\n\nHere are some additional facts from Allianz. Bedbug incidents account for almost one-third of all animal-related liability claims, right behind rutting deer that ram or are rammed by cars and trucks. But while deer tend to migrate mostly in the fall, bedbugs are prolific year-round, although infestations peak in the warmer months.\n\nBedbugs accounted for nearly 400 of the claims paid out in a five-year period, double the number of other insect bites and nearly four times as many dog bites.\n\nAllianz's figures include only insurance claims by it and other insurers. Since many hotels, bed and breakfasts and private homes handle the problem themselves with the assistance of a fumigator, it's tough to figure out the total cost of these critters.\n\nLandlords, hotels and businesses typically pay for the elimination of bedbugs on their own, said Loretta Worters, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the industry. But she warns that can be extremely expensive.\n\nFor starters, the property owner could be liable for any bodily injury. Bedbugs aren't deemed to be dangerous and haven't yet caused a fatality, but they are very, very annoying. And claims against hotels range up to $400,000, said Worters. Defending against these claims costs a lot of money because lawyers can draw blood too.\n\nThen there's the reputational risks for a hotel that's known for bedbuggery or has to shut down for fumigation. Allianz's clients are covered under its general liability policy, but other insurers offer specific policies, sometimes in conjunction with exterminators, to help the hospitality industry hang out a no vacancy sign for pests, Worters said.\n\nAllianz's Sugiyama, who admits he was once bitten by bedbugs, is now twice shy when it comes to staying at hotels, which he has to do frequently. I take a big flashlight with me, he said. I check the bed, particularly the seams of the sheets, and if I see anything that looks like rust, I call management.\n\nHere are some other tips:\n\nIf you're able, turn over the mattress, no matter what size. Bedbugs like to congregate in dark places.\n\n\n\nExamine your luggage when you repack and inspect it for any black or brown spots. Believe it or not, the safest place in a hotel room to keep your luggage is in the bathtub.\n\n\n\nLaunder all the clothing you brought with you -- with the hottest water -- when you get home.\n\n\n\nSince most hotels are well aware of the bedbug problem, they keep an exterminator on retainer, and housekeeping is trained to spot any problems as well. Dogs, particularly beagles, are sensitive to the sweet musky odor of bedbugs, so if you see one sniffing around your hotel, it may be more than a pet.\n\nBut despite all the precautions, entomology isn't on your side in the battle of the bedbugs. They're blood eaters, but they can be stealth fighters and live an entire year without a meal. And they love to be under the covers with you, which is why they're usually found within five feet of a bed.\n\nFumigate all you want to kill the critters, but will you ever feel secure where you were when you started that itching? It never quite feels the same, said a woman whose apartment was infested after a stay in a Southern hotel during a flood. When I moved, I was so happy to say goodbye to that place.
The partial government shutdown has glided into its third week with no end in sight. If the government is not reopened before March, millions of Americans who receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — the nation's food stamp program — could have their assistance disrupted. The funding provided for SNAP and other programs through February is only a temporary fix.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced Tuesday that SNAP would be funded through February, thanks to the funding bill that expired on Dec. 22, which included a provision allowing federal agencies to make obligated payments to support certain programs for 30 days after its expiration date.\n\nIn September 2018, the last month for which data is available, $4.7 billion in SNAP benefits were disbursed throughout every state. If the shutdown continues through March, there will be no remaining funding for SNAP, endangering food security for millions of Americans.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 42 million Americans received SNAP benefits in 2017. More than 68 percent of participants were in families with children, and more than 44 percent were in working families.\n\nOther programs were in even more immediate danger than SNAP. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) were not receiving federal funds at all during the shutdown, but can continue to operate at the State and local level with any funding and commodity resources that remain available, according to the USDA in December.\n\nHowever, the USDA announced Tuesday that WIC would continue to operate through February, thanks to prior year funding which USDA will begin to provide states this week.\n\nIn the first five months of 2018, around 7 million Americans received WIC benefits each month. WIC is provided for pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5 who fall within the poverty index and are at nutritional risk. The WIC program granted nearly $5 billion to every U.S. state and territory in 2018, as of September.\n\nAmericans who benefit from both SNAP and WIC would be particularly affected if the shutdown continues past February.\n\nChild Nutrition Programs, including School Lunch, School Breakfast, Child and Adult Care Feeding, Summer Food Service and Special Milk will continue operations through February, according to the USDA.\n\nStaffing for Food and Nutrition Services, which oversees the Child Nutrition Programs, SNAP, and WIC, has been cut by 95 percent since the shutdown began.
A 19-year-old pregnant woman from Guatemala died this week from injuries suffered when she fell trying to climb the U.S. border wall near El Paso, Texas, U.S. and Guatemalan authorities said Thursday. Guatemala identified the woman as Mirian Stephany Girón Luna.\n\nMedical personnel tried to deliver her baby, but were unsuccessful, both governments said. The U.S. said Girón was eight months pregnant.\n\nCBP is saddened to report the death of a pregnant Guatemalan woman and her unborn child. CBP sends our condolences to their family and loved ones. Full statement: https://t.co/YlOH5rMGS6 — CBP (@CBP) March 12, 2020\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection blamed Girón's death on human smugglers who encouraged her to try to climb the wall. In a statement, Gloria Chavez, the chief for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, said the authorities would work with Mexico to find those responsible for placing these lives in danger.\n\nDespite the best efforts of our Border Patrol agents and medical professionals, sadly more lives have perished at the hands of human smugglers, Chavez said. Someone in Mexico guided this 8 month pregnant woman from Guatemala to this section of the border and encouraged her and helped her climb the steel mesh border barrier.\n\nCBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan told reporters that Girón and her partner were taken to the border by smugglers and left there in the darkness. They were attempting to climb when she fell. Border Patrol agents reached her and called medical authorities, who took her to the hospital but tragically, the mother and the child died from their injuries from the fall, he said.\n\nAccording to Guatemalan authorities, Girón fell more than 19 feet (6 meters) on Saturday. Her partner, who is believed to have been the baby's father, eventually found Border Patrol agents who called for an ambulance.\n\nGirón suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, a pelvis fracture, and liver and kidney lacerations. Guatemala says surgical interventions could not save her life and she died Tuesday afternoon.\n\nGirón is from Guatemala's San Marcos department, near the country's border with Mexico. CBP says it has no record of her trying to enter the U.S. at an official port of entry or having been placed in the Remain in Mexico program, in which tens of thousands of migrants have been forced to pursue their immigration cases from Mexico.\n\nTekandi Paniagua Flores, the Guatemalan consul in Del Rio, Texas, said he spoke to Girón's partner, who remains in Border Patrol detention.\n\nHe said that if he had known that the risks were this high, he would not have done it, Paniagua said.\n\nPaniagua said he could recall at least seven cases this year in which Guatemalans had injured themselves trying to climb U.S. border walls. He says such cases are rising because more migrants from Guatemala and other Central American countries wracked by violence and poverty no longer surrender en masse to the Border Patrol.\n\nPolicy changes such as Remain in Mexico and a ban on many asylum claims have made it more difficult for many people to remain in the U.S. once they are caught.\n\nThe U.S. has already built or replaced about 135 miles of border barriers with Mexico, with several contracts awarded for more construction. Much of the border in and around El Paso, across from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, already has some form of fencing.\n\nAs it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump's administration has continued to promote the border wall and move to condemn land for construction. Responding to a post linking the wall to stopping the coronavirus, Trump tweeted Tuesday, We need the Wall more than ever! There is no evidence that an expanded border wall would prevent the spread of the virus, and the U.S. has reported far more coronavirus cases than Mexico.
UPDATE: SpaceX Falcon Heavy launched successfully Tuesday afternoon. Complete coverage here.\n\nSpaceX erected its new Falcon Heavy rocket atop historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center Monday, setting the stage for its debut as the world's most powerful booster when it climbs away Tuesday atop nearly 5 million pounds of ground-shaking thrust.\n\nSpaceX founder and chief designer Elon Musk told reporters at the Kennedy Space Center that he's optimistic, adding the weather's looking good, the rocket's looking good, so it should be an exciting day.\n\nWe finally have a major advancement in rocketry, he told CBS News during an earlier interview at the base of pad 39A. I'm not sure whether this will be lost on people, whether they'll appreciate it. I hope they do, because the era of the very large rocket went away with Saturn 5 and with the space shuttle.\n\nI find it odd that the Falcon Heavy is twice the thrust of anything from Russia, China, Boeing, Lockheed or Europe, Musk continued. And I hope it encourages them to raise their sights.\n\nAs for the rocket's maiden launch, by definition a relatively high-risk test flight, Musk said, I'm looking forward to it. It's either going to be an exciting success or an exciting failure. One big boom! I'd say tune in, it's going to be worth your time.\n\nCarrying Musk's cherry red Tesla Roadster, complete with a space-suited Starman mannequin strapped in the driver's seat, the Falcon Heavy is scheduled for launch at 1:30 p.m. EST (GMT-5), the opening of a three-hour window. Forecasters predicted an 80 percent chance of good weather.\n\nMusk tweeted a video showing an animation of what a successful launch will look like, including his red Roadster flying off to Mars:\n\nFalcon Heavy sends a car to Mars https://t.co/Y7uBtU6Mt2 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 5, 2018\n\nThe maiden flight of the Falcon Heavy has generated widespread public interest with tens of thousands of tourists and area residents expected to turn out along area roads and beaches to watch the booster race away, believed to be the biggest crowd for a space launch since the shuttle program came to an end in 2011.\n\nMusk has gone out of his way to downplay expectations, saying last year there's a lot of risk associated with the Falcon Heavy, a real good chance that that vehicle does not make it to orbit.\n\nBut on the eve of launch, he told CBS News he was optimistic and almost giddy with excitement. In the end, he said, SpaceX engineers have checked everything humanly possible to eliminate any unpleasant surprises.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk chats with CBS News at the base of pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center where the company's Falcon Heavy rocket is being readied for its maiden launch Tuesday. CBS News\n\nWe've done all the (computer) modeling we could think of, he said. We've asked ... third parties to double check the calculations, make sure we haven't made any mistakes. So, we're not aware of any issues, nobody has been able to point out any fundamental issues. In theory it should work. But where theory and reality collide, reality wins.\n\nHe put the odds of a successful flight at somewhere between 50 percent and 70 percent.\n\nMade up of three side-by-side Falcon 9 first stages and an upper stage carrying the Tesla, the Falcon Heavy will easily be the most powerful rocket in the world when it takes off, generating 4.7 million pounds of thrust with 27 Merlin engines firing in concert, nine per core stage.\n\nLater versions flying at full throttle will generate more than 5.1 million pounds of push, enabling the rocket to boost payloads weighing up to 140,660 pounds to low-Earth orbit or 37,000 pounds to Earth-escape velocities needed for missions to the moon, Mars or beyond.\n\nNASA is currently building an even more powerful rocket known as the Space Launch System, or SLS, that will generate 8.8 million pounds of thrust in its initial configuration and up to 11.9 million pounds in a follow-on cargo variant. The initial version will be able to boost more than 50,000 pounds to Earth-escape velocity.\n\nBut the SLS is not expected to fly until late 2019 or later. Until then, the Falcon Heavy, assuming it succeeds, will hold the record as the world's most powerful rocket, offering a relatively low-cost option for getting heavy payloads into space for NASA, the Department of Defense and commercial satellite operators.\n\nI think this could be an extremely significant launch, first of all because it's happening in 2018, not whenever SLS is going to launch, it is going to be, if it succeeds, the most powerful rocket in the world, and that enables lots of different things, said John Logsdon, a noted space historian and space policy analyst.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk's cherry red Tesla Roadster sports car will serve as a test payload for the Falcon Heavy in its maiden flight. The car, and it's space-suited dummy pilot Starman, wil SpaceX\n\nIt poses a competitive challenge to the NASA way of doing business. Just as SpaceX has posed a challenge to (competitor) United Launch Alliance that seems to be succeeding, it could well pose a challenge to NASA's launch strategy.\n\nIf all goes well, the Tesla and its dummy passenger will be released onto a deep space trajectory about six hours after launch, breaking free of Earth's gravity at nearly 25,000 mph while David Bowie's Space Oddity plays in the background.\n\nAssuming it makes it through the high-radiation environment of Earth's Van Allen belts, and assuming the Falcon Heavy's second stage propellant doesn't freeze or boil away after six hours in the deep cold of space, the Tesla will be released on a trajectory carrying it slightly farther than the orbit of Mars.\n\nWe expect it'll get about 400 million kilometers away from Earth, maybe 250 to 270 million miles, and be doing 11 kilometers per second, Musk said. It's going to be in a precessing elliptical orbit with one part of the ellipse being at Earth orbit and the other part being at Mars orbit. So it'll essentially be an Earth-Mars cycler.\n\nWe estimate it'll be in that orbit for several hundred million years, maybe in excess of a billion years, he said. At times, it will come extremely close to Mars, and there's a tiny, tiny chance that it will hit Mars (someday). Extremely tiny. I wouldn't hold your breath.\n\nNew rockets making their first flights typically carry dummy payloads, or mass simulators. But not the Falcon Heavy.\n\nIt's just for fun, Musk laughed. A lot of people (wondered,) what's the purpose of sending a car to Mars? There's no point, obviously! It's just for fun and to get the public excited. Normally, when a new rocket is tested, they put something really boring on like a block of concrete or a chunk of steel or something. ... The car is just the most fun thing we could think of.\n\nSpaceX typically attempts to recover its Falcon 9 boosters after launch. For the Falcon Heavy, the company will attempt to recover all three core stages after the Heavy climbs out of the lower atmosphere.\n\nThe two previously flown outside boosters will separate, flip around and fly back to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for side-by-side rocket-powered descents to touchdown at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1. The central core stage will attempt to land on an off-shore droneship.\n\nThe recovery of all three stages would push SpaceX's record to 24 successful landings in 27 attempts. Musk was particularly animated describing the landings and the dual sonic booms that will thunder across Florida's Space Coast as the two returning boosters slow down for landing.\n\nBut it's the launch, seeing the most powerful rocket since the space shuttle climbing away from pad 39A, that has sparked such widespread interest. And no wonder.\n\nAt liftoff, with all 27 core stage engines firing together, the Heavy will enjoy more than twice the liftoff power of a United Launch Alliance Delta 4 Heavy, the most powerful currently flying U.S. rocket, and more than one-and-a-half times the power of a European Ariane 5.\n\nFor comparison, the Soviet Union's ill-fated N1 moon rocket holds the all-time record with a thrust of 10.5 million pounds, but it catastrophically failed in four launch attempts. NASA's successful Saturn 5, the gargantuan booster that propelled Apollo astronauts to the moon, generated 7.5 million pounds of push while the space shuttle rocketed away atop 6.8 million pounds of thrust. The Soviet Union's short-lived Energia booster generated 6.6 million pounds.\n\nMusk said the debut of the Falcon Heavy does not mark the rebirth of an Apollo-like program, but it's arguably a prelude to a new Apollo, and it's going to be the only heavy- to super-heavy-lift rocket in the world.\n\nThis will be more than twice the thrust and capability of any other rocket currently flying, he said. And if it reaches orbit, it will have the most payload of any rocket since the Saturn 5. You could actually send people back to the moon with the Falcon Heavy, you could, with orbital refueling, send people to Mars.\n\nMusk said last year that he planned to send two unidentified paying customers on a flight to loop around the moon, but he said today SpaceX is now focusing on building a new, even more powerful rocket known as the BFR, a huge machine he says can be used to help colonize Mars.\n\nThe business end of the Falcon Heavy, showing 27 Merlin engines at the bases of three core stages. Firing together, the engines will generate about 5 million pounds of thrust. SpaceX\n\nIt's not yet clear how the Falcon Heavy figures into that plan or whether enough customers, including NASA, might line up to buy the Heavy for commercial satellite-launching missions, to send interplanetary probes into deep space or possibly to send space tourists into space aboard a piloted version of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy is definitely capable of sending the crewed Dragon vehicle around the moon, Musk said. We may still do that. It depends on how quickly the BFR development goes. If that development's looking good, then we will try to push everything to BFR. If that's looking like it's going to take longer than expected, then we'll send people around the moon using Falcon Heavy and Dragon.\n\nBut the BFR is the clear focus, a rocket system that he says will be ideal for interplanetary colonization and for establishing a large base on the moon and a city on Mars. But this (the Falcon Heavy) is a prelude to that, this is going to teach us a lot about what's necessary to have a huge booster with a crazy number of engines.\n\nThere are numerous unknowns when it comes to flying a powerful new rocket, even one utilizing multiple flight-proven stages like the Falcon Heavy. As the rocket climbs away, consuming propellant and losing weight, it will rapidly accelerate, subjecting it to hard-to-model aerodynamic and mechanical stresses as it plows out of the thick lower atmosphere.\n\nIt is also difficult to model the vibration and acoustic environment at the base of the rocket where the 27 Merlin engines will be firing. The engines were test fired at the pad on Jan. 24 and SpaceX said later there were no problems. But, Musk warned Monday, there's so much that can go wrong here.\n\nThere are a lot of experts out there saying there's no way you can do 27 engines, all at the same time, and not have something go wrong, he said. You've got the booster-to-booster interaction, acoustics and vibration that haven't been seen from any man-made device in a long time.\n\nEven so, he told reporters later, I'm really hopeful for this flight going as planned. We've done everything we could do to maximize the chances of success of this mission. I think once you've done everything you can think of and it still goes wrong, well, there's nothing you could have done. But I feel at peace with that.
Ivanka Trump's company received preliminary approval from the Chinese government for another five trademarks this month, as her father's administration pushes ahead on trade negotiations with China.\n\nFour trademarks, including child care centers, sunglasses and wedding dresses, were approved on Sunday. A fifth, covering brokerage, charitable fundraising and art valuation services, was approved on Jan. 6, according to online trademark office records. The applications were filed in 2016 and 2017. If no one objects, they will be finalized after 90 days.\n\nIvanka Trump's expanding intellectual property holdings have long raised ethical concerns, particularly because they are happening in China, where the courts and bureaucracy tend to reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party. Even though Ivanka Trump, who serves as a White House adviser, shut down her brand last year, critics say the trademarks could help her revive her business after her father leaves office.\n\nIvanka Trump's lawyers in China did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nAnother 34 approvals in October, November\n\nIn November, the Chinese government granted a total of 18 trademarks to companies linked to U.S. President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka over the last two months, Chinese public records show, raising concerns about conflicts of interest in the White House as Americans vote in national elections.\n\nIn October, China's Trademark Office granted provisional approval for 16 trademarks to Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, bringing to 34 the total number of marks China has greenlighted in the past year, according to the office's online database. The new approvals cover Ivanka-branded fashion gear including sunglasses, handbags, shoes and jewelry, as well as beauty services and voting machines.\n\nA chance to profit later?\n\nCritics say the Trump family's worldwide intellectual property portfolio could set the groundwork for the president and his daughter to profit from their global brands as soon as they leave office.\n\nIvanka receives preliminary approval for these new Chinese trademarks while her father continues to wage a trade war with China. Since she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family's businesses, wrote Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group that first published the news about Ivanka Trump brand's new Chinese trademarks, last year.\n\nPotential pressure in government negotiations\n\nCritics argue that by asking a foreign government for valuable intellectual property rights, White House officials could open themselves to pressure in government negotiations.\n\nIvanka Trump's representatives assert trademark filings are a normal business practice and are needed to protect her name from copycats seeking to capitalize on her fame.\n\nCompanies apply for trademarks for a range of reasons. They can be signs of corporate ambition, but many also are filed defensively, particularly in China, where trademark squatting is rampant.\n\nChina has said it treats all trademark applications equally under the law.
The New York Stock Exchange has withdrawn plans to delist shares of three Chinese state-owned phone carriers. The shares were to be removed under an order from President Donald Trump, a move Beijing had warned might lead to retaliation.\n\nThe exchange cited further consultation with regulators but its announcement late Monday gave no other details. China's foreign ministry on Tuesday criticized Washington for suppressing foreign companies but made no direct comment on the NYSE announcement.\n\nThe NYSE, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange, said last week it would remove China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom Hong Kong under Mr. Trump's November order barring Americans from investing in securities issued by companies deemed to be linked to the Chinese military.\n\nTensions ratcheting up\n\nThe order added to mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology, security and spying accusations. The Trump administration has imposed export controls and other sanctions on some Chinese companies, visa curbs on members of the ruling Communist Party and other restrictions.\n\nThe suppression will have very limited impact on Chinese companies, but it will damage the national interest and image of the United States, said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Han Chunying. She expressed hope Washington will do more to maintain the order of the global financial market and protect investors.\n\nPolitical analysts expect little change in policy under President-elect Joseph Biden, who takes office Jan. 20, due to widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.\n\nTrump's November order bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies deemed by the Defense Department to be part of efforts to modernize the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army. The 2 million-member PLA is one of the biggest and most heavily-armed militaries. It is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.\n\nGrowing U.S. blacklist\n\nThe Pentagon has added 35 companies to its blacklist. In addition to the phone carriers, they include telecom equipment giant Huawei; China's biggest maker of processor chips; three state-owned oil producers; and construction, aerospace, rocketry, shipbuilding and nuclear power equipment companies.\n\nDespite the NYSE's reversal on delisting the Chinese telecoms, some Wall Street analysts think investors will sell their holdings in companies linked to the Defense Department's blacklist.\n\nHong Kong-traded shares in the three phone carriers surged Tuesday. China Telecom rose 3.4%, China Mobile jumped 5.7% and China Unicom surged 8.5%. Shares in all three have fallen recently.\n\n[W]e expect many investors to divest themselves of all companies related to entities on the DoD's list to avoid any regulatory, compliance or legal actions/liabilities, analysts with Height Securities said in a note.\n\nThe Chinese government has accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and has warned that Trump's order would hurt U.S. and other investors worldwide.\n\nOn Saturday, the foreign ministry said Beijing would take unspecified necessary countermeasures to protect its companies.\n\nThe government made the same announcement following previous U.S. sanctions without taking action.
Some of the content you are about to read is graphic.\n\nSANTA ANA, Calif. -- Unlike similar escapes where dangerous inmates fled into rural areas, the three men who broke out of a Southern California lockup escaped into densely populated suburban communities where they have close ties.\n\nHundreds of officers are focusing on neighborhoods where the trio charged with violent crimes could be hiding among friends, family or fellow gang members, particularly Orange County's huge Vietnamese population, authorities said Tuesday, the fourth day of the manhunt.\n\nIt is just a few miles from the jail where the trio broke out Friday, and two of the inmates, Jonathan Tieu, 20, Bac Duong, 43, have deep ties to the community, which is among the largest in the U.S.\n\nSheriff's officials put out a call in both English and Vietnamese on Monday for help in finding them. The two may be embedded there, said sheriff's Lt. Dave Sawyer, who is leading the investigation.\n\nWe sincerely need input from the community to help us, Sawyer said.\n\nTieu, Duong and Hossein Nayeri, 37, are considered dangerous and all were awaiting trial for separate violent felonies, authorities said. They have now each been charged with the escape.\n\nTieu had been held since 2013, accused of murder and attempted murder. Duong faced attempted murder and assault charges in the shooting of a man on his front porch. Nayeri was arrested in 2014 on charges including kidnapping and torture. Authorities said Nayeri abducted a marijuana dealer, burned him with a blow torch and cut off his penis because Nayeri thought the man had buried money in the desert.\n\nThe men were gone for as long as 16 hours before officials noticed they were missing from the common dorm they share with more than 60 other inmates at Orange County Central Jail. An attack on a guard delayed a Friday night head count by hours. The trio sawed through a quarter-inch-thick grill on a dormitory wall, got into plumbing tunnels and then sawed through half-inch-thick steel bars as they made their way behind walls to an unguarded area of a roof atop a five-story building.\n\nThere, they moved aside razor wire and rappelled to the ground using a bed linen.\n\nThe sheriff's department has been slow to add more rooftop security cameras at the jail despite a grand jury's recommendations for eight years straight, according to a report Monday in the Orange County Register.\n\nThe department has said since 2008 that budget constraints prevented upgrades to the camera systems at the five county jails. The escape was eerily similar to one last year in New York, where two inmates cut through a portion of a wall hidden under a bunk bed and used piping and tunnels inside the facility to get out. But the search for the pair focused on nearby woods instead of a dense urban population.\n\nA major question for California investigators will be how the men could plan and execute their escape with such precision, said Kevin Tamez, a managing partner for MPM Group, a Philadelphia-based firm that consults on prison security, management and infrastructure.\n\nThere is no evidence so far that the trio had help from the inside, but authorities know it's a possibility, Orange County sheriff's Lt. Jeff Hallock said. It's likely someone slipped them blueprints or told them how the bowels of the jail were laid out, he said.\n\nIf I were whoever's investigating, there are some people who would be on a polygraph, I guarantee you, Tamez said. They had to have had some inside help.\n\nMotion sensor cameras - available for $55 and often used as baby monitors - can be installed along interior tunnels and pipes to catch inmates, Tamez said.\n\nThorough searches of dorms likely would have discovered tools or damage to the vent grill, he said. It was the first escape in nearly three decades from the California facility, which was built in 1968. It holds 900 men and is in Santa Ana, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.\n\nHallock said the jail's general policy is to do walk-throughs every hour to check on inmates. More thorough searches are done randomly, he said, declining to give more details.\n\nIt's unclear why the inmates - who are charged with violent felonies - were housed in the common dorm with dozens of others.\n\nAssigning them to a large, busy room likely made it easier for them to avoid detection, said Martin Horn, a professor of corrections at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York.\n\nFederal authorities are offering $50,000 for information leading to their capture.\n\nIf you have any information on the escaped inmates call the sheriff's hotline at 714-628-7085.
In this Eye on Money series, Jill Schlesinger joins CBS This Morning with tips for getting the best financial aid\n\nIn this Eye on Money series, Jill Schlesinger joins CBS This Morning with tips for getting the best financial aid\n\nBy now, most high school seniors have college offers on the table, leaving them only a few days to decide which one to choose. Will it be the glamour school with a big price tag? The reliable state school? A commuter or community college?\n\nMaking a solid choice means weighing what will be the best fit and value for your family's budget, your student's personality and academic interests. But even though time is short, you can still work on getting better aid offers until colleges need a final decision, which is usually May 1.\n\nKalman Chany, a college financial counselor and author of Paying For College Without Going Broke, said from the time students and their families get the acceptance notices until May 1, the student and their family is in the strongest position -- as the ball is now in a different court with the school no longer being in control.\n\nWhy are families in a great position now that offers are in front of them? Chany noted this is prime time because once you lock into a school, you lose a great deal of leverage, so you still have time to improve a financial aid offer -- which shouldn't include loans but often do (I discourage anyone from going into deep debt for most degrees).\n\nHere are four strategies to keep in mind:\n\nIf the aid offer falls short, appeal it. But this isn't the same process as trying to get a better price on a refrigerator. One should never use terms such as negotiate, bargain or 'goose up' when dealing with the aid office, Chany noted.\n\nBetter to say you wish to 'appeal' or 'request reconsideration.'\n\nDo your homework on the school's ability to dole out grants and scholarships. This means don't ask for nonloan aid from schools that are in financially struggling states or those with meager scholarship resources. Look at a school's endowment, the often enormous kitty that has been built up over years.\n\nColleges with billion-dollar-plus endowments certainly have the resources to meet your financial need. Others simply may have no-loan policies, which is desirable even if you don't completely meet their financial assistance thresholds.\n\nWhat you're looking for in vetting a college's cash reserves is endowment per student, which should be on the university's website or findable through a simple online search. This is the amount the school is doling out from its endowment. The higher the number, the more generous it can afford to be.\n\nDon't pay attention to retail price tags. The sticker price of tuition, fees and housing may not be what most families pay. It depends on a college's aid policy. If a school is committed to meeting all or most financial need, that means generous combinations of grants, scholarships and tuition discounts.\n\nAlso don't think because a private college's sticker price is much higher than a public school's that your net cost -- after all nonloan aid is awarded -- is going to be higher. You could get a much better deal at a private school because many have more money to offer and are in a position to dole it out. A good way to gauge a college's aid-giving record and net price is by searching College Abacus.\n\nOne will have a better chance with an appeal at a private college then at a public university, Chany has found. The key is having a thorough understanding of the aid formulas to know how the colleges and the government are determining your eligibility for aid.\n\nConsider hiring an aid consultant. These professionals go to bat for your family to help you garner more aid. While they charge for their services (they're expensive and rates vary), they can make a difference if you're staring down a six-figure college bill.\n\nIf one is thinking about private colleges -- which usually require much more extensive documentation than just the federal FAFSA form -- the cost of a consultant may be just a penny on the dollar, given the sticker price for four years is now $250,000 to $300,000 at many of them.\n\nHow do you find an aid consultant? You can ask other parents and guidance counselors for referrals. Just be careful. Some consultants supplement their income by selling financial products you don't need. One neighbor told me a consultant insisted that her family needed an annuity, an often-expensive retirement product that has nothing to do with college financing.\n\nA good place to start finding an adviser who does aid planning is through the Association of Certified College Planning Specialists. They train and certify a variety of financial professionals who can share prudent tax, financial, cash flow and lending advice that can help families lower the cost of college and pay the tuition bill.\n\nIf you have some time -- that is, if you're not making a decision about college offers in the next week, planning ahead is still the best strategy for maximizing your aid. Chany suggests that you start working with your child as early as 9th grade.
MIAMI - The family of slain journalist Steven Sotloff is suing Syria in U.S. court, claiming the government of President Bashar Assad provided support to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants who carried out the gruesome beheading.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Washington seeks tens of millions in damages from Syria for Sotloff's 2014 killing. It's far from certain Sotloff's South Florida-based family would be able to collect money if they win the case.\n\nSotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished in Syria in August 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in a video released last month that showed fellow journalist James Foley's beheading. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on ISIS.\n\nLater, a video was distributed documenting his death.\n\nThe lawsuit contends Syria is liable because it provided financial, material and military support to ISIS. Syria has not yet answered the lawsuit.\n\nEarlier, family members had contended that Sotloff was captured by moderate rebels and sold to ISIS for somewhere between $25,000 and $50,000 dollars. Sotloff's family, like many others whose relatives were held captive by ISIS, described their relationship with the Obama administration as strained.\n\nPresident Obama met with the Sotloffs in 2015. According to Bernadette Meehan, a National Security Council spokesperson, Mr. Obama expressed his and First Lady Michelle Obama's condolences for Steven's death.
The last several years have been tumultuous for many colleges in the United States, as undergraduate enrollments have declined, endowments have shrunk and many private institutions have become increasingly dependent on tuition for survival. Now, many in higher education fear that the unprecedented combination of difficulties presented by the coronavirus pandemic could sound a death knell.\n\nThe pandemic has upended almost every aspect of our operations, from teaching and student life to research to athletics to admissions and recruitment to the financial model that sustains all of it, Michael Schoenfeld, Vice President for Public Affairs and Government Relations, and Chief Communications Officer for Duke University, tells CBS News. This is all happening in real-time, so it will be a while before we can fully assess the impact across the institution, and indeed across higher education. In the short term, we are evaluating a range of options with regard to the coming academic year, which will depend on both health and public policy considerations. We are also looking at the long-term effects and opportunities, which will be considerable as well.\n\nA staggering 6.6 million Americans sought jobless benefits last week, meaning that roughly 10% of the country is now unemployed. Oxford Economics expects the crisis to intensify as the weeks of coronavirus closures drag on, predicting as many as 30 million U.S. job losses – three times the number of jobs that vanished as result of the housing crash of 2008.\n\nFamilies will have less money. Many of them won't have jobs for a while. You know, if they're relying on investments, they'll have less investments, said Dr. Thomas Bailey, President of Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nAnd he said that could pose a very real problem for colleges and universities across the country that are very tuition dependent and aren't particularly selective.\n\nIf you look at the industry press over the last several years, you quite periodically read about institutions that have closed, he said. I think the elite, well-financed, high reputation institutions will be able to weather this. But many colleges and universities – small, private, less selective institutions – were already under a lot of stress. So, I think this will just make it that much more difficult.\n\nTo make matters worse, the current social distancing and quarantine guidelines make it impossible for students to tour campuses or attend admitted students events, which often help sell a university to its prospective classes.\n\nThat will definitely have an effect, Dr. Linda LeMura, president of New York's private Jesuit institution, Le Moyne College, tells CBS News. In our situation, when students come to campus and they feel the strength of the community, the friendliness of the community, the accessibility of the professors, they get a feel, a vibe, and they say to themselves, 'I can see myself here.' It's very different when you're selling your college in an online or a virtual environment. It doesn't affect the senses in the same way.\n\nStudents at the University of Washington are on campus for the last day of in-person classes on March 6, 2020 in Seattle, Washington. The University will close starting Monday, March 9, as a precautionary reaction to the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, outbreak for the remainder of the winter quarter. The student in the gas mask said he was wearing it because all the regular masks were sold out. Karen Ducey / Getty Images\n\nWhen asked whether she thought next year's freshman class would be as full as usual, LeMura replied gravely, I don't. I don't.\n\nI want to be wrong in the worst way, but I really think that the modeling that we all use, the assumptions are now completely faulty, she continued. Because when we launched the recruitment season, we weren't counting on a pandemic. We don't know how that's going to affect family behavior, family finances. It's possible that recruiting outside of your area will be restricted because families want to keep their children closer to home. All of those things now are unknowns. Whereas we could have predicted a class with a variable of roughly 25 students, we could be looking at a difference of 200 students. We just don't know.\n\nAcross the board, regardless of the size of the institution or whether it is public or private, endowments have plummeted as a result of the recent turmoil in the stock market, putting further stress on schools' operating budgets. Most development offices have temporarily suspended asking alumni for donations. And to make matters worse, events like reunions, which ordinarily play a key role in inspiring donations, have been cancelled as well.\n\nWe rely heavily on the nature of relationships on residential campuses, LeMura told CBS News. Bringing people back to campus and having the alums meet with the next generations of students, that is the impetus for generating gifts and philanthropy. So, without a doubt, the more distance we have, the harder that it is. It can be done, but it's just an enormous challenge. The entire enterprise, really on a campus like ours, is based on the ability to connect human-to-human. And the online environment and canceling those kinds of events cuts into the bottom line.\n\nIt's a bottom line that has already been hammered by the refunds of meal plans and room and board that most schools had to make when COVID-19 necessitated the early closures of campuses across the nation this spring semester.\n\nThere's no question, LeMura said. Most institutions have refunded room and board on a prorated rate and so that will affect the bottom line for this academic year, in terms of whether or not we end the year with a margin or in deficit. And then, moving forward, if we have to open up the campus at a later time in the fall, that's another revenue hit, not to mention it changes the nature of developing a cohort model, which is so effective in residential campuses. All those things combined really equate to a major disruption.\n\nStudents move out of dorm rooms on Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University on March 12, 2020 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Students have been asked to move out of their dorms by March 15 due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) risk. All classes will be moved online for the rest of the spring semester. Getty Images\n\nPublic institutions are not immune either. Penn State, which has committed to paying all of its employees through April and set up an emergency fund for its students hardest hit by the crisis, told CBS News in an email that it had frozen hiring and terminated a number of service contracts in effort to stem financial losses.\n\nPenn State has incurred significant financial losses in auxiliary and other units that are dependent on self-generated revenue to fund their operations, the statement read. These operations include Penn State's two hotel and conference centers, the University airport, and housing and food services in the University's extensive residence hall operations, which typically serve approximately 20,000 students daily. Total revenue losses across the university through the spring semester are estimated to be well above $100 million.\n\nOrdinarily, higher education is countercyclical, so its outlook doesn't necessarily move in the same direction as the rest of the economy during a downtown. The question is whether the current global predicament is so unique that it defies past models of behavior.\n\nIt's possible that students might say, 'You know, I really want to have that in-class experience, so let me wait a year,' says Bailey. On the other hand, higher education is countercyclical. After the recession 12 years ago, we had huge enrollment increases. So, it's possible that somebody who's out of a job temporarily may say, 'Okay, this is a time for me to go back to school to pick up some courses, maybe to pick up an extra degree that I can use.' But of course the problem with that is that people may not have the money to pay for it. If you have a recession that goes to 7 or 8% unemployment, that might work. If we have much higher unemployment, then I'm not sure that that countercyclical argument will work.\n\nLeMura anticipates this recession will hit higher education harder than the last one.\n\nI think there'll be more pressure to charge significantly less for online education, she said. And let's face it. Institutions over the past, I don't know, 200 years have been investing mightily in physical infrastructure, so now you're going to have that overhead of all those buildings that are under capacity on the balance sheet. And that's a heavy lift for any institution.\n\nIt's also unclear how the coronavirus pandemic will affect universities' ability to enroll international students, who often pay higher tuition than their domestic counterparts. However, despite travel restrictions, Annelise Riles, executive director of the Buffett Institute for Global Affairs at Northwestern University, told CBS News that Northwestern's Office of International Student and Scholar Services is still continuing to process immigration document (I-20 and DS 2019) requests, so that international students slated to begin programs at Northwestern can be as prepared as possible for any scenario in these uncertain times.\n\nLast month, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the credit outlook for higher education from stable to negative, citing the unprecedented enrollment uncertainty colleges and universities will face heading into the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nWith the futures of many U.S. academic institutions now uncertain, Bailey cautioned that a blow to higher education would reverberate through society as a whole.\n\nHigher education is absolutely crucial. It provides a foundation for so much that we rely on in society; not only advancing society technologically, culturally and scientifically, but also providing opportunities for low income students to develop a better life and more opportunities, he said. Science, culture, equity, those are fundamental things that we're trying to develop in higher education. And if we're just scrambling to stay afloat, we're not going to be as effective in pursuing those goals.\n\nThere are simply some intangible losses that can't be marked down on a balance sheet.\n\nI think the future of the nation's soul is at stake, LeMura told CBS News. The kind of educational experiences that we have available in the United States is such a diverse ecosystem that, to let many of these schools die, we'll never be the same.
The Clark County Black Caucus said Thursday that it would throw its support behind Bernie Sanders, the latest in a flurry of Nevada endorsements this week as he seeks to shore up support in a key early contest.\n\nWhen you look at his platform and his consistency, over the years he has a long history fighting for civil rights and economic justice, Yvette Williams, chair of the Clark County Black Caucus, tells CBS News.\n\nWe've interviewed him as well, and he has concrete plans in place that will address many of the inequities, inequalities, and injustices of black America, Williams added.\n\nClark County includes Las Vegas and is far and away the most populous county in the state. Racking up supporters in the county is essential for any candidate who hopes to win the Nevada caucuses on February 22nd.\n\nThe Clark County Black Caucus' endorsement comes as other Nevada groups have rallied to Sanders. On Tuesday, the immigrant rights group Make the Road Action made public its plans to leverage their organizing heft in Nevada for the Sanders campaign. Meanwhile, the Clark County Education Association, Nevada's largest teachers union, announced Monday that it too would back the Vermont senator.\n\nSanders has invested heavily in Nevada, which votes third after Iowa and New Hampshire. The contest is seen as a crucial test of candidates' support among Hispanic and Asian American voters, as well as the powerful labor unions that dominate Democratic politics in the state.\n\nThe Nevada caucuses could also be an early barometer for neighboring California, the mammoth Super Tuesday contest where the Sanders campaign has also focused significant resources.\n\nSanders boasts 10 offices and over 100 staffers in Nevada, the most of any candidate the state. And if not for a heart attack that sidelined the senator in Las Vegas more than three months ago, he would have recorded the most days publicly campaigning in Nevada of any candidate in the race.\n\nThe Clark County Black Caucus represents the diverse coalition we're building in Nevada and I am proud to gain their support, Sanders said in a statement.\n\nTheir voice and leadership has brought meaningful change in the lives of the communities they serve, and together, we will fight against a government and political system that have historically oppressed African Americans, he added in part.\n\nThe Clark County Black Caucus, which backed Sanders in 2016, had endorsed Cory Booker late last year after a vote among its membership of some 400 Nevadans. At the time, the group indicated that Sanders was their second choice.\n\nBooker, who suspended his campaign for president on Monday, suggested Tuesday in an interview with CBS This Morning that he was not yet ready to endorse a Democratic candidate for president. However, multiple backers of Booker tell CBS News they have already been aggressively courted by other campaigns.\n\nRecent polls in Nevada show Sanders in a tight race with Joe Biden this year. But while Biden's team is dwarfed by the staff Sanders has amassed, the former vice president has nabbed the support of key progressive leaders in the state.\n\nThe leadership of the influential Nevada Culinary Union has remained publicly skeptical of Medicare for All, the single-payer healthcare proposal at the heart of the Sanders platform. And just this week, a USA Today/Suffolk survey showed Sanders still trailing the Biden among black Nevada caucus-goers.\n\nWilliams hopes the Clark County Black Caucus can help boost the senator's chances among that demographic and is planning events to support the campaign in its home stretch. Early voting in Nevada kicks off in just a month, on February 15th.\n\nI have no ill will with Biden. But I just strongly believe that it's time for change for black America. It's time for Bernie Sanders and his policy that's going to provide for an America that's more racially just, said Williams.
Many of the 27 million people taking a cruise this year will spend a fair amount of shipboard time cozying up to the bar. But liquid lubrication may cost consumers more than it's worth.\n\nThat's because drinking alcohol can void your travel insurance policy, or what travel insurance website SquareMouth warns is one of the biggest mistakes cruise-goers make. In other words, don't drink on board and assume your emergencies will be covered if you incur an injury.\n\nThe health insurance policies that protect Americans where they live and work don't always extend to cruise ships. Because of that, many cruise passengers buy an additional policy from companies such as AXA, Berkshire Hathaway and Nationwide. Those policies include coverage for medical emergencies, but there's sobering fine print: coverage doesn't apply to intoxicated passengers.\n\nTravel insurance can cover expensive cruise ship medical costs unless the traveler is intoxicated, said SquareMouth Director of Marketing Carolyn Leckie. This is a standard exclusion in all policies. The language used is 'claims resulting from expenses incurred as a result of being intoxicated above the legal limit.'\n\nIt's important to realize that a serious injury, such as a fall on a stairway or in one of the ship's pools, can mount into an emergency that costs far more than it would on dry land. If onboard medical personnel don't have the skills or equipment to treat the passenger, they might decide to lift the passenger by helicopter to an onshore hospital at a cost of up to $25,000. International evacuations could be even more costly.\n\nChartering a plane to then fly the patient back to a U.S. hospital from a foreign country with limited medical services could tack on another $100,000. None of this is ordinarily covered by a standard health insurance policy.\n\nA cruise passenger involved in an accident while drunk may mount the same defense as a motorist charged with driving under the influence, claiming they weren't intoxicated. But this is where the passenger and the cruise line could part company. The cruise line will have to provide documentation during the claims process, such as medical records or a police report, that could undermine the passenger's claim for coverage, according to SquareMouth.\n\nCruise lines aren't unique in excluding drunkenness as a reason not to collect on travel insurance. It also applies to both domestic and international resorts.\n\nIf a traveler has a medical emergency while intoxicated, they will not be reimbursed for those medical expenses, said Leckie. Travel insurance policies can also exclude dangerous activities, such as bungee jumping or skydiving, as well as lower impact activities like kayaking or riding in a hot-air balloon.\n\nCruise lines may offer cheap deals during Wave Season, from January to March, but the discounted price is often made up by the high profit margin earned on the onboard sale of liquor, which is free-flowing and always available. Before passengers drink up, they may want to give a sobering thought to the downsides.
The Federal Reserve finds itself between the proverbial rock and a hard place as it has embarked on a path of raising interest rates in the face of a slowing U.S. and global economy.\n\nAfter much postponing in the face of low inflation and concerns about the global economy, the U.S. central bank in December officially pulled the plug on an unprecedented period of easy monetary policy, raising the federal funds rate from at or near zero to 0.25 percent and signaling four additional moves in 2016.\n\nThe Fed is in a tricky position today, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's global chief investment officer of fixed income told CBS News at the World Economic Forum at Davos. They are starting to move in a period of time where we've seen growth in the world slow.\n\nThe BlackRock portfolio manager is among a growing number of investors and analysts who have dialed back expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates four times this year.\n\nThe Fed has described how they are going to move four times this year. I don't think they are going to move four times this year, said Rieder, who believes there will be at most two hikes by the Fed in 2016. Growth in the world is difficult, volatility is higher in the world, said Rieder of the hand the Fed has been dealt.\n\nArt Hogan, chief strategist at Wunderlich Securities, concurred, saying that the stock market's wild and mostly downward ride in recent weeks is in part due to the mixed messages from the Fed. We need a little more clarity as to why they are sticking to a four narrative when the data doesn't support that.\n\nThe Fed is tightening monetary policy as U.S. economic growth loses steam, with the gains made in the U.S. labor market unlikely to be sustained at the same robust pace in the months ahead, Rieder said.\n\nThe Fed has had a window to move rates for a couple of years -- they are going to have to be slower now, Rieder said. You've had this tremendous growth in terms of payrolls, I think you've seen some of the best days in terms of that growth.\n\nThoughts that the global economy would grow more slowly than expected in 2016 have roiled global markets, pushing the S&P 500 (SPX) to a 21-month low earlier in the week. But U.S. stocks on Friday were poised for their first weekly gain of the year, extending a rally into a second day on thinking central banks overseas -- including the European Central Bank (ECB) -- would further their stimulus, even as the Fed moves in the opposite direction.\n\nThe scenario makes the Fed's tight-rope walk that much more dicey, Rieder said.\n\nYou have aggressive monetary policy, like what the ECB is doing, that could drive the dollar higher and slow the U.S. economy -- it's part of why I think they could have gone a number of months ago in terms of beginning this policy.
A federal appeals court in California on Friday initially blocked a centerpiece of the Trump administration's network of restrictive policies at the southern border, ordering officials there to stop sending asylum-seekers to Mexico, where tens of thousands of Latin American migrants returned by the U.S. have been stranded for months.\n\nBut later on Friday, the same court temporarily paused its own order, granting an emergency request filed by Trump administration lawyers who rushed to defend the controversial Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program.\n\nThrough its initial ruling, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had prohibited the government from continuing to enforce the program, known as Remain in Mexico, finding that it is likely illegal. The decision was a major setback for the administration since officials have touted the program as one of the main reasons it curbed an unprecedented influx of Central American families last year that overwhelmed officials and stations across the southern border.\n\nSince early 2019, the U.S. has required nearly 60,000 asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration court proceedings under this program, which has drawn scathing criticism from advocates. They believe the policy violates both domestic and international refugee law, pointing to the high levels of violence and insecurity in the areas of northern Mexico where the U.S. has been sending migrants placed in the program.\n\nThe program's hours-long halt was a short-lived victory for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the group spearheading the legal challenge against the policy, and immigration advocates and lawyers, some of whom traveled to border checkpoints to see if any of their clients could get relief under the initial ruling.\n\nThis is a temporary step and does not change the fact that courts have ruled multiple times against this illegal policy. We will continue working to permanently end this unspeakably cruel policy, Judy Rabinovitz, the top ACLU attorney in the case, said in a statement.\n\nImmigration lawyers working with the Atlanta-based group Lawyers for Good Government, attempted to inform hundreds of asylum seekers of their legal rights after they had been sent back to Matamoros, as part of the Trump administration's Remain in Mexico program. Michael Nigro/Sipa via AP\n\nHours after the court's initial ruling early Friday afternoon, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officers — who interview asylum-seekers in the Remain in Mexico program — were instructed in an email to immediately cease all MPP processing, including cases pending decision service. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the agency that places migrants in the Remain in Mexico program, also said it had issued a cessation of processing under the program.\n\nOn Friday night, top CBP officials, including acting commissioner Mark Morgan, said the agency was reinstating the program.\n\nThis evening, with support of DOJ attorneys and CBP's declaration, the 9th Circuit granted a stay of its earlier order enjoining MPP. @CBP will immediately reinstate MPP! — Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan (@CBPMarkMorgan) February 29, 2020\n\nIn their initial order, which upheld a preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge last spring, two circuit judges on a three-judge panel in San Francisco appeared to share the concerns raised by advocates, writing that migrants returned to northern Mexico risk substantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of their applications for asylum.\n\nU.S. District Judge William A. Fletcher, who was appointed by President Clinton, said in his majority opinion that the asylum-seekers and legal groups the ACLU is representing are likely to succeed on their two main challenges to the policy: that it violates the non-refoulement principle in international and U.S. law of not returning asylum-seekers to places where they may face persecution, and that a 1996 law the administration has been citing to defend the legality of the program does not allow officials to return all asylum-seekers to countries that border the U.S. like Mexico.\n\nCircuit Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, an appointee of President George H. W. Bush, dissented.\n\nOfficials across the administration denounced the initial ruling on Friday. The Trump Administration has acted faithfully to implement a statutory authority provided by Congress over two decades ago and signed into law by President Clinton, a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement. The Ninth Circuit's decision not only ignores the Constitutional authority of Congress and the Administration for a policy in effect for over a year, but also extends relief beyond the parties before the Court.\n\nThough he called the first order reckless, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said his department has other tools to maintain the end of catch and release, presumably referring to recently created rapid deportation programs, as well as deals with countries in Central America's Northern Triangle that allow the U.S. to re-route asylum-seekers there.\n\nAsylum seekers wash clothes on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande at an immigrant camp on December 8, 2019 in the border town of Matamoros, Mexico. Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, who represents the border district in El Paso, praised the 9th Circuit's initial decision. But she called for more than a halt to the policy. DHS must now follow the law, issue guidance for the nearly 60,000 asylum-seekers who have been returned to Mexico, employ alternatives to detention, and guarantee the humane treatment of all asylum-seekers, Escobar said in a statement.\n\nAs a result of the MPP policy, tens of thousands of asylum-seekers from Central America, Cuba, Venezuela and other Latin American countries who would otherwise be in the U.S. are stranded in overcrowded shelters and squalid makeshift encampments in northern Mexico, including in crime-ridden cities like Ciudad Juárez and Matamoros, located in a region the U.S. government warns American travelers not to visit due to rampant violence.\n\nAdvocates and even some of the asylum officers implementing the program have been withering in their criticism of Remain in Mexico, saying it violates international obligations against returning migrants seeking refuge to dangerous places. The group Human Rights First has denounced hundreds of reported kidnappings and assaults.\n\nA CBS News series last summer detailed the due process concerns about the policy, which makes it extremely difficult for migrants to secure U.S.-based lawyers generally needed for successful asylum claims. According to data by researchers at Syracuse University, only about 5% of migrants in the program have had lawyers represent them in proceedings in the U.S. — which, for many migrants, now occur inside makeshift tent-like courts in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nOut of about 35,500 completed cases in the program, only 263 migrants have been granted asylum or some other form of protection, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).\n\nDespite the criticism, the administration has defended the Remain in Mexico program as an effective tool in reducing border apprehensions, which have dropped for eight consecutive months since May.\n\nThe policy had been briefly blocked by a federal judge in April, but the 9th Circuit ruled in May that the administration could proceed with the policy as it considered the merits of the legal challenge mounted by several advocacy groups. After the panel's decision, the administration dramatically expanded the program with the consent of the Mexican government, which accepted the expansion last summer after Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs.\n\nIn a separate ruling on Friday, another panel in the 9th Circuit upheld a lower court injunction that has blocked a rule that would render migrants who cross the border in between ports of entry ineligible for asylum.\n\nOnce again the courts have recognized there is tremendous danger facing asylum seekers along the entire southern border, and that the administration cannot unilaterally rewrite the laws, said Lee Gelernt, the top ACLU attorney in that case.
The idea that the Federal Reserve might take interest rates below zero in hopes of stimulating economic growth has recently picked up steam in financial markets. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged that she's not certain the central bank could legally implement the scenario.\n\nDuring her testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, Yellen said she did not foresee the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) being in a situation anytime soon where it would see a need to cut rates. Still, the possibility of negative rates is something the Fed should look at, given Europe's experience, she added.\n\nThe European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan recently reduced their benchmark rates into negative terrain in an effort to add further stimulus.\n\nThe issue has presented itself in the U.S. amid worries about the global economy and what tools the Fed has at its disposal to fight another downturn, given it only in December hiked short-term interest rates off record lows for the first time since 2006.\n\nResponding to questions from lawmakers, Yellen said: I am not aware of anything that would prevent us from doing it, but I'm saying we have not fully investigated the legal issues -- that still needs to be done.\n\nI would say that remains a question that we would still need to investigate more thoroughly, Yellen added.\n\nThe question in question is whether or not the law that gives the Fed the power to pay banks interest on reserve balances deposited at the Fed -- the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 -- also empowers it to charge interest.\n\nFor Yellen, the issue goes beyond one of legality. Could the plumbing of the payment system in the United States handle it? Is our institutional structure of our money markets compatible with it? We've not determined that.\n\nBut from Yellen's public stance, the Fed continues to anticipate a gradual rise in rates by the central bank, even as the recent upheaval in the markets and uncertainty about global economic growth could take the Fed off course from the four increases that had been forecast by the Fed this year.\n\nThe monetary policy makers next gathering to mull a rate increase comes at a two-day session starting March 15.\n\nWhile Yellen is not ruling out an increase next month, fed funds futures are pricing in no hikes this year.
Facebook says it has removed hundreds of Russia-linked pages, groups and accounts that it says were part of two big disinformation operations, in its latest effort to combat fake news.\n\nThe social media company said Thursday it took action after finding two networks that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior on its Facebook and Instagram platforms.\n\nFacebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said in a blog post that one network operated in countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the other focused on Ukraine.\n\nThe people running the accounts represented themselves as independent news sources and posted on topics like anti-NATO sentiment and protest movements, although Facebook said one network of 364 pages was linked to employees of Sputnik, a Russian state-run English-language news site.\n\nSome of the Pages frequently posted about topics like anti-NATO sentiment, protest movements, and anti-corruption, Gleicher wrote in the blog post. We are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don't want our services to be used to manipulate people.\n\nSputnik did not reply to emailed requests for comment.\n\nSputnik activity\n\nFacebook said the Sputnik-linked accounts has been active for years, organizing about 190 events that started in August 2015 and as recently as January 2019. The pages had about 790,000 followers.\n\nUp to 1,200 people expressed interest in at least one of these events. We cannot confirm whether any of these events actually occurred, Gleicher wrote.\n\nThe company said about $135,000 spending in ads were paid for in euros, rubles and U.S. dollars, with the ads starting in October 2013 and running as recently as this month.\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nFacebook said it also received a tip from U.S. law enforcement that led it to remove 107 Facebook pages, groups and accounts, as well as 41 Instagram accounts, for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior as part of a network that originated in Russia and operated in Ukraine.\n\nThe individuals behind these accounts primarily represented themselves as Ukrainian, and they operated a variety of fake accounts while sharing local Ukrainian news stories on a variety of topics, such as weather, protests, NATO, and health conditions at schools, Gleicher noted.\n\nThese accounts had about 180,000 Facebook followers and 55,000 Instagram followers.
The Justice Department on Saturday night filed an appeal to a court order halting President Trump's travel ban, requesting that implementation of the controversial executive order resume immediately.\n\nThe 125-page filing states that Friday night's injunction harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the President, based on his national security judgment.\n\nThe Justice Department lawyers write that Mr. Trump has determined that '[d]eteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States,' and that our Nation accordingly must take additional steps 'to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.'\n\nThe initial injunction, handed down by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, effectively paused all implementation of Mr. Trump's signed executive order, which prohibited entry into the U.S. to all refugees and citizens from seven countries with Muslim-majority populations.\n\nThe ruling was the result of a lawsuit brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota against the Trump administration challenging the ban. Robart issued a temporary restraining order to pause its implementation until the case was heard, saying the states had legal standing to contest the president's directive and had showed their case was likely to succeed.\n\nThe departments of State and Homeland Security complied immediately with the order by the Seattle-based judge.\n\nOn Saturday, the State Department issued a statement saying it had reinstated visas that were not physically canceled, so travel to the U.S. could resume for those banned under the executive order.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also instructed its employees to suspend any actions carrying out the ban, including the detention and removal of travelers. Traveler inspections, DHS said, would continue in accordance with standard policy and procedure.
For years, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low to spur investment and encourage individuals to borrow. But that policy, an effort to boost economic growth after the 2008 financial crisis, has come at a cost for the millions of Americans with savings accounts.\n\nThat has been especially painful for people living on fixed incomes, such as retirees. A decade ago, a high-yield savings account with a balance of $25,000 would have generated $1,150.62 in annual interest. Today, consumers are lucky to find accounts paying 1.05 percent interest, which would generate annual interest payments of $263.88, or almost $900 less than a decade ago, according to a study from financial site NerdWallet.\n\nExtrapolated to the national level, that means savings account holders have missed out on $7.7 billion in interest during the last decade, NerdWallet said.\n\nYet while workers and retirees have had even less of an incentive to sock away money in the low-interest rate environment, they're saving a bit more than they did a decade ago -- about 5.2 percent of disposable income now, compared with 3.3 percent in 2006. Placing that money in a savings account might not be the best choice on a number of levels, NerdWallet banking expert Devan Goldstein said.\n\nWith rates as low as they have been, your savings might not keep up with inflation, he said. We all need a savings account, but it might actually cost you money to save when you measure it against inflation. That was stunning to of all of us.\n\nEven though Americans are saving more than in 2006, it's still not enough to create the three-to-six month cushion that financial experts recommend. About four out of 10 American households don't have enough liquid savings to handle a $2,000 expense, the Pew Charitable Trusts found in a 2015 study. About eight of 10 admitted they have lower savings than households similar to theirs should have.\n\nEven though NerdWallet found that Americans are saving more than they did a decade ago, Goldstein cautions that the numbers may reflect the considerable gains experienced by America's top earners, whose income growth has far outpaced those in the middle- and lower income brackets.\n\nThe first step for most Americans is simply to start saving more, with Goldstein recommending a beginning goal of socking away 10 percent of income, and looking beyond savings accounts for a more lucrative haven.\n\nIt's a reality that people who have fixed incomes do rely on savings accounts. That's something we would recommend against, he said. Somewhere in the toolkit between savings accounts and an index fund is a low-risk but slightly higher return vehicle.\n\nThose include bond funds, annuities and CDs. Other options to consider are alternatives such as real estate or precious metals, Goldstein noted. Each of these products carry their own risks and may not be appropriate for everyone. Others might limit liquidity, such as CDs, which require investors to tie up their money for a period of time.\n\nWith the Fed evaluating a series of rate hikes, it's possible that savings account rates will go up, and we want to help people to be prepared by having good savings habits right now, Goldstein said.
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - TONY BLINKEN\n\nHOST: MICHAEL MORELL\n\nPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nTony, great to have you on the show.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nThanks, Mike. Great to be with you.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nTony, you have a particularly interesting story about how you came to be interested in foreign policy. Can you share that with us?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nYes. You know, I think we're all sort of products of the conversations we hear around the dining room table, the kitchen table in our families. And in my family, a lot of the stories were about the fact that so many of the people that came before me were refugees or immigrants of one kind or another. I had a grandfather who came here at the turn of the last century fleeing pilgrims in what's now Ukraine, was welcome to the United States, built a life for himself, for his children, a stepmother who fled communism, literally, in the dead of night on a train, made her way, at a very young age with her mother, to the United States.\n\nShe, too, was welcome here. And, then, finally, my stepfather who passed away a few years ago, he was one of 900 children in his school in Bialystok, Poland before World War II, the only one of those 900 to survive. His entire immediate family was wiped. Bialystok was the center of Jewish living in Poland.\n\nHe wound up in virtually all of the concentration camps one can remember from history, Auschwitz, Dachau, Majdanek. At the very end of the war, he made a run for it. They were on a death march out of one of the camps in Bavaria. And he made a run for it with some of his friends. And somehow, they made it into the woods.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nHow old was he at the time?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nAt this point, he was 16. So he was in the camps from age 12 to 16. And somehow, they made it to the woods. And they hid out during the day and moved around at night. And after a few days of this, one day, they heard this rumbling sound. And as he looked out from their hiding place, what he saw was a tank.\n\nBut instead of having the dreaded iron cross or a swastika on it, he saw something else. He saw a five-pointed white star. And in a kind of crazy way, he ran to the tank. And the hatch opened up. And an African American GI looked down at him. And he got down on his knees. And he said the only three words that he knew in English that his mother had taught him before the war, God bless America. And at that point, the GI lifted him into the tank into freedom, in effect, into the United States. That was kind of the image that I had of my country growing up, what it represented to people around the world. And I think that's what motivated me as much as anything else to get into foreign policy.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo I don't want to jump too far ahead. But what we're seeing in our country now with the feelings about immigrants and refugees must cut to the core with you.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nIt does. And, you know, on the one hand, look, I think we all get it. People feel a tremendous sense of confusion right now and chaos and a loss of identity. They don't recognize themselves. They don't recognize the country. And it's deeply, deeply, deeply confusing.\n\nAt the same time, we know from our own history that we've gone through successive waves of migration each of which has made the country stronger but each of which, at different points in history, had a counterweight whether it was Irish, whether it was Italians, whether it was Jews, whether it was Asians, whether it's Latinos.\n\nAnd we know that this is incredibly disruptive. And it takes some time to sort it all out. Each time, it's made the country stronger. But during these periods of transition, it's tough. And we have to find a way forward that works for all of our communities as well as working for the people that want to come here.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo in those previous moments of backlash, how did we emerge from them?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nYou know, in these previous moments, there was a transition period. And it was challenging. And I don't want to minimize the disruptions that took place. But there was a recognition the economy might improve as we saw success, as we saw what immigrants were bringing to the country. There was a recognition that this made sense for America. Now, when we look across the broad swath of the economy, look at every pursuit. Who are the folks who are picking our crops?\n\nWho are the folks serving food at our tables, cleaning our homes and, then, as you move up the ladder, nursing the sick in underserved communities, doctoring them and, then, at the highest end, half of our fortune 500 companies foundered or co-foundered by immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants, half of the startups in Silicon Valley, the same thing.\n\nSo we see the success time and time again. But now, in this particular moment, these disruptive forces are more intense and more acute than they've been. And you get a feeling things are just moving in fast motion. And it's very hard for people to be grounded and have a sense that they're going to come out okay on the other side.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo with this historical understanding, are you confident that we're going to come out the other end here?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nLook, this could be the exception that breaks the rule. It's hard to be fully confident. You know, I'm reminded of the late John McCain who said, It's always darkest before it goes completely black. But all of that said, I don't believe that.\n\nI think that most of us have a sense of optimism based on our history because we've been through incredibly tough periods before. The 1960s, to take a recent example, the late 1960s were far more disruptive than the period that we're going through now. The dawn of the progressive era, to me, this is maybe most closely approximate to that.\n\nWe had, before the progressive era, capitalism fully unleashed in this country producing tremendous wealth and, in many ways, tremendous progress but also in a way that was not evenly distributed, that was leaving too many people out, too many people behind.\n\nAnd thankfully, we had a progressive era in which the rough edges of capitalism were rounded off. More people were brought into the mix. We made major investments in education, in healthcare, in infrastructure, progressive taxation. Now, in a sense, we need a progressive era but on a global scale. That's really the change of the moment to figure out how we can take these incredible forces that are at play, bringing tremendous advantages globalization, but in way that doesn't leave too many people out of the deal.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So I heard Warren Buffet say not long ago, you know how there's things that people say that stay with you for the rest of your life, this was one of those moments, he said, I believe that capitalism was the greatest force for good in the history of mankind, which I believe, too. And, then, he said, But I fear we're going to lose it unless we take care of the people that it leaves behind.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nI couldn't agree more. There is a crisis of legitimacy for capitalism that we're going through now. And, again, we've been through it before. This is what happened before the progressive era. It happened before the New Deal. And in a sense, it's happening now but, again, on a global scale.\n\nAnd we figured out how to get through these periods before. Now, could this be different? Absolutely. At each big transformation there was a transitional period. And somehow, we wound up on the other side in a better place. That may still happen. But you still have to get to the other side. And that's the challenge we're in now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay. Then, the impact of all of this on our foreign policy and our role in the world, how do you think about that?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nWell, I think there's increasingly recognition that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it actually has to work for people here at home. And if it doesn't, then, it's going to be very difficult to sustain it. And so, for example, if we have a foreign trade policy, an economic policy that's not also working to materially improve the lives of the people here, it's not going to be sustained.\n\nIf we have a foreign policy that people perceive is somehow getting us into problems that we shouldn't be involved in, that may be difficult to sustain as well. So being clear with our fellow citizens explaining what we're doing, why we're doing it, what the objectives are, how it's going to actually make their lives better is usually important. But, Mike, I'd say another thing, we shouldn't be a prisoner to history. But we should at least be informed by it. And I think the period after World War II was hugely instructive and remains very instructive because that was a period in time when, after the war, we could've retreated as we did after World War I.\n\nWe could've pulled back. Or we could've used the tremendous power that we had to, basically, lord it over others. And we didn't do either of those things. Famously, we spent time building the institutions, developing the norms, the rules that others live by but also ourselves. And that seemed counterintuitive.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd spending a tremendous amount of money rebuilding our enemies.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nAbsolutely. But here's what we got out of it, we did, we invested in their prosperity. We invested in their security. But we got new markets for our products. We got new partners to deal with global challenges. We got new allies to deter aggression. Those investments, we got ten, 20, 100 times over in return. And that's why, as we think about today, we shouldn't be blind to what we did in the past because it does hold lessons.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Tony, one of the things that I worry about is that we national security folk, foreign policy folk, have a hard time articulating for the average American why America's role in the world is so important to them. I mean, I've been places in the country where people say to me, Mr. Morell, why does it matter what Vladimir Putin does in Ukraine? Or why does it matter what the Chinese do in the South China Sea? How does that affect me? How do you answer that question?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nYou know, I spent about 25 years in government. And one of the things I took away is this, the world doesn't govern itself. And over the past 70-plus years, the United States has played a lead role in helping to govern the world, again, establishing the institutions but also defending them, helping to put in place the rules and the norms.\n\nAnd we know this, if we're not doing it, if we're not playing a lead role, then, one of two things: either someone else will and probably not in a way that advances our interests and values or even worse, perhaps, no one does. And, then, the forces of anarchy and chaos prevail. And in the past when that's happened, that's created big global conflagrations World War I, World War II.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhich we get sucked into.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nWhich we get sucked into.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nPay now or pay later.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nIt's pay now or pay a lot more later. And the other thing I'd say is this, we have extraordinary resources in this country. And with those resources, with that wealth, with that success I think comes a certain amount of responsibility to at least do our part in advancing the common good. But it's also something called enlightened self-interest. Yes, it's doing right by others. But, ultimately, that does well by us.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay. Let's do an around the world kind of hotspots approach. And as we do these, Tony, I would ask you to kind of assess the situation, assess the Trump administration's approach to that issue. And if you disagree with it, say what would you recommend to the president instead. Okay. So let's start with Saudi Arabia.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nSaudi Arabia, I think the administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to use a horrific, terrible event, the murder of this journalist, Khashoggi, to use that as a way to influence Saudi behavior and Saudi policies in a way that better reflect our interests and our values. There was a moment to go to Saudi Arabia and say a few things. One, your new leader or de facto leader, the crown prince, acts in impulsive and sometimes reckless ways.\n\nWe're not telling you who should lead your country. But we are telling you he needs to be reined in in some fashion. You choose how. Second, this horrific war in Yemen that is doing extraordinary damage to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of innocent civilians, that needs to end.\n\nYou need to actually take the first step in helping to end it. We're here to defend you. We will defend you from any aggression by the Houthis in Yemen. But you need to take steps to end this war. And we won't be complicit in it anymore.\n\nThird, this crazy division with Qatar, that needs to end. You need to resolve it. And you also need to demonstrate to the world that the things you're talking about in terms of liberalizing your country you mean. And that means letting people who've been simply trying to advance and advocate for their rights out of jail.\n\nThere was a moment to do all of that. That moment seems to have been squandered. Saudi Arabia seems to have a blank check. This is not about ending the alliance or the partnership with Saudi Arabia. It is making sure that the alliance actually reflects our interests and our values not just Saudi Arabia's.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYour view on the likelihood that Mohammad Bin Salman is going to change, because, I mean, there's been such a pattern here of reckless behavior. Right? And it seems to flow from both an arrogance and a paranoia. And people who have paranoia, as they get older, it tends not to go away. So I'm really wondering here about how likely he is to change, ultimately.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nLook, I'm skeptical, which is why I think Saudi Arabia needs a governor on his impulsiveness and his recklessness of their choice -- whether it's a regent, whether it's a council, something. But look, he is whatever he is, 33, 34 now. I don't want to rule that out either.\n\nYou know, I met him when he was 29. He had just become defense minister. And this was just after the Houthi aggression taking over Sana'a and Yemen and then, moving on the rest of the country. And then, the Saudis and the emirates intervened with our backing. And I was dispatched to Saudi Arabia to say two things. One was to make it clear that we were committed to Saudi Arabia's defense if they were attacked in any way by the Houthis, we would be there.\n\nBut two was to ask them, 'What are you trying to accomplish in Yemen? What's the strategic objective?' And the answer I got from Mohammad Bin Salman in the meeting with him was, immediately, 'To remove every last vestige or Iranian influence in Yemen,' to which I responded, 'Good luck, not going to happen.'\n\nMy hope is that with experience, including the experience of what he has brought on himself through this horrific, horrific action and murder of a journalist, that if he's going to remain around, that he learns something from it. But the jury's out.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWe'll see. Just across the Persian Gulf, Iran.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nLook, I think the irony with Iran is that we have a lot of problems and challenges posed by Iran including its support for terrorism, including its meddling in various countries in the region, including, of course, its abysmal record at home on human rights. The irony is this: the one thing we got right, actually curbing its nuclear weapons program and putting a check on it, is the one thing we just tore up -- which makes no sense. And now, it actually makes it more difficult to deal with the other challenges posed by Iran.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhy more difficult?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nTwo reasons, first, I think the reason the Obama administration focused like a laser on trying to deal with the problem that was an urgent problem, which was Iran having the capacity to move to a nuclear weapon very, very quickly, to have the capacity to have enough fissile material on very short order to build a weapon was urgent, because of the immediate threat that that would pose if they actually developed a weapon -- but also because it would allow them to act with even greater impunity in these other areas where they posed a threat to our interests and to what we were trying to achieve in the region. Now, I think we have the worst of both worlds. Iran, for the time being, continues to abide by its obligations under the deal. It's trying to see if it can get the economic benefits it bargained for from Europe and from other countries. And we'll see if that's sustainable.\n\nWhat I worry about it this, given the administration's efforts to squeeze Iran economically and to use the leverage that we have with our economy to force other countries to abandon any kind of economic relationship with Iran, at some point, those in Iran who are against the nuclear deal from the beginning will reassert themselves and say, We're no longer abiding by our obligations. And, then, Mike, we'll be right back where we were before we got into the deal which is Iran on the threshold of having enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. And we'll be faced with the binary choice that we tried to avoid.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight. Right. And we're sending a signal, a very strong signal, whether it's the policy or not, I don't know. But we're sending a signal that we're all about regime change. And if you're the Iranians, why would you ever negotiate with people who want you to go away?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nThat's right. That's right. The idea that Iran is now going to do more and get less under duress doesn't make any sense.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAfghanistan -- we've been there for 17 years.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nThis is one of the toughest problems and I think one of the most enduring frustrations that I've had. And I have to acknowledge here that I actually think President Trump's instincts are probably right on this, which is, it's time. It's time to cut the cord.\n\nAnd this goes against a lot of, I think, instincts that a lot of us have because we know what the Taliban regime meant to the people of Afghanistan -- and not in a good way. We know that real progress has been made in improving the lives of people in Afghanistan. At the same time, the position we're in is not sustainable.\n\nAnd where I'm particularly frustrated is this --and you'll remember this well -- virtually every year, we would hear from our colleagues, We just need one more year, just one more year. And it will be self-sustaining. The Afghans will be able to fend for themselves.\n\nThe military will be able to control the security situation along with the police. And year after year, it was just one more year. I think our finger's been in the dyke in Afghanistan for a long time. I, obviously, worry what will happen when we take it out. But I also think that, at this point, it's just not sustainable.\n\nAnd we also have to remember why we were there in first place. As much as one can appreciate some of the successes that the international community had in improving the lives of Afghans, the bottom-line, hard reality is that we were there because of 9/11 and because of Al Qaeda. And that threat has been, if not eliminated, significantly reduced to the point where I think it can be contained without having 15,000 Americans in Afghanistan.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI mean, one of the ways I think about it is to ask if we weren't there now, would we go? And the answer to that is no.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nI think you've got it right.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAbsolutely. Russia, Putin's aggression on a number of fronts, right, whether it's with his neighbors, whether it's what he's doing in Syria, whether it's what he is doing in terms of weaponizing social media, a whole bunch of issues. How do we deal with that?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nPutin is playing a losing hand brilliantly. Russia, by virtually every metric, is actually in decline. And, yet, he succeeded in reasserting Russia on the world stage, to some extent to distract from problems at home, to some extent to try to realize a vision that he has of a greater Russia, but mostly I think for this reason -- the biggest threat to Putin's continued leadership in Russia is really the success of democracy.\n\nAnd that's true, by the way, for just about any autocrat. And he has a profound strategic interest in trying to demonstrate to his own people that democracies are failing, that our system is no better than his. It's not delivering better results. To the contrary, it's chaotic, not stable. And so, unfortunately, whether we like it or not and even if we pull back and didn't engage Russian aggression, I believe he would continue to try to create trouble in Europe, in the United States, within our societies and between them. So this is a huge challenge for us.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nHow do we engage him in a way that makes this much better?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nA few things. First of all, let's take Ukraine and let's take Russian aggression with regard to some of its neighbors. First, I think it's a good thing that we expanded NATO. There's a big argument over whether NATO expansion actually has provoked Russian behavior.\n\nI asked myself where would the Baltic states be right now if they were not in NATO? Where would Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic be in their own ways? I think that's proved to be a tremendous deterrent to Russian aggression. But states like Ukraine that are not in it, there's a reason that we got involved in leading the effort to put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression, and, we hope, actually return sovereignty to Ukraine. And it's not because on a basic level Ukraine, itself, is that critical to the United States or to countries in Europe. It's because the norms that were violated in terms of aggressing a democratic country on Russia's borders, changing its borders by force, trying to dictate to people their choices about with whom they would ally or associate, if you allow that to stand, it is an open invitation to aggression and anarchy throughout the world.\n\nSo we have to stand up against that. And I think sustaining that is important. And we've sustained it. And the Trump administration, despite what the president says, the administration, itself, has sustained it. But at home, we have to do a much better job, of course, at defending our democratic institutions from the kind of meddling not only in the elections in 2016 but everything that's followed since.\n\nAnd I think we've got a couple of big challenges there. First, we're not properly defended. Second, we don't have a clear and effective deterrence policy. We need to actually be very clear about what we'll actually do if we're attacked, and mean it and actually do it. And, then, we probably have to look at how we would use these tools ourselves, and also what the right responses would be. And they may well be asymmetric, responding tit for tat, for example, against some kind of cyber--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe problem, of course, is that politics has got in the middle of this issue, right, and has not allowed the discussion that you want to have on this to actually occur.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nThis should've been a unifying issue. This should've brought people together because the attack is not on Democrats or on Republicans or anyone else. It's on our democracy. And that's the one thing that should unite us. And, unfortunately, that's what we're losing right now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nNorth Korea.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nSo on North Korea, look, I think that there was some merit in President Trump throwing the deck of cards up in the air and seeing what came from it, because the fact of the matter is the policy that successive administrations have pursued over the last decades has not worked.\n\nNorth Korea's gotten more dangerous, not less dangerous. Its arsenal has gotten bigger, not smaller. And so, at some point, you say, Maybe it's worth trying something new. And I don't object to direct diplomacy even with someone as heinous Kim Jong Un. But, unfortunately, thus far at least, the art of the deal has really been the art of the steal and all in North Korea's favor.\n\nI think the president in having the meeting with Kim Jong Un gave Kim Jong Un something that he deeply, deeply valued and that none of his predecessors were able to get. And that was the legitimacy that comes from meeting with the leader of the free world being on the same stage.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThat was the questioned they always asked, he and his father, When can I meet with the president? When can I meet with the president?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nSo President Trump would say, See, I did something that no previous president did. Well, there was a good reason that previous presidents didn't do it. Or if you're going to do it, at least make sure you're getting something. And, unfortunately, thus far at least, we haven't.\n\nNorth Korea's program has continued. We continue to see reports in the press from our intelligence agencies and others showing that far from pulling back, they're moving forward. At the same time in elevating Kim Jong Un, in declaring success and even saying, at one point, that the nuclear problem was resolved, the president gave a green light to other countries, starting with China, to go back to something approaching business as usual. What had been working and where the administration deserves credit was it not only continued, but it actually deepened the pressure program that the Obama administration put in place to cut off every economic tie that North Korea had, diplomatic ties, political ties. And that was starting to have an effect.\n\nChina, of course, is a key to that. Now, the president has, basically, said to China, Hey, if the problem's resolved, why should China have to continue doing this?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe Chinese, the Russians and the South Koreans have all loosened up.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nThat's exactly right. That's exactly right. You know, again, I give him some points for trying a different playbook, the way he's played it, I think, is making things worse, not better.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nHow would you fix that? I mean, if you could say to Mike Pompeo, Here's what I think you need to do?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nLook, I think we were on the right track. And we need to figure out a way to get back to it, which was a sustained pressure campaign that's internationally coordinated but that has an objective not of regime change but conduct change. The hard reality is it's, if not impossible, highly unlikely that we will achieve in any near term the complete denuclearization of North Korea. I just don't see that as realistic in the near term.\n\nWhat I think we can get is an arms control and, over time, disarmament process put in place. But that requires enough pressure, sustained and comprehensive to get North Korea to the table. And that requires China. It requires South Korea. It requires Russia. It requires others. It's doable. But it takes time. It has to be sustained. And it has to be comprehensive. So there's a play there. But we haven't seen signs of the administration being willing to do it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay. The toughest one of all, China. Right. What should our strategic approach to China be?\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nWe had an approach for decades that sought to bring China more and more into the international system starting with the international economy on theory that this would actually liberalize China at the same time. And thus far, at least, that theory has not borne out.\n\nNow, history is long -- especially Chinese history. So maybe we're assessing the situation too soon. But clearly, the consensus that had developed over the right approach, the responsible stakeholder approach right now, at least, is in serious doubt. But I still think the basics of what we were trying to do, which was work to cooperate with China where we can, compete with it where we must but compete in a way that has a level playing field and basic fairness, is still the right approach.\n\nBut now, we're stuck in a different dynamic. And that is a veering wildly between confrontation on the one hand and abdication on the other hand. So on the one hand, a very confrontational approach over trade and related issues which is not wrong in the sense that the lack of reciprocity in the commercial relationship was totally un-sustained.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThese are real issues.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nThese are real issues. The president was right to confront the issue, I think profoundly wrong in the way he's doing it; throwing out the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a huge strategic mistake. This was our best lever to change Chinese behavior. 40% of world GDP with us in it represented, something that China would want to get into, not stay out of, that's gone. Not making common cause with our allies who are similarly situated when it comes to China, who are aggrieved in the same way with technology transfer, the theft of intellectual property, the lack of transparency, unfair competition from state-owned enterprises.\n\nWe should've been on the same team with them. Instead, of course, starting a tariff war against our closest partners has made that more difficult. But that needs to be dealt with. But I think that as we're doing that, we can't abdicate our leadership in the region.\n\nAnd, again, out of TPP is an abdication of our leadership. Telling our allies, 'You know what, you're going to be on your own. We don't want to pay for this anymore,' that's an abdication of leadership. And if there's a vacuum, look, what have we seen? A profound irony.\n\nWe've seen Xi Jinping try to assert himself as a leader of the global community who is in favor of a free and open trading system, who supports globalization, who supports the United Nations, peacekeeping, whose voting shares are increasing in the international financial institutions at the same time when we're pulling back from all of that. And that means that, again, in the absence of American leadership, in the absence of an American model, a Chinese model could win by default not because it's better.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo one of the two outcomes you talked about earlier.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nExactly.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight. Right. Tony, you have been fantastic with your time. I just want to ask you one final question. You worked very closely with two people who may run for president in 2020, Joe Biden and John Kerry. What I'd love to hear you talk about a little bit is how would a Biden foreign policy or a Kerry foreign policy be different from an Obama foreign policy because I think most people think it would be exactly the same. And I'm just wondering what you think.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nLook, I can't speak for either Secretary Kerry or Vice President Biden when it comes to what policies they would pursue if they, you know, were to continue in public life in some fashion. I think, in fact, in either case, the basic principles were the same.\n\nBut we're also in a different moment. And it's the moment we talked about at the very outset, a moment in which there are people in our own country, people in allied countries, people around the world who are feeling a sense of chaos, confusion and vulnerability because of the rapidity and profundity of change, technological change, the flow of information, at the same time, a paradox when, by so many metrics, we're better off than we've ever been in history and, yet, too many people left out and left behind in that situation.\n\nThe best way to look at it is, on the one hand, over the last 30 to 40 years extraordinary success in alleviating poverty around the world. And, yet, inequality is growing at the same time. And those two things put together create a lot of disaffected people either economically or culturally and, then, finally, huge power shifts not only among countries but beyond them, between them, the rise of China that we talked about but also super empowered groups and individuals, corporate chieftains, the mayors of megacities, all of these new actors making it more difficult for nation states to get the results that they would get in the past. That's an increasingly new reality. And technology's driving a lot of it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBut the next President's going to have adjust to.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nThe next president, whoever it is, has to deal with that. And I think that, again, this comes down to a president who understands that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it has to actually work for people here at home. It has to show them that it's making their own lives safer, more prosperous. And, ultimately, that's the test.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nTony, thank you for being with us.\n\nTONY BLINKEN:\n\nGreat to be with you, Mike, as always.
President Donald Trump and his economic advisers focus on trade deficits when it comes to China, and Mr. Trump has said a trade war would be easy to win. But trade relationships — and their impacts — are far more complex.\n\nChinese data released overnight show the trade gap between the world's two largest economies was at a record high in 2018, and it may signal a broader global economic slowdown, according to economists. An alarming point in the latest Chinese trade data was a slowdown in the country's exports in December, shrinking by 4.5 percent to $221.2 billion, while imports declined 7.2 percent to $164.2 billion.\n\nThat led global stock markets to slide in Monday trading as fears mounted that global growth is slowing. In the U.S., the S&P 500 lost 0.5 percent, and the Dow industrials fell 0.4 percent.\n\nHere's a rundown on what the latest numbers show.\n\nRecord trade gap\n\nChina's 2018 trade surplus with the U.S. surged to a record $323.3 billion. That means the U.S. purchased that much more in goods and services from China than it shipped to the country.\n\nMr. Trump's trade war with Beijing may be starting to take a toll both at home and in China, even though the White House is holding back on additional tariff measures until March while the two sides try to negotiate a trade deal. U.S. and Chinese officials ended a three-day negotiating session last week with no sign of agreements or word on what their next step would be.\n\nBut penalties of up to 25 percent already imposed on billions of dollars of each other's goods remain in place, raising the cost for American and Chinese buyers of soybeans, medical equipment and consumer goods, from purses and bicycles to furniture and tech gear.\n\nTariffs are taxes paid by companies, not countries, to import goods and services. Yet tariffs are just one of the many factors in China's slowing growth, economists at Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients. They estimate a cooler Chinese economy could cut about 0.2 percentage points off global GDP in 2019 compared to the 2018 pace. Other experts have pointed to a potential hit to the U.S. economy from the current partial government shutdown.\n\nAdmittedly, U.S. tariffs may have played a small part in the sharp fall in China's export growth last month, the Capital Economics economists wrote. But growth in exports to the rest of the world also slowed significantly, indicating that softer demand was the main culprit, and that a trade truce with the U.S. would be no guarantee of a strong recovery.\n\nThe trade figures were another sign that growth in the global economy is slowing too, weighing on stocks, the Capital Economics wrote. It expects economies in Europe and the booming U.S. to slip this year.\n\nWhat does it mean for the U.S.?\n\n\n\nIn the U.S., consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity. American households also save far less than their counterparts in Europe and Asia. The personal savings rate among Americans has hovered at less than 5 percent for years as their spending has boomed, according to the Federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of economists point to the high consumption levels and low savings rates in the U.S. as a major determinant of large U.S. trade deficits in general, and China in particular, Michelle Casario, an associate professor at Villanova University, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nTax cuts passed signed into law in late 2017 by Mr. Trump likely gave the U.S. economy a quick lift last year by boosting disposable income. That means Americans are spending even more, while the tax cuts are ballooning the U.S. budget deficit. That could have consequences down the line as the pace of spending will likely slow as the impact of the tax cuts fades.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts not only increased the budget deficit, they also increased disposable income, at least for now, which increases consumption, Casario said. The irony here is that the tax cuts indirectly increased the trade deficit, which has been at the center of Trump's policy agenda.\n\nUnless the large federal budget deficit shrinks and the low savings rate rises, the U.S. will continue to experience the world's largest trade deficit, Casario said. Tariffs do not reduce trade deficits, they simply reduce (or have the potential to reduce) trade flows. The asymmetries in trade will persist.\n\nYear-end stockpiling may also be a factor\n\nAnother reason for the trade deficit's jump last year is that U.S. firms may have hiked their imports of Chinese goods in reaction to Mr. Trump's threat to increase tariffs before he postponed them until March in a December decision.\n\nSome companies have shifted production of goods bound for the U.S. from China to avoid U.S. tariffs. Others are lining up non-Chinese suppliers of industrial components and may have rushed to get some in hand before year-end.\n\nIn anticipation of tariffs, U.S. firms increased their orders from China to avoid the higher costs of imports, Villanova's Casario said. This may continue as U.S. businesses are concerned that Trump will increase the tariffs on the most recent $200 billion from 10 percent to 25 percent, and/or levy tariffs on an additional $250 billion.\n\nAt the same time, Chinese leaders are trying to reduce the country's economic reliance on trade and stoke self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumer spending. But their plans call for keeping exports stable to avoid politically dangerous job losses.\n\nMr. Trump could use the latest trade deficit report as ammunition to boost tariff rates or add new ones after the March 1 truce deadline, Casario said.\n\nAs China's growth slows, it's investing less in the U.S.\n\n\n\nChinese direct investment in the U.S. plummeted to $4.8 billion last year after a steep decline in 2017 to $29 billion, itself a sharp drop from a record-high $46 billion in 2016, a report released over the weekend from Rhodium Group shows.\n\nPast free-trade agreements gave foreign companies incentive to invest in the U.S., typically in manufacturing and in startup companies. That created more U.S. jobs. But imposing tariffs can make it difficult for a country and its companies to invest in the U.S.\n\nPolicies such as how the U.S. uses the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as CFIUS, to more tightly examine transactions with Chinese companies pushed abandoned deals to an all-time high, the Rhodium report said.\n\nOn top of that, it said, trade barriers and a generally more confrontational stance toward China have created tremendous uncertainty for Chinese companies in the U.S., dampening investor appetite and increasing the risk perception of U.S. sellers.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
BP (BP) has cut Chief Executive Bob Dudley's 2016 pay package by 40 percent to $11.6 million, the latest British bluechip company to rein in executive pay after a wave of shareholder revolts.\n\nThe oil company has reduced Dudley's payout and introduced changes from this year that will lower executives' performance incentives. The cuts come after around 60 percent of shareholders opposed BP's pay policy at last year's annual general meeting.\n\nExecutive pay has come under growing scrutiny in Britain after a string of corporate scandals, such as the collapse of store chain BHS, which has fueled mistrust of the high levels of pay awarded to company bosses.\n\nWe applaud the BP remuneration committee for being proactive in responding to the shareholder revolt last year and see this as a milestone in the engagement between companies and shareholders, said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management.\n\nBP's pay policy changes, which will apply for the coming three years if approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting in London on May 17, include lowering Dudley's maximum long-term payout to five times salary from seven times and cutting bonus payments by a quarter.\n\nI have consulted widely with shareholders and listened to and sought to act on their concerns, and have been sensitive to developments in the society in which we work, Ann Dowling, chair of BP's remuneration committee, said in the company's annual report published on Thursday.\n\nDudley's 2016 pay cut was a result of downward discretion to the four components of his total pay, the company said.\n\nEven after a cut of nearly $8 million, Dudley's pay remains well above that of rival European oil companies.\n\nShell's Ben van Beurden was awarded an 8.263 million euro ($8.8 million) pay package for 2016, a 60 percent jump year on year, while Total's Patrick Pouyanne took home 3.8 million euros last year.\n\nBP Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary's overall pay package will be cut by 18 percent to 4.2 million pounds ($5.2 million).\n\nOther large British companies, such as Reckitt Benckiser and GlaxoSmithKline, have also cut executives' pay after shareholders had voiced concerns about their remuneration plans.\n\nBP's annual report also showed the oil company cut a net amount of 2,400 jobs in 2016, after reducing 4,700 roles in 2015, as part of plans to rein in spending in response to weak oil prices.
WASHINGTON -- Janet Yellen was put on the spot about whether she made a mistake in raising interest rates in December. Ben Bernanke was quizzed about what it felt like to be called a traitor by the governor of Texas.\n\nAlan Greenspan was asked if he purposely sought to confuse Congress with his answers. And Paul Volcker was queried about being hung in effigy after he pushed interest rates to levels not seen since the Civil War.\n\nThe event was an unprecedented gathering of leaders of the Federal Reserve -- past and present -- to discuss what it feels like to hold what is considered the world's most powerful economic policy-making job.\n\nThe four Fed leaders appeared Thursday evening at an event to launch a speaker's program honoring Volcker at the International House in New York, a residential dormitory for foreign students. Greenspan appeared by video link from Washington.\n\nTogether, the tenures of the four participants cover more than one-third of the Fed's 102-year history. Their leadership included the double-digit inflation of the 1970s, the global banking and financial market crises of the 1980s and 1990s and, beginning nearly a decade ago, the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.\n\nFareed Zakaria of CNN, who moderated the discussion, asked how the four felt in a job with so much concentrated power that opened them up to criticism when the economy was not doing well.\n\nGreenspan, who was often accused of trying to dodge tough questions at congressional hearings with big words and incredibly long sentences, did not deny employing that tactic. But he said, The real problem is that monetary policy is largely economic forecasting and our ability to forecast is limited. ... How do you convey what you know without going into the area of forecasting beyond our knowledge?\n\nBernanke said he didn't like it in 2011 when he was called a traitor by Rick Perry, who was then governor of Texas and a Republican presidential candidate. But he said he realized that criticism came with the job, especially in times when the Fed was trying to pull the country out of the worst recession since the 1930s.\n\nWe had tremendous responsibilities to address these terrible risks, Bernanke said. I didn't take the job for adulation.\n\nVolcker's policy of high interest rates contributed to pushing the country into two recessions in the early 1980s. But he said even with unhappy farmers and home builders attacking the central bank's policies, the Fed could not have done what it did without broad support from the public for the central bank's attempts to deal with a prolonged bout stagflation, a toxic combination of high inflation and weak economic growth.\n\nPeople were unhappy with malaise and inflation going up, Volcker said. They felt we were doing something.\n\nYellen, who succeeded Bernanke in February 2014, was quizzed about whether she felt the Fed's rate hike in December, a quarter-point move, had been a mistake. In January, the global economy slowed and financial markets went into a tailspin triggered by rising oil prices and increased weakness in China.\n\nI certainly don't regard it as a mistake, Yellen said. She said despite the global weakness, the U.S. economy remains on a solid course. She also disputed the suggestion that the Fed's low rates could be fueling a bubble economy.\n\nThis is an economy on a solid course, not a bubble economy, she said, during the hour-long program.\n\nYellen said that in December the Fed indicated that the pace of future rate hikes would be gradual and she said that remained the Fed's expectation. The central bank's quarter-point move in December was the first rate hike after seven years in which the benchmark rate was kept at a record low near zero. Many private economists believe the next hike will not occur until June.\n\nWe think that a gradual pace of rate increases will be appropriate, Yellen said. The prospects for continued growth and progress in the labor market look good.\n\nAll the Fed leaders stressed that they had not acted alone but with the support of a large group of policymakers and a talented Fed staff, but Volcker said that didn't mean there were not times that they worried about their decisions.\n\nI did worry. I worried all the time, Volcker said.\n\nHe said he sometimes paced so much in his office that he worried about wearing a hole in the rug.
WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to confirm President Donald Trump's nominee to serve as U.S. trade representative, despite clear frustration among some Republicans with the administration on trade.\n\nThe vote was 82-14 to confirm Robert Lighthizer.\n\nHe was deputy U.S. trade representative under President Ronald Reagan and has worked on trade issues as a lawyer representing various manufacturers and high-tech companies.\n\nLighthizer will take his cues from a president who's broken with most Republicans in his criticism of free trade agreements and who's spread the work on trade policy beyond the trade representative.\n\nSome of Lighthizer's strongest support has come from Democratic lawmakers.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon says Lighthizer not only understands how the global trading system works, but also how it sometimes breaks down.\n\nSens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., announced their opposition to Lighthizer a day before the vote because of his position on NAFA.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's home in Louisville, Kentucky, was vandalized early Saturday morning. Spray-painted messages over the Republican leader's front door appear to be in response to his opposition to increasing coronavirus relief checks to Americans from $600 to $2,000.\n\nOne message reads weres (sic) my money, another, Mitch kills the poor, according to photos shared by CBS Louisville affiliate WLKY-TV. McConnell blocked a vote on increasing the checks for three days in a row last week, calling the proposal socialism for rich people.\n\nMcConnell and the GOP argue that the bill would benefit the wealthy. McConnell, however, previously supported the $1 trillion 2017 tax cut, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy. The GOP leader also takes issue with how much money the bill would cost the government. Bigger checks would amount to an estimated $530 billion, about $385 billion more than what $600 checks would cost, according to Heights Securities. The Senate, led by McConnell, on Friday approved a $740 billion defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA.\n\nTo approve the NDAA, the senate had to override a veto by President Trump, marking the first time Congress has voted to override Mr. Trump during his entire presidency.\n\nAfter blocking the House bill that would have authorized $2,000 stimulus checks, McConnell then introduced a bill that linked the increased payments to two separate issues valued by Mr. Trump: Nixing Section 230, a legal shield for internet companies, and creating a commission to examine election integrity. The president also tied a repeal of Section 230 to the NDAA, but several members of Congress, including some Republicans, successfully argued that it was not relevant to national security.\n\nHere is the deal, McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor earlier this week. The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues that President Trump linked together just because Democrats are afraid to address two of them.\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, called the vandalism to McConnell's home unacceptable in a tweet on Saturday. While the First Amendment protects our freedom of speech, vandalism is reprehensible and never acceptable for any reason, Beshear wrote.\n\nMcConnell said in his own statement that vandalism and the politics of fear have no place in our society.\n\nI've spent my career fighting for the First Amendment and defending peaceful protest. I appreciate every Kentuckian who has engaged in the democratic process whether they agree with me or not, reads his statement. My wife and I have never been intimidated by this toxic playbook. We just hope our neighbors in Louisville aren't too inconvenienced by this radical tantrum.\n\nIt appeared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home in San Francisco was also vandalized this weekend, CBS San Francisco reports. The garage door of a residence in the neighborhood of Pacific Heights was spray painted and a pig's head was left on the sidewalk.\n\nThe graffiti, which said cancel rent and we want everything, also appears to be related to the coronavirus stimulus checks. Democrats are in support of bigger checks, and Pelosi herself implored McConnell not to block a vote on the bill. Mitch McConnell, remove the obstacle that you have to the American people having the opportunity to have that direct payment, and do it now, she said.\n\nSan Francisco police would not confirm whether the residence belongs to the speaker. Pelosi is currently in Washington, D.C.
Freshman Congressman Dan Crenshaw said he knew what was in confidential documents about the war in Afghanistan not because he had read them before they were published in The Washington Post, but because he saw the failures of U.S. policy firsthand as a Navy SEAL deployed in the county.\n\nThe Texas Republican, a former Navy SEAL, was deployed to active combat three times as a member of Seal Team Three. In 2012, while on his third deployment in Helmand province, Afghanistan, Crenshaw was hit by an IED blast that exploded next to him. The blast killed a member of his unit.\n\nIt's like being hit by a truck, but everyone in the truck is shooting you with shotguns, Crenshaw told Major Garrett on this week's episode of The Takeout. The blast destroyed Crenshaw's vision in his right eye and severely impacted vision in his left, but he remained in the SEALs and was deployed in non-combat roles twice after he recovered.\n\nIn December, The Washington Post published the Afghanistan Papers, an investigation into 2,000 pages of previously unpublished notes of interviews with people who played a direct role in the war, from generals and diplomats to aid workers and Afghan officials. The investigation revealed that although U.S. officials said they were making progress throughout the 18-year conflict, they knew those declarations were false.\n\nCrenshaw told CBS News he was pleased the Afghanistan Papers were released because they confirmed what the military — and the soldiers he served with — knew: That taking control of the region and then giving that control up was a politically-driven decision.\n\nWhat you're seeing from the Afghan Papers is what you would see from any large, complex organization doing a very complex mission. There's going to be very different opinions on how well things are going, Crenshaw said. You're going to talk about the good stuff and you're going to make it sound that way. I think it's good the Afghan Papers came out actually and forced us to rethink that.\n\nThe U.S.' current involvement in Afghanistan hinges on one question, according to Crenshaw: whether the U.S. would be better off if the U.S. allowed Afghanistan to be controlled by the Taliban.\n\nIt's deterrence against future strongholds for terrorists, that's really what it comes down to, Crenshaw said. Crenshaw favors keeping the current troop levels in Afghanistan, in order to engage in anti-terror operations and to train and equip Afghan government forces.\n\nThe days of roaming around grape fields where I was getting blown up, those are over, Crenshaw said. Unless we're going to put 200,000 troops [in Afghanistan] and hold the territory, it's over and it needs to be over.\n\nGarrett and Crenshaw also discussed the numerous instances of misconduct that have come to light recently involving Navy SEAL soldiers, including the highly publicized accusations of war crimes by Edward Gallagher. Gallagher was acquitted on most of the charges but was found guilty of posing with a corpse. The Navy Board also considered stripping Gallagher of his status as a Navy SEAL. In November, President Trump intervened and restored Gallagher's rank.\n\nIs there a wide-scale disciplinary problem in the SEAL teams? I don't have all the data to really say one way or another, Crenshaw said. It doesn't mean you ignore the problems that exist. It just means that you should be balanced about it and be honest about what's happening and what isn't happening.\n\n\n\nFor more of Major's conversation with Crenshaw, download The Takeout podcast on iTunes, GooglePlay, Spotify and Art19.

Here's an open secret: open office plans are the worst. About 70% of American work spaces are set up as open, where architectural walls disappear, stripping any creative boundaries between you and your cubicled colleagues.\n\nShared space enables team-building, so y'all can value add, and shift paradigms while you move the needle! Except it doesn't work that way, according to science – AND everyone who's ever had to work in one of these open hell holes.\n\nRecent research shows that open office plans result in approximately 73% less face-to-face interaction, as well as a significant increase in electronic activity, because all the hubbub causes workers to tune out with their headphones; and the lack of privacy means your colleague emails you rather than asks you to brainstorm all over everyone's desks.\n\nFaith Salie. CBS News\n\nBut we didn't need science to prove how much open offices suck the life out of your work day.\n\nSince the rows of cubicles and pods of bean bags resemble a library, an open office adopts the rules of a library, meaning silence at all costs.\n\nWhen your sister calls to fight over Thanksgiving plans, you hunt for an empty conference room. When you have to pitch an important client, you squat in a storage closet.\n\nNot to mention if you love your chair and don't want it swiped, you'd better mark it in some way!\n\nOpen office spaces were sold to us as a way to create an egalitarian feel. But the truth is, they save money: like the airlines, your company just wants to cram as many of you in as possible and call it pop-up synergy.\n\nThere IS some upside: if it's someone's birthday, it's cake for all! If it's someone's 11 a.m. hoagie, it's the smell of processed meat for all! If it's Take Your Child to Work Day, it's someone's four-year-old for all!\n\nLook, if you're a parent who's ever worked from home, you've experienced an open office. Because your children make themselves your boss.\n\nJust ask this guy how an open door office policy works out:\n\nWe go to an office to get away from it all, which is why open office plans put the funk in cross-functional collaboration. It's fun to drill down with your cohort, but it's not fun to hear them chew.\n\nAnd by the way, here at Sunday Morning, we don't have an open office plan – which is why we're able to get a show on the air every week.\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Young Kim.
A growing number of babies and toddlers are landing in the emergency room for injuries related to strollers, cribs and other nursery products, a new U.S. study finds.\n\nThose ER trips rose nearly 24 percent between 2003 and 2011, after more than a decade of decline, the researchers found.\n\nHowever, only 1 percent of those ER trips were blamed on actual product failures.\n\nThat does not mean the nursery products on the market are perfectly safe. They can still be more intelligently designed to help prevent accidents, said Tracy Mehan, of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where the study was conducted.\n\nMuch of the increase in injuries was related to concussions: The rate of concussion diagnoses more than doubled between 2005 and 2011, the researchers found.\n\nThat may be due, at least in part, to better recognition of concussions, according to Mehan, who was not an author on the study.\n\nIn recent years, the issue of childhood concussions has gotten increasing attention, partly because of kids' sports-related head injuries.\n\nSo, parents may be more likely to bring their child to the ER after a fall or other mishap, explained Mehan, who is manager of translational research at Nationwide's Center for Injury Research and Policy.\n\nIn 2014, more than 69,000 babies and young children landed in the emergency room for injuries related to nursery products, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).\n\nThose are only the injuries serious enough to be treated in the ER, Mehan pointed out. So, the actual number of injuries is probably much higher.\n\nThe study findings, published online March 13 in the journal Pediatrics, are based on figures from a federal injury surveillance system.\n\nThe Nationwide researchers specifically looked for ER visits among children younger than 3 who had injuries attributed to nursery products.\n\nOn average, there were just over 66,000 such incidents each year. But the trend shifted over time.\n\nBetween 1991 and 2003, ER trips declined by over one-third, the study found. That improvement was largely due to an 86 percent drop in injuries related to baby walkers, jumpers and exercisers.\n\nAccording to Mehan, that represents a big success story.\n\nWalkers, for instance, allowed babies to move around quickly, before they were developmentally ready. We started seeing these serious injuries from falls, Mehan said.\n\nThat led researchers to work with lawmakers and manufacturers to devise tougher safety standards and product revisions -- like making the walkers too wide to fit through doorways.\n\nBut since 2003, the Nationwide study found, ER trips related to nursery products have been on the upswing.\n\nThe Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association did not respond to requests from HealthDay for comment on the findings.\n\nNo one product seemed to drive the injury increase after 2003. But one type of injury -- concussion -- stood out.\n\nDr. Barbara Pena is research director for the emergency department at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami.\n\nThat rise in concussions is no surprise to Pena, who said her ER sees children with head injuries every day.\n\nI think that years ago, there wasn't as much concern when a child fell or hit his head, Pena said. But now, parents are more likely to bring their children in.\n\nIt's also common, she said, to see young children with injuries related to nursery products.\n\nIn this study, baby carriers were the product most commonly involved: They accounted for more than half of injuries among babies younger than 6 months.\n\nOften, babies were injured when the adult using the carrier tripped and fell.\n\nCribs and strollers were also commonly implicated. Cribs can present a risk of entrapment or suffocation, according to Mehan -- especially if parents use a mattress that is not designed for the crib, or if they put blankets, bumper pads or other soft objects in with their baby.\n\nWith strollers, youngsters can be hurt if the stroller tips over or rolls away, for example.\n\nParents and other adults can take steps to help prevent those mishaps, Pena said.\n\nMake sure you're using these products carefully, and use every safety feature 100 percent of the time, she said.\n\nWith strollers, Pena noted, parents often like to hang bags on the handles. That extra weight can tip the stroller over.\n\nSafety tips\n\nMehan pointed to four Rs that parents should keep in mind:\n\nResearch: Before you buy a nursery product, do some digging using a trusted resource, like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the CPSC.\n\nRecalls: Periodically check whether any of your nursery products have been recalled, using the federal website Recalls.gov. Parents can also sign up for email alerts, Mehan said.\n\nRegister: Products come with forms that allow consumers to register them with the manufacturer. If the product is recalled, the company can contact you.\n\nRead the manual: Take the time, Mehan said, to be sure you know how to use the product and all of its safety features.\n\nWhen it comes to cribs, Mehan also advised buying one made after 2011, because it will meet the latest safety standards.\n\nShe noted that many parents buy or borrow used nursery products. If you do that, make sure you inspect it carefully, and look for any broken pieces, missing parts or chipped paint.
Three hours in an overhead compartment proved too much for a 10-month-old puppy, who died on a United Airlines flight from Houston to New York Monday night.\n\nUnited Continental (UAL) apologized for the dog's death in an emailed statement on Tuesday, calling it a tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin.\n\nShortly after boarding United Flight 1284 to New York's LaGuardia, a passenger was told to place the French bulldog, called Papacito, and its carrier in the overhead, June Lara, a passenger sitting nearby reportedly said.\n\nThe flight attendants felt that the innocent animal was better off crammed inside the overhead container without air and water, Lara wrote on Facebook. They INSISTED that the puppy be locked up for three hours without any kind of airflow. They assured the safety of the family's pet so wearily, the mother agreed.\n\nThe scenario violates the carrier's policy, which states in part: Pet traveling in cabin must be carried in an approved hard-sided or soft-sided kennel. The kennel must fit completely under the seat in front of the customer and remain there at all times.\n\nUnited said it would assume full responsibility for the incident and that it was investigating what happened to prevent such an incident from happening again.\n\nThere was no sound as we landed and opened his kennel. There was no movement as his family called his name, Lara wrote. I held her baby as the mother attempted to resuscitate their 10 month old puppy. I cried with them three minutes later as she sobbed over his lifeless body. My heart broke with theirs as I realized he was gone.\n\nAnother passenger on the flight posted a photo on Twitter of the dog's owner and children after the plane had arrived in New York. I want to help this woman and her daughter, she wrote. They lost their dog because of an [U]nited flight attendant. My heart is broken.\n\nI want to help this woman and her daughter. They lost their dog because of an @united flight attendant. My heart is broken. pic.twitter.com/mjXYAhxsAq — MaggieGremminger (@MaggieGrem) March 13, 2018\n\nThe puppy's death is not the first such incident for the carrier. In 2017, United also apologized for the death of a dog that had been put in the cargo hold of a plane held for hours on a tarmac last summer. A similar incident ended in the deaths of seven puppies in 2010. The airline also was sued last summer over the death of a giant rabbit on a flight from London to Chicago.\n\nIn another public relations fiasco, United faced public backlash and congressional hearings last year for having a man dragged off a plane.
CHICAGO -- The NFL wants to put some flair back into touchdown celebrations, allowing players to use the football as a prop, celebrate as a group and roll around on the ground again if they choose.\n\nIn an email from Commissioner Roger Goodell sent to fans in an effort to deliver a more exciting game experience, the commissioner said the new guidelines came after conversations with more than 80 current and former players.\n\nThe league, however, will continue to penalize any celebration deemed offensive, including those that embarrass opponents or mimic the use of weapons.\n\nPlayers have told us they want more freedom to be able to express themselves, Goodell wrote.\n\nThat freedom had been stripped in many cases, with fans and media criticizing the NFL as being the No Fun League. A 15-yard penalty often was the price paid for excessiveness.\n\nGoodell later made a reference to the onetime Comedy Central show Key & Peele in a tweet about the new policy. On the sketch comedy show, actor Keegan-Michael Key played fictional player Hingle McCringleberry, who in one sketch was penalized for repeatedly celebrating touchdowns with three hip-thrusts.\n\nDon't get any ideas about pumps @KeeganMKey ‑ they're still not OK under the new policy, Goodell wrote.\n\nDon't get any ideas about pumps @KeeganMKey – they're still not OK under the new policy #FootballisFamily — Roger Goodell (@nflcommish) May 23, 2017\n\nGoodell's email also mentioned how the league is placing an emphasis on speeding up the pace of games. To go with that, he said the league knows that you love the spontaneous displays of emotion that come after a spectacular touchdown.
The Federal Reserve took emergency action Sunday and slashed its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to nearly zero to try to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. In another move to boost growth, the central bank also said it would purchase $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to encourage lending.\n\nThe Fed said in a statement that the effects of the outbreak will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the outlook. Policy makers said they will keep rates at nearly zero until they are confident the economy has weathered the storm, which a number of economists say could push the U.S. into recession.\n\nThese are strong measures, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a rare Sunday news conference, warning that growth in the second quarter would be slow. The virus will run its course and economic activity will resume. In the meantime, we will act to support the flow of credit to companies and individuals.\n\nThe Fed also said that it was working with central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan and others, in a coordinated effort to make it easier for financial institutions to trade currencies and get U.S. dollars.\n\nThe Fed's latest move to ease borrowing costs, which followed another emergency cut on March 3, is one of the most drastic steps the central bank has taken since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. It is an effort to loosen up the country's monetary supply and stimulate to try to counter the coronavirus's growing damage to the U.S. economy and global financial markets.\n\nPaul Ashworth, chief U.S economist with Capital Economics, said the Fed cuts resemble its actions to shore up the economy during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.\n\nSo now we have the entire crisis playbook enacted before Asian markets open — with the Fed doing everything in its power, not just to support economic activity, but to keep the financial system afloat and keep credit flowing to affected households and businesses, he said in a research note.\n\nThe Fed had been expected to take action at its scheduled meeting on Wednesday. But its preemptive move underlines policy makers' concern at how quickly the virus is shutting down key sectors of the American economy, including travel and sports.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Powell for his handling of monetary policy, said in a news conference on Sunday at the White House that the Fed's latest cut makes me very happy.\n\nI think that people in the markets should be very thrilled, Mr. Trump added.\n\nInvestors, by contrast, seem less than thrilled, even with the Fed taking extraordinary measures to support the economy. U.S. stock futures fell more than 4% Sunday evening after the rate cut announcement.\n\nThe Fed's latest move does not change our expectation that the economy will slow dramatically in the near term, Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics, told investors in a report.\n\nWith the virus' spread causing a broad shutdown of economic activity, the Fed faces a daunting task. Its tools — intended to ease borrowing rates, facilitate lending and boost business and consumer confidence — aren't ideally suited to offset a fear-driven halt in spending and traveling.\n\nWe have been urging this action for some time and we're very happy that the Fed did not wait until Wednesday's meeting, said economist Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. In one line: Great news, but not enough on its own.\n\nShepherdson said Congress and the White House may need to consider at least $1 trillion in emergency spending to help support small and mid-sized businesses, the self-employed and millions of households under varying levels of quarantine facing the prospects of months of little to no business or income. This could include financial help for the nation's travel and hospitality industries, which have seen unusual plunges in business in barely two weeks.\n\nThe Fed's actions may amount to a recognition that the U.S. economy faces its most perilous juncture since the recession ended more than a decade ago.\n\nI think the Fed has to bring the big guns, said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist for TD Securities.\n\nSeparately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier Sunday that both the central bank and the federal government have tools at their disposal to support the economy.
U.S. Air Force helicopter pilot Major Mary Jennings Hegar and her crew were shot down by the Taliban in July 2009 during a rescue mission outside Kandahar in Afghanistan. Despite her wounds, she fought back and saved the lives of her crew and patients. Major Hegar received the Purple Heart. She also became the second woman ever to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross for her valor and heroism.\n\nShe returned home and joined a lawsuit that barred women from joining ground combat positions. My gender has never been a factor in accomplishing my unit's missions, and it should not be a factor when selecting personnel to serve in combat roles, she said in 2012. That rule, the Combat Exclusion Policy, has since been reversed.\n\nHegar discusses her battle in and out of the military in her book Shoot Like a Girl (Berkley).\n\nMajor Mary Jennings Hegar. CBS News\n\nAppearing on CBS This Morning Monday, Hegar said she was inspired to be a pilot from a young age thanks to watching films like The Perfect Storm, which depicted off-shore helicopter rescues.\n\nI didn't want to crash into the ocean, but from watching Han Solo navigate an asteroid field to watching movies like 'Perfect Storm,' it would always kind of get my adrenaline up, and I knew it was something I wanted to do, she said.\n\nBut she faced resistance along the way, such as a teacher who told Hegar that her ambition was not fit for a girl.\n\nThat was the first experience of many where I realized the vast majority of people that I encountered along the way were very supportive and only cared about whether or not I was competent, but every now and then you got somebody who didn't give you a chance.\n\nHow do you push past that when you get that kind of resistance? asked co-anchor Anthony Mason.\n\nTo be honest with you, even from a young age it just motivated me. It really did. It motivated me. It was almost like a dare.\n\nCommissioned into the Air Force in 1999, Hegar was later selected for pilot training by the Air National Guard. She would serve three tours in Afghanistan, flying Medevac and Combat Search and Rescue missions.\n\nBerkley\n\nShe flew a Sikorsky MH-60 Pave Hawk, a rescue version of the Blackhawk helicopter, pulling wounded soldiers from the battlefield.\n\nHow many women are flying those helicopters? asked co-anchor Norah O'Donnell.\n\nMore than you might think, [but] fewer than there should be! Hegar said. I had probably two or three in my unit.\n\nWhen asked to describe her experience of being shot down in Afghanistan, Hegar said, At the time it wasn't really that scary. It was what we were trained to do. We were just doing our jobs.\n\nYou say 'trained to do.' You were wounded and bleeding, remarked co-anchor Gayle King.\n\nHegar replied, It happened so fast, you know?\n\nYou say battle readiness has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with capability.\n\nRight. I've seen men and women who were fit for combat that I wanted to fight beside, and men and women who I really wouldn't want to go back into combat with. It really doesn't have anything to do with gender. I feel I have a warrior's heart, and it doesn't have to do with anything —\n\nWhat is a 'warrior's heart'? asked Mason.\n\nJust a drive to protect people and to run toward the emergency when everybody else is running away, Hegar explained. You know, I think that that's not something you can choose to do. It's just something that you reflex-do, or you don't.\n\nWhen asked to describe the backlash she experienced for speaking out in support of women in combat positions, Hegar said, It was significant, but I think it's a very vocal minority. The vast majority of the messages that I receive are, 'Please keep doing what you're doing, you're inspiring my daughter or you're inspiring my son, you're fighting for us.' But there are some really determined people out there who see it very threatening that a woman can do these jobs.\n\nDoes she think the military needs to do more?\n\nAbsolutely. They're doing a lot, more than they're getting credit for. I think we have some amazing leaders. But then we have some leaders who turn a blind eye to things that contribute negatively to a really difficult culture for women, she said.\n\nKing noted one scene in her book, after the crash, involving a briefing: People are patting themselves on the back, you're the only one in the meeting, M.J., that says basically, 'Where the hell were you guys?' Because you thought you'd been left stranded by another group. You're the only one who said that.\n\nThat gets me into trouble a lot! Megar laughed. Yeah, I kind of looked around and I can't understand why nobody else is speaking up. Later when I faced the backlash of speaking up, I realized why nobody did. But at the time I kind of looked around, like, 'Why isn't anyone saying anything? I guess I will.' And that's been my whole life.\n\nHegar's book is being developed for the big screen by TriStar Pictures, with Angelina Jolie slated to star. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Jason Hall (American Sniper) is attached to the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more info:
MURFREESBORO, Tenn. -- A Tennessee police chief has offered an apology after his officers arrested 10 elementary school students.\n\nMurfreesboro Police Chief Karl Durr told The Tennessean he's so sorry this incident happened and that he thinks it could have been avoided. Durr said the arrests were connected to a bullying and assault incident. The newspaper reports there are no plans to dismiss the charges.\n\nThe comments to the newspaper came after angry parents demanded action during a community meeting at a church after the arrests occurred at Hobgood Elementary School and other locations on April 15. Some students were handcuffed, but it was unclear how many.\n\nDurr reiterated that an internal review of the incident is ongoing. He said the department would also review its handcuffing policy, which currently says officers should take into consideration whether to handcuff children under 12.
Another federal judge on Friday ruled that Chad Wolf was likely unlawfully appointed to his position at the helm of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), issuing a decision that blocked a set of broad asylum limits slated to take effect Monday.\n\nIn a scathing 14-page decision, Judge James Donato of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco agreed with other federal judges who have concluded that DHS failed to follow proper legal procedures when installing Wolf as the department's acting secretary. He said Trump administration lawyers recycled arguments to defend the legality of Wolf's appointment, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts.\n\nIn effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through, Donato wrote.\n\nBased on this conclusion, Donato said Wolf did not have the authority to greenlight a regulation that would erect new restrictions at every stage of the U.S. asylum process, including rules that generally disqualify victims of gang violence, gender-based persecution, domestic abuse and torture staged by rogue government officials from U.S. refuge.\n\nDonato issued a nation-wide preliminary injunction against the policy, which advocates dubbed the death to asylum rule.\n\nThis is the most far-reaching of the midnight asylum regulations unveiled in the Trump administration's final days, said Sabrineh Ardalan, the director of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical program, one of the groups challenging the policy. But try as it may, this administration cannot destroy our asylum system and rewrite our laws by executive fiat.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. asylum officers were instructed not to rely upon the new rules when interviewing migrants or adjudicating applications, according to an internal U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) email obtained by CBS News. Andrew Davidson, the chief of the asylum division, said officers must continue to follow current guidance and procedures.\n\nAlong with the Government Accountability Office, Congress' investigative arm, several other federal courts have also questioned the legality of Wolf's appointment and blocked actions he has approved, including the suspension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nWolf was tapped to lead DHS in November 2019, following the departure of former acting secretary Kevin McAleenan. Unlike McAleenan, Wolf was nominated by President Trump to be the Senate-confirmed secretary of the department, but his nomination was withdrawn this week by the White House.\n\nThe rules blocked on Friday represent the most ambitious effort by the Trump administration to restrict access to U.S. asylum through numerous procedural and substantive changes. The outgoing administration has argued that its restrictions — which include a policy of requiring migrants to wait in Mexico for the duration of their U.S. court cases — are necessary to prevent border-crossers from abusing the asylum system.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has pledged to undo many of Mr. Trump's asylum changes, including the Remain in Mexico program. While he has not addressed the rule blocked on Friday, Mr. Biden's advisers have said they intend to reverse Mr. Trump's asylum restrictions for victims of gang and domestic violence.\n\nDHS representatives did not immediately respond to a request to comment on Friday's order.
Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Monday made it clear that Congress will have to change the law if the government wants to move some remaining detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison to a facility on U.S. soil.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Pentagon, Carter said that safety is his top priority and there has to be alternate detention facility created for the detainees.\n\nNow, that can't be done unless Congress acts, which means that Congress has to support the idea that it would be good to move this facility or the detainees to the United States, said Carter, who reiterated that closing Guantanamo Bay would save the U.S. a lot of money.\n\nCarter went on to say that the closure plan, unveiled by the White House last week, could not be fully implemented until Congress takes action.\n\nSo it is good if it can be done, but it cannot be done under current law. The law has to be changed, he said. That is the reason to put a proposal to put in front of Congress.\n\nPart of the plan calls for the administration for work with Congress to find a location in the U.S. to house fewer than 60 detainees. Many of the other remaining detainees, under the plan, would be transferred to foreign countries.\n\nLast fall, President Obama signed a defense policy bill that barred the administration from transferring detainees to U.S. soil.\n\nAt a congressional hearing in November, Attorney General Loretta Lynch acknowledged that the law is clear.\n\nWith respect to individuals being transferred to the United States, the law currently does not allow that, she told the House Judiciary Committee. Certainly it is the position of the Department of Justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard on that issue.\n\nWhen Mr. Obama announced his plan last week, he explained that the U.S. has already had to house terrorists in the U.S. and the government has kept the country safe.\n\nPart of my message to the American people is we're already holding a bunch of really dangerous terrorists in the United States because we threw the book at them and there have been no incidents. We've managed it just fine, he said.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, meanwhile, blasted the president's plan and largely declared it dead on arrival on Capitol Hill.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has suggested Britain's drug regulator may be gambling with public safety by expanding the time gap between administration of the first and second doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine beyond that proven safe and effective by trial data. The FDA warned in a statement on Monday that there was a potential for harm if people believed they were protected against COVID-19 by a first dose of Pfizer's vaccine for longer than available data demonstrate.\n\nFacing a dramatic surge in both infections and hospitalizations — fueled, according to U.K. officials, by a more infectious strain of the coronavirus discovered in southeast England — British officials decided last week to change their inoculation strategy.\n\nThe focus is now on getting as many people as possible a first dose of either the Pfizer shot or the other approved for use in the U.K., developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Under government policy, the second doses of both vaccines can be put off for up to 12 weeks.\n\nOxford scientists have said their trial data supports allowing a window of up to 12 weeks between shots, and that their vaccine will provide protection to the full extent possible (up to 74% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection) for that full period.\n\nPfizer hasn't said that, however. Along with its German partner BioNTech, the American pharmaceutical maker has made it clear that their trial data only shows efficacy for 21 days after a first dose.\n\nThe U.K. regulator appears to be making an assumption based on the available data from the Pfizer-BioNTech Phase 3 human trials.\n\nThe decision was made to update the dosage interval recommendations for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following a thorough review of the data by the MHRA's COVID-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group, a spokesperson for the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency told CBS News on Tuesday.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Working Group concluded that vaccine efficacy will be maintained with dosing intervals longer than 21 days… based on clinical trial data that showed the vaccine was 90.5% effective against preventing COVID-19 after the first dose once the protection that starts at around 12 days kicks in, and there was no evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccine is declining towards the end of the 21-day period following the first dose.\n\nBut as the FDA and Pfizer have said, there's also no data to show that the effectiveness of the first dose lasts until the 12-week mark, or anything near it. The FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use with a maximum of 21 days between the first and second doses.\n\nSuggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence, the U.S. agency said in its statement. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19.\n\nIf people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks, the FDA warned.\n\nPeople line up for a COVID-19 vaccination at Guys Hospital in London, England, on January 5, 2021. Dan Kitwood/Getty\n\nWith the worst COVID-19 epidemic in Europe, and one that is worsening fast, Britain's strategy was clearly born of urgency. It's a bid to provide as many people with some immunity as fast as possible to try and stem the dramatic spread of the virus, and it the U.K. isn't alone in considering the measure.\n\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn confirmed this week that the government was considering extending the length of time between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, citing the example set by the U.K.\n\nSpahn stressed, however, that Germany's Health Ministry would await guidance from the Standing Committee on Vaccination at the national health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, before making a final decision.
WASHINGTON -- District of Columbia schools have canceled recess at 13 schools near the National Zoo because of an escaped bobcat, even though zoo officials say the animal poses no danger to humans.\n\nSchool system spokeswoman Michelle Lerner says the decision to not let students outside on Tuesday was made out of an abundance of caution. She declined to comment on how long the policy would stay in place.\n\nZoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson says she spoke to the school system's chief operating officer and emphasized that the animal is not dangerous. She says the zoo and the school system will keep in touch as the search for the missing bobcat continues.\n\nThe National Zoo tweeted on Tuesday that the bobcat was still missing, and that overnight calls indicated she may be in the area.\n\nBobcat that escaped 1/30 has not returned. Overnight calls report she may be nearby to Zoo. See her? 202-633-7362. https://t.co/22DWxjpZro — National Zoo (@NationalZoo) January 31, 2017\n\n\n\nBobcats are native to North America, including the greater Washington area. They prey mostly on small rodents and birds.\n\nThe female bobcat, believed to be about 7 years old, was found to be missing Monday morning when it didn't show up for breakfast. At the zoo, the bobcat is known as Ollie.
A child pornography case involving a California doctor has revealed that Best Buy's Geek Squad technicians allegedly worked with the FBI to uncover data on customer's computers for years, CBS Pittsburgh reports. A non-profit organization claims that the nature of the FBI's relationship with the technicians may have violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit last year after it learned that the FBI allegedly paid Geek Squad employees to pass along information about illegal materials on devices sent in by customers for repairs.\n\nOne search led to felony child porn charges against Dr. Mark Rettenmaier after a technician reportedly went through the oncologist's deleted files and called the FBI in 2011. In 2017, a judge ruled that the images found in Rettenmaier's computer could not be considered child porn and the invasive search was illegal. All of the charges were dropped and the case was dismissed after a judge said an FBI agent made false and misleading statements to obtain a search warrant for the doctor's house.\n\nEFF says their FOIA request revealed that Best Buy has been working with the FBI for at least 10 years. An FBI memo acquired in the lawsuit shows that Best Buy hosted a meeting and tour of their Kentucky repair facility for the FBI's Cyber Working Group in 2008. The memo and related email also claim that agents maintained close liaison with the Geek Squad's management in an effort to glean case initiations and to support the division's Computer Intrusion and Cyber Crime programs.\n\nOther court records uncovered in the FOIA search found that Geek Squad technicians were paid between $500 and $1,000 to actively search a client's computer.\n\nThe reports have raised concerns that the FBI is using the Geek Squad to bypass the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nBest Buy spokesperson Jeff Shelman denied the claims in 2017. Shelman said their technicians don't do anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer's problem, according to The Washington Post. Shelman added that if illegal material is found during those repairs, Geek Squad employees are obligated to contact law enforcement.\n\nIn a statement provided to our partner site ZDNet, Best Buy confirmed that three of four managers who received payments from the FBI are no longer at the company. The statement reads in full:
As CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin reported on Thursday, President Trump appears to be standing firm on his decision to pull American forces out of Syria. The president himself has not yet commented on the topic since four Americans were killed in a targeted attack by ISIS in northern Syria on Wednesday. But Vice President Mike Pence did reiterate Mr. Trump's assertions, not long after the U.S. confirmed the casualties, that ISIS had been defeated in Syria and it is time to bring American troops home.\n\nVisiting the front lines of the ongoing war this week with U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters, however, CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata saw a different reality. What follows is his report from the front-line town of Ash Sha'fah, in eastern Syria.\n\nAsh Sha'fah, Syria -- President Trump and Vice President Pence may continue to insist that ISIS is defeated in Syria, but the frontlines here tell a very different story, with U.S. forces and their allies on the ground battling a persistent enemy that refuses to surrender.\n\nEven as we made our way toward the fighting, we were warned that ISIS terror cells lurked among the ruined villages, launching counterattacks and planting bombs on the only road in and out.\n\nWe travelled to the front lines in eastern Syria, the very last pockets of ISIS resistance. Once these areas are taken back, ISIS will not be considered a territorial force here.\n\nWe arrived in Ash Sha'fah to see Kurdish-led forces firing a barrage of mortars toward ISIS positions not much more than a mile away.\n\nNearby, vital reinforcements: U.S. troops and military hardware. An American position is just a few hundred yards away from the Kurdish forces we're embedded with. The U.S. forces have been firing mortars in the direction of the ISIS holdouts since we got here.\n\nThey're playing a very big role, Kurdish commander Simko Shkak told us. Their forces have been very effective. We give them coordinates for ISIS locations and their Air Force and artillery do all they can.\n\nIn addition to roughly 2,000 U.S. ground forces here, the American-led air campaign has been pummelling this territory, carrying out airstrikes on 1,100 targets in the first two weeks of January alone. The missiles have focused on the sliver of land still under ISIS control.\n\nCommanders here tell us the final push could take a month or more. But as the tragic deaths of four Americans among more than a dozen killed in the Manbij attack on Wednesday shows, ISIS is already morphing into an insurgency that has begun striking targets far beyond these battlefields.
Americans are considering their travel plans as the coronavirus spreads across the globe, with the World Health Organization on Friday upgrading the global risk from the disease to very high. Travelers are weighing what happens if they decide to cancel flights because of fear of infection, including whether they'll get refunds.\n\nThe answer: Refunds are unlikely unless they bought cancel for any reason insurance, which isn't as widely used by travelers because it costs about 40% more than standard travel insurance. But more common insurance policies won't cover the cost of a ticket if you opt against traveling because of the outbreak.\n\nA key phrase for travelers to understand: unexpected event — that's what insurance companies are offering to cover when you buy a standard travel policy. But now that the virus has spread across the globe, insurers are excluding the disease as a trigger for coverage because it's no longer an unexpected event, according to Squaremouth, a travel insurance comparison site.\n\nOnce an event becomes common knowledge, it also becomes excluded by travel insurance policies – this is because insurance providers consider it to have a foreseeable impact on travel, Squaremouth said on its blog.\n\nInsurance companies designated the coronavirus as a foreseen event between January 21 and 24, which means policies sold after those dates aren't going to cover issues related to the outbreak, said Karen Johnson, a travel insurance program leader with USI Insurance Services.\n\nSome travelers may not need to rely on insurance given that a few airlines are waiving fees for canceling or changing flights due to coronavirus concerns. JetBlue became the first U.S. carrier to introduce the policy when it said this week that it would suspend these fees for trips booked between February 27 through March 11 for travel completed by June 1. Some airlines in Asia, where the disease is most widespread, are also waiving fees.\n\nCancel for any reason\n\nStill, travelers concerned about needing to cancel a trip because of the outbreak may want to pay more for cancel for any reason policies. In exchange for a higher insurance rate, travelers can expect to recoup about 75% of their travel costs if they need to cancel.\n\nI'd expect we'll see more people buying it because they want to say, 'No, I don't want to go because I don't think it's safe for my family', said Lisa Lindsay, executive director of the Private Risk Management Association.\n\nThe good news about cancel for any reason policies is that they can be purchased after you make a deposit on a trip, although you typically have a window of about 14 to 21 days to buy it, USI's Johnson said. (The window for purchasing a policy depends on the insurance company.)\n\nIn other words, if you bought tickets for an Italian vacation two weeks ago — before the coronavirus spread across the country's northern region — you could still purchase one of these policies to protect your ticket purchase.\n\nThere are some caveats, Johnson added. For instance, you must insure the entire cost of your trip, and if you cancel, you need to do so before 48 hours of your scheduled departure date. Other than that, you are good to go — or not go.\n\nLiterally you can cancel for any reason. If you can see it's going to rain the entire week, well, you can cancel, Johnson noted. For an event like this, where we don't know how long it's going to be around or if it's just going to explode, this is a perfect example why someone would buy cancel for any reason insurance.\n\nMedical planning\n\nFlight insurance isn't the only consideration for travelers, Lindsay said. People going overseas also should consider medical coverage, including whether you would want to be treated by local health care facilities if you fall ill.\n\nSome insurers are still offering medical coverage for travelers, which would cover emergency medical treatment and evacuation to those who contract the virus during their travels, Squaremouth said. But it's important to read medical policies' fine print to understand what's covered and what isn't.\n\nA preparedness plan\n\nMore generally, travelers should also create a preparedness plan. We ask people to think about the trip and think what might happen, and if it does happen, what do we need to know? Lindsay said.\n\nFor instance, it's important to have a communication plan with your family when you travel. Pick a family member or friend who isn't traveling with you, and let them know that you'll check in with them at a specific time each day. A text that says the trip is great and we're all fine can help allay fears — and also alert loved ones if something goes awry, she said.\n\nLikewise, check cell phone coverage and internet access before traveling, including the costs of international coverage and whether you'll encounter any problems. Have a plan in place in case you get sick, such as designating someone in your group to call your insurance carrier.\n\nAlways, always check and see if your insurance coverage is going to cover you while you are abroad, Lindsay said. If it's not going to cover you while you are [out of the country], you should buy a temporary policy that will provide you with coverage.
Most Americans — 59 percent — oppose the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, 8 in 10 Republicans favor a wall. Two-thirds of independents and 84 percent of Democrats oppose a wall.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans also have different priorities when considering immigration policy.\n\nMost Democrats (67 percent) say it's more important to focus on dealing with illegal immigrants already in the U.S. For Republicans, securing the border is the top immigration priority (75 percent).\n\nWhen Americans are asked which issue is most important for the president and Congress to address, health care outranks immigration. Republicans, however, see immigration as the higher priority.
Senate Democrats are expected to bring their long-awaited health care reform bill to the floor next week. And just as in the House, which passed its bill last week, senators are divided over the issue of abortion, reports CBS News Correspondent Nancy Cordes.\n\nThe fight over abortion rights has become a thorn in the side of both parties now. It all started when anti-abortion Democrats, led by Michigan's Bart Stupak, began demanding that health care reform include strict new language banning abortion coverage.\n\nWhat I'm saying and a number of my Democratic colleagues are saying is no public funding for abortion, period, Stupak said.\n\nGovernment rules have prohibited abortion coverage in federally funded plans since 1976. Federal workers, Medicaid recipients and women in the military do not have abortion coverage except in extreme cases like rape.\n\nBut the health care reform bill creates an unprecedented scenario. Millions of low-income Americans get some federal assistance to help them buy insurance. Stupak's amendment bars any woman who gets even a dollar of federal funding from buying a plan that contains abortion coverage.\n\nI remember the days of back alley abortions and this amendment takes us one step back to those days, said Rep. Barbara Lee of California.\n\nThe amendment passed with the support of 64 Democrats and all but one Republican.\n\nNow the traditionally pro-abortion rights Democratic Party is at a crossroads.\n\nThis is an internal fight, a civil war within the Democratic Party, said Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report.\n\nThat internal fight spilled over into the GOP on Thursday, when Politico revealed that even the Republican National Committee provides coverage for elective abortions in its health care plan.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Steele swiftly axed the policy, saying, money from our loyal donors should not be used for this purpose.\n\nNow a group of female senators is scrambling to find a compromise on abortion funding. But even if they succeed, there are a number of other major issues, like the public option, and how to finance reform, that have Democrats at odds as well.
The government shutdown -- the longest in U.S. history -- is estimated in 31 days to have cost the American economy almost as much as the $5.7 billion President Trump has demanded for his proposed southern border wall.\n\nAverage weekly direct and indirect costs of the partial shutdown, which began Dec. 22, currently add up to $1.2 billion, according to Beth Ann Bovino, S&P Global's U.S. chief economist. Monday marked the start of the shutdown's fifth week, and the closure will have caused roughly $6 billion in damage to the economy if the government does not reopen by the end of the week, Bovino estimated in a recent research note.\n\nAnd the average weekly cost of the shutdown is expected to grow as the damage to industries and consumers both widens and deepens. The longer this shutdown drags on, the more collateral damage the economy will suffer, Bovino wrote.\n\nDirect effects of the marathon shutdown include lost productivity from the hundreds of thousands of furloughed workers who haven't been paid since the Dec. 22 closure. While the precise impact has not been calculated, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that federal employees' lost hours during a 16-day shutdown back in October 2013 reduced fourth-quarter GDP by 0.3 percentage points.\n\nAs in previous shutdowns, the productivity lost from furloughed government workers will never be regained. In real terms, GDP will be lower since no 'product' was created, the S&P Global note said.\n\nFederal workers will be compensated when the government reopens, but workers in the roughly 4 million private-sector jobs that depend on the federal government won't receive back pay, according to Capital Economics.\n\nThe longer the shutdown extends, the more grave its impact could be if it starts to affect unpaid workers' consumption, for example.\n\nThe partial closure of the Securities and Exchange Commission will delay companies' plans to file initial public offerings, at least until it reopens, and the Treasury's shutdown threatens to delay income tax refunds, which could have a dampening effect on sectors that tend to benefit from tax-refund spending, including auto retailers, according to Raymond James.\n\nPrivate businesses that depend on visitors to national sites are also feeling the pinch as Americans cancel their vacations to national parks, museums and monuments that are closed.\n\nAn extended shutdown could reach even further into American households by causing these businesses to reduce their staffs -- taking wages away from private citizens.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business association, last week urged Mr. Trump and Congress to end the shutdown. Consequences from the shutdown are wide and growing, Neil L. Bradley, the group's chief policy officer, wrote in a letter Tuesday. He listed a wide range of affected programs, data and functions.\n\nSmall businesses are unable to receive assistance from the Small Business Administration. Companies are delayed in their ability raise additional capital or complete the process of going public. The review of mergers and acquisitions is suspended. Companies ranging from manufacturers to brewers are unable to receive the approvals required by law to sell their products, he wrote. Travelers are delayed.\n\nProcessing of imports is hindered, and tariff exclusion requests are unprocessed. Safety inspectors are sidelined, mortgage approvals are delayed, and research is halted. National Parks are closed and trash at the parks is not being collected. Grants, contracts, and payments for goods and services already provided are delayed, the letter continued. Federal rulemakings are halted, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors go without pay.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg, the thousands of businesses with contracts tied to the federal government could lose a cumulative $200 million a day.
Over the past 40 years, damage from major weather and climate disasters has cost the United States nearly $2 trillion dollars. A closer look at the data reveals that recently the cost of such incidents has been escalating quickly, due in part to human-caused climate change.\n\nAccording to NOAA's assessment of the biggest U.S. weather disasters — those with an inflation-adjusted cost of a billion dollars or more — the economic toll rose from an average of $17.8 billion a year in the 1980s to over $81 billion a year in the 2010s.\n\nNow a new study from Stanford University puts a number value on the portion of the increasing costs caused specifically by the rise in floods linked to climate change. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines flooding related to rain and snow events and finds that of the $199 billion in U.S. flood damage from 1988 to 2017, more than one-third is directly related to trends in intensifying precipitation.\n\nTwo recent disasters that come to mind in which flooding made up the vast majority of economic damage include 2017's Hurricane Harvey, which cost the U.S. a staggering $125 billion, and the historic 2019 Midwest floods which devastated the heartland and cost around $3 billion.\n\nFlooded homes are shown near Lake Houston following Hurricane Harvey, August 30, 2017, in Houston, Texas. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nBut how much of the financial toll of disasters like these is due to climate change making things worse, and how much is due to socioeconomic factors like increased population and value of assets? This study helps to clarify this debate among many experts who work in disaster-related fields. That's important because, with the impacts of climate change continuing to mount, there's an urgency among scientists and economists to quantify how much climate change is costing us and how much it may cost us in the future.\n\nDr. Noah Diffenbaugh, co-author of the research and professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University, says obtaining this quantification was the motivation for this study. There has been a lot of research about the impacts of climate change on different natural and human systems, but relatively little of that has focused on generating hard numbers quantifying the financial costs of those impacts, Diffenbaugh said. This study provides those numbers for flooding, which is one of the most costly natural disasters.\n\nThe mechanism behind why climate change is causing more extreme floods is very straightforward: a warmer ocean and atmosphere provides more energy to fuel more extreme weather systems.\n\nTo start with, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and dump more precipitation. A simple equation called the Clausius-Clapeyron rate calculates that for every 2 degree Fahrenheit increase in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold 8% more moisture, and thus produce more rain or snow.\n\nHowever, the extra energy in the Earth system goes a step further. A warmer atmosphere and ocean can also power more intense weather systems, which increase rainfall rates and also the overall precipitation which falls in a storm. So, even if a region's average rainfall is decreasing, individual storms still tend to produce more precipitation.\n\nIn recent decades, heavy rain and snow events are increasing due to a warmer atmosphere. This is especially true in the Midwest, Great Lakes and Northeast. Climate Central\n\nThe most extreme events have been intensifying more rapidly as a result of climate change, and this is a pattern that is true across the country, even in regions where average precipitation has not changed or has decreased slightly, explains the study's lead author, Frances Davenport, a PhD student at Stanford Earth.\n\nWhen asked how much of the increased extreme rain was due to climate change versus natural pattern changes, Davenport said, While natural climate variability has also had some effect on precipitation over the historical time period, the observed changes in extreme precipitation are very consistent with what we expect to occur as a result of human-caused climate change.\n\nDavenport says that the flood damage cost from rainfall in Hurricane Harvey, which dumped up to 60 inches of rain on Texas's Gulf Coast, made up about 20%of the $199 billion evaluated in her study. A series of studies after Harvey found that climate change resulted in the storm dumping up to 38% more rainfall than it otherwise would have.\n\nThese more extreme precipitation events more easily overwhelm infrastructure like flood barriers and drainage, which were built for the tamer climate of the 1900s, not the souped-up climate of the 2000s. The image below shows this is also true for rivers and streams, many of which have seen an increase in streamflow since the 1980s.\n\nWhile some rivers have seen a decrease in streamflow, the majority of U.S. rivers are seeing increases, which are leading to more flooding events. Climate Central\n\nIn order to calculate which portion of the flood damage between 1988 and 2017 was due to increases in extreme events on a warmer planet, the team started with higher resolution climate and socioeconomic data and then applied advanced methods from economics and statistics. Using these tools they constructed an economic model to analyze the relationship between observed precipitation and flood damage month by month and state by state.\n\nThey also used the model for a counterfactual analysis in which they calculated what the damages would be if there were no changes in extreme precipitation.\n\nTogether, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the U.S. Overall, the study found 36% of the cost of flooding over that time period can be attributed directly to increasing extreme precipitation events, or almost $75 billion of the estimated $199 billion total.\n\nAnd with much more climate heating anticipated in the future, the team says the proportion of costs due to extreme events will only get worse.\n\nOur analyses show that exceeding the 2 degrees Celsius level of global warming identified in the U.N. Paris Agreement is likely to result in further intensification of extreme precipitation, says Diffenbaugh. So, if the future is anything like the past, we can expect continued increases in flood damages from future changes in precipitation.\n\nBeyond the impact from flood events, Diffenbaugh says the study goes further by establishing a methodology for economists to apply on various forms of extreme weather going forward. The study provides a framework for calculating how much climate change is likely to cost in the future, as well as the economic value of reducing emissions in order to limit the level of global warming, he said.\n\nMuch of the concern about taking action to limit global warming has been framed around how much it will cost to transition from fossil fuels, Diffenbaugh added. Indeed, It will cost too much is a familiar refrain among those who oppose action to combat climate change, to which the climate-concerned always counter: We can't afford not to. That's because as the planet gets warmer, the impacts of climate change increase exponentially.\n\nThe team's findings provide a method to separate the costs of the different variables — vital pieces of the puzzle for policy makers who must weigh the costs of action versus inaction. Armed with this understanding, they can use cost-benefit calculations to determine how, and how much, to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation.\n\nThe need for these calculations is becoming more and more important, because as the climate warms, Diffenbaugh says, the costs of inaction continue to increase.\n\nThis study shows that changes in precipitation are already costing billions of dollars, and that we can expect more global warming to further intensify the precipitation events that are driving those climate-related costs.
Were you recently rear-ended at a red light by a driver who was texting? If so, you probably got a double dose of bad luck, according to a just-published study by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA).\n\nIt showed that drivers in major cities nationwide end up paying more -- as much as $400 in Queens, New York -- when they apply for insurance after they've suffered a fender-bender, even if it's the other motorist's fault. And that's in addition to the already substantial premium insurers charge for living in an urban area and having a moderate income, the study claimed.\n\nIt's another 10 percent for people who already got a sizable whack, said the CFA's insurance expert Doug Heller.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that insurance industry representatives immediately attacked the study as skewed.\n\nThey threw a lot of things at the wall, said Bob Passmore, assistant vice president with the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI), which represents 1,000 car insurers that write more than 40 percent of the nation's automotive policy premiums.\n\nAssigning fault in an accident is rarely a zero-sum process where one driver is 100 percent at-fault, whereas the other driver is zero percent at-fault, said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the industry.\n\nBut the news wasn't entirely negative for motorists or the insurance industry. According to the CFA, while Progressive Insurance (PGR) used the no-fault penalty most aggressively, charging almost a 17 percent average penalty for not-at-fault accidents, the largest U.S. auto insurer, State Farm, doesn't assess any markup for motorists who weren't responsible when their cars were hit.\n\nThe study, which ranked only five of the top car insurers, included Berkshire Hathaway-owned GEICO (BRK.A) with a 14 percent increase, Farmers at 11 percent and Allstate (ALL) at around 5 percent.\n\nAnd there was some good news: California and Oklahoma don't allow car insurers to increase premiums for motorists who weren't responsible for an accident, said the CFA.\n\nBut other states and urban areas weren't so lucky. While Queens was the highest, Baltimore ranked second on the hit parade at $258, and Minneapolis came in third at $213. At the bottom of the CFA's list of cities where insurers charged more was Atlanta, where they boosted premiums by only $60.\n\nWhile lower-income drivers fared worse, with a 9.6 percent hike after a not-at-fault collision, upper-income motorists still experienced a 6.6 percent markup on their premiums.\n\nCFA Director of Insurance Robert Hunter said any increase in premium wasn't fair if the accident isn't your fault. As a former insurance commissioner of Texas and the industry's severest critic, Hunter said charging people for accidents that weren't their fault is not only unfair, but discourages them from filing legitimate claims and using the policy they've already paid for.\n\nThe CFA survey trolled the websites of the major insurers and used two fictional women motorists to get quotes. They had similar ages, cars and driving records, but differed in likely income.\n\nInsurers don't ask for income, but factors such as job and home ownership provide the clues, so one applicant was a bank executive with a master's degree, while the other was a bank teller with a high school education. Not surprisingly, the bank executive made out better, both with and without the fender bender.\n\nThe PCI's Passmore said the survey was imprecise because of the lack of specifics, such as the imaginary bank teller not having had car insurance for the past six months -- a red flag, particularly when referring to an accident. The vague question of not your fault on the application didn't address how severe the accident had been or what were the costs.\n\nWorters also said the survey was flawed because it didn't go far enough.\n\nUnderwriting a new auto insurance policy requires the collection of much more information than is gathered through an auto insurer's website, she said.\n\nBut Passmore and Worters didn't challenge the fact that car insurers often charge more, even if an accident may not be your fault.\n\nSo what, if anything, can you do about it? Shop around, said the CFA's Hunter. Ask the insurance agent or his company whether they charge you more if someone careens into you. And if you are abused, complain to your state insurance department. Two states already ban this and a little push from consumers might encourage other states to do the same.
The number of U.S. kids accidentally or intentionally overdosing on ADHD medications may be on the rise, a new study suggests.\n\nResearchers found that between 2000 and 2011, there was a 71 percent increase in calls to U.S. poison control centers related to kids' ingestion of drugs prescribed for ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).\n\nAfter 2011, there was a small -- but not statistically significant -- dip.\n\nMost cases were accidents, the study authors said. Young children got their hands on pills such as Ritalin or Adderall, for example, or kids were mistakenly given a double-dose of their prescription.\n\nBut 18 percent of calls were made after a teenager intentionally abused an ADHD medication, or took it in a suspected suicide attempt, according to the new report.\n\nCalls to poison control centers are often made by worried parents whose kids aren't actually sick, but might have been exposed to a drug.\n\nSo an exposure to a medication does not necessarily mean there's been a poisoning, said senior researcher Dr. Gary Smith.\n\nStill, it's concerning to see such calls going up, said Smith, who directs the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital, in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAnd in some cases, the kids did suffer an overdose, the findings showed.\n\nJust over 6 percent of calls ended with a hospital admission, the investigators found. And three teenagers died -- two from abusing ADHD medications, and one in a suspected suicide.\n\nThe scenario of the medication exposure varies greatly depending on the age group, Smith said.\n\nThat means various solutions are in order -- from safer medication storage, to education on the risks of abusing ADHD medication, he added.\n\nADHD affects how kids function in school and in everyday life. Stimulants such as amphetamine and methylphenidate are frequently prescribed to help control behavior and improve focus.\n\nThe study findings are based on calls to U.S. poison control centers between 2000 and 2014. Over the years, Smith's team found an average of 29 calls a day related to kids' exposure to ADHD medications.\n\nThose numbers steadily rose until 2011, when about 12,300 calls were made -- up from just over 7,000 in 2000. Then from 2011 to 2014, calls declined slightly -- to fewer than 11,500.\n\nIt's not clear whether the recent dip represents any turnaround in the problem, Smith said.\n\nOverall, kids reportedly suffered symptoms in 28 percent of cases -- including agitation and irritability, elevated heart rate, and drowsiness or lethargy. About one-quarter of all kids were taken to a medical center and released soon after, while just over 6 percent were admitted to a hospital.\n\nWhen children younger than 6 were involved, it was usually because they'd stumbled upon pills that were left out or improperly stored, Smith said.\n\nWith children that age, it's all about safe storage, he stressed. Keep all medication in child-proof containers up, away and out of sight.\n\nAnita Siu is a clinical associate professor at Rutgers University School of Pharmacy who specializes in pediatric pharmacy.\n\nShe made the same point about younger children -- and said that also applies to any over-the-counter medicine or supplement that could mistakenly get into little hands.\n\nWith kids aged 6 to 12, the study found, they typically had a prescription for ADHD medication and were accidentally given an extra dose.\n\nParents can prevent those mishaps, Smith said, by having a system that helps them remember whether their child has taken that day's dose -- using a smartphone app, for instance.\n\nPill boxes can be helpful reminders, Siu said. But, she stressed, they can also make it easier for young kids to get their hands on pills.\n\nWith kids in the 6- to 10-year age range, Siu said, an adult should always supervise medication use. But parents can start to educate them on label reading and the importance of taking medications only as directed.\n\nWith teenagers, it's a different situation. In this study, half of the teens had intentionally abused an ADHD drug or used one in a suspected suicide attempt.\n\nThat figure is striking, Smith said.\n\nSiu said, with preteens and teenagers, education is key. They should know that taking someone else's prescription -- or sharing their own with a friend -- is dangerous.\n\nAnd if parents have any concern their child might be abusing a medication, they should talk to their health care provider, Siu and Smith said.\n\nThe findings were published online May 21 in Pediatrics.
White House unveils gun policy proposal Nearly four weeks after the Florida school massacre, the White House is officially announcing which gun policy changes it will support. The list does not include raising the age limit for gun buyers to 21. Major Garrett reports.
SEOUL -- North Korea may be preparing to conduct a long-range ballistic missile test on the heels of its recent underground nuclear test, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies are still formulating their response -- and trying to work out differences with China, North Korea's closest ally -- to the nuclear test carried out earlier this month.\n\nThat test, which American officials do not believe was of a device nearly as powerful as the hydrogen bomb touted by North Korea, was a violation of United Nations sanctions against the isolated, totalitarian state. Ballistic missile tests are also forbidden by the sanctions against North Korea.\n\nWe predict that North Korea's next significant military provocation will be carried out in a surprising manner, Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said Thursday at a news conference in Seoul, amid unconfirmed reports the launch could be just days away. The South Korean military is continuing to keep a close watch on any signs of North Korea's long-range missile test.\n\nThe new information, based on satellite imagery from one of North Korea's established rocket launching sites, came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged China to keep a lid on North Korea's military ambitions during a meeting with senior Chinese leaders in Beijing.\n\nKerry described North Korea's growing nuclear capability and related missile technology as a threat the United States must take extremely seriously during a joint news conference with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nNorth Korea last tested a long-range missile in December 2012, when it successfully launched a Unha-3 (Galaxy 3) rocket into space carrying a satellite.\n\nPyongyang insisted the launch was merely to put a weather forecasting satellite into space, but experts in the U.S. and South Korea accused the North of conducting a thinly veiled test of its intercontinental ballistic missile capability.\n\nAnalyzing the rocket debris from the launch in 2012, South Korean officials described the North as having possibly secured a missile range of up to 6,200 miles, which would put the western coast of the U.S. mainland within reach. Most experts, however, agree that North Korea has yet to master the technology to fit a nuclear warhead onto such a missile.\n\nSouth Korean officials say the North completed a major upgrade last year to its main missile launch site in the country's northwest. The upgrade is believed to have extended the launch pad's height to about 67 yards, which would allow the North to launch a more powerful rocket than the Unha-3.\n\nSatellite imagery has shown several screens erected around key parts of the site in recent days -- an apparent attempt to elude satellite surveillance, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Local news reports also speculated Thursday that an underground railroad may be delivering necessary parts to the site.\n\nNorth Korea's testing of a long-range missile would likely push South Korea closer to deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile shield championed by the U.S.\n\nThe THAAD system, which is designed to shoot down short, medium, and long-range ballistic missiles, has been described as an insurance policy against North Korea's missile attacks, but has been vehemently opposed by China.\n\nWith the reports of a possible imminent missile test, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened a National Security Meeting in Tokyo on Thursday. Several South Korean media outlets reported that Japan was considering shooting down any North Korean missiles that cross into Japanese airspace.\n\nMany experts in South Korea see the isolated regime's continued military provocations as a carefully calculated move, with tangible objectives.\n\nNorth Korea appears to be intent on driving a wedge between the U.S. and China, Kim Han-kwon, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told South Korea's YTN news network. Kim said a new long-range missile test would cajole the international community to push for stronger sanctions against the North, which would force China -- fearing the North's political collapse and the mass exodus that would cause more than its military ambitions -- to fend for its treaty ally.\n\nFrom North Korea's perspective, a schism between China and the U.S. is the ideal situation, Kim said. Because of the strategic interests at stake, China will be forced to further embrace North Korea.
A proposed law that would require people on food stamps to get a job or receive work training is unlikely to deliver the cost savings that its proponents hope, a government analysis shows.\n\nMost of the savings from the plan -- which would bump 1.2 million people from the food-stamp rolls -- would be consumed by new administrative costs for the program, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office. The analysis, released late Wednesday, examines several proposals in the farm bill, which was introduced in the House last month.\n\nThe work requirement would lower spending on food stamps by about $9.2 billion over the next 10 years, but the costs from the provision would add $7.7 billion in new costs over the same period. That leaves a net savings of $1.5 billion over a decade, the report found.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Michael Conaway, R.-Texas, would require food-stamp recipients between the ages of 18 to 59 who aren't disabled or caring for children younger than 6 to either work or participate in a government-sponsored training program for at least 20 hours a week. By 2026, that would jump to 25 hours a week.\n\nSome would receive exemptions, such as pregnant women and people who taking care of an incapacitated person. Within a month of receiving food stamps, recipients would have to prove they are working or in job training.\n\nThe measure, known formally as the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, has made its way through committee and now awaits a floor vote in the House.\n\nFood stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), provides grocery money to 41 million Americans. Following the recession, the program swelled to almost 48 million recipients, but enrollment has declined since 2013 as the economy strengthened. Its annual costs run to about $70 billion, or roughly 2 percent of the federal budget.\n\nSpringboard to success?\n\nProponents of the work requirement argue that the goal isn't to save money, but rather to encourage poor Americans to find a job or sign up for job training. Conway, who is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, described the requirement as a springboard out of poverty to a good-paying job.\n\nMost of the cost of the proposed SNAP changes would stem from funding job-training programs for food stamp recipients, the CBO said.\n\nThey key question is whether this change will improve working families' employment and earnings, or just leave working age adults and in many cases their children with less food assistance, said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank, in an email.\n\nShe added, There is no research evidence that people will be better off under these types of changes.\n\nThe plan to impose work requirements to get food stamps may result in additional costs that the CBO isn't calculating, Dean added. For instance, people who lose SNAP benefits may turn to food pantries or local charities, burdening local communities. The report also focuses only on federal spending, and states may incur new costs because of the job training mandate.\n\nMeanwhile, families may feel another type of cost: hunger and health issues, Dean said.\n\nGiven the research evidence that participating in SNAP is linked with lower health costs and higher educational achievement, a SNAP cut would likely have ripple effects that are difficult to measure in the aggregate, but very real for people struggling to put food on the table, she said.\n\nSome analysts argue that the requirement isn't necessary since most food-stamp recipients who can work are already working. Many are employed in low-wage jobs without guaranteed hours or apply for the food benefit when they are between jobs. About two-thirds of food-stamp recipients aren't expected to work because they are disabled, children or senior citizens, according to the CBPP.\n\nAbout 17 percent of current food-stamp recipients are between 18 to 59, aren't disabled and aren't caring for young children, the CBO said. The proposed work requirements would cut off about 7 percent of that group from food stamps. But most would likely continue to receive food assistance because they're working enough hours or would receive a waiver, such as if they lived in a high-unemployment area, the analysis said.\n\nDean said, The primary effect of the changes will be to increase hunger and hardship for people who are unable to comply with the new requirements or get caught in the bureaucracy of proving they are already working or are in between jobs.
President Trump posted an edited video on social media showing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi repeatedly ripping up a paper copy of his State of the Union address as he honored a military hero and other guests. Pelosi's office asked Twitter and Facebook over the weekend to take it down, but the companies refused to do so.\n\nThe video, entitled Powerful American Stories Ripped to Shreds by Nancy Pelosi, was made by Freedom Fights — part of the conservative activist group Turning Point USA — and shared by Mr. Trump on his Twitter account last week. The 5-minute clip juxtaposes shots of Mr. Trump praising a Tuskegee Airman, military families, mothers and children, with shots of Pelosi tearing apart the speech between each. The video has more than 11 million videos as of Monday afternoon.\n\nIn fact, at the address Tuesday night, Pelosi ripped up her copy only after Mr. Trump finished delivering it — not in response to any of those specific honorees. Afterwards, she said she did so because the president's speech was a manifesto of mistruth, accusing him of repeating falsehoods about health care legislation, infrastructure and other policies.\n\nAfter the edited video was posted, some Democratic lawmakers and Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, called out social media giants for allowing it to circulate. Hammill said the video was deliberately designed to mislead and lie to the American people.\n\nThe American people know that the President has no qualms about lying to them — but it is a shame to see Twitter and Facebook, sources of news for millions, do the same, Hammill tweeted Friday, adding that every day that these platforms refuse to take it down is another reminder that they care more about their shareholders' interests than the public's interests.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson, Andy Stone, fired back at Hammill. Sorry, are you suggesting the President didn't make those remarks and the Speaker didn't rip the speech? Stone tweeted. Hammill responded, What planet are you living on? this is deceptively altered. take it down.\n\nA day later, Stone said the company declined to take it down because the things featured in this video actually happened, and pointed to Facebook's policy on manipulated media.\n\nThe reason I was making the point about the fact that the things featured in this video actually happened is because that's a key element of our policy on content like this. https://t.co/CAtmBPczlG — Andy Stone (@andymstone) February 7, 2020\n\nSimilarly, a Twitter spokesperson told CBS News partner CNET the video posted by the president didn't go against any of Twitter's current policies. Under new rules scheduled to take effect in March, manipulated media posted on Twitter by political leaders could get a warning label.\n\nTim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump's presidential campaign, told CNET, If Nancy Pelosi fears images of her ripping up the speech, perhaps she shouldn't have ripped up the speech. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk echoed Murtaugh's statement said Pelosi is trying to shut this down.\n\nThis is the second time Pelosi has had an issue with social media companies involving edited footage. Last May, a doctored video of Pelosi was posted online with the footage of her slowed down make her appear impaired.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have warned about the risk of altered videos misleading voters ahead of the 2020 elections.
A lobbying group for the nation's largest banks wants the Federal Reserve to permanently relax a number of regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. The reason: To help lenders deal with any economic fallout from the novel coronavirus.\n\nSome of the proposed changes would allow the banks to reduce the amount of money they must set aside to cover potential bad loans, which is exactly what got the banks into trouble during the crash.\n\nThe Fed has every reason to take steps now, said Bill Nelson, a top economist for the Bank Policy Institute, which is funded by large banks including Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Nelson co-authored the policy statement Actions the Fed Could Take in Response to COVID-19, which the group released earlier this week. It makes sense to increase confidence now to make sure there are no unwanted economic shocks from the coronavirus.\n\nThe banks have already been granted one of their wishes after Nelson last weekend sent an open letter to his group's members calling on the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates by at least a half of percentage point. The Fed did just that on Tuesday, though the reaction from the market was mixed.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his agency would talk to independent bank regulators about easing rules for lenders.\n\nOther financial regulators are easing rules because of the COVID-19 disease. The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday it will give companies seeing an impact from the coronavirus an additional 45 days, or as late as the end of June, to file their first-quarter earnings reports.\n\nNelson said he hasn't seen any evidence of financial stress at the big banks because of the virus. He added the lobbying group's recommendations stemming from the outbreak are along the lines of regulatory changes the banks have been seeking for years.\n\nIndustry critics accuse the banks of not letting a good crisis go to waste. The banks are trying to seize this moment when people are rightly concerned to push for changes that are unrelated and they have wanted for years, said Michael Barr, a law professor at the University of Michigan who wrote and helped implement the federal Dodd-Frank bank regulations enacted in 2010 after the financial crisis.\n\nBarr added that he doesn't see a connection between what the banks have proposed and anything related to the coronavirus. I don't think it would be helpful for the Fed to take these recommendations.\n\nDennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a pro-regulation non-profit that was co-founded by a hedge fund manager and a former corporate lawyer, said the Fed should force banks to suspend dividend payments and halt stock buybacks if the industry shows signs of financial distress. That would ensure banks have enough capital to cover bad loans, which could spike if the U.S. fell into recession because of the coronavirus.\n\nThe current unique circumstances require an increase of capital and liquidity, not a relaxing of the rules, Kelleher said.
WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve officials at their January meeting believed improving global economic prospects and the effects of recently passed tax cuts had raised the prospect for solid economic growth and for continued interest rate increases in 2018.\n\nThe minutes of the Fed's Jan. 30-31 discussions showed that the officials were more optimistic about the economy than they had been in December. They noted a stronger U.S. and global economy and rising expectations that the tax cuts passed in December would boost growth.\n\nThe minutes said a majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.\n\nThe Fed did not raise rates at the January meeting, which occurred before the February stock market plunge and turbulence.\n\nIn a statement, Capital Economics Chief Economist Paul Ashworth said, The upshot is that the addition of 'further' in the accompanying policy statement was intended to convey a more hawkish stance.\n\nRegarding the number of rate increases the Fed is likely to make during 2018, We have long expected the Fed to hike interest rates four times this year, on the basis that Congress would loosen fiscal policy and core inflation would rebound markedly in 2018, said Ashworth. That view is now rapidly gaining traction in the markets and among other economists.\n\nAfter spiking higher immediately after the minutes' release, stocks reversed course in late afternoon trading Wednesday, as the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond's yield leaped up just above 2.95 percent, the highest since January 2014.
Laundry detergent packets are getting into the hands -- and mouths -- of an increasing number of small children, resulting in serious and even fatal consequences, according to a new report.\n\nThe study, published Monday in Pediatrics, showed a 17 percent rise in calls to U.S. poison control centers reporting accidental exposures to laundry detergent packets involving young kids in 2013 and 2014.\n\nWe found that the majority of poisonings were due to exposure to laundry detergent packets and unfortunately it was precisely those products that were causing the greatest toxicity, lead study author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told CBS News.\n\nSmith and his team analyzed data from more than 62,000 calls made to U.S. poison control centers after unintentional exposures to laundry or dishwasher detergent in children under the age of 6. While the number of exposures increased for all forms of detergents, the greatest jump was seen in laundry detergent packets followed by dishwasher detergent packets, which saw a 14 percent rise.\n\nThe researchers found that liquid laundry detergent packets -- as opposed to granules -- were the most harmful when ingested by children. These exposures resulted in 17 comas, six cases of respiratory arrest, four cases of pulmonary edema, and two cases of cardiac arrest.\n\nTwo deaths occurred as a direct result of ingestion of laundry detergent packets.\n\nThe authors say the detergent packets are more concentrated than traditional detergent, making them more toxic.\n\nKids under the age of 3 accounted for the majority of cases in the study, with 2-year-olds making up slightly more than 16 percent of dishwasher detergent exposures and about 30 percent of laundry detergent exposures.\n\nChildren at this age will explore their environment by putting things in their mouth and if they simply bite down on one of these things, they'll burst and those contents will shoot to the back of their throat, Smith said.\n\nSmith said that the study findings provide enough basis to recommend parents opt for traditional laundry detergent over the packets.\n\nThere is no reason why children should be rushed to hospitals in a coma and with swelling down their lungs and we have to intubate them, he said. There's no reason why children should die when we have effective, safer alternatives for detergents.\n\nIf parents or adults with young children visiting their home do have these products, he urges that they be treated like any other poison.\n\nThey should be kept up away and out of sight of children and preferably in a locked cabinet, Smith said, because really the time it takes you to pick up a pair of dirty socks and throw them into the laundry is all it's going to take for a child to put one of these in their mouth, bite down, and have it squirt down their throat.\n\nWhile ingestion causes the most harm, contact with the eyes or lips can also lead to irritation and pain.\n\nDepending on the route of exposure, initial symptoms can include drooling, swelling, choking, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Parents who suspect their child has come into contact with the liquid inside these packets should seek medical advice immediately.\n\nIf parents have any question that their child has been exposed to the contents of a laundry detergent packet, they should call their poison help line to ask if they should be seen and follow their advice, he said.
Catholic bishops from across the U.S. are gathering Wednesday for a weeklong retreat on the clergy sex abuse crisis at a seminary near Chicago. Organizers said the retreat, which was requested by Pope Francis, will focus on prayer and spiritual reflection and not policy-making.\n\n\n\nThe gathering comes as CBS News has also learned of several cases involving nuns accused of sexual misconduct. The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests – or SNAP – said it doesn't keep count of sexual abuse allegations, but CBS News' Nikki Battiste has spoken with several women who recently reported misconduct, ranging from forceful kissing to molestation, all carried out by nuns.\n\nWhen Trish Cahill was 15 years old she said she confided in Sister Eileen Shaw at a convent in New Jersey. Cahill said she told Shaw things she'd never revealed to anyone about her now-deceased uncle – a priest – whom she claims sexually abused her, starting at age five.\n\nI would have done anything for her. I would have died for her, Cahill said. She gave me everything that was lacking that I didn't even know I was lacking. I was so broken. She filled in all those pieces.\n\nShe now describes that process as grooming, saying Shaw plied her with drugs and alcohol while teaching her how to have sex with a woman.\n\n\n\nI'm with my friends during the day. And I'm with this pedophile nun on the evenings and on the weekends, and in the summer, Cahill said.\n\nThe Catholic Church has been plagued with high-profile abuse scandals but pedophile nun is a phrase many people have probably never heard before.\n\nThat's really a shame. Because there's a lot of them out there … it's the secret not yet told, Cahill said.\n\nSister Eileen Shaw, the women Trish Cahill says abused her. CBS News\n\nMary Dispenza is trying to change that.\n\nThe demands of chastity and celibacy are unrealistic demands for many of us, Dispenza said.\n\nDispenza, a former nun from another congregation, remembers what happened when a superior summoned her to her room.\n\nI knelt down right next to her and she kissed me all over softly, my face … and I want to say, 'Oh but it wasn't bad,' but it was. And I've carried it with me until today, Dispenza said.\n\nThrough her work with SNAP she said she would occasionally hear about abuse or cover-ups by nuns but since the publication of a grand jury report identified hundreds of pedophile priests in Pennsylvania, at least 18 people have contacted her to share stories of abuse by religious sisters.\n\nAsked why we haven't heard much about abuse by nuns until recently, Dispenza said, A lot has to do with the culture of nuns which are, they are very, very private by nature.\n\nCahill reported her abuse to the sisters of charity of St. Elizabeth in 1994. The congregation paid her a $70,000 out-of-court settlement.\n\nThey had canon lawyers on retainer just for people like me. Shut her up, pacify her, tell her you love her and you'll pray for her, and send her on her way, Cahill said.\n\nIn a statement, the congregation told CBS News, The case was investigated immediately when it was reported in 1994 and a settlement was reached that was mutually agreed on by all parties. We believe that the Sisters of Charity acted in a responsible manner.\n\nWe reached out to Sister Eileen Shaw who Cahill said she continued to see for years as an adult. She hung up on Battiste.\n\nThe Sisters of Charity removed her from her role as a grade school principal but reports she remains a nun. They're providing her with food and housing while restricting her from outside ministry. In the meantime, Cahill said the settlement she signed wasn't enough to help her deal with a lifetime of trauma. But she hopes that her voice can help prevent this from happening again.\n\nThat this is the beginning of many, many times more that I get to speak and I get to educate, and I get to, possibly, prevent this from happening to anyone ever again, Cahill said.\n\nCahill said she believes other nuns had to have known what was going on with her. She's struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, along with alcohol and drug addiction that she said began with her abuse. The Sisters of Charity said they're willing to meet with her to address her continuing concerns.
Stocks surged on Monday following last week's rout, when Wall Street suffered its worst week since 2008. The market reversal comes after the Federal Reserve's Jerome Powell on Friday pledged monetary support if financial conditions decline.\n\nThe Dow soared 1,294 points, or 5.1%, to 26,704 on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 4.5% and the broader S&P 500-stock index gained 4.6%. The gains follow a Dow plunge last week of more than 12%, marking the fastest recorded slide into market correction territory — defined as a decline of at least 10% from a previous high.\n\nInvestors have been on edge as the coronavirus spreads into more U.S. states and more than 50 countries, prompting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to suggest the Fed could intervene with interest rate cuts or other moves by the central bank if the virus hurts the U.S. economy. That statement helped temper steepening losses on Friday and boosted sentiment on Monday, with Goldman Sachs analysts suggesting that the Fed could cut rates by a total of 1 percentage point over the next two months.\n\nMany commentators argue that monetary policy is ill-suited to address the impact of the virus on the economy, and that it is really public health policy (and fiscal policy more broadly) that needs to act, Goldman analysts noted. We agree with this point but think that central bankers will still want to do their part to support the economy.\n\nEven so, the spread of the coronavirus is prompting warnings about its impact on economic growth. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Monday cut its forecast for global economic growth in 2020 to 2.4% from 2.9% last year, saying in a report that the potential economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak is severe.\n\nAll we can say with any confidence at this point is that if markets remain at or close to their current levels, you should expect to see an abrupt deterioration in business and consumer sentiment over the next couple of months, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note.\n\n#COVID19 presents the 🌍 economy with its greatest danger since the #FinancialCrisis, raising the risk of: 🔹 Restrictions on movement (people, goods & services)\n\n🔹 Lower business & consumer confidence\n\n🔹 Slowing production 🆕 Interim #EconomicOutlook ➡️ https://t.co/Ur8AjvAzzy pic.twitter.com/kD2dWTXQUz — OECD ➡️ Better policies for better lives (@OECD) March 2, 2020\n\nInvestors are closely watching the spread of the disease both globally and in the U.S. Two deaths linked to the virus have been confirmed in the U.S., and scientists are warning that it already may have spread much more widely than believed in Washington state. The disease has led to more than 87,000 infections and resulted in at least 3,037 deaths, mostly in China.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has already brought considerable human suffering and major economic disruption, the OECD said in its report. Output contractions in China are being felt around the world, reflecting the key and rising role China has in global supply chains, travel and commodity markets.\n\nIt added, Subsequent outbreaks in other economies are having similar effects, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\nFed to the rescue?\n\nInvestors are recoiling against uncertainty over how widely the disease might spread and its impact on global and U.S. economic growth, noted Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird.\n\nThe central issue is will the virus be a short-term disruption or create long-term disturbances in the economy? he wrote in a Monday research note.\n\nEven though stocks are close to an oversold condition, Bittles wrote, shares have yet to rally because of strong downside momentum. We would encourage investors to be patient and not rush to buy until we have solid evidence that the decline has run its course, he noted.
Beijing — With just days left for the Trump administration, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has lifted a nearly four-decade policy that unilaterally restricted official U.S. government visits to the democratic island of Taiwan. Pompeo faulted the policy as an attempt to appease the Communist regime in Beijing, adding for emphasis: no more.\n\nThe State Department quickly put the policy change into practice, announcing that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft would visit Taiwan this week.\n\nToday, I am lifting all self-imposed restrictions on executive branch agencies' interactions with their counterparts from Taiwan. This action will benefit both of our great democracies. https://t.co/JmxE5jsZYf — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) January 9, 2021\n\nBeijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that rightfully belongs to China, quickly condemned the move, while Taipei thanked the U.S. for its support.\n\nWe urge the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters on Monday, adding that Washington should refrain from any words or actions that promote U.S.-Taiwan relations or strengthen military ties with Taiwan.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty\n\nHe took aim directly at Pompeo for the move: We advise people like Pompeo to recognize the historical trends, stop manipulating Taiwan-related issues, stop going against the tides of history, refrain from going further down the wrong and dangerous path, otherwise they will be severely punished by history.\n\nBut 111 miles across the Taiwan Strait in Taipei, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said in a tweet that he was grateful to Pompeo and the U.S. State Department, for lifting restrictions unnecessarily limiting our engagements these past years.\n\nI'm grateful to @SecPompeo & @StateDept for lifting restrictions unnecessarily limiting our engagements these past years. I'm also thankful for strong bipartisan support in Congress for the #Taiwan🇹🇼 Assurance Act, which advocates a review of prior guidelines. The closer ... 1/2 https://t.co/2UrT5d7Wws — 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC (Taiwan) 🇹🇼 (@MOFA_Taiwan) January 10, 2021\n\nThe closer partnership between #Taiwan & the #US is firmly based on our shared values, common interests & unshakeable belief in freedom & democracy, Wu added.\n\nThe change in U.S. government policy toward Taiwan sets the stage for Craft's visit — the first by a U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in half a century, since Taiwan was formally excluded from the U.N. in 1971. Craft is scheduled to land in Taiwan on Wednesday.\n\nYears of shifting policy\n\nThe policy update is the latest in a string of U.S. moves that have drawn Taipei closer to Washington, and it comes after global recognition for the island's vibrant democracy and its success in containing the coronavirus.\n\nIn August 2020, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar became the most senior U.S. government official in decades to visit Taiwan and meet President Tsai Ing-wen — and to draw Beijing's condemnation. He was also the highest-level U.S. cabinet official to visit the island since 1979, when Washington formally cut ties with Taipei via a series of agreements with Beijing.\n\nIn January 2017, then President-elect Donald Trump accepted a phone call with President Tsai — a move that infuriated Beijing and set the course for four years of warming U.S.-Taiwan ties, and proved to be yet another point of contention in the deteriorating U.S.-Beijing relationship.\n\nBiden and the road ahead\n\nVictor Gao, a veteran international affairs analyst and Chair Professor at Soochow University, called Taiwan the most important and the most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations.\n\nHe told CBS News on Monday that by changing U.S. policy, Pompeo was completely disregarding and distorting history and current geopolitics in claiming the previous U.S. administrations since Nixon had been kowtowing to China regarding Taiwan. The overwhelming majority of the countries in the world and all the international organizations acknowledge there is only one China... Taiwan is not a separate and independent country, but a part of China. Pompeo will not succeed in his attempt to change this reality in the world.\n\nNine days before President-elect Joe Biden takes over the White House, other Chinese scholars in Beijing were cautious about the positions he may take against China.\n\nBeijing prepares for the worst when it comes to the changing U.S. policy on Taiwan and Ambassador Craft's looming visit, Sun Zhe, Director of the Center for U.S.-China Relations at Tsinghua University told CBS News.\n\nHe said that while a single visit cannot change the current cross-Strait relations, he was not sure what Biden will do, but he has been careful in handling the Taiwan issue in the past.\n\nWhen then-President George W. Bush sought to defend Taiwan in 2001 against an increasingly aggressive Beijing, Sun noted that Biden was cautious, and I think he will be more prudent.\n\nCraft's visit constitutes a major action [by the] Trump administration… to erode extraordinarily [the] U.S.' one-China policy, which it has done since early 2018 and accelerated much since April 2020, Professor Shi Yinhong, former Director of the Center on American Studies at Renmin University of China in Beijing, told CBS News. The Biden White House, he added might continue the process in essence, with less pace and intensity.\n\nCBS News' Grace Qi contributed to this report.
NEW YORK -- New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman agreed to accept a 30-game suspension under Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy, a penalty stemming from an incident with his girlfriend last October.\n\nUnder the discipline announced Tuesday, the four-time All-Star will serve the penalty from the start of the Yankees' season on April 4. He will lose 30 days of pay -- $1,856,557 of his $11,325,000 salary. The agreement specifies he will be eligible for free agency after this season barring any additional suspension for off-the-field conduct that would cost him the necessary service time.\n\nI found Mr. Chapman's acknowledged conduct on that day to be inappropriate ... particularly his use of a firearm and the impact of that behavior on his partner, baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. I am gratified that Mr. Chapman has taken responsibility for his conduct.\n\nChapman became the first player penalized a finite number of games under the policy, which MLB and the players' association agreed to in August following several high-profile incidents among NFL players. Colorado shortstop Jose Reyes was given an indefinite paid suspension last week, pending a trial scheduled for April 4, following an alleged altercation with him wife in October.\n\nBaseball's investigation of Chapman stemmed from Oct. 30. Chapman's girlfriend, 22-year-old Cristina Barnea, told police he pushed and choked her. Chapman said there was an argument but that he was pushed down by Barnea's brother, eventually getting a handgun and firing eight shots into a wall and window while locked in his garage.\n\nThe Davie Police Department and Broward Assistant State Attorney Stefanie Newman declined to file charges, saying conflicting accounts and insufficient evidence made a conviction unlikely. Under MLB's domestic violence policy, discipline does not have to be predicated on a conviction.\n\nChapman, the hardest-throwing pitcher in the major leagues, was traded from payroll-paring Cincinnati Reds to the Yankees in December. He had said he would contest any suspension, but a deal was reached following negotiations with MLB.\n\nI want to be clear, I did not in any way harm my girlfriend that evening, Chapman said in a statement. However, I should have exercised better judgment with respect to certain actions, and for that I am sorry. The decision to accept a suspension, as opposed to appealing one, was made after careful consideration. I made this decision in an effort to minimize the distractions that an appeal would cause the Yankees, my new teammates and most importantly, my family.\n\nChapman's representatives and MLB had been discussing the discipline for about 10 days. A suspension of 46 days or longer would have delayed his eligible for free agency until after the 2017 season.\n\nThe players' association said it supported Chapman's decision to accept the penalty and said its members do not condone the mistreatment of others by playing or non-playing personnel.\n\nWith the Yankees, Chapman forms a powerful back end of the bullpen along with former closer Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances.\n\nChapman can continue to participate in all spring training activities. The penalty starts when the Yankees open the season April 4 at home against Houston. Barring rainouts, he would eligible to start his season May 9 when the Yankees host Kansas City.\n\nWe need him, teammate Alex Rodriguez said Tuesday before the suspension was announced. He's a big part of our team, and I think the key in New York is you have to focus on the game, focus on your teammates, and I think he has a lot of support in that clubhouse.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig is under investigation by MLB for a fight with a bouncer at a Miami bar in November following an argument with his sister.
Joe Biden has landed a high-profile endorsement for his presidential bid as Rep. Abby Finkenauer becomes the first member of the Iowa congressional delegation to take sides in the Democratic nominating contest.\n\nFinkenauer, a first-term House member from a district Donald Trump won in 2016 and the second-youngest member of Congress, will campaign with Biden this weekend, with less than four weeks to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses that lead off Democrats' 2020 voting.\n\nBiden has received more than two dozen congressional endorsements, the most of the Democratic presidential field. Finkenauer and Congresswoman Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada who also endorsed Biden, are the only two members of Congress from the four early primary states to publicly back a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nFinkenauer said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Thursday's announcement that the former vice president's experience, his proposals on infrastructure and other economic matters and his appeal to a wide range of voters make him the ideal Democrat to take on Trump.\n\nWe need somebody at the top who can lead from the White House, someone who's willing to unite not just Democrats but the country, Finkenauer said. There are days where I swear Democrats and Republicans are speaking different languages, and there's no translator. ... (Biden) is the translator.\n\nAt 31, Finkenauer also gives the 77-year-old Biden a potential bridge to younger Democrats, a group that has proved to be more skeptical of his candidacy than older voters.\n\nThe congresswoman is scheduled to appear alongside Biden in at least eight cities and towns as part of a 10-county, five-day Iowa tour that begins Thursday. It won't be their first pairing; Finkenauer was among the dozens of Democratic House candidates Biden campaigned for ahead of the 2018 midterms.\n\nHer potential influence, even as a freshman, was on display in November, when nine presidential candidates visited her northeastern Iowa district for a forum she co-sponsored with labor groups. That slate included the four candidates — Biden, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — who polls suggest are the top contenders in Iowa.\n\nFinkenauer did not frame her support for Biden as a rejection of his rivals, saying she's not going to speak to what's going to win votes and what's not. Yet her explanation aligns with Biden's argument that a center-left approach, coupled with his record as a senator and vice president, makes him Democrats' best option in a general election.\n\nFinkenauer specifically cited Biden's proposals for new infrastructure spending and his role in the 2010 health care overhaul becoming law, saying Biden connects the big picture to what it means around kitchen tables across the country.\n\nBiden and Finkenauer share similar electoral strategies, as well.\n\nA small-town Iowa native, Finkenauer defeated a Republican incumbent in 2018 emphasizing her family's deep ties to the district and establishing cultural connections with voters who've grown increasingly skeptical of Democrats. At the same time, she carved out a policy profile that, like Biden's, reflects Democrats' leftward evolution but with a more cautious agenda than the progressive left fueling Warren and Sanders. Finkenauer and Biden are staunch allies of organized labor. Finkenauer campaigned heavily on paid family leave and infrastructure improvements. Like Biden, she supports expanding the 2010 health care law but stops short of single-payer, all-government insurance like what Sanders and Warren support. She also campaigns aggressively in her district's rural areas and small towns, venues like those that have dominated Biden's itinerary in his recent rips to Iowa.\n\nIt goes back to the uniting factor, Finkenauer said of her endorsement. You can't divide rural America and our cities. They do require different attention and different plans, but if rural America is forgotten, then our cities are also hurt, and vice versa. He's understood that from the beginning.
A high-ranking New York Police Department official accused of posting hateful messages online has opted to retire days after the department said it was suspending him without pay. An NYPD spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that Deputy Inspector James Kobel, the former head of the department's workplace discrimination office, had submitted retirement papers.\n\nThe NYPD opened an internal affairs investigation into Kobel in November after he was accused of posting attacks on Black and Jewish people, women and members of the LGBTQ community on a message board where officers would air grievances anonymously.\n\nKobel was removed as commanding officer of the Equal Employment Opportunity Division and reassigned to the transit unit. Last week, the department placed him on unpaid administrative leave.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Sunday that the posts were absolutely disgusting and go against everything we've done to build a more inclusive police department.\n\nThe head of Kobel's union said the 29-year NYPD employee retired to avoid a departmental disciplinary hearing, where de Blasio suggested he be terminated immediately if found guilty of violating NYPD rules.\n\nGiven the current political climate and anti-police sentiment, DI Kobel did not see it as possible to get a fair administrative trial and decided to avail himself of the opportunity to file for retirement, Captains Endowment Association President Chris Monahan said.\n\nKobel was accused of posting for more than a year using the pseudonym Clouseau, a reference to the bumbling French detective in the Pink Panther films.\n\nClouseau used vulgar, racist nicknames when referring to multiple Black public figures, including Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark, President Obama and de Blasio's son. He ridiculed Public Advocate Jumaane Williams for having Tourette's syndrome.\n\nKobel denied being Clouseau when the posts came to light but acknowledged the fiasco would likely end his career. In an interview with The New York Times, he asked: Where do I go to get my reputation back?\n\nThe allegations against Kobel were detailed in a report by a City Council oversight panel. City Council investigators linked the Clouseau messages to Kobel by matching information in them to publicly available details about Kobel's life and career.\n\nThe NYPD's Equal Employment Opportunity office is responsible for preventing and investigating employment and harassment claims and has implemented policy changes in recent years providing for lactation rooms, enabling officers to wear religious head coverings and making accommodations for transgender officers.
Mark Zuckerberg's congressional testimony could have a big effect on the tech leaders of tomorrow. CBS News' Tony Dokoupil watched the Facebook CEO testify Tuesday at San Francisco's Founders Space where Steve Hoffman helps support start-ups. They were joined by Chirag Bhatt of the office collaboration platform Flock as well as Chris Kelly who runs Survata, an online survey company.\n\nIt was a room that didn't have a lot of sympathy for the 33-year-old Facebook founder who appeared in front of Congress to answer questions and apologize about his company's failure to protect users' information in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nI think he's sorry he has to testify in front of Congress, Kelly said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Hoffman: If Zuckerberg truly was sorry that this was going to happen then in advance he would have made it a policy of the company….and to really put the consumer above profits and he didn't do that.\n\nHe's absolutely sorry about just having no idea from where his information that he is supposed to be responsible for is being used, added Chirag Bhatt.\n\nZuckerberg may deflect the attention of Congress, but there's no ducking the judgment of other tech executives who also rely on data to build their businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nData is the new oil, Kelly said. But in Bhatt's opinion, data is even harder to control than oil.\n\nOil you can actually see, data you cannot, Bhatt said.\n\nSome have referred to the data economy as surveillance capitalism. Hoffman wholeheartedly agreed.\n\nWe're gathering as much information as possible about every user on the internet, and that information is being used to not only watch people, but influence them, predict what they are going to do, change what they are going to do. All of that, Hoffman said.\n\nAll three are open to the idea of regulation if it restores trust, but not if it stifles innovation. Silicon Valley wants to make sure young companies get the same chance Facebook has had to put their data to use.\n\n\n\nIn this period of time, right now in social networking they are a monopoly, but that monopoly will not persist forever, Hoffman said.\n\n\n\nZuckerberg says he doesn't think Facebook has a monopoly. While none of these entrepreneurs' companies directly compete with Facebook, they all want that next big data idea because by 2025, the average internet user will connect with a device once every 18 seconds -- upwards of eight times more per day than they do now.
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- Florida's new governor has suspended the sheriff whose deputies were assigned to protect the Parkland school where 17 people died in a massacre last February. Gov. Ron DeSantis removed Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel on Friday. He appointed former Coral Springs police Sgt. Gregory Tony to replace Israel.\n\nDuring the campaign, DeSantis originally said he would suspend Israel, but then backed off slightly, saying he would hold officeholders accountable. DeSantis tweeted Friday that the suspension was over Israel's repeated failures, incompetence and neglect of duty.\n\nBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel on Feb. 21, 2018. POOL / REUTERS\n\nThe massacre might never have happened had Broward had better leadership in the sheriff's department, DeSantis said.\n\nA state commission investigating the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School recently concluded Israel's changes to the department's active shooter policy may have contributed to some deputies' inaction during the shooting. DeSantis' executive order says that Israel inserted into the department's active shooter policy that deputies may enter a building to confront a shooter in order to preserve life.\n\nAs such, it says, deputy Scot Peterson, the only armed deputy on campus the day of the massacre, exercised the discretion of Sheriff Israel when he failed to confront the shooter. It also notes that six nearby Broward sheriff's deputies did not immediately move towards the gunshots to confront the shooter.\n\nThe executive order references 21 previous interactions with gunman Nikolas Cruz, including a social media threat to shoot up the school and a tip that he had weapons and might be a Columbine in the making.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Friday, Israel called the suspension unjustified and vowed to fight it in court and before the Florida Senate.\n\nLet me be clear -- I wholeheartedly reject the statements in the governor's executive order, Israel said. They are lacking both in legal merit and valid factual basis. There was no wrongdoing on my part. I served the country honorably.\n\nEffective immediately, I am officially suspending Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel for his repeated failures, incompetence and neglect of duty. https://t.co/tkHzxTHhjH — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) January 11, 2019\n\nIsrael said his suspension amounted to the newly seated governor fulfilling a campaign promise he made well before the commission issued its findings on the massacre response.\n\nThis was about politics, not Parkland, Israel said.\n\nDeSantis' Republican predecessor, now-Sen. Rick Scott, had refused to suspend the sheriff, saying he wanted to wait until investigations were complete before deciding.
Stocks thudded to their worst day since the epic Black Monday crash in 1987 amid mounting investor fears over the coronavirus pandemic and President Donald Trump's assessment that the U.S. may be heading toward recession. The sharp decline came despite this weekend's emergency cut in interest rates to nearly zero by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Dow plummeted 2,997 points, or 12.9%, to 20,189. The broader S&P 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell around 12%. On a percentage basis, the Dow's decline is larger than the losses incurred on either October 28 or October 29, 1929, when the index slumped 12.8% and 11.7%, respectively. The biggest one-day loss remains the 22.6% plunge on October 19, 1987.\n\nStocks traded lower later in the afternoon after President Donald Trump said at a press conference that the crisis could last until July or August, and that the economy might enter a recession. Asked about the stock market, Mr. Trump said, The best thing I can do for the stock market is we have to get through this.\n\nEconomists increasingly expect the U.S. economy to slide into a recession, with IHS Markit chief U.S. economist Joel Prakken writing in a research note that the sharp contraction in spending on activities that involve travel and congregating in public could lead to a recession in the second quarter.\n\nThe extra stimulus and measures to ease strains in the financial system announced by central banks over the weekend have failed to prevent stock markets from tumbling again today, as concerns mount about the economic consequences of a global 'lockdown' to combat coronavirus, John Higgins, chief market economist at Capital Economics, told investors in a report.\n\nThe Fed's surprise rate cut on Sunday is designed to shore up the economy by making it cheaper to borrow and to keep lending flowing to businesses and consumers. Even so, Wall Street is growing increasingly pessimistic because consumer spending — the bedrock of the U.S. economy — appears to be grinding to a halt as Americans hunker down to avoid the coronavirus.\n\nTrading was halted briefly on Monday after stocks plunged sharply minutes into the session — the third trading halt this month as investors weigh the economic impact of the pandemic. Trading is halted when stocks decline by 7%, 13% or 20% in a single session. The measures were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week hadn't been tripped since 1997.\n\nAcross the U.S., states and cities are closing schools, bars and restaurants, and other businesses in an effort to slow the spread of the disease, a potentially devastating hit to the income of millions of workers. More than 4.4 million U.S. restaurant jobs are at risk in states that have shuttered eateries and bars, according to outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas.\n\nThe only certainty at this point is more volatility, Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said in an email. I would expect the market to price in a recession and if that turns out not to be the case — or if credible and specific fiscal and public health policies are put in place to contain the economic and public health risks — that is when you will begin to see a bottom in the stock market.\n\nHe added, Unfortunately, the Fed will be unable to put much of a floor under the market, only Congress and the Executive Branch will be able to do that.\n\nMore than 3,700 people have tested positive for the new COVID-19 disease in the U.S., and at least 69 have died. Globally, the death toll was just over 6,500 on Monday, with the weekend seeing an alarming spike in fatalities in three European nations grappling with aggressive outbreaks.\n\nThe Fed said in a Sunday statement that the effects of the outbreak will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the outlook. Policy makers said they will keep rates at nearly zero until they are confident the economy has weathered the storm, which a number of economists say could push the U.S. into recession.\n\nThese are strong measures, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a rare Sunday news conference, warning that growth in the second quarter would be slow. The virus will run its course and economic activity will resume. In the meantime, we will act to support the flow of credit to companies and individuals.\n\nAirlines slump\n\nAirlines and other travel businesses are suffering as the pandemic drives down demand for flights, hotels, cruises and other travel bookings. United Airlines on Sunday said its revenue in March is projected to shrink by $1.5 billion compared with a year earlier, and said it would cut flights by 50% for April and May. Shares of United plunged 14.8% on Monday.\n\nIn just the first two weeks of March, we have welcomed more than one million fewer customers on board our aircraft than the same period last year, CEO Oscar Munoz and President J. Scott Kirby said in a message to their employees.\n\nThey added: The bad news is that it's getting worse. We expect both the number of customers and revenue to decline sharply in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nUnited is also cutting salaries for corporate officers by 50%, and expects its flight reductions to extend into the summer.\n\nWall Street analysts think U.S. stocks will continue to flounder until there are signs the virus has been contained.
President Trump has been in office for more than a week and has taken advantage of his executive powers by beginning to craft and impose his administration's policies.\n\nSeven days into his first term, Mr. Trump issued more than a dozen executive actions, which include a government-wide freeze on new and pending regulations, the reinstatement of a policy that bars U.S. funding to health providers abroad that discuss abortion as an option and a call for the construction of a physical wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe one that has provoked the loudest uproar was the travel and refugee ban, which blocks people from entering the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries and halts admission for Syrian refugees.\n\nMost of the actions taken so far are technically presidential memoranda, while some are executive orders, which have the force of law and must be published in the Federal Register. Historically, presidents have embraced the executive order as a tool to use when there's a lack of action from Congress. Some have been infamously contentious -- President Franklin Roosevelt signed one in 1942 that established internment camps during World War II.\n\nMr. Trump issued an executive order Friday that temporarily bans immigration to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries and indefinitely suspends the Syrian refugee program. The president said in his order that their entry would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\n\nJulian Zelizer, history and public affairs professor at Princeton University, said of the order, The power of the president on national security is vast, especially post-9/11. But he went on to say, I'm sure that will be challenged.\n\nHere are some of the major actions that Mr. Trump has taken so far:\n\nObamacare\n\nWithin hours of being sworn in a week ago, Mr. Trump signed his first executive order, which seeks to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThe order directs the head of Health and Human Services and other departments to use their authority to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or cost, fee, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance or makers of medical devices, products and medications.\n\nMark Peterson, chairman of the Public Policy Department at UCLA, said that the order is more of a planted flag and that there are significant constraints on what the president can do with an executive or domestic issue like this one.\n\nThe Trump administration could change rules related to Obamacare, Peterson said, that were developed as part of the regulatory process. He pointed out, however, that any new, proposed regulations would have to comply with existing law and would be subject to a lengthy and complex process that would take months to implement them.\n\nWhat the executive order does do is simply add further uncertainty to the process, which itself is something President Trump may wish to accomplish, he said. Uncertainty unnerves insurance companies, and that may lead to eventual market withdrawals and more destabilization of the market. That could lead to market collapse. Then the administration and Republicans will strive to claim that Obamacare collapsed under its own weight.\n\nRobert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's School of Public Health, agrees that the order itself is not going to affect many people, but it does have enormous significance politically.\n\nIf I am a governor, a president of an insurance company, I'm somebody enrolling, I'm saying I don't know what this thing does, but this is a signal that this new president places as job number one, getting rid of this law, he said.\n\nThe talking points given to Congress by the White House said that one goal of this executive order was to help get the mandates and penalties off the backs of the poorest and sickest Americans. The ACA's individual mandate requires that Americans purchase health care insurance or pay a penalty. But this provision was already somewhat weakened by the fact that the law gave the IRS no real ability to enforce the payment of the penalty. The only recourse the tax collecting agency has is to subtract the penalty from the taxpayer's refund. And if the taxpayer isn't entitled to a refund, the IRS can carry the penalty over to the following year.\n\nTravel and refugee ban, extreme vetting\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order Friday that has blocked people from entering the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The order also suspends the Syrian refugee program to accept new refugees into the U.S. for 120 days. The order for called the extreme vetting of new arrivals to the United States.\n\nI'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States, he told an audience at the Pentagon, where the action was signed.\n\nHis order directs the State Department to stop issuing visas to Syrian nationals and halts the processing of Syrian refugees for 120 days. The president, during his signing of the order at the Department of Homeland Security, also called on the Pentagon and the State Department to create a plan for safe zones in and around Syria to offer protection for Syrians fleeing the war there.\n\nBut the signed order itself makes no mention of a plan for safe zones in Syria. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation.\n\nSeveral other points included in the action:\n\nMr. Trump ordered a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which is America's broader refugee program. The suspension is intended to provide time to review how refugees are vetted before they are allowed to resettle in the United States.\n\nThe executive action appears to be capping the number of refugees from other countries at 50,000 people in fiscal year 2017, saying more than that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The Obama administration had set a goal of admitting 110,000 refugees into the U.S. in the current fiscal year, which began last October.\n\nThe action says that when U.S. Refugee Admissions Program admissions resume, the secretary of state, in consultation with the secretary of homeland security, is directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.\n\nBuilding a border wall\n\nDuring a visit to the Department of Homeland Security Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that calls on the department's secretary to take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border.\n\nBut it won't be that simple. Philip Schrag, a Georgetown law professor whose expertise includes immigration policy, said the U.S. doesn't own all of the land adjacent to the border.\n\nIn Texas, apparently there are a great many of the lands adjacent to the border in private hands, so the government would first have to seize the land by eminent domain or purchase it from the owners and then deal with the construction problems, he said.\n\nThe order also calls on the DHS secretary to identify and allocate funding for the wall's construction and prepare long-term budget requests to submit to Congress. House Speaker Paul Ryan is already on board and ready to work with the president to fund the wall. Mr. Trump also called for the hiring of 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and the construction of detention facilities near the U.S. border with Mexico, although that is dependent on Congress allocating money for the hires.\n\nSchrag added that the migration of animals along the border will also pose an obstacle to building the wall and the U.S. will have to spend years funding this project.\n\nThe challenges of building a physical wall in that terrain are going to mean that this is an extremely expensive project, requiring billions of dollars of appropriations over a period of years, he said.\n\nDefunding sanctuary cities\n\nMr. Trump signed another executive order Wednesday that intends to allow the attorney general and homeland security secretary to make a determination whether certain cities, known as sanctuary cities, are not eligible for federal grants. Schrag, however, said that the order doesn't make sense because it says states and cities can't receive federal grants if they willfully refuse to comply with the law, U.S. Code 1373.\n\nThat's a little bit puzzling because that subsection of the U.S. Code doesn't actually require the cities to maintain any information about the immigration status of people they apprehend or people living in the cities, he said. It only prohibits the officials of states and governments from refusing to send such information to the Department of Homeland Security. It doesn't require anybody to maintain that information. So if the city of New York apprehends somebody for a misdemeanor, this section does not require it to inquire into that person's immigration status.\n\nThe order also says the DHS must prioritize deportations for people in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of a criminal offense, have been charged with one, have engaged in fraud and abused any program related to public benefits, among other criteria. It also calls for the hiring of 10,000 more immigration officers, which Congress would have to agree to allocate funding for.\n\nMany mayors are resisting the threat posed by the executive order, though not all. Fearing a loss of millions of dollars from the federal government, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez ordered county jails to begin complying with federal immigration detention demands. The move effectively unravels Miami-Dade's status as a sanctuary for the undocumented.\n\nHiring freeze on civilian government employees\n\nA memorandum Mr. Trump issued Monday imposed a freeze on all federal civilian employees across the board in the executive branch.\n\nBeginning last Sunday, no vacant positions were allowed to be filled and no new positions could be created except in limited circumstances. The memorandum does not apply to military personnel, and it instructed the director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a long-term plan to reduce the size of the federal government's workforce through attrition.\n\nReinstating the Mexico City policy\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum that reinstates the Mexico City policy, introduced in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, which bans the granting of U.S. funding to health providers internationally that discuss abortion as a family planning option. Since the Reagan administration, Democrats have rescinded the policy and Republicans have reinstated it.\n\nThe latest president's memorandum directs the secretary of state to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Democrats have called the policy a global gag rule and have blasted the president for taking this action.\n\nPresident Trump's reinstatement of the Global Gag Rule ignores decades of research, instead favoring ideological politics over women and families. We know that when family planning services and contraceptives are easily accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths, and abortions, said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, in a statement.\n\nWithdrawing from TPP\n\nMr. Trump issued a memorandum Monday that called on the U.S. Trade Representative to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and negotiations that began under President Obama. It was largely a symbolic move since Congress had no plans to approve the trade deal.\n\nI hereby direct you to withdraw the United States as a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to permanently withdraw the United States from TPP negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages, the memorandum says.\n\nKeystone and Dakota Access Pipelines\n\nOn Tuesday, the president signed memoranda that attempt to renew the process for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was halted by Mr. Obama, and the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline.\n\nFor the Keystone pipeline, the action invites TransCanada to re-submit an application for a presidential permit for the construction and operation of the pipeline that would carry petroleum from Canada into the U.S.\n\nThe memorandum on the Dakota Access pipeline called it a substantial, multi-billion-dollar private investment in our nation's energy infrastructure and would carry about 500,000 barrels of crude oil from different areas in North Dakota to oil markets in the U.S. The Army Corps of Engineers announced in December that it would explore an alternate route for the pipeline after the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said the pipeline interfered with their drinking water, which led to massive protests.\n\nGovernment-wide freeze on regulations\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus said in a memo last Friday that he was communicating a request from the president to the heads of all government agencies that no new regulations could be submitted to the Federal Register until the head of a department or agency, selected by Mr. Trump, can review and approve the regulation.\n\nAny regulations that were already sent to the Federal Register must be immediately withdrawn for review and approval. For regulations that have been published in it, but haven't taken effect, their effective date must be postponed for 60 days to review them.\n\nExpanding the military\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order on Friday that he said would result in a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States.\n\nAs we prepare our budget request for Congress, he said, ... our military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will the nation's commitment to peace.\n\nWe will always have your back, he vowed to an audience at the Pentagon. According to Mr. Trump, the new action will provide new planes and ships for the military, along with resources and tools for the nation's men and women in uniform.\n\nLobbying ban\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order Saturday that bans administration officials from ever lobbying the U.S. on behalf of a foreign government again and imposes a five-year ban on people lobbying the agency they previously worked for. Another part of the order said that for two years, appointees must avoid working on issues involving their former clients or employees.\n\nReducing regulations\n\nA second week into his presidency, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that requires that two regulations be removed for every new regulation added. The White House argues that this will reduce the burden the private sector has in complying with federal standards.\n\nCBS News' Emily Schultheis and the Associated Press contributed to this report.
TOWSON, Md. -- A Towson University fraternity has been temporarily suspended after an alleged hazing incident has left one student hospitalized, CBS Baltimore reported.\n\nThe alleged hazing happened on March 31 off campus. Towson University, campus police and Baltimore County police are now investigating the troubling claims.\n\nThis investigation is going to be thorough. If we uncover any illegal activity whatsoever, those people will be held responsible, said Cpl. John Wachter.\n\nCBS Baltimore has learned from a family member that the victim was forced to eat cat food and drink a substance which he was told was only vinegar and pickle juice.\n\nThe family member also tells CBS Baltimore the student started vomiting blood.\n\nThe fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon at Towson University is being questioned for the alleged hazing. Its local chapter is temporarily suspended as police look into the concerning accusations.\n\nThe incident is also disturbing students across campus.\n\nIt's scary. It's scary that someone would ever do that, one student said.\n\nKind of scary to know we go to school with people that might hurt other people intentionally, another student said.\n\nThe incident is also sparking outrage in posts on the the Greek Rant blog. One person said: Cool, bros. Let's poison someone and destroy their esophagus and stomach lining!\n\nAnother said: [These] guys are pure scum. They flat out poisoned a kid and should be charged for attempted murder.\n\nTau Kappa Epsilon's national chapter is taking the accusations very seriously, suspending the local chapter during the investigation.\n\nAt this time, we are investigating this alleged incident at Towson University. Tau Kappa Epsilon does not condone hazing in any form. These alleged actions do not align with our values of love, charity, and esteem. We have temporarily suspended the Pi-Upsilon chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon. We are fully cooperating with the university and police investigations. If these allegations are found to be true, we will address the allegation swiftly and with appropriate action.\n\nTowson University also has a strict hazing policy, and plans to take action if needed.\n\nAnd when we get an allegation of hazing, we respond immediately, we take it very seriously. If it's confirmed, we take action swiftly, said Ray Feldman, senior director of communications, Towson University.\n\nInvestigators are now working to determine what exactly happened to the student, where the ritual took place, and above all -- why.\n\nThe university is not releasing the victim's name at this time.\n\nHazing is considered a misdemeanor in Maryland. It carries a fine of up to $500 and six months behind bars.
MISSION VIEJO, Calif. -- A Southern California swim coach said he had reported rumors of former Team USA assistant swim coach Sean Hutchison being in a forbidden relationship with a U.S. champion swimmer at an Olympic training center years ago, CBS Los Angeles reports. The revelation about Hutchison comes after the swimmer, Ariana Kukors, said this week that he sexually abused her when she was 16.\n\nKukors, now 28, also told authorities that Hutchison took thousands of sexually explicit photographs of her when she was a minor, according to a search warrant document by a federal agent.\n\nKukors told officers that he kissed and touched her when she was 16 and engaged in sexual activity with her when she was 17 at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, the document said.\n\nHutchison, 46, denies abusing Kukors and has not been charged with a crime. U.S. authorities and police executed a search warrant at his Seattle apartment this week, seizing electronic devices.\n\nMarc Schubert, who is now the head coach for a Mission Viejo swim club, told CBS Los Angeles that he had heard rumors of a relationship between Kukors, who was then 21, and Hutchison, who was 39, and told his boss to look into it.\n\nA fellow coach from back East called me and said that there were rumors going around the swim meet about Sean, and I was shocked, Schubert said.\n\nThat call came eight years ago, when Schubert was coaching Olympic hopefuls at the Olympic training center in Fullerton. He worked there with Hutchison.\n\nI felt like I needed to tell somebody, Schubert said. So I told his boss.\n\nSchubert said the head coach hired a private investigator to follow Hutchison.\n\nAll they could come up with was Ariana and Sean's cars parked together at 5 a.m. in the morning in front of his condo, Schubert said.\n\nHutchison and Kukors both denied they were having a sexual relationship, which is against policy for USA Swimming, the U.S. governing body of swimming. Without proof, Schubert said, the head coach did what he thought was best and asked Hutchison to leave.\n\nI think they came to an agreement that they wouldn't divulge the problem if he resigned, Schubert said.\n\nHutchison left coaching afterward but remained a member of USA Swimming as the owner of member club King Aquatic near Seattle, the organization said.\n\nHutchison's bio has been removed from the website. Michael Brooks, the club's head coach, said Thursday that Hutchison has stepped down as an executive with the club and has had no direct interaction with the club's swimmers for a very long time. He said the club supports past and current King Aquatic swimmers.\n\nIt's another scandal for USA Swimming and for the sports world, which was rocked by a litany of sexual misconduct by former USA Gymnastics sports doctor Larry Nassar. The organization revealed in 2010 that sex abuse allegations were mostly to blame for lifetime bans of 46 members and then said it set up training and enhanced screening for all coaches, officials and volunteers.\n\nUSA Swimming said Thursday that it learned of the underage abuse allegations against Hutchison this week.\n\nKukors, the 2009 world champion in the 200-meter individual medley who placed fifth in that event in the 2012 Olympics, on Wednesday publicly accused Hutchison of grooming her for sexual abuse when she was 13 and he was her coach at a Seattle-area swim club.\n\nI never thought I would share my story because I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself, she said in a statement Wednesday. But in time, I've realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.\n\nHutchison, who was an assistant coach on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team, said the two were in a relationship after the 2012 Olympics and that she lived in his Seattle home for more than a year.\n\nAt no time did I ever abuse Ariana Kukors or do anything with her that was not consensual, he said in a statement. I absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. Prior to that time, I did nothing to 'groom' her.\n\nThe investigation comes amid scrutiny over the supervision of people who work with young athletes. Nassar was recently sentenced to decades in prison in a case that led to a reckoning for the gymnastics governing body, with top executives resigning and the entire board of directors planning to step down as requested by the U.S. Olympic Committee.\n\nKukors' attorney in California, Robert Allard, compared his client's case to the one against Nassar.\n\nMuch like the USOC knew about Larry Nassar years before his arrest and did nothing, USA Swimming had notice in 2010 that Sean Hutchison was involved in an inappropriate coach-athlete relationship with Ariana and took no actions to protect her or other swimmers, he said in a statement.\n\nMike Saltzstein, former vice president of USA Swimming who previously complained about the organization's handling of sexual abuse cases, questioned the thoroughness of the organization's 2010 investigation.\n\nIn retrospect, it was absolutely flawed, he said, adding that a more thorough investigation may have uncovered other problems, including allegations of underage abuse, he said.\n\nNow with the benefit of hindsight and time, one would have to question whether there was any integrity to the first time they did this investigation, he said, adding that I sincerely hope that if they're investigating at 21, did they ask what happened before 18?
This week, Ri Chun-hee put the bomb in bombastic when she broke the news in her signature style that North Korea had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Whether there's any truth to that claim remains a matter of debate, but the announcement alone has had an impact on both sides of the Korean border.\n\nToday it was South Korea's turn to crank up the pressure -- by pumping up the jam; blasting propaganda and pop music across the border into the North.\n\nBut in Ri Chun-hee, Pyongyang deployed its own weapon; rolling her out before the public and the world once again to breathlessly convey the purported H-bomb breakthrough.\n\nWe will not disrupt or dismantle the program, she said, until the U.S. reverses its vicious hostile policy toward North Korea.\n\nThe 70-something grandmother is the go-to news anchor when the regime wants to impress the world, and those under its control.\n\nOften outfitted in the Chima Jeogori, a traditional Korean ensemble, her unbridled exuberance and passion plays well in an isolated country that prides itself on the projection of power -- real or imagined -- under Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nOtherwise she'd be out of a job, obviously -- or worse.\n\nShe barely made it through the theatrically dramatic announcement on the death of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011.\n\nWe make this announcement with great sorrow, she said.\n\nIn an interview with Chinese television, Chun-hee recommended that a good anchor shouldn't shout, but speak gently to viewers.\n\nWhile that advice that may have fallen on deaf ears to some of North Korea's up-and-coming talent -- one of whom recently bellowed through televisions at the country's citizens -- her style is clearly one that we in the West find amusing.\n\nREUTERS\n\nBut all the bombast and drama hits home, back home, says David Kang, director of the USC Korean Studies institute.\n\nThis is classic propaganda, says Kang. The regime is telling a story to the people and she symbolizes that story, which is: 'we're the real Koreans.' She wears a traditional Korean dress, she's a woman, which is also typically more considered to be the hearth and the home. And yet she's powerful and defiant.
A pack of wild canines found frolicking near the beaches of the Texas Gulf Coast carries a substantial amount of red wolf genes, researchers said, a surprising discovery because the animal was declared extinct in the wild nearly 40 years ago. The finding has led wildlife biologists and others to develop a new understanding that the red wolf DNA is remarkably resilient after decades of human hunting, loss of habitat and other factors had led the animal to near decimation.\n\nOverall, it's incredibly rare to rediscover animals in a region where they were thought to be extinct and it's even more exciting to show that a piece of an endangered genome has been preserved in the wild, said Elizabeth Heppenheimer, a Princeton University biologist involved in the research on the pack found on Galveston Island in Texas. The work of the Princeton team was published in the scientific journal Genes.\n\nI think we were all genuinely surprised that there was any indication of red wolf genes in either of these samples, Heppenheimer said in a statement. I think of myself as an expert on these animals, but in reality most of the time I'm just looking at my computer. It's the people on the ground, who watch these animals regularly, who have made the major discovery.\n\nThe genetic analysis found that the Galveston canines appear to be a hybrid of red wolf and coyote, but Heppenheimer cautions that without additional testing, it's difficult to label the animal.\n\nA pair of 7-week old red wolf pups explore their habitat at the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, N.C., Tuesday, June 13, 2017. Gerry Broome / AP\n\nRon Sutherland, a North Carolina-based conservation scientist with the Wildlands Network, said it's exciting to have found this unique and fascinating medium-sized wolf. The survival of the red wolf genes without much help from us for the last 40 years is wonderful news, said Sutherland, who was not involved in the Princeton study.\n\nThe discovery coincides with similar DNA findings in wild canines in southwestern Louisiana and bolsters the hopes of conservationists dismayed by the dwindling number of red wolves in North Carolina that comprised the only known pack in the wild.\n\nThe red wolf, which tops out at about 80 pounds, was once common across a vast region extending from Texas to the south, into the Southeast and up into the Northeast. It was federally classified as endangered in 1967 and declared extinct in the wild in 1980. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the 1970s captured a remnant population in Texas and Louisiana that eventually led to a successful captive breeding program. Those canines in 1986 became part of the experimental wild population in North Carolina. That group has been declining since peaking at an estimated 120 to 130 wolves in 2006. A federal report in April said only about 40 remained.\n\nAn additional 200 red wolves live in zoos and wildlife facilities as part of captive breeding programs.\n\nA federal judge in November sided with environmental groups that argued in a lawsuit that efforts by federal authorities to shrink the territory of the wild group in North Carolina were a violation of law. The judge ruled U.S. Fish and Wildlife also violated the Endangered Species Act by authorizing private landowners to kill the canine predators even if they weren't threatening humans, livestock or pets.\n\nA lawsuit by the Red Wolf Coalition, Defenders of Wildlife and Animal Welfare Institute argued that the federal government's neglect allowed the red wolf population to decline.\n\nThe debate over red wolf protections could take on new dimensions with the discovery on Galveston.\n\nSutherland said the Galveston canines have effectively quashed a decades-old impression that red wolves were a feckless predator overwhelmed by the numerical superiority of coyotes. He adds that the Galveston group has DNA that can't be found in the animal's captive population.\n\nA red wolf female peers back at her 7-week old pup in their habitat at the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, North Carolina, on Tuesday, June 13, 2017. Gerry Broome / AP\n\nFrom a practical conservation biology standpoint, these animals have special DNA and they deserve to be protected, he said, explaining that conservation easements that restrict development along parts of the Gulf Coast are an essential first step.\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Fish and Wildlife said the agency is unable to comment during the partial government shutdown. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said in a statement that the Galveston discovery is interesting, but we do not anticipate any regulatory changes or implications in Texas at this time.\n\nKim Wheeler, executive director of the North Carolina-based Red Wolf Coalition, cautioned that further study of the Galveston pack is needed.\n\nWe can get excited, but in my mind, we really need to let science do its due diligence to determine what this animal is, she said, noting that red wolves can evoke strong feelings in people with livestock or who have other concerns with their predatory nature.\n\nConservationists, meanwhile, say policymakers need to have a greater appreciation for hybrid animals. When the Endangered Species Act was implemented in the 1970s, conventional wisdom was that hybridization between species — such as the wolf and coyote — was rare and to be avoided. But experts say the thinking on that has changed.\n\nNow we know hybridization is relatively common in natural systems and does not always have negative consequences, but the policy hasn't quite caught up with this notion, Heppenheimer said.
Anthony Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general and former head of U.S. Central Command who has been working as an envoy for the Trump administration to resolve a dispute with Qatar, has resigned from his position with the State Department. He is the latest four-star general to exit the administration.\n\nZinni resigned after realizing he could not help resolve the Qatar dispute because of the unwillingness of the regional leaders to agree to a viable mediation effort that we offered to conduct or assist in implementing, he told CBS News. Zinni also felt there was no need for his involvement with the Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) concept — a NATO-style security alliance — that he was asked to introduce to regional leaders, since other members of the administration are carrying it forward.\n\nA senior State Department official described Zinni's departure as a soft resignation.\n\nZinni had originally agreed to work as a special adviser to the secretary of state on Middle East issues at the request of then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — both of whom have since left the administration in the wake of significant policy differences with Mr. Trump.\n\nZinni later coordinated with former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, then later current national security adviser John Bolton. Zinni described his working relationship with them as excellent, and the inter-agency cooperation on the issues he worked on impressive.\n\nZinni also served as former President George W. Bush's special envoy to the Middle East.\n\n— CBS News' Russell Midori contributed to this report
An alleged recruiter for the al-Qaida terrorist organization was released Friday from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba and sent home to Kuwait, as part an ongoing effort to winnow down the number of detainees held there.\n\nFaez Mohammed Ahmed al-Kandari was flown to Kuwait after a review by six U.S. government departments and agencies concluded it was no longer necessary to continue holding him after nearly 14 years at Guantanamo, the Pentagon said in announcing the release.\n\nLast year, the Pentagon released a profile of al-Kandari that identified him as an al-Qaeda recruiter and propagandist. The profile also said that he probably served as Osama bin Laden's spiritual adviser. Al-Kandari denied committing any terrorist acts or having any extremist affiliations and the U.S. never charged him.\n\nObama promises to work with Congress to close Guantanamo\n\nHis attorney, Eric Lewis, said al-Kandari would undergo a medical examination and then be placed in rehabilitation program set up by the Kuwaiti government to help former Guantanamo prisoners re-integrate into society.\n\nMr. al-Kandari is delighted to be going home and reuniting with his beloved parents and family after all these years away, Lewis said. The lawyer said the former prisoner looks forward to resuming a peaceful life and to putting Guantanamo behind him.\n\nAl-Kandari was the last of 12 Kuwaitis held in Guantanamo since it opened in January 2002 to hold prisoners suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban. Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, a prisoner at the base who has claimed responsibility for orchestrating the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, grew up in Kuwait but is a Pakistani national. He is facing trial by military commission with four co-defendants at the base.\n\nThe government of Kuwait had supported the release of its citizens and the 12 prisoners, who unlike a majority of those held at Guantanamo, have high-profile Washington lawyers and public relations firms working to secure their freedom.\n\nThat effort suffered a setback in 2008 when one of the released prisoners carried out a suicide car bombing in Iraq targeting Iraqi security forces in the northern city of Mosul.\n\nAl-Kandari's release leaves 104 detainees remaining at Guantanamo Bay. Earlier this week, two Yemeni detainees were resettled in Ghana. The Pentagon has planned to release a total of 17 Guantanamo detainees this month.\n\nPresident Obama has said he wants to reduce the number of low-level detainees and move the remainder to the U.S., a policy that is opposed by many in Congress. The White House intends to submit a plan to Congress to close the detention facility, and while the president considers it a priority, the timing for presenting a plan has not been announced.
With voters in 14 states preparing to head to the polls for Super Tuesday, Joe Biden's campaign has steadily rolled out a slew of high-profile endorsements in key states, consolidating support from the moderate and establishment wings of the Democratic Party after his decisive victory in the South Carolina primary. CBSNews.com writer Melissa Quinn reports the floodgates seemingly opened Saturday in the wake of Biden's win in the Palmetto State, which propelled him to second in the national delegate race, trailing Bernie Sanders by just two delegates. As the former vice president was projected to win the state just after polls closed, former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe announced on CNN his support for Biden, saying he has the best chance of winning the state in November. Joining McAuliffe were fellow Virginians Senator Tim Kaine, Congressman Bobby Scott and Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, who unseated a GOP incumbent in 2018. Also closing ranks around Biden were Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of Texas, Congressman Gil Cisneros of California and Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois — the seventh U.S. senator to back the former vice president. California, Texas and Virginia all hold their primaries Super Tuesday, when a total of 1,357 delegates are up for grabs. California and Texas will award the most, 415 and 228 respectively.\n\nAmong those announcing their support for Biden on Monday was former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who called him the candidate who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump's presidency. In a statement Reid said, Biden will be a much-needed stabilizing force following Trump's disastrous term, offering a positive and progressive alternative to Trump's dark vision of racism, xenophobia and policies built on cruelty and exclusion. Reid, who represented Nevada in the Senate for 30 years, added, I believe Biden is best able to defeat Donald Trump and enact the policies we all care about. The former vice president is also expected to snag support from his former competitors in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Amy Klobuchar, who suspended her presidential campaign on Monday, is expected to appear alongside Biden at a rally in Dallas on Monday night. Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out of the presidential race Sunday, endorsed Biden in Dallas on Monday night.\n\nAmong the field of Democratic presidential candidates, Biden has always had a high number of endorsements in competitive states like Iowa and New Hampshire, but they didn't translate into wins in either of the two states. In Iowa, Biden came in fourth and in New Hampshire, he placed fifth, and he came in second, far behind Sanders, in the Nevada caucuses. But that changed in South Carolina, where he received the coveted endorsement of Congressman Jim Clyburn, a Democratic kingmaker in the Palmetto State. Among Democratic primary voters, 47% said Clyburn's endorsement was an important factor in their vote. Biden thanked the South Carolina congressman for helping drive him to victory in the state, saying he brought me back. The field of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination has thinned in the wake of the South Carolina primary. Tom Steyer ended his campaign on Saturday, followed by Buttigieg on Sunday and Klobuchar on Monday. This leaves five candidates in the race: Sanders, Biden, Mike Bloomberg, Tulsi Gabbard, and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBiden warned about the ramifications of Sanders winning the nomination in an interview on Monday with CBS News political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns, saying a ticket led by Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, could jeopardize Democrats running for the House and Senate. There's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist, Biden said. Imagine here in Texas or in North Carolina or in Georgia, the idea, if I said to you, 'This is an open test. You're running for office. Do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream Democrat running at the top of the ticket?' My guess is in most states, they'd say no. The former vice president suggested his flurry of endorsements, including from Democrats in battleground states, stems from the realization that the success of other candidates could hinge on the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. It's not going to be enough just to beat Donald Trump. We have to win back the Senate, we have to keep the House, he said. Whether they're right or not, those people who are running for those offices think that Bernie was not likely to help them, but hurt them in their pursuit of their Senate or their House seat or their governor's seat.\n\n*CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson contributed to this report\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nAs opposing candidates are dropping from the race, CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says Warren is focusing on telling voters what she'd do in office. Ahead of a Los Angeles speech Monday night, the Massachusetts senator released a pair of plans, one that includes a $400 billion stimulus package to head off the potential economic impact of coronavirus and another to improve conditions for farm and food chain industry employees. At the start of January, Warren had released a plan on preventing, containing and treating infectious disease in light of the spread of coronavirus. This new plan echoes her speech in Houston Saturday, where she argued she is better suited to take on coronavirus then Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg. It says she would make certain uninsured Americans can get free care and evaluation for the virus, and that she would create an emergency paid leave program so that anyone with the CDC's outlined symptoms can be paid for time in quarantine. Warren's farmworkers rights plan specifies that she would include farmworkers in her push for a $15 minimum wage as well as replace the H2-A agricultural guest worker visa program with an immigrant worker visa that has full labor protections built in. Like her coronavirus economic plan, this one repeatedly references previous proposals and how they will work off of her new ones.\n\nLIFE AFTER 2020\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR\n\nKlobuchar is suspending her presidential campaign and plans to endorse Biden at a rally in Dallas on Monday night, a campaign spokesman told CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, just hours before voters in 14 states go to the polls on Super Tuesday. While the Minnesota Democrat often boasted about kicking off her campaign in the middle of a blizzard, the end of her run was marked by a storm of frustrations and stalled momentum. Aides and allies told CBS News they took solace that her campaign performed better and lasted longer than many had initially expected. Over the course of the campaign, Klobuchar was quick to admit she did not have the name recognition or financial resources enjoyed by some of her rivals. Besides hitting the trail, her prospects hinged on her performance in the primary debates, which were crucial for introducing herself to a national audience and raising money. Klobuchar positioned herself as a moderate Midwesterner who could unite the party, casting doubt on the feasibility of progressive policy proposals like free college tuition and Medicare for All put forward by Sanders. She also largely steered clear of criticizing Biden, given the similarity in their views. Armed with her neighborly appeal, Klobuchar bet that a strong finish in the Iowa caucuses would catapult her candidacy into the top tier. She set out to visit all of the state's 99 counties, a feat she accomplished just before the weeks-long Senate impeachment trial trapped her on Capitol Hill. She came in fifth place in Iowa, signaling that voters in that state did not agree with her proposition that a Midwest moderate was best suited to win back the heartland. In what would prove to be the high water mark of her bid, Klobuchar managed to bounce back with a strong showing at debate in New Hampshire just days before the Granite State's primary. She came in third, ahead of Warren, a surprising finish that allowed her to continue on to Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThere were indications earlier Monday that Klobuchar's bid was coming to an end. After an event in Salt Lake City, Utah, the campaign held reporters for over two hours, with the lights turned off and no staff in sight. As late as Monday morning, a senior adviser said they had received no official word of her exiting the race but declined to elaborate. Multiple aides said they had expected her to remain in the race through Super Tuesday. The senator broke the news to her staff shortly after 1 p.m. ET on a conference call from Salt Lake City on Monday, two campaign officials told CBS News. Klobuchar thanked her team for their work on the wild ride of the campaign, telling staff that she was proud of the operation they built. She also acknowledged that the outcome was not what they wished, but that she felt it was right to consolidate support around Biden. The call lasted around 20 minutes, and Klobuchar and staff members were sad and a bit shell-shocked. One longtime Klobuchar ally told the initial plan to remain in the race through Super Tuesday was becoming untenable as polls showed her coming in behind Sanders in her own state of Minnesota, reports CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. The feeling in the campaign really starting to change last week, this person said.\n\nMONEY MATTERS\n\nON THE $$$\n\nICYMI over the weekend, Sanders' campaign announced Sunday it raised $46.5 million in February, the most of any Democratic presidential candidate in a given month in the 2020 election cycle. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says the figure shatters the previous monthly record of $25 million, set by the Sanders campaign in January. According to the campaign, the cash haul came from more than 2.2 million donations, including contributions from more than 350,000 donors who were giving to the campaign for the first time. The Vermont senator's fundraising efforts were fueled by victories in the early primary states of New Hampshire and Nevada, and a first-place finish in the popular vote in Iowa. The campaign said 99.9% of Sanders' donors have not reached the federal limit on individual contributions, meaning they can give again. The average donation in February was $21. Warren also announced her February fundraising numbers on Sunday, saying she pulled in $29 million, a record for her campaign. Her cash haul included $2.8 million on the day of Warren's well-received debate performance in Nevada on February 19. According to Warren campaign manager Roger Lau, 250,000 people donated for the first time in February, bringing the campaign's total number of donors since its launch to more than 1.25 million. The average February donation was $31. Read more here on how the candidate plans to use some of that cash.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA\n\nAfter months of carrying a double-digit poll lead—that dramatically winnowed in the days leading up to the South Carolina Democratic primary—Biden won the state's primary contest with 48.7% on Saturday. Gaining 39 delegates in the first in the South primary state, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says Biden received more than double the amount of delegates on Saturday night than he had in the first three early state contests combined. The CBS News South Carolina exit poll show that Biden dominated in almost every category of South Carolina voters—coming up short only among non-college educated white men, people who never attend religious services and younger voters. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders edged out victories among voters ages 17-44 but came up short among black voters ages 30-44. According to the South Carolina Democratic Party, more than 600 campaign stops were made by the candidates throughout the cycle and a CBS News analysis shows that combined the candidates spent at least 145 days over 75 visits in the state. Amid reports that Republicans were being encouraged to participate in the open Democratic primary, exit polls showed only 5% of those who voted usually thought of themselves as a Republican. The SCDP reported record-breaking voter turnout with 539,020 South Carolina Democrats and Independents voting in Saturday's contest. This number smashed the 2008 Democratic primary record by nearly 7,000 votes but the total turnout percentage was just 16.33%, compared to the 23% of registered voters who turned out in the 2008 primary, where then-Senator Barack Obama won the contest with 55.4% of the vote.\n\nAs predicted by early absentee ballot returns, more women (59%) voted than men and black voters comprised nearly 60% of those who voted. Among black voters, 61% voted for Biden with Sanders coming in in second with only 17%. Health care ranked as the top issue for South Carolina voters and, while it was important for voters that the Democratic party nominate a candidate who agreed with them on major issues, more than half of those who voted said they would rather see the party nominate a candidate who could beat President Trump. Biden won in every geographical region of the state—from the more conservative upstate down to the more liberal Low Country. More voters who live in small cities and rural areas came out than those in larger cities (population 50,000+) and the suburbs — and population areas that Biden won. Tom Steyer, who had seen a notable rise in polls in recent months, ultimately came up short, receiving 59,917 votes, which was 11% of the overall vote. After having invested heavily in the state spending more than $20 million in ads, Steyer did not reach the 15% threshold to receive any delegates and dropped out of the race Saturday evening. During an emotional speech that was interrupted with cheers of we love you, Tom! from supporters, Steyer said that he would still be fighting for South Carolinians. When the Lord closes a door, he opens a window. I will climb through that window and crawl through it with you, he said.\n\nTEXAS\n\nThe second-biggest delegate prize on Super Tuesday is Texas, which will award 228 pledged national delegates, according to CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Democrats have ramped up their efforts in the days leading up to the primary, hoping to score points in the delegate-rich state. A CBS News Battleground Tracker poll released on Sunday showed Sanders with the lead in Texas, with 30% of likely primary voters saying he was their top choice. Biden was in second (26%), followed by Warren (17%) and Bloomberg (13%). The poll, taken February 27-29, had a margin of error of +/- 6.2%. Candidates need 15% support statewide or in Senate districts to win delegates. Sanders, who has led the most recent Texas polls, spent the weekend of the Nevada caucuses crisscrossing Texas. Thousands of supporters attended his rallies in El Paso, San Antonio, Houston and Austin, where he repeatedly said he would win Texas' primary. On television, they say you know Texas is a conservative state, it's a red state. I don't believe it for a minute, Sanders said at his Houston rally. If our people stand together, come out to vote, we're going to win here in Texas. Sanders' five public events in 2020 trailed only Bloomberg for public events held in the state in this calendar year. With the exception of Bloomberg, Sanders has also outspent all of his other Democratic competitors on the airwaves in Texas, dropping almost $5 million on advertisements, according to Kantar/CMAG data. Part of Sanders' polling strength has been his standing with Latino voters. A Univision poll released on Friday showed Sanders was leading with 31% support from Latino voters, followed by Bloomberg (23%), Biden (19%) and Warren (8%). The poll, taken February 21-26, had a margin of error of +/- 5.5%.\n\nBiden, who had a huge lead in Texas polls until the calendar turned to 2020, spent his final day before Super Tuesday holding rallies in Houston and Dallas, hoping to capitalize on momentum from his strong finish in South Carolina. Biden's evening event in Dallas is set to feature endorsements from Klobuchar and Buttigieg, who have suspended their campaigns. That could give his campaign a final jolt before voting tomorrow. Recent polling has shown that Buttigieg and Klobuchar combined for 8% to 12% of the vote in Texas. In an interview on Monday with CBS News political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns, Biden echoed concerns from some of his high profile Texas congressional endorsers about Sanders' possible effect on down ballot races. There's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist, Biden said in the interview with CBS News in Houston. Imagine here in Texas or in North Carolina or in Georgia, the idea, if I said to you, 'This is an open test. You're running for office. Do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream Democrat running at the top of the ticket?' My guess is in most states, they'd say no.\n\nNobody has spent more money or poured more resources into Texas than Bloomberg. He has more than 180 staffers on the ground in Texas and 19 offices around the state, giving him an unrivaled ground game form a sheer paid staff perspective. Bloomberg has blanketed the Texas airwaves by spending more than $47 million of advertisements. He has also held 13 public events in the state, more than his rivals, even though he jumped into the race last. We want to come in number one, said Bloomberg's Texas State Director Ashlea Graves Turner. We've built the biggest infrastructure that Texas has ever seen for a statewide candidate, especially a presidential candidate. In the closing days, Bloomberg made trips to Houston and San Antonio, where part of his pitch included his ability to handle crises like coronavirus.\n\nWarren's campaign has been on the ground in Texas the longest of the campaigns remaining and has dozens of staffers spread around the state. Warren made two trips to Texas in the final week before Super Tuesday with rallies in San Antonio on Thursday and Houston on Saturday. In Houston, she acknowledged her campaign's struggles in the early states, but said she believes it can turn around. I'll be the first to say that the first four contests haven't gone exactly as I'd hoped, Warren said. But Super Tuesday is three days away and we're looking forward to gaining as many delegates to the convention as we can — from California to right here in Texas. Her high-profile Texas endorsers, former Obama Housing Secretary Julián Castro and Congressman Joaquin Castro, campaigned around the state for her on the final weekend before the primary. While Warren's campaign has spent about $900,000 on advertising in Texas, the Persist PAC, which supports her, has spent more than $2.6 million.\n\nGabbard is also in Texas on Monday for an event in Austin.\n\nA key wrinkle in all of this: Just over 1 million people voted early or by mail in the Democratic primary, according to the Texas Secretary of State's website. Early voting ended last Friday and mailed ballots need to be counted. The Texas Secretary of State's office says those voters are not able to change their votes, even if a candidate has dropped out of the race. The turnout for Democrats in Texas' 15 most populated counties has eclipsed turnout in 2016's Democratic primary, but has not matched the record numbers from the 2008 Democratic primary.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nAs of Monday evening, more than 3.5 million in California have already returned their ballots. Election and data experts in the state expect total turnout this year to be close to 50%, which would mean around 10 million total votes.\n\nVoters who have cast early ballots for candidates no longer in the race are not allowed to change their ballots. According to Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc., more than 500,000 votes were cast for candidates no longer in the race since early voting began on February 3. This would be about 5% of the total eventual turnout in the state.\n\n\n\nAnother group to keep an eye on are the so called perfect voters — the ones who have participated in the last five elections but are not turning in their ballots as fast. Mitchell's data shows that so far, only about 40% of those perfect voters have turned in their ballots. In 2016 and 2008, more than 9 in 10 of these voters participated and this year, Mitchell expects turnout among this group to be just as high.\n\n\n\nThere is a segment of Democratic perfect voters, voters that have voted five of the last five elections that are not turning in their ballots as fast. And we know those people are going to vote. They voted five of the last five elections, Mitchell said. They voted in the 2014 primary and the general, which were the lowest turnout elections we've had in forever and they still haven't voted. Well, it's not because they said 'I just don't care anymore,' it's because they're waiting to see what happens in probably South Carolina. I expect those people to turnout.\n\n\n\nIn the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, only 9% said the results out of South Carolina will be a major factor in their decision, compared to the nearly 40% who said what happened in South Carolina will have no impact on their vote.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nIn addition to the presidential primaries on Super Tuesday, 120 congressional districts will also be holding primaries on Super Tuesday, and about three-quarters of these are in the delegate-rich states of Texas and California. Here's some interesting House races to watch on Tuesday via CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro:
President Trump announced Friday evening that U.S. troops had been sent to Gabon to protect U.S. assets in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is awaiting the first results of its presidential election.\n\nMr. Trump wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Friday that around 80 personnel had been deployed to the capital of Gabon, which borders Congo, to be in position to support the security of United States citizens, personnel, and diplomatic facilities in Congo's capital.\n\nThis deployment of approximately 80 personnel is in response to the possibility that violent demonstrations may occur in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in reaction to the December 30, 2018, elections there, Mr. Trump wrote, adding that the first of the American forces had arrived on January 2.\n\nThese deployed personnel will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes such that their presence is no longer needed, he added.\n\nThe country's Catholic church has warned about a popular uprising if false election results are announced, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA polling official counts votes in a school in Kinshasa on December 30, 2018, during Democratic Republic of Congo's general elections. Luis Tato/AFP/Getty Images\n\nElection observers in Congo have raised concerns about potential voting irregularities in the race to replace longtime President Joseph Kabila. The U.S. has increased sanctions on people close to Kabila during the Trump administration in an effort to persuade the Congolese president to act more democratically. The U.S. has also threatened sanctions against those who undermine the democratic process in the election, according to The Associated Press.\n\nMr. Trump's announcement regarding U.S. troops indicates the U.S. is concerned with the safety of American officials and facilities in Congo, not with the electoral situation itself.\n\nThis action was taken consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct United States foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, Mr. Trump wrote.
At the launch of tax season, a coalition of consumer groups is issuing a sobering warning to taxpayers: Hot dog vendors and hair stylists are regulated more strictly than paid tax preparers in many states. That can allow preparers to charge exorbitant fees for inaccurate -- even fraudulent -- returns that can ultimately cost consumers thousands of dollars.\n\nErrors on tax forms put consumers at risk of fines and lost refunds, yet few states have taken action to ensure that paid tax preparers are licensed, trained and disclose what are often high and unpredictable fees, said Tom Feltner, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement.\n\nIndeed, studies of tax return accuracy have shown an astounding number of errors. A 2014 mystery shopper test by the Government Accountability Office found that only 11 percent of the returns studied were accurate. A 2015 study by the National Consumer Law Center uncovered errors in 93 percent of the returns reviewed.\n\nCalling for increased state regulation of the industry, representatives of 10 consumer groups said Wednesday that a survey of more than 1,000 adults found widespread support for licensing, testing and uniform disclosures in the tax preparation industry.\n\nOnly four states -- California, Oregon, Maryland and New York -- require tax preparers to be licensed and tested for a basic level of competence. However, the consumer groups found in a new poll that eight in 10 consumers support requiring tax preparers to be licensed and able to pass a test indicating that they have the knowledge and training to complete returns accurately. Nearly one in nine thought tax preparers ought to disclose their fees upfront, instead of revealing them after the fact, which is all too common in the industry.\n\nIt's not surprising that American consumers have the common sense to know that tax preparers should be held to some standards -- what's surprising is that Congress has not come to the same conclusion, said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nIn the absence of federal legislation, the consumer groups said that states should act.\n\nState legislatures have the authority to implement common sense protections for taxpayers, said Michael Best, senior policy advocate with the Consumer Federation of America. The coalition is urging state legislatures to pass a model law drawn up by the National Consumer Law Center that requires up-front fee disclosures, licensing, testing and continuing education for paid preparers.\n\nBut for this tax season, at least, consumers are on their own. How can you protect yourself from an incompetent or dishonest preparer?\n\nFirst, know that while few states require licensing, any preparer that has the title of enrolled agent, certified public accountant or that is also a tax attorney must conform with standards set up by their professional organizations, which already demand licensing, testing and continuing education. Ask if your preparer has one of these professional designations and inquire about his or her fees -- both how they're calculated and for an estimate of what your return will cost.\n\nCan't afford a highly trained professional? Anyone earning less than $62,000 in 2015 can have their federal return prepared for free online via the Internal Revenue Service's Free File Alliance. State returns can also often be completed online for free at your state taxing authority's website. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs will also provide free in-person preparation for poor and elderly individuals. You can find VITA and TCE programs on the IRS website by plugging in your zip code.\n\nIn absence of state regulation, don't assume that anyone who hangs out a shingle offering tax preparation can be trusted, the consumer groups warn. Consumers, not their paid preparers, are on the hook for the accuracy of their tax returns. And the penalty for mistakes can be severe. If you claim the Earned Income Tax Credit when you're not eligible, for instance, you can lose the right to claim that credit for up to 10 years.\n\nYou wouldn't give your Social Security number to your stylist or your bank account information to a hot dog vendor, said Ali Mickelson, director of tax and legislative policy for the Colorado Fiscal Institute. Yet these people are more regulated than tax preparers who are entrusted with your most sensitive financial information.\n\nAdded Linda Sherry, national priorities director for Consumer Action: The thought that consumers pay good money for bad advice is appalling. New consumer protections must be adopted to ensure that taxpayers can rely on the advice they are paying for.
About five years ago, Chicago resident Paul Nickerson turned to a trio of cats to deal with a rodent infestation after higher-tech pest-control methods failed. He figured he had nothing to lose.\n\nIt got to the point where my neighbors and I couldn't walk out of our back doors to throw the garbage out at night because rats would be running over our feet, Nickerson said.\n\nThe cats came from a Tree House Humane Society program that places animals that aren't suited for life as house pets in places where their native talents as hunters are needed, such as warehouses and breweries.\n\nIn Nickerson's case, the field of battle was his two-car garage, where he also stores beekeeping equipment and other gear. His feline team was led by a calico female he named Kevorkian -- The Angel of Death, in reference to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the late champion of assisted suicide.\n\nFor about a year, I'd see a dead rat probably on a daily basis, said Nickerson, adding that the rats are now gone. In fact, he was so taken with his cats that he eventually joined Tree House and now runs the shelter's Cats at Work program.\n\nAccording to Nickerson, the cost for three working cats, which is a typical order, is $650, which includes the cost of spaying and neutering and equipment such as a heated pad. Clients must agree to feed and provide medical care for the animals. They also need to pass a screening process.\n\nOther shelters around the country have similar programs.\n\nAbout 100 otherwise unadoptable cats from Philadelphia have found new homes in barns and stables over the past year, according to Ame Dorminy, of ACCT Philadephia, an animal rescue group. Some working cats even warmed up to humans once they got situated in their new homes, she said.\n\nFeline mouse eradication specialists are on the job at the Southern California Flower Market, the country's largest, in Los Angeles. The Arizona Humane Society has a waiting list for working cats, according to spokeswoman Bretta Nelson. Minnesota businessman Jim Trenter is such a fan of the program that he's planning to get a new feline to patrol his grass seed business after someone catnapped his Fritz, a working cat he adopted last March.\n\nBeyond helping people deal with vermin, shelters put cats to work to generate revenue, which helps ease the burden of caring for the 6 million to 8 million unwanted pets that wind up in their care every year. According to Dorminy, working cats take up space that could go to cats who have a better chance of being adopted.\n\nAnytime we can move a cat fast, it saves us money, she said.\n\nThe felines also appeal to people leery about using rat poisons favored by professional exterminators, which charge between $200 and $2,000 to handle a rodent infestation depending on the size of the property and damage involved, according to HomeAdvisor.\n\nWorking cat programs are popping up all over the place, said Katie Lisnik, director of cat protection and policy at The Humane Society of the U.S. Perhaps if the shelter is crowded or the cat is near another cat, and they get sick, then you have medical concerns -- veterinary visits, medications -- all of that.\n\nAccording to the Humane Society, animal control organizations spend as much as $1 billion annually to combat such problems. In some regions, two-thirds of the animals in shelters are cats, and roughly 70 percent of them are euthanized.\n\nThe cats that shelters draft as workers are often closer to the kind of feline that has long patrolled barns and lived outside than the sort of cossetted cuties that are daily fodder for YouTube.\n\nMany are feral and afraid of humans, or at least indifferent toward them. Nickerson said Kevorkian and her associates Morticia, a gray-and-white longhair female, and Eberkanisis, an orange-and-white female, remain leery of him.\n\nFor the first couple of years, they would not even stay in the garage with me, he said. They were deathly afraid of me. They're not like a house cat where you can sit there and pet them all day.They have a threshold where they get overstimulated. So you can only pet them a couple of times, and then they let me know that I have overstepped my welcome.
Facebook expands rules on deepfakes but falls short of total ban Facebook's vice president for global policy management Monika Bickert testified about Facebook's policies and freedom of speech in front of a House committee Wednesday. Earlier this week the company rolled out new rules against deepfake videos. Jennifer Grygiel, assistant professor of communication at Syracuse University, joins CBSN's Red & Blue to discuss.
NEW ORLEANS -- A former New Orleans Saints cheerleader has filed a discrimination complaint against the NFL team with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Bailey Davis' case was detailed in a New York Times article on Sunday. It says she was fired after posting a photo of herself to her private Instagram account. It showed her in an outfit that the Saints said violated team rules against its cheerleaders appearing nude, seminude or in lingerie.\n\nThe Times also says the team was looking into whether she attended a party attended by Saints players -- a rule violation Davis denies.\n\nDavis' EEOC complaint states the team has two sets of rules: one for the cheerleaders, who are all women; another, for the players.\n\nThe New York Times report said the Saints anti-fraternization policy requires cheerleaders to avoid contact with players, in person or online, even though players are not penalized for pursuing such engagement with cheerleaders. The cheerleaders must block players from following them on social media and cannot post photos of themselves in Saints gear. The same rules don't apply to players, the report said.\n\nIf the cheerleaders can't contact the players, then the players shouldn't be able to contact the cheerleaders, said Sara Blackwell, Davis's lawyer. The antiquated stereotype of women needing to hide for their own protection is not permitted in America and certainly not in the workplace.\n\nWe want equality, Blackwell said, CBS New Orleans affiliate WWL-TV reports. The NFL owners are meeting right now in Orlando and we want it to be on their agenda to look at these antiquated, very old time, not American discriminatory rules and just make them equal. Treat women how they should be treated in 2018.\n\nWWL-TV reports that outside legal counsel for the New Orleans Saints released the following statement: The New Orleans Saints is an equal opportunity employer, and it denies that Ms. Davis was discriminated against because she is female. The Saints will defend these allegations in due course, and the Organization is confident that its policies and workplace rules will withstand legal scrutiny.
A campaign that started more than two years ago and featured more than 2,200 candidate events is down to its final weekend in Iowa. On Monday night, Iowa will officially kick off the presidential nominating process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nThere has been a clear top tier of Democratic hopefuls in Iowa since the early fall: former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Two of those candidates, Sanders and Warren, have been stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial the past two weeks, while Biden and Buttigieg have been able to camp out in the state. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has also been in Washington for impeachment, has been working to break into that top tier for several months.\n\nAll the major candidates are blanketing the state this weekend and making their closing arguments to fire up supporters and try to win over some of the voters still trying to make up their minds.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTHE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES' CLOSING IOWA ARGUMENTS\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nBernie Sanders has seen a boost in support in the weeks leading up to the caucuses and sat atop many of the polls that have come out in January. While he has been one of the candidates stuck in Washington, his campaign has flooded the state with high level surrogates like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, filmmaker Michael Moore, and Sanders' wife, Dr. Jane Sanders. The Vermont senator has spent some of his final days in Iowa stressing that his political revolution can begin here.\n\nThe entire world will be watching...to see if people of this state are prepared to fight back, Sanders said in Storm Lake on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte. He has also emphasized that the Democratic establishment is worried about the strength of his movement. We are their worst nightmare! This is their 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' Sanders said in Sioux City on Sunday, Korte reports.\n\nIf Sanders is successful on Monday night it will show that caucus-goers back his message of changing the system and believe he will fight for issues that matter to working class Americans. The campaign also has an aggressive ground game in Iowa, one that includes hundreds of staffers and volunteers spread across the state looking to turn out his fervent supporters and first-time caucus-goers. Although it is a comparatively small demographic in the state, the campaign's outreach with Latino voters in the state could also prove to be essential come Caucus Night.\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nJoe Biden has spent months making the case to Iowans, in person and in advertisements, that he's best suited to take on President Trump in a general election and restore the soul of the nation. In the days leading up to the caucuses, advertisements have emphasized Biden's poll numbers against Trump and stressed that this is no time to take a risk. We need our strongest candidate.\n\nBiden has repeatedly said the values that uphold American democracy are on the line and he's in the strongest position to restore them.\n\nCharacter is on the ballot, Biden said in Waukee on Thursday in a speech aimed at President Trump, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. Does it matter if a president lies? Does it matter if a president has no moral compass? Does it matter if a president believes they're above the law? Does it matter if a president is petty? Mean? Cruel? Spiteful? Does the character of a president matter? I believe the answer to each and every one of those questions is yes.\n\nBiden has also highlighted his ability to withstand a barrage of attacks from Republicans, especially after some have questioned whether it was appropriate for his son Hunter to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. They have thrown everything but the kitchen sink so far, Biden said in Iowa City on Monday. And I'm just gonna say it...I'm still standing and just getting stronger. Biden also ramped up his visits to Iowa in December and January while focusing more time on smaller and mid-sized communities.\n\nIf Biden is successful on Monday night, his campaign will argue that voters believe he has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump. While many important issues come up in conversations with Iowans, polls suggest caucus-goers are more concerned about finding an electable candidate. The Biden campaign hopes those Iowans will turn out for the former vice president.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\n\nPete Buttigieg's argument is that he has the ability to unite the country and appeal to moderate voters, including future former Republicans. Buttgieg, the other top candidate who has been free to roam Iowa during impeachment, has made final trips to some of the counties that voted twice for President Obama before switching to Mr. Trump, and the campaign has emphasized their organizing strength in Iowa's pivot counties.\n\nThe Midwestern former mayor has argued that it will take nominating someone from outside Washington for Democrats to win in November. He also has pushed back against criticism that he lacks the experience to be president. And in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg began to draw finer distinctions between himself and some of his top rivals.\n\nI hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said in Decorah on Thursday, according to CBS News Reporter Jack Turman. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.\n\nAt another stop, Turman reports, Buttigieg again went after Biden and Sanders. He framed Sanders' vision as a revolution where nothing counts unless you go all the way. Buttigieg took on two of Sanders' signature policy proposals: Medicare for All, the ambitious and expensive plan for the government to provide health care to all Americans, and free public college.\n\nIf Buttigieg prevails on Monday, it will show there's a desire among some voters for a more moderate message carried by a new voice. The campaign's focus on rural areas and swing counties, combined with aggressive campaign schedule in the final few days, will give many Iowans one more chance to hear from him before making up their minds. He also built an extensive field operation, with 34 offices placed around the state.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nElizabeth Warren, who has also been tied up with the impeachment trial, has sent a flood of surrogates to the state, including former Democratic rival Julian Castro. She built up an early operation in Iowa, but has seen poll numbers dip since the fall. At events in Iowa last weekend, Warren addressed the electability argument head on and stressed that she believes Democrats need to nominate a woman to beat Mr. Trump.\n\nWe now know that women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since Donald Trump was elected, Warren said in Davenport on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak. Warren also reintroduced her argument, which she frequently made over the summer, that she's a fighter who can defeat Mr. Trump and deliver progressive victories in Washington.\n\nWe have to decide whether to give into the fear or whether to fight back, Warren said on Saturday in Muscatine. Me, I'm fighting back. That's why I'm in this.\n\nIf Warren is successful on Caucus Night, it will be partly due to her organizing strength in the state. Her team built a large operation early in the process and deployed organizers around the state before many campaigns built out their Iowa infrastructure. Her broad range of policy proposals has resonated with voters around the state, even if they don't agree with all of her views.\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR\n\nAmy Klobuchar has pitched herself as a candidate with a strong electoral record and Midwestern roots. At nearly every event she has told people that she has won every race, every place, every time and talks about the surge she sees in Iowa in polls and her endorsements.\n\nShe has emphasized that she believes the election is a decency check on Mr. Trump and in order to send a strong message, Democrats need to win big. Last thing that I will say is just that we want to win, Klobuchar said in Waterloo on Sunday. And my profound advice to you is we'd better not screw this up. And we better put someone at the top of the ticket, and this is my piece for me, someone at the top of the ticket that has the record of bringing people with her and winning big.\n\nWhile she's been in Washington for the impeachment trial, her family members and local legislative endorsers have held events on her behalf. Klobuchar has also urged supporters to help push her into the top tier while she's busy with the impeachment trial by volunteering for her campaign. And she's told undecided Iowans to call friends and family in Minnesota for a performance review.\n\nIf Klobuchar is successful on Monday, it will likely be because her decision to tour every corner of the state, her focus on pursuing more moderate policies, and her message of uniting the country at a time of deep partisan division. She has campaigned relentlessly, holding more events than any other candidate in the top tier, and her campaign believes they'll see an advantage in rural areas because they visited every one of Iowa's 99 counties.\n\nANDREW YANG\n\nAndrew Yang is approaching the end of a of a 17-day swing across Iowa. Yang has been campaigning on a message that a changing economy requires a different perspective in Washington to ensure Americans aren't left behind. He's promised that a win in Iowa will also mean a victory in New Hampshire.\n\nTOM STEYER\n\nTom Steyer has presented himself as the unconventional politician who can go head-to-head with President Trump on the economy. Steyer also points to his work building grassroots coalitions and reminds Iowans at nearly every town hall that he's the only candidate who will make tackling climate change his number one priority.\n\nUP FOR DEBATE\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is switching the qualifications for candidates to participate in the Nevada Democratic presidential primary debate, including eliminating the unique donor threshold, which paves the way for Mike Bloomberg to potentially qualify for future presidential debates.\n\nTo make the debate stage in Las Vegas on February 19, CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says candidates need to meet either a new polling threshold or received pledged delegates. Presidential hopefuls must receive either 10% in four state or national polls or 12% in two state polls out of either Nevada or South Carolina from a list released by the DNC. Those polls must be released between February 15 and 11:59 p.m. ET on February 18.\n\nAlternatively, candidates can qualify based on pledged delegates. Those delegates will be awarded based on the results of the Iowa caucuses on February 3 as calculated and reported by the Iowa Democratic Party or the New Hampshire primary on February 11 as calculated and reported by the Associated Press.\n\nBased on a CBS News analysis, only three candidates are currently qualified to participate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All candidates have until February 18 to qualify.\n\nFor the first time, there is no unique donor threshold to help candidates qualify for the debate. This could benefit billionaire Mike Bloomberg who has said he would not seek donations for his presidential bid. The requirement has kept him off the debate stage in the past. He has not yet reached the polling threshold but has ticked up in support in polls released in recent weeks.\n\nWe are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together, Bloomberg's campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. Mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect.

It's the timing that caught his attention. According to a New York Times report, in early May last year, President Trump told Bolton to call the Ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had just won the presidency, in order to ensure that he'd meet with the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nJust about an hour and twenty minutes before the Senate voted not to call witnesses, including Bolton, Biden told the crowd that he was in the race in May, and according to the transcript, the president instructed Bolton to go to the Ukrainians and try to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. (h/t CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro). The former vice president was likely referring to the fact that it's Giuliani who has been alleging and investigating, on Mr. Trump's behalf, corruption allegations of Joe and Hunter Biden related to Ukraine. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of either Biden has surfaced.\n\nEarlier this week, the Times reported that Bolton had written in his book draft that the president had told him in August that he wanted to continue the pause in military aid to Ukraine until officials helped with investigations into Democrats including Biden.\n\nBiden declared he was running for president on April 25, days before the meeting described by Bolton.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nNEVADA\n\nCory Booker's former supporters are picking new favorites in Nevada this week, among the new endorsements rolled out Friday by the Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden campaigns. Included are two women of color in the state: state Assemblywoman Selena Torres, now backing Biden, and Reno-Sparks NAACP President Patricia Gallimore, now behind Warren. CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin says a quarter of the Nevada's Democratic electorate is estimated to be women of color, with 22% of likely caucus-goers in the demographic still undecided in a recent poll by advocacy group She the People in the state. Biden and Bernie Sanders virtually tied for the lead in the survey, with only Warren (10%) and Tom Steyer (14%) also clearing double digits.\n\nMONEY MATTERS\n\nSPENDING SPREE\n\nFormer New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg filed his fourth-quarter FEC report. Although he was late entering the Democratic field, launching at the end of November, his campaign spent nearly $188 million, including over $140 million dollars on television and digital advertising says CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry.\n\nOur first month's filing represents a down payment and commitment in all 50 states to defeat Donald Trump, and it shows we have the resources and plan necessary to take him on, Bloomberg 2020 Campaign Manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement released by the campaign.\n\nOther expenses include $14 million in payments to his private company Bloomberg LP. A campaign aide tells CBS News that these expenses include air travel, as Mayor Bloomberg travels on a plane owned by Bloomberg LP and it also includes personnel costs, for employees who switched over to Bloomberg's presidential campaign. Hawkfish LLC, a tech start-up launched by Bloomberg also received $12 million for its advertising work for the campaign. The campaign also disclosed $679,000 in spending for some campaign staffers living in New York City, the location of the campaign headquarters. Housing and furniture were offered to some staffers who relocated to the city, regardless of seniority. The campaign listed the merchandise it sold as other receipts, saying that the products were union-made in the USA, and priced at cost.
In 2007, U.S. commandos watched as a convoy carrying a powerful Iranian military leader made its way to northern Iraq. It was a prime opportunity to take out Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who had been accused of aiding Shiite forces that killed thousands of American troops in Iraq.\n\nBut ultimately, military leaders passed on a strike, deferring to deep concerns about the potential fallout of such a provocative attack.\n\nTo avoid a firefight, and the contentious politics that would follow, I decided that we should monitor the caravan, not strike immediately, retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal wrote last year in Foreign Policy.\n\nFears about the repercussions and reverberations of a targeted killing of Soleimani persisted throughout the administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama according to officials who served under both. Soleimani, they calculated, was just as dangerous dead and martyred as he was alive and plotting against Americans.\n\nThat approach came to an end this week when President Donald Trump authorized an airstrike that killed Soleimani.\n\nA burning vehicle at the Baghdad International Airport following an airstrike in Baghdad, Iraq, early Friday, January 3, 2020. Iraqi Prime Minister Press Office via AP\n\nBut some former administration officials argued that despite Soleimani's role in orchestrating deadly attacks on U.S. troops, Mr. Trump's decision may ultimately put Americans in the region at heightened risk.\n\nPrevious presidents have had the opportunity to take measures like what we saw last night but have held back because of the risks entailed and the questions that were there about where this would all lead, said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense during the Obama administration. Unfortunately, those questions are not any clearer today.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump's strike against Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, thrusts Washington and Tehran into uncharted territory after months of rising tensions. It's unclear how or when Iran will respond, or whether that response will pull the U.S. deeper into a military conflict abroad.\n\nJoint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said officials were well aware of the prospect of retaliation, but believed the risk of inaction exceeded the risk of action.\n\nPrevious administrations weighed concerns about Iranian retaliation as they monitored Soleimani, who kept a low profile and traveled only to countries like Iraq where the Quds Force already had strong security. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan and former CIA analyst who tracked Soleimani's activities, said there was a simple question that prevented both the Bush and Obama administrations from targeting the Iranian leader.\n\nWas the strike worth the likely retaliation and the potential to pull us into a protracted conflict? Slotkin said. The two administrations I worked for both determined that the ultimate ends didn't justify the means.\n\nFormer Obama administration officials told The Associated Press discussions about taking out Soleimani never reached an operational phase. Beyond the risk of escalation with Iran, officials said they were uncertain that taking the Quds leader off the battlefield would have any impact on Tehran's regional aggression or support for terror groups.\n\nThe Obama administration also worried that killing Soleimani would undercut diplomatic efforts to forge a nuclear deal with Iran, according to one official, The AP reports. The U.S. and five other nations signed a nuclear accord with Tehran in 2015, but Mr. Trump withdrew from the pact after taking office. The officials insisted on anonymity in order to discuss internal national security deliberations.\n\nThe operation that killed Soleimani early Friday was set in motion after an American defense contractor was killed in late December in Kirkuk in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, CBS News national security correspondent David Martin reported.\n\nThe attack on the base which killed an American was carried out by an Iranian-backed militia which is directly controlled, according to U.S. intelligence, by Soleimani, Martin reported. So that is what got this going.\n\nThe U.S. military was simultaneously picking up intelligence in which Soleimani was talking about a big action, according to Martin. He was traveling around the Middle East in what U.S. intelligence believed were a final series of briefings with local militias before this so-called 'big action' was put into play.\n\nHe was in Syria then went to Lebanon and flew to Iraq. When he landed at Baghdad airport there were two Reaper drones circling overhead, Martin said. Soleimani got into one vehicle while others in his party got into another vehicle. They then took off down the airport road, which is when the drones fired two missiles at each vehicle and scored direct hits, Martin said.\n\nYou have these relatively small explosions … setting off what promises to be a real earthquake in the Middle East, Martin said.
Americans not buying as many cars and more Mo...\n\nBOSTON-- Ride-hailing companies catering exclusively to women are cropping up and raising thorny legal questions, namely: Are they discriminatory?\n\nIn Massachusetts, Chariot for Women is promising to launch a service featuring female drivers picking up only women and children. Drivers will even have to say a safe word before a ride starts.\n\nMichael Pelletz, a former Uber driver, said he started the company with his wife, Kelly, in response to instances of drivers for ride-hailing services charged with assaulting female passengers.\n\nHe believes their business plan is legal, and he's prepared to make his case in court, if it comes to that. The couple had planned an April 19 launch but now say they're pushing it back to the summer to make sure their app can handle demand they say has exceeded expectations.\n\nWe believe that giving women and their loved ones peace of mind is not only a public policy imperative, but serves an essential social interest, Pelletz said. Our service is intended to protect these fundamental liberties.\n\nIn New York City, the owners of SheRides are also promising a reboot this summer.\n\nFernando Mateo, who co-founded the company with his wife, Stella, said the company put the brakes on its planned launch in 2014 after spending tens of thousands on legal fees as activists and male drivers threatened to sue. The company settled one challenge, he said.\n\nWe were accused of all sorts of things, Mateo said. So we went back to the drawing board.\n\nWhen the company re-launches as SheHails, men will be permitted as drivers and passengers. It will be left to female drivers to accept male passengers, and for female passengers to accept rides from male drivers.\n\nWhile taxis driven by and for women are common in Dubai and India, such businesses would likely run afoul of anti-discrimination laws in the U.S., industry and legal experts said.\n\nMajor ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft don't give users the option of requesting a driver based on gender. The Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association, a trade group, says companies vary on whether women may request a female taxi driver.\n\nThe safety issue is a really big deal, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at the Harvard Business School. But you just can't discriminate. You can't turn people away.\n\nOn the employment side, the federal Civil Rights Act bans gender-based hiring except when deemed essential.\n\nCourts have interpreted that bona fide occupational qualification clause very narrowly, said Elizabeth Brown, a business law professor at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nPrisons, for example, have been permitted to hire female guards in select situations, but the airline industry was famously ordered to end the practice of hiring only women as flight attendants in a 1971 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.\n\nWhether the 1964 civil rights law applies is also an open question. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law, declined to comment on the legality of women-only ride-hailing services.\n\nBut spokeswoman Justine Lisser noted employers whose workers are independent contractors, as is the case with Mateo and Pelletz's companies, are generally outside the agency's purview.\n\nOn the consumer side, Massachusetts and many other states have anti-gender discrimination laws governing public accommodations like transportation services.\n\nBut those too, have exceptions. In Massachusetts, for example, women's-only gyms won a special legislative carve-out in 1998.\n\nMichelle Sicard, a Granby, Massachusetts, resident who recently signed up as a Chariot for Women driver, said she isn't concerned about the legal debate.\n\nI don't think it's discriminating against anyone. It's another way to make women feel safe, said the 33-year-old postal worker. I just think people overthink things and everything becomes a battle of the sexes.\n\nBut Harry Campbell, an Uber and Lyft driver in Los Angeles who runs The Rideshare Guy, a blog and podcast, fears the idea could be a slippery slope to other forms of discrimination.\n\nStronger background checks on drivers and regular monitoring of current ones might be a better approach, he suggested.\n\nThere are likely passengers who would feel more comfortable with drivers who are the same race or same ethnicity, so where do we draw the line? Campbell said.\n\nFemale ride-hailing users in the Boston area interviewed by The Associated Press had mixed feelings.\n\nAshley Barnett, a 24-year-old from Somerville, said it's well intended but avoids a larger societal problem -- people's attitudes toward women.\n\nIt's a solution to a problem that's way bigger than transportation, she said.\n\nCarolina Quintanilla, a 22-year-old from Boston, said she'd consider using the service at night. But even then, she said, there's no guarantee of safety.\n\nThere are crazy women out there, too, Quintanilla said. You never really know nobody's intentions. You have to trust your instincts.
SALT LAKE CITY -- A woman who says a former Mormon missionary leader raped her in the 1980s and that the church failed to take her allegations seriously has filed a lawsuit, saying Thursday she wants the church to change the way it handles sexual abuse reports. McKenna Denson, 55, said she opted to take legal action after becoming fed up that local church leaders failed to take disciplinary action despite reporting the allegations several times over three decades.\n\nShe said her experience illustrates systematic problems in the church with sexual abuse claims.\n\nEric Hawkins, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus of Christ of Latter-day Saints, said the institution has faith in the judicial system. The church has previously said it's investigating Denson's allegations and last week updated guidelines for how local leaders should deal with sexual abuse claims.\n\nThe church should encourage members to report abuse first to police, not local leaders, and require local leaders to call police when they hear of abuse, not a church hotline as currently directed, Denson's attorney, Craig Vernon, said at a news conference.\n\nNothing happened. McKenna wasn't believed, Vernon said. McKenna was blamed, McKenna was shamed.\n\nThe Associated Press doesn't usually name alleged victims of sexual assault but Denson has decided to go public with her story.\n\nIn the federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Denson repeated her allegation that Joseph L. Bishop singled her out, groomed her and sexually assaulted her in 1984 when he was president of the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah.\n\nBishop, now 85, has denied raping Denson but acknowledged to police who investigated the report this year that he asked her to expose herself, which he says she did. Denson, of Pueblo, Colorado, said that didn't happen.\n\nGregory Bishop, an attorney serving as his father's spokesman, didn't return a request for comment Thursday.\n\nThe case became public last month when a conversation Denson secretly recorded with Bishop in December came to light. In the conversation, Bishop is heard apologizing to Denson after she confronts him about the incident, but he doesn't say what happened.\n\nIn the same conversation, Bishop acknowledged molesting an unidentified second woman and described it as back rub that he says got too frisky.\n\nThe Mormon church has said it is investigating both incidents and has vowed to bring accountability. The church says no discipline was taken against Bishop after Denson previously reported the abuse because he denied it and they couldn't verify the allegations.\n\nOur hearts ache for all survivors of abuse, and the church is committed to addressing incidents of abuse wherever they are found, the church spokesman said.\n\nIt's not the first lawsuit filed against the church alleging sexual abuse by religious leaders, but Bishop held a much more prominent position than others. As president of the Missionary Training Center from 1983-1986, he was in a position of authority over hundreds of young Mormons preparing to go on proselytizing missions.\n\nDenson said she came from a troubled background and converted to Mormonism as a teenager. She said the attention from a high-ranking leader like Bishop made her feel special.\n\nAfter the incident, Denson said Bishop told her: No one will believe you. Look at you, look at me.\n\nDenson said the #MeToo movement gave her the courage to think she might be finally believed. She posed as a journalist working on a story about Mormon leaders to secretly record the conversation with Bishop.\n\nDenson said she's not fazed by a dossier prepared by church officials, which was distributed to media by Gregory Bishop of her criminal record. It includes a shoplifting conviction in 2010 in Utah and a police investigation of a death threat she made against Bishop that same year. She wasn't charged after police determined she wasn't serious, a police report shows.\n\nMaybe five years ago, 10 years ago, discrediting and victim shaming would have worked, Denson said. It doesn't work now. There's been at tectonic shift really that has caused a ripple then a wave and then a tidal wave.\n\nThe allegations have exposed how the church handles sexual abuse while it also deals with questions about closed door one-on-one interviews between local lay leaders and youth, and the sexual questions that sometimes are asked.\n\nAbout 1,000 people marched to the church's headquarters last week to demand an end to the so-called worthiness interviews that they argue can lead to unhealthy shaming of youth.\n\nThe church last week changed policy to now allow a child to bring a parent or adult with them to the interviews. Parents previously were allowed only in a hallway or adjacent room.\n\nThe Mormon church faced more criticism Monday after a top leader during a conference last weekend praised the #MeToo movement but referred to sexual misconduct as non-consensual immorality, a remark that some said could be interpreted as victim blaming.
DALLAS -- United Airlines wants to see more paperwork before passengers fly with emotional-support animals -- and don't even try to bring a peacock on board. The airline announced Thursday it will tighten rules starting March 1. The changes are similar to those coming at Delta Air Lines.\n\nUnited said owners will have to confirm that their animal is trained to behave in public, and they will need a vaccination form signed by a veterinarian. The vet will have to vouch that the animal isn't a health or safety threat to other people.\n\nUnited has seen a 75 percent year-over-year increase in customers bringing emotional support animals onboard and has experienced a significant increase in onboard incidents involving these animals, the airline said in a statement. We understand that other carriers have seen similar trends. The Department of Transportation's rules regarding emotional support animals are not working as they were intended, and we need to change our approach in order to ensure a safe and pleasant travel experience for all of our customers.\n\nThe airline bounced a passenger on Sunday who showed up at the airport with a peacock for emotional support. New York City-based photographer and performance artist Ventiko said she bought a ticket for her peacock, Dexter, so he would have his own seat on Sunday's flight from New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport to Los Angeles.\n\nUnited already bans exotic animals and non-household birds. Still, the fact that a passenger tried to bring a peacock on board helped illustrate why we needed to revise our policy, United spokesman Charles Hobart said.\n\nGuide dogs have been occasional flyers for years, but recently there has been a surge of emotional-support animals. Federal regulations allow them -- if they're not too big or exotic -- but airlines can ask for a doctor's note verifying that the passenger needs the animal.\n\nAirlines are convinced that scofflaws abuse the rules. Passengers often have to pay $125 or more each way to bring a small pet on board, but comfort animals fly free.\n\nThe crackdown by Delta raised objections from service-dog owners. Jenine Stanley of the Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind is upset that Delta will require service-dog owners to file a health form at least 48 hours before a flight. That could make emergency trips impossible.\n\nI don't think I've ever filled out a form for assistance. Now my animal is going to have to be verified every time, she said.\n\nUnited said it will not require forms for trained service animals. It's unclear, however, what would stop someone from claiming their comfort animal is a trained service animal.\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) -- a union -- has praised United's announcement, saying the airline has taken a very thoughtful, responsible approach to this issue, CBS News' Kris Van Cleave reports.\n\nThe airline's increased requirements for emotional support animals will reduce fraud and protect the legitimate need of animal assistance for passengers with disabilities and veterans, Sara Nelson, international president of AFA, said Thursday in a statement. This is about maintaining safety, health and security for passengers and crew, while ensuring accessibility for those who need it.
BETHLEHEM, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania university has kicked a sorority off campus due to what officials are calling a reprehensible scavenger hunt that involved drugs, alcohol and sexual activity. Alpha Chi Omega's Theta Chi chapter lost its recognition by Lehigh University for two years and will be banned from campus through May 2020.\n\nThe Lehigh Greek Community blog published by the university says the sorority hosted a December scavenger hunt in which participants were given a list of tasks that involved the use of drugs and alcohol, sexual activity and other activities that violate the Bethlehem school's policy.\n\nThe sorority was suspended pending an investigation by a disciplinary committee that called the activity reprehensible.\n\nAlpha Chi Omega can appeal. The national organization conducted an investigation resulting in probation and individual punishments.\n\nThe blog says, This incident was a significant, reprehensible event that the entire chapter was aware of and leadership endorsed. This event did not only take place this year, but there is credible information that this event has been going on for years. The panel is deeply concerned about the escalated nature of the content of this year's list and we are unconvinced that this escalation wouldn't continue.\n\n … The current conduct history of AXO does not lead the panel to have confidence in the chapter's ability to act and demonstrate care and concern for its members, particularly related to health and safety concerns. This type of behavior is simply unacceptable considering the current climate on college campuses.
Tech giant Apple is spending $100 million to expand opportunities for communities of color in technology and entrepreneurship.\n\nSpeaking with CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Vice President Lisa Jackson are revealing new details about the racial equality initiative, launched last summer after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n\nIt's about giving people opportunity, Cook said. I can't wait to see students that are able to enjoy the innovation hub at the Propel Center.\n\nThe company said it would team up with Historically Black Colleges and Universities around the country to open special learning hubs — propel centers at 100 or so of these educational institutions across the country.\n\nThink of it as an innovation hub and we'll work on things from coding, to machine learning, to creativity, to entertainment arts, Cook said.\n\nOn top of those skills, the centers will also help students sharpen their entrepreneurship — a lot of the things that we do here will be in the curriculum there, Cook summarized.\n\nAsked if he was a good student himself, Cook answered: I tried to be.\n\nAs for Vice President Lisa Jackson, she first served as President Obama's EPA administrator before coming to Apple in 2013.\n\nJackson, who runs all of Apple's environmental and social policy efforts, said HBCUs have a history of turning out the leaders in our community.\n\nShe described Apple's Propel Centers as both a place for all HBCU students and the surrounding community, and a talent pool for Apple and other companies to find ready recruits.\n\nWe know that the talent is already there. We know these students are trying to do what every student does — propel themselves to a better future and a better life, Jackson said.\n\nEven the name of the program itself — Propel Center — aims to motivate.\n\nThis is meant to be a little bit of wind under their sails, Jackson explained.\n\nIn Detroit, a city with at least 50,000 small businesses owned by people of color, Apple is revolutionizing job training.\n\nThe first ever, in the United States, app developer academy, Jackson revealed, aimed at giving some extra lift to Black and brown developers.\n\nShe said, There is a concentration of strivers in Detroit who are trying to build their city back.\n\nTim Cook called the city a fantastic footprint.\n\nWe want to provide people a mechanism to learn to code, to learn how to write world class apps, he said.\n\nAspiring applicants should demonstrate desire, creativity, a level of interest, Cook said, adding that you want to feel that desire of someone who really wants to make a go at this.\n\nOne of the programs at their Detroit academy is aimed at people who have never studied coding at all.\n\nCook said he believed anyone could learn to code.\n\nYou know, I did it in school, he said. Once you start, you recognize that it's just another language.\n\nBut while building the next generation of minority tech entrepreneurs, Apple is also supporting the current one through a $10 million dollar investment in Harlem Capital, a fund whose goal is to back a thousand companies founded by people of color in the next 20 years.\n\nAsked when and how he first identified systemic racism, Cook said he firsthand witnessed it while growing up in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWhen I was five years old, John Lewis was beaten on the Edmund Pettus bridge. When I was eight years old, the riots at Stonewall happened, Cook recounted. Both of these changed the course of time and changed the course of my life as well.\n\nHe continued, When you either experience those sort of things or read about those things, and then apply them to what you're seeing today, there was systemic racism, there is systemic racism, and it's not gonna go away unless we do something about it.\n\nCook is speaking out about the current political situation as well — saying he was shocked by the violence that occurred at the U.S. Capitol as Congress met to count state-certified Electoral College votes.\n\nIt was a very, very sad and shameful day. I could — probably like you — I couldn't believe what I was seeing either. I felt like I was in some other form of reality or something, Cook said. I think it's key that people be held accountable for it. This is not something that should skate.\n\nThe tech CEO is holding social media app Parler accountable, claiming it failed to remove language inciting violence from its platform. Popular with the far-right, Apple took it off the app store over the weekend — effectively preventing anyone with an iPhone from using it.\n\nParler has some issues with moderation. There are some incitement to violence examples on there, and they need to step it up on the moderation. And I'm — our hope is that they do that and get back on the store, Cook said.\n\nHe pointed out Parler's removal was just a suspension, rather than a full ban.\n\nParler CEO John Matze has publicly criticized his app's removal from Apple and other hosts, claiming he was being censored and his First Amendment rights were being violated.\n\nAll we're asking, Gayle, is that he meet the terms of service, Cook said. We have terms of service for our app store, and some of those terms of service he's in violation of.\n\nLooking ahead to 2021, Cook said his goal remains the same as years' past — to do as much as I can to help other people and enrich their lives.\n\nThat's Apple's goal, he said. For the country, I hope that we enter a stage in our country where we're back to bipartisanship.
The stock market has trended upward since Election Day, stoked by optimism that President Donald Trump's agenda will translate into stronger corporate earnings. While Wall Street may be having some second thoughts lately, the Trump bump seems to be taking hold on Main Street in the form of stronger hiring by bullish small and midsize employers.\n\nThe pace of hiring by large companies hasn't changed much since the election, but smaller firms have shown a notable uptick in hiring, according to a Morgan Stanley (MS) study. It examined net monthly changes in employment among firms of different sizes (on a three-month rolling-average basis) relative to historical averages.\n\nMorgan Stanley based its analysis on data from the ADP Research Institute, a division of payroll-processing giant ADP. This week, ADP reported that private sector employers added a stronger-than-expected 263,000 jobs in March, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Small and midsize companies led the way in job creation, generating more than 80 percent of all new private sector jobs last month.\n\nSmall-business hiring may have lagged -- unusually so -- in this labor market recovery, but its animal spirts are certainly awake now, said the Morgan Stanley report, which noted that small-business owners are feeling more upbeat lately, while the number of startup companies has also surged.\n\nSince the presidential election, optimism among small-business owners has risen to levels not seen since 1983, a year that marked the start of a prolonged economic expansion, said William Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The trade group publishes a monthly small-business optimism index based on a survey of a random sample of its member firms.\n\nHigher levels of optimism are starting to translate into stronger hiring and capital spending, said Dunkelberg. Manufacturers and construction companies are particularly upbeat, he said.\n\nWhy has hiring by small businesses lagged during the recovery? Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was slow to bounce back, and that took a toll on many small businesses, explained Dunkelberg.\n\nThe recovery was awful for small businesses in terms of sales growth, he said.\n\nMr. Trump's unexpected win in November has many feeling decidedly more upbeat, added Dunkelberg. That's because they're hopeful the administration will deliver on its promises to reform the tax code, roll back regulations and upgrade America's infrastructure.\n\nHis vow to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is another cause for optimism. The cost of health insurance and complying with regulations have been among the biggest problems small businesses have faced in recent years, said Dunkelberg.\n\nExisting tax policy is another pain point for many small businesses, he added. Many want tax cuts and a simpler code, among other policy changes.\n\nA win by Hillary [Clinton] wouldn't have been viewed as a change in the status quo, just more of the past eight years, said Dunkelberg.\n\nOf course, what goes up must come down. The Trump euphoria on Main Street may eventually fade if the administration fails to deliver on its pro-business agenda. Last month's collapse of the Republican-backed health insurance bill has undoubtedly given some supporters in the small-business community pause.\n\nNot according to Dunkelberg. Many, he said, see it as just a temporary setback.
NAVARRO -- A North Texas college known for its incredible cheer program is being sued by a former cheerleader, CBS DFW reports. The now 20-year-old says he was drugged and sexually assaulted by an assistant coach.\n\nLiving in fear is … probably the hardest part, he said. Just the images, the memories, you can never shake them.\n\nHe enrolled at Navarro College in 2015 hoping to win a national cheerleading championship. He and his family met Andre McGee the very first day.\n\nEverybody said, 'Oh you're one of the new cheerleaders. Andre takes great care of you boys,' said the cheerleader's mother. All campus police, the man who was in charge of the dorms, they all knew Andre.\n\nOnline, the 40-year-old McGee called himself the assistant cheer coach and #1 recruiter at Navarro College. His Twitter profile proudly proclaimed he was best friends with and right hand to head cheer coach Monica Aldama. In several social media posts, McGee refers to himself as a tough big who is proud of his littles.\n\nThe alleged victim said the pictures don't tell the whole story. In his civil lawsuit against McGee and Navarro College, he said McGee would slap and hit male cheerleaders and make them drop their pants at his command. He claimed McGee had hundreds of nude photographs of the cheerleaders and would force the rookies to drink and/or consume drugs, calling it big girl games.\n\nAccording to the suit, in October 2015 McGee forced the alleged victim to take Xanax. He said he later awoke to McGee sodomizing him. He said he stayed quiet about the alleged assault because he still dreamed of winning a championship. But three months later he called police.\n\nCBS DFW obtained the police report, which shows a second cheerleader making similar claims. That cheerleader did not want to talk on the record for this story, but attorneys for the first cheerleader believe others will come forward.\n\nWe have spoken to other victims in this case, said Lacey Turley Most. And we've heard from other cheerleaders that there were other victims.\n\nThe cheerleader said he also reported the assault to Navarro College and Monica Aldama. That's when he learned McGee did not work for the school.\n\nWe were totally under the impression that he was the assistant coach, said the cheerleader's mother. A Navarro College spokesperson later told CBS DFW McGee was allowed to volunteer with the Navarro Cheer program, adding that once the school learned of the allegation, the college notified him that he could no longer volunteer. You can read Navarro's full statements below.\n\nThe alleged victim and his family said there was no indication that McGee was only a volunteer.\n\nThe boys had to answer to him 24/7, said the cheerleader's mother. He had to have their schedule, so he knew exactly what classes they were in, when.\n\nNavarro County indicted McGee on a charge of sexual assault in March 2017, but for the next ten months the case stalled. That's why the mom says she reached out to the I-Team. It's taken way too long, she said, saying her son feels like he's less important because he's a boy.\n\nWe contacted the district attorney's office to ask why all of McGee's court hearings had been cancelled. The DA, Lowell Thompson, said they were waiting for McGee to be released from the Freestone County jail on another charge. But when the I-Team called the jail, we were told there was no other charge, and McGee had never been behind bars.\n\nWe found McGee substitute teaching at Fairfield ISD. Two days after we relayed that information to Thompson, police arrested McGee. Thompson later told the I-Team he had been given bad information about McGee's whereabouts.\n\nMcGee made his first court appearance in December. He, his mother and his pastor all took the stand. His mother told the judge McGee had been around kids his whole life, while his pastor said he worked with the choir … and Sunday school classes. All of them denied the allegations.\n\nWhile the criminal case is moving forward, the cheerleader's family is also pursuing a civil lawsuit against McGee and Navarro College. Head coach Monica Aldama is not a defendant, but she is repeatedly named as part of the suit. She declined to be interviewed for this story but sent CBS DFW a statement.\n\nI have never and would never tolerate sexual harassment or sexual abuse in the Navarro College cheer program, the statement reads in part. I would not remain silent if I were aware that any sexual misconduct were occurring in the cheer program. In addition, I do not accept or condone unlawful drug and alcohol use by Navarro cheer team members. Andre McGee volunteered as a helper for the cheer team. He was never an assistant coach and never had authority over the team or cheer team members. The cheerleader who has accused Mr. McGee … never made any complaint to me. Once I learned of the allegations against Mr. McGee, I ensured that he had no further contact with the Navarro College cheer team.\n\nThe I-Team also reached out to more than 30 current and former Navarro College cheerleaders. Seven supported McGee and said they had never witnessed any inappropriate behavior. Two back up the cheerleader's claims of hazing and sexually inappropriate behavior. The rest did not respond to the I-Team's questions.\n\nCindy said her son is still dealing with the fallout of the alleged assault.\n\nThe fear of that man … and what has happened to him has just crushed him on an emotional level that none of us can understand.\n\nThe cheerleader said the lawsuit is about helping others. I just don't want it to happen to anyone else.\n\nNavarro College's first statement:\n\nAndre McGee attended Navarro College as a student from 1995 until 2000 and participated in the College's cheerleading program. From November 2003 through June 2004, Navarro College employed Mr. McGee as a Resident Advisor (RA). This was the only time Navarro College employed Mr. McGee. Navarro College never employed Mr. McGee in its cheerleading program and never employed Mr. McGee as an Assistant Coach. Mr. McGee was not affiliated with Navarro College in any way at the time of the arrest referenced in your email. The safety and welfare of students is of utmost priority to Navarro College. The College prohibits sexual misconduct, including any acts of a sexual nature against an individual without consent. Navarro College has strong policies and procedures for reporting, investigating, and responding to all allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Navarro College remains committed to the prevention and detection of sexual harassment and abuse. Upon receipt of a report regarding sexual misconduct, Navarro College investigates the matter and acts swiftly to provide an appropriate response.\n\nNavarro College's second statement:\n\nAs previously stated, Andre McGee was not a Navarro College employee. It is the College's understanding that Mr. McGee was allowed to volunteer with the Navarro Cheer program. The College did not compensate Mr. McGee for any time he volunteered. Once Navarro College was made aware of any allegation of misconduct by Mr. McGee, the College notified him that he could no longer volunteer for Navarro Cheer. This matter is the subject of a currently pending lawsuit. Navarro College does not comment on pending litigation. Navarro College denies any and all wrongdoing with respect to the allegations against Mr. McGee. Any further statement by the College will be made by the College's attorneys in the lawsuit.\n\nMonica Aldama's full statement:
The following is a transcript of the interview with Vice President Mike Pence that aired Sunday, Jan. 20, 2019, on Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face the Nation. We begin today with Vice President Mike Pence. Welcome and so good to have you here.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Yeah, morning Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You arrived here today with Secret Service agents who are with you 24 hours a day. Are they getting paid during this shutdown?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: They're not at this point and 800,000 federal workers are also going without pay and if we don't have a resolution then those paychecks won't go out at the end of this week. But we also have a crisis at our southern border, Margaret. Humanitarian and a security crisis. And as the president laid out yesterday we're absolutely determined to secure the border to end the shutdown. And what the president articulated yesterday was a good faith, common sense compromise where the president laid out his priorities: building a physical barrier on the southern border - a steel barrier - new resources for border patrol, humanitarian assistance technology. But the president also announced that- that he'd be willing to support legislation that provides temporary relief, three years of temporary legal status for those in the DACA program and also those who have temporary protective status. It really is an effort to- to compromise and- and we really look forward to the Senate taking this bill up Tuesday and beginning to work in earnest not just to end this government shutdown, which is a burden on the families of 800,000 federal workers but even more importantly in that to address the crisis that we face in our southern border.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: If this is a genuine attempt why weren't any Democrats included in the consultations for this?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, Margaret we've been talking to Democrats--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Who?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --over the last four weeks. Well, first the president's met repeatedly with Democrat leadership all the way through a week ago last Wednesday--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But Democratic leaders have said this is a nonstarter.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well look, that- that meeting in the situation room a week ago Wednesday the president looked at Speaker Pelosi and said, Ok if I gave you everything you wanted, if I signed legislation for most- funding most of the government and- and had a 30 day extension on homeland security. He said to her - I was sitting there - he said, Would you give me funding to secure the border and a wall? And she said, no. So what the president directed us to do, our negotiation team, was to reach out with rank and file Democrats in the House and in the Senate. And what the president presented yesterday really is an effort to bring together ideas from both political parties. I- I think it is an act of statesmanship on the president's part to say, Here is what I'm for. It includes my priorities, it includes priorities that Democrats had- have advanced for some period of time. And we believe it provides a framework--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Which--\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --a framework for ending this impasse, securing our- our border and reopening government.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I- I didn't hear you say which Democrats are supporting it though.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Right. Well--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I need that.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --well the- the president met this week, we all did, with the problem solvers caucus. I think we all know who was there and we- we were grateful for their presence. But we've had- we've had good conversations with Democrat members of the Senate but look, their- their- their leadership has discouraged them in the House and the Senate from engaging the administration so I want to respect those conversations. But, I think what the American people saw the president do yesterday was say, I- I- you know I- I want to set the table for us resolving this issue in a way that achieves his objectives to secure the border, end the humanitarian security crisis, end the government shutdown, but also to- to bring together- bring together the Democrats' priorities to accomplish that. That's what the American people expect us to do. And- and honestly you know- you know the hearts and minds of the American people today are thinking a lot about it being the weekend where we remember the life and work of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But one of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was, Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. You think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. That's exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do. Come to the table in a spirit of good faith. We'll secure our border, we'll reopen the government and we'll move our nation forward as the president said yesterday to even a broader discussion about immigration reform in the months ahead.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've said that this is not- this offer on the table is not amnesty. The president this morning tweeted something that I'd like you to clarify though. He said, Amnesty will- will be used on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else. Was that an offer for a path to citizenship?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well I'll- I'll let the president's words stand. But at the end--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what he meant?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: -- at the end. Yes I do.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What was it?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: At the end of his remarks yesterday he made it very clear that while this proposal is just it's- look- it's- it's funding to secure our border, to build a steel barrier on the southern border, to give additional resources that the Department of Homeland Security has requested in terms of personnel and facilities and detection technologies as well as humanitarian assistance. But the president's also said he's more than willing in this legislation that comes to the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, to extend temporary relief to people that are in the TPS program as well as--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Three years--\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --the DACA program. But at the end of that speech I hope the American people heard him. So once we move past this impasse, once we begin to build more trust between the parties. This is a president who is absolutely determined to fix our broken immigration system in this country. But he has always said it all begins with border security.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will he come down from that five point seven billion dollar ask? Is that also up for negotiation?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well look, that's the president's request and the Senate leadership has agreed to bring the bill to the floor with our request for funding for the wall and all the other resources. But look we recognize the legislative process is a process of give and take. The Democrats want to bring amendments or recommendations forward. I know the president will give them due consideration, but the president is absolutely determined to build a steel barrier on the southern border in the 10 priority areas that the Department of Homeland Security said that we need a physical barrier. It's roughly two hundred and thirty four miles. It's not from sea to sea. It's two hundred thirty four miles of additional steel barrier. And- and- and frankly you look back at prior administrations- you know virtually the last four presidents have all built similar barriers on the southern border including President Obama. And we just want to respond to the needs that we have to secure our border. But once the legislative process goes forward I know President Trump will be listening to recommendations from the other party.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There is an inspector general report this week that said that the Trump administration actually separated far more children from their parents than initially reported, more than the twenty seven hundred. In fact they couldn't put a figure on it. Do you regret that policy?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well the president reversed that policy. And now we have in place--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN : But do you regret what happened to the more than twenty seven hundred children?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I think- I think we, we regret not only that circumstance but what's driving that circumstance. It's one of the reasons why the president had Secretary Nielson negotiate with Mexico that going forward we'll be able to allow families to remain in Mexico while they apply for asylum and it would obviate the need to bring them into our system that is ill-equipped to handle the extraordinary influx of families and unaccompanied minors that's coming across our border today. A majority of the sixty thousand people that are- that are detained attempting to come into our country illegally every single month more than two thousand a day are now families and unaccompanied children. We now have an arrangement with Mexico where those families can remain in Mexico. The president in his proposal also recommended that we allow children to apply for asylum--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In the countries of origin.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --in the Central American countries. Look, the human traffickers and the cartels take American cash to- to entice families to send either their family or their children on the long and dangerous journey north. We want that to end. These reforms will advance that from ending. But look it's time for Congress to come to the table and take this important step.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I do want to ask you two- two quick things since it's so rare we get time with you. Do you care to comment on this BuzzFeed report that the special counsel seemed to have found some issue with, but wasn't specific. What part of this report was inaccurate?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, we- I- the- the special counsel said that the report of BuzzFeed was inaccurate and- and frankly the response by many in the national media to take it at face value and engage--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what part of it was wrong?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: --and I- in- in hyperventilating about accusations against the president was really a disgrace. Look, look--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't know which part of it was inaccurate.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: There is a- there is an obsession in this town. Look, we- we've fully cooperated with the special counsel, over a million documents, we'll continue to fully cooperate. I'll let the special counsel address that issue. The president's maintained that he did nothing wrong. But look, what the American people saw this week was the obsession of many in the national media, and frankly some Democrats on Capitol Hill, to assume the worst about this president.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well that's why I wanted you to--\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: And- and frankly we appreciate\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --to tell us--\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --the special counsel--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- what part of it was inaccurate.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well frank- we- we--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --but can I ask you--\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --appreciate the special counsel making it clear that that report was inaccurate.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT: --and- and look, the- the special counsel is going to complete his work. And we're- we're going to continue to focus on the issues that are most important to the American people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, four Americans were killed in a suicide attack in Syria this week. That same day you gave a speech and said the ISIS caliphate was defeated. Do you regret in hindsight saying that?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Well first and foremost--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Their deaths seemed to contradict what you said.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, look. First and foremost, we're deeply saddened at the loss of these four brave Americans and we were praying, especially yesterday, when the president joined their families at Dover Air Force Base. And- their contributions to our national security will forever be enshrined in the hearts of the American people. But look, President Obama withdrew American forces--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But should you have said that?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --from Iran. Well let me be clear- President Obama withdrew American forces from Iraq precipitously in 2011. ISIS rose up virtually out of the desert, overran--\n\n\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- And that's the criticism--\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: --overran vast areas of Iraq and Syria--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --of what the Trump administration is doing in Syria now.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: President Obama began a bombing campaign. But when we came into office two years ago today, President Trump said we are going to drive ISIS out of Iraq. We're going to drive the caliphate out of existence. And because of the sacrifices and the courage of people like those four brave Americans, last- the end of 2017 we captured the so-called capital of their caliphate in Raqqa. The- the ISIS state has been defeated. But as I said in that very same speech, the president wants to bring our troops home. But he also wants to make sure that we hand off the fight against--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: -- ISIS in Syria, what remains of ISIS in Syria, to our coalition partners and that we continue to support them with American assets in the region.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Vice President--\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: The ISIS caliphate has crumbled thanks to the courage of our armed forces and our allies in the region. But America is going to continue to support the effort until we drive any remnants of ISIS from the region and from the face of the earth.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Vice President thank you for your time today.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Next up, we'll speak to House Democrat Congressman Adam Schiff.
Scientists are reporting progress on a blood test to detect many types of cancer at an early stage, including some of the most deadly ones that lack screening tools now.\n\nMany groups are working on liquid biopsy tests, which look for DNA and other things that tumors shed into blood, to try to find cancer before it spreads, when chances of a cure are best.\n\nIn a study published Thursday in the journal Science, Johns Hopkins University scientists looked to see how well their experimental test detected cancer in people already known to have the disease. The blood tests found about 70 percent of eight common types of cancer in the 1,005 patients. The rates varied depending on the type -- lower for breast tumors but high for ovarian, liver and pancreatic ones.\n\nIn many cases, the test narrowed the possible origin of the cancer to one or two places, such as colon or lung, important for limiting how much follow-up testing a patient might need. It gave only seven false alarms when tried on 812 others without cancer.\n\nThe test is nowhere near ready for use yet; it needs to be validated in a larger study already underway in a general population, rather than cancer patients, to see if it truly works and helps save lives -- the best measure of a screening test's value.\n\nWe're very, very excited and see this as a first step, said Nickolas Papadopoulos, one of the Hopkins study leaders. But we don't want people calling up and asking for the test now, because it's not available, he said.\n\nSome independent experts saw great promise.\n\nIt's such a good first set of results that it gives hope this approach will pan out, said Dr. Peter Bach, a health policy expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who consults for a gene testing company. Anything close to 50 percent or 40 percent detection is pretty exciting stuff, and this one did better than that, he said.\n\nDr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, was encouraged that the test did well on cancers that lack screening tests now. If a blood test could find 98 percent of ovarian cancers at an early stage, as these early results suggest, that would be a significant advance, he said.\n\nBut he cautioned: We have a long way to go to demonstrate its effectiveness as a screening test.\n\nThe test detects mutations in 16 genes tied to cancer and measures eight proteins that often are elevated when cancer is present.\n\nIt covers breast, colon and lung and five kinds that don't have screening tests for people at average risk: ovarian, liver, stomach, pancreatic and esophageal. Prostate cancer is not included. A blood test already is widely used for prostate cancer -- the PSA test -- but its value for screening is controversial.\n\nResearchers tried the new test on people whose cancers were still confined to where it started or had spread a little but not widely throughout the body. It detected 33 percent of breast cancers, about 60 percent of colon or lung cancers and nearly all of the ovarian and liver ones. It did better when tumors were larger or had spread. It did less well at the very earliest stage.\n\nThe test probably will not work as well when tested in a general population rather than those already known to have cancer, researchers say. Hopkins and Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania have started a study of it in 10,000 Geisinger patients who will be tracked for at least five years.\n\nThe work was financed by many foundations, the Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which provides The Associated Press with funding for health and science coverage. Many study leaders have financial ties to gene testing companies, and some get royalties for patents on cancer detection methods.\n\nResearchers say the test could cost around $500 based on current materials and methods, but the ultimate goal is to commercialize it, so what a company would charge is unknown.\n\nAlso this week, Taiwan-based CellMax Life gave results on its liquid biopsy test, which looks for whole tumor cells shed into blood, at an American Society of Clinical Oncology conference.\n\nResearchers tested 620 people getting colonoscopies or with confirmed colon cancer at a hospital in Taiwan. The company said its test had an overall accuracy of 84 to 88 percent for detecting cancer or precancerous growths and a false alarm rate around 3 percent.\n\nThe company's chief executive, Atul Sharan, said U.S. studies should start this year. The test is sold now in Taiwan for $500, but should cost around $150 in the U.S., he said.\n\nDr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society, said results are encouraging, but the test needs more study, especially to see if it gives too many false alarms.\n\nThe last thing you'd want is a test that tells you you might have cancer if you don't, he said.
Washington — President Joe Biden signed 10 executive orders at the White House on Thursday as part of his national strategy to combat COVID-19, warning Americans that the pandemic which has already claimed more than 408,000 American lives is certain to get worse.\n\nAbove all our plan is to restore public trust, Mr. Biden said at the White House, appearing alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who will now play a more public role as the new administration embarks on its pandemic response effort.\n\nLet me be very clear, things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The memorial we held two nights ago will not be our last one unfortunately, the president said, referring to a pre-inauguration memorial service he attended at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nExperts expect the United States' COVID-19 death toll to reach half a million people next month. Mr. Biden promised that his administration's approach, laid out in a 198-page plan, matches the gravity of the moment, calling it a war-time undertaking.\n\nThe cases will continue to mount, we didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around, Mr. Biden said. But let me be equally clear, we will get through this, we will defeat this pandemic, and to a nation waiting for action, let me be the clearest on this point: Help is on the way.\n\nUnder the National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness, the administration aims to vastly expand testing, reopen the majority of K-8 schools in the next 100 days, and administer 100 million vaccine doses by the end of April. This will be one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever undertaken, Mr. Biden said of the vaccine distribution effort.\n\nThe national strategy says the Biden administration aims to stand up a coordinated response while restoring trust, accountability and a sense of common purpose in our response to the pandemic, an unmistakable dig at the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. Jeffrey Zients, the coordinator of the White House's COVID-19 response, told reporters on Wednesday that the situation the Biden team is inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined.\n\nWhite House officials couldn't say when the vaccine will be available for the general population — those without underlying health conditions who are under age 65 and not essential workers.\n\nThe brutal truth is, it's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated, Mr. Biden reiterated Thursday. The U.S. was administering nearly 1 million doses a day when Mr. Biden took office, so the country is already roughly on pace for 100 million doses by the end of April. But even hitting that goal means only 50 million people will be vaccinated, since both authorized vaccines require two injections to be effective.\n\nOfficials also acknowledge that much of their plan will be impossible if Congress doesn't pass the administration's nearly $2 trillion coronavirus proposal.\n\nMr. Biden said he would use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to speed vaccine and PPE production and reduce supply-chain log jams. The national strategy calls for prioritizing supplies that could cause bottlenecks and potentially using the DPA to produce glass vials, stoppers, syringes [and] needles to ensure that drug manufacturers have all the supplies they need to keep packaging vaccine doses as they're produced. Officials said their goal was to shore up stockpiles for the immediate need and any future pandemics.\n\nOur national plan launches a full scale war time effort to address the supply shortages by ramping up production and protective equipment, syringes, needles, you name it, Mr. Biden said.\n\nThe administration is directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to create a liaison or point person for each state, something intended to hasten the vaccination process. The administration will also establish a coronavirus testing board.\n\nTo increase vaccine availability, the administration plans to erect vaccine centers at stadiums and community centers and mobilize federal personnel to help administer shots. This is a departure from the Trump administration's approach, which sent vaccine doses to states and localities and largely left it to them to figure out distribution.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, vaccine doses will no longer be held back by the government, except for a small strategic reserve. The Trump administration, too, eventually adopted this very policy after the Biden transition team announced it would release all but a few doses.\n\nThe Biden administration is also putting a spotlight on racial and geographic disparities in healthcare. One of the president's executive orders establishes a health equity task force, led by Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, to compile data on the coronavirus' disproportionate impact on minority communities.\n\nFormer President Trump's surgeon general, Jerome Adams, has been asked to stay on to advise Mr. Biden's COVID-19 response. Zients said the administration will hold regular press briefings with government doctors including Anthony Fauci.\n\nExecutive orders\n\nDirecting agencies to address vaccine and PPE supply shortfalls using all authorities including DPA; Directing OSHA to publish worker safety guidelines; Establishing a coronavirus testing board; Directing government scientists to identify new treatments for COVID-19; Directing HHS and CDC to provide clear guidance on safe school reopening; Directing agencies to expand data collection and reporting capacity; Establishing a health equity taskforce that focuses on racial/geographic health disparities; Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith will be chair; Enhancing the collection, sharing and analysis of covid data including metrics by race and ethnicity; Require mask wearing on planes, trains and other forms of public transportation; Bolster clinical care facilities and long term care facilities.\n\nPresidential memos
Seoul, South Korea -- North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, Jo Song Gil, went into hiding with his wife in November, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers in Seoul on Thursday. A high-profile defection by one of North Korea's elite would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong Un as he pursues diplomacy with Seoul and Washington and seeks to portray himself as a player in international geopolitics.\n\nSouth Korean lawmaker Kim Min-ki said an official from Seoul's National Intelligence Service shared the information during a closed-door briefing. Kim did not say whether the spy agency revealed any information about Jo's current whereabouts or whether the diplomat had plans to defect to South Korea. Kim said the NIS said it has not been contacted by Jo.\n\nThis March 20, 2018 photo made available on Jan. 3, 2019 by the Parish of Farra di Soligo, shows North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy Jo Song Gil, center, holding a model of Bell of Peace of Rovereto during a cultural event on the occasion of a visit of the North Korean delegation to the Veneto region, in San Pietro di Feletto, near Treviso, northern Italy. Aldo-Cietto/AP\n\nKim said the NIS official said that Jo and his wife left the official residence in early November, weeks before his term was to end in late November. Kim said he couldn't confirm whether the NIS official revealed whether Jo and his wife were accompanied by any children. The NIS earlier said it couldn't confirm a South Korean media report that Jo was under the protection of the Italian government as he seeks asylum in a Western nation.\n\nNorth Korea has not yet commented on Jo's status.\n\nAn official with the Italian Foreign Ministry said the North Korean hadn't requested asylum from Italy. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with standard practice, said Jo no longer held diplomatic status in Italy. That presumably refers to his government's ending his diplomatic assignment to Italy and his being recalled.\n\nNorth Korea, which touts itself in its propaganda as a socialist paradise, is extremely sensitive about defections, especially among its elite diplomatic corps, and has previously insisted that they are South Korean or U.S. plots to undermine its government.\n\nNorth Korea may publicly ignore Jo's possible defection or hold back harsh criticism to avoid highlighting the vulnerability of its government as it pursues diplomacy with Washington and Seoul, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University.\n\nThe last senior North Korean diplomat known to have defected is Thae Yong Ho, a former minister at the North Korean Embassy in London, who fled to South Korea in 2016.\n\nWhile not identifying him by name, the North's state media then described Thae as human scum and claimed he was trying to escape punishment for serious crimes.\n\nThae, who has been an outspoken critic of Kim Jong Un while living in South Korea, denied the accusations and said he defected because he didn't want his children to live miserable lives in the North.\n\nIt's possible that Jo is trying to defect because of similar reasons, said Koh, who is a policy adviser for South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It could be difficult for some diplomats to accept being called back to the North after enjoying years living in the free West. They could want their children to live in a different system and receive better education.\n\nThe highest-level North Korean to seek asylum in South Korea is Hwang Jang-yop, a senior ruling Workers' Party official who once tutored Kim Jong Un's late father, dictator Kim Jong Il.\n\nHwang's 1997 defection was hailed by many South Koreans as an intelligence bonanza. Hwang died in 2010.\n\nIn 1997, the North Korean ambassador to Egypt fled and resettled in the United States.\n\nNot much is publicly known about Jo, who had been North Korea's acting ambassador to Rome after Italy expelled then-Ambassador Mun Jong Nam in October 2017 to protest a North Korean nuclear test.\n\nKim, the lawmaker who listened to the spy agency's briefing, said the NIS official said the agency has yet to figure out many details about Jo.\n\nAbout 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, according to South Korean government figures. Many defectors have said they wanted to leave North Korea's harsh political system and poverty. North Korea often accuses the South of deceiving or paying people to defect, or claims that they have been kidnapped.
A decade ago this very month, in Cairo's Tahrir Square, social media was being praised. Its role as an organizing tool during the pro-democracy rallies had many calling the Arab Spring the Facebook Revolution instead.\n\nBut for all its glowing promise, we quickly learned social media is only as good as how it's used.\n\nThe major difference between now and then is, more than ever before, our experiences on social media are determined by hidden decisions made by the social media companies themselves, said Ramesh Srinivasan, who was in Tahrir Square back then researching how Twitter and Facebook were giving voice to the voiceless.\n\nIt used to be something more of an open pipe, he said.\n\nSrinivasan is now an author, and a professor at UCLA's Department of Information Studies. What we are seeing when we go online is likely to be that which is most sensational or inflammatory. They're predicting whatever is most likely to grab people's attention.\n\nKeeping us engaged on social media is how Big Tech makes money, and the past four years have proven lies and conspiracy theories are unfortunately more engaging that the truth.\n\nAnd the danger in that is, what? asked correspondent Lee Cowan.\n\nThe danger is it's gonna present us with an extremely distorted view of reality, Srinivasan replied. The fringe becomes the new normal.\n\nThat is a study in the Trump Presidency. His reality TV roots taught him controversy gets ratings. And he used his social media feeds in much the same way. No one has a bigger bully pulpit than the President of the United States, and no one before Mr. Trump used it with such abandon online.\n\nThe attack on the Capitol changed all that.\n\nAfter years of defending his presence on their platforms, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media giants booted Mr. Trump, claiming he'd incited a riot.\n\nAmazon removed an entire site from its servers: Parler, which had become the place favored by many conservatives.\n\nDe-platformed was a word we learned a lot about this past week.\n\nI think Big Tech has made a terrible mistake, and very, very bad for our country, President Trump said Tuesday. They shouldn't be doing it. But, uhh, there's always a counter-move when they do that.\n\nWhile many applauded the move, the precedent of shutting out the leader of the free world made many people uncomfortable, too. It's a huge power to wield, one that is currently held in the hands of a very few.\n\nIt's not a new argument; the CEOs of the major tech companies have been called on the carpet before.\n\nWho the hell elected you, and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear? Sen. Ted Cruz asked tech executives during an October 2020 hearing on the Communications Decency Act.\n\nIn 2019 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, So, you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? I think it's just a pretty simple yes or no.\n\nBut claiming Big Tech is running afoul of the First Amendment by de-platforming those it deems harmful may be missing the larger point.\n\nCowan asked, Is kicking someone off any of these social media sites an infringement of their free speech rights?\n\nNo, it isn't, replied Daphne Keller, who directs the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center. They are not subject to the First Amendment. They are not the government.\n\nWhen it comes to digital speech and the First Amendment, she said, it gets messy pretty fast.\n\nCowan said, This isn't just a free speech argument on the part of users; it's also a free speech argument on the part of the providers as well, right?\n\nPeople who want to sue platforms, and force them to carry speech they don't want to, have a double First Amendment problem, Keller said. First of all, those people don't have a First Amendment claim against the platforms, and second of all, the platforms do have a First Amendment argument against being forced to carry speech they disagree with.\n\nBut what if the argument over regulation was reframed – less about speech, and more about changing how Big Tech exposes us to that speech?\n\nYaël Eisenstat used to work for Facebook as one of the heads of election integrity, where she saw firsthand just what these companies do with all that content.\n\nThis idea that it's just this free flow of information is false. It's a curated flow of information, she said. It's a business model that is predicated on gathering as much of our human behavioral data as possible, to create these little boxes of who we are, to then target us with ads.\n\nThat's all fine if we're shopping for sneakers, she said. But those same algorithms apply to our politics, too. We'll willingly follow ideas that pop up down the rabbit hole, and those who want their messages to spread know the more controversial, the better.\n\nI don't think that Mark Zuckerberg set out with the idea that, 'I wanna create a platform where the most outrageous, salacious, hate-filled speech wins.' I don't think that was his goal, Eisenstat said. But instead of holding the platform responsible for what somebody posts, it's the tools that I want them held responsible for, not the actual speech on the platform, except for, of course, if the speech breaks the law.\n\nBut it sounds like what you're saying, though, is that'd be changing the business model, pretty much, said Cowan.\n\nOne hundred percent.\n\nBig Tech has promised more transparency, and better enforcement of their own rules when it comes to spreading dis- and mis-information.\n\nFacebook removed more hate speech this year than ever before; Twitter, the same. Even Tik-Tok is being more proactive.\n\nBut that will likely not be enough going forward.\n\nCowan asked Ramesh Srinivasan, Can we trust them to do this kind of regulation on their own, though?\n\nNo. We should not be trusting Twitter or any private company to magically serve the public interest. I think, if anything, the last four years have taught us that we can't do that.\n\nA year before the end of his second term, President Bill Clinton talked about the challenges of regulating the internet: That's sorta like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\n\nThat was more than two decades ago. Times change, but the value of good stewardship doesn't.\n\nThis discussion is about how we wanna live, how we wanna be, as a country and as a people, said Srinivasan. It's a discussion about our humanity, at the end of the day. I do believe that you can force people to tie their actions to beliefs that might be a little more virtuous than their mere bottom lines.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by John Goodwin.

How 5G is ushering in a new era of possibilit...\n\nHow 5G is ushering in a new era of possibility\n\nHow 5G is ushering in a new era of possibility\n\nThe new generation of wireless technology known as 5G is exciting industry leaders who believe the rapid advancements toward faster internet speeds will spur innovation in every sector of the U.S economy.\n\nOn Monday night, Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg spoke for nearly an hour about 5G during his keynote address at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, or CES, which is being held virtually this year. 5G was also featured in more than a dozen breakout sessions throughout the week as industry leaders discussed its impact on businesses, government, and consumers.\n\nBut researchers caution that the promises of life-changing applications will take years and that lawmakers in Washington might not be ready to lead the way.\n\nThe big bet right now is to try to get all the infrastructure in place so that the next revolutionary app and service ecosystem can spring forward in the United States before it does somewhere else, said Stan Adams, deputy general counsel and open internet counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nAttendees and workers chat beneath a 5G logo at the Quectel booth at CES 2020 at the Las Vegas Convention Center on January 8, 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mario Tama / Getty Images\n\nInstalling new cell towers or upgrading existing ones with hundreds of thousands of pizza-box-size antennas on every block, and making available more radio frequencies for those towers to connect to, are critical for the technology's growth, experts say.\n\n5G frequencies are available in the low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrums. In the past few years, the Federal Communications Commission has opened up 5 gigahertz of spectrum for 5G use. There's an ongoing auction to open up an additional 280 megahertz of space in the mid-band spectrum, which has so far raised a record $80 billion, a senior FCC official told CBS News.\n\nThe official said opening up new spectrum space has been challenging because much of the space is already in use.\n\nIndustry leaders agree that the full benefits of 5G will be unlocked with more high-band, millimeter wavelength frequencies becoming available. The high-band category provides the most bandwidth and fastest speeds, but the signal doesn't travel far and can't penetrate walls.\n\nThat means having a tower on every corner of every block and maybe on every floor of every building, according to Adams. As a result, companies deploying the infrastructure often get locked into regulatory battles with cities and towns.\n\nThe issue from the industry side is the new towers they're rolling out for 5G are not the 300 foot tall metal structures, Adams said, adding, they're not the same kind of thing that most of the permitting and review rules had in mind when they were developed.\n\nLocal governments want to preserve their ability to review and collect fees on new deployments in their towns, while the companies want to roll out 5G in a timely fashion and cost effective way, Adams explained.\n\nThe FCC said it has adopted reforms to help speed up the deployment of 5G.\n\nIn 2018, the commission prevented localities from charging more than it costs them to process and manage applications. More recently, the FCC said state or local officials must approve any request for modification of existing towers that doesn't substantially change the dimensions of existing structures within 60 days.\n\nDr. Nicol Turner Lee, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution and Director of the Center for Technology Innovation, told CBS News that a centralized committee to help with policy while engaging all the stakeholders will reduce regulatory battles and improve rollout efficiency.\n\nHead of Samsung Next Global, Senior Vice President Emily Becher speaks during a Samsung press event for CES 2020 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center on January 6, 2020 in Las Vegas, Nevada. David Becker / Getty Images\n\nWe need to sit back and figure out how to take all the Post-It notes and put them all into a complete plan so we can move forward cohesively around it, Turner Lee said. She added that it is imperative for the incoming Biden administration to think about a 5G taskforce that would bring all these pieces together.\n\nBut some, like technology consultant and CEO of the Palmer Group Shelly Palmer, say lawmakers in Washington aren't tech savvy enough to usher in a new era of advancement.\n\nWe've got lawmakers and legislation that are years behind the technology, Palmer said. While it's always been that way, we've never had technology accelerating at a pace like this.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has increased the need for connectivity as Americans work and study from home. Beyond a fast internet connection, experts say 5G will support advances in telemedicine, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and much more.\n\nPalmer said the really cool stuff like mixed reality, which is the combination of physical and digital objects co-existing and interacting in real time and other applications that will rely on the fast speed and low latency of 5G, is going to take a few years.\n\nIn 2010, when 4G wireless technology hit the market, it took two to three years before life-changing applications like ride-sharing and video conferencing became commonplace .\n\nAdams said 5G will also bring about the ability to deploy literally millions of tiny little sensors on all kinds of infrastructure and goods that will lead to a lot more data collection across networks. Additionally, cell towers on every block means more precise geolocation of individual cell phones.\n\nAs you magnify and amplify your data collection mechanisms, privacy suffers. We've seen that over and over again, Adams said.
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran on Wednesday snubbed a proposal agreed to by four influential oil producers to cap their crude output if others do the same. A senior Iranian Oil Ministry official said Tehran has no intention of freezing oil output levels.\n\nMahdi Asali, Iran's OPEC envoy, said his country will in fact keep increasing its crude exports until it reaches levels attained before international sanctions were imposed on Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\nAsali's comments came as Iran's oil minister was expected to hold three-way, closed-door talks in Tehran with his counterparts from Iraq and Venezuela.\n\nOn Wednesday, Venezuela joined Russia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in conditionally agreeing to cap their output at last month's levels in order to halt a slide that has pushed oil prices to their lowest point in more than a decade. Oil prices recently plummeted below $30 a barrel, the lowest in 13 years.\n\nThe four countries made their announcement following an unexpected meeting on Tuesday in the Qatari capital of Doha that pointedly did not include Iran. They agreed to act only if other producers made similar freezes.\n\nData curated by FindTheData\n\nAsali said the fall in oil prices should be blamed on oversupply and that it was up to Saudi Arabia and others to cut down production to boost oil prices. He said the four nations that participated at the Doha gathering could stabilize oil prices on their own -- if they cut their production by 2 million barrels a day.\n\nThese countries increased their production by 4 million barrels when Iran was under sanctions, Asali was quoted as saying by the Shargh daily. Now it's primarily their responsibility to help restore balance on the market. There is no reason for Iran to do so.\n\nIran is eager to ramp up its exports now that sanctions related to its nuclear program have been lifted, saying recently it aims to put another 500,000 barrels a day on the market. Figures from the International Energy Agency show it pumped 2.9 million barrels daily in December, before sanctions were lifted.\n\nIran used to export 2.3 million barrels per day, but its crude exports fell to 1 million in 2012.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iran's petroleum minister, Bijar Namdar Zangeneh, signaled the Islamic Republic has no intention of giving up its share of the market. He acknowledged that global markets are oversupplied, but he said Iran will not overlook its quota, according to comments carried by his ministry's Shana news service.\n\nEven with Iran's cooperation, it was unclear if the Doha plan would be enough to put a floor under prices.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates' energy minister, Suhail Mohamed al-Mazrouei's, refused on Wednesday to discuss the Doha proposal after giving a keynote address at a Dubai conference in which he mentioned low oil prices only in passing.\n\nI will only talk about this conference, he said, before smiling and walking away from reporters' shouted questions.\n\nHe later took to Twitter to say his country's oil policy is open to cooperate with all producers toward mutual interest of the market stability and we are optimistic on the future.\n\nKuwait, another Gulf OPEC member, signaled it was willing to go along with the Doha plan.\n\nAnas al-Saleh, Kuwait's deputy premier, finance minister and acting oil minister, said in a statement his country was committed to the proposal if others join in: Kuwait hopes the agreement would provide a positive atmosphere for oil prices, and for the market to regain balance, and calls on all to support stability of markets.
The pace of hiring in the U.S. jumped in February before the novel coronavirus spread across many parts of the country, new federal data show.\n\nEmployers added about 273,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday, surpassing forecasts. The gains were spread widely among sectors. Health care, food services, construction, professional services and government all saw job gains. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%.\n\nAverage hourly pay for workers increased 3% from the year before, an indication that wage growth remains muted despite the nation's low unemployment rate.\n\nThe unemployment rate has been at or below 4% for two years, and wage growth is, if anything, decelerating, Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said on Twitter.\n\nBusinesses and economists are viewing the latest job numbers with caution, wary of any slowdown from the spread of the coronavirus. The surveys that form the basis of the government's monthly employment report were taken in the second week of February, before the outbreak had begun to spread widely across the U.S.\n\nPre-virus, the labor market was strong, if weather-assisted. Now, trouble is coming — fast, Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics told investors in a note.\n\nThe industries most responsible for the surge in hiring are service industries that rely on face-to-face interaction, and they stand to suffer if many people in the U.S. practice the social distancing health authorities have advised.\n\nAnother strong jobs report underscores the resilience of the U.S. services sector — which accounts for the lion's share of employment — at least until February, said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. The fallout from China's sharp downturn and the changes in U.S. firms and households behavior in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including reduced travel, will doubtless take a toll on service sector and broader U.S. economic activity from March.\n\nThe Federal Reserve slashed interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency cut intended to protect the economy from coronavirus-related disruptions. Since then, Fed officials have warned that the outbreak is already taking a toll.\n\nWe are now also hearing reports that some businesses here in the United States are being affected by supply disruptions and weakening demand, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said in a speech in New York City on Thursday ahead of the government's latest employment report. As people take precautions, we're seeing concerns around the tourism and travel sectors, in particular.
During his first day in office, President Joe Biden swiftly moved to dismantle major parts of the Trump administration's immigration legacy by halting border wall construction, pausing most deportations from the interior of the U.S., rescinding travel and immigration restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries and safeguarding protections for so-called Dreamers.\n\nMr. Biden signed 17 executive orders — including six immigration-related directives — shortly after being sworn in on Wednesday as the country's 46th president. The Department of Homeland Security also announced it would implement a 100-day moratorium on deportations for immigrants in the U.S. facing removal, and suspended the Trump administration's policy of requiring non-Mexican asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings.\n\nThrough the flurry of early actions, Mr. Biden signaled his willingness to roll back former President Donald Trump's restrictive immigration measures using the same executive authority that his predecessor invoked to enact more than 400 unilateral changes.\n\nOne memo signed by Mr. Biden ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to safeguard the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that offers works permits and deportation relief to more than 640,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nMr. Trump's attempts to suspend DACA were all blocked in court, but a federal judge in Texas has yet to rule on a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general who are asking for the program to be declared unlawful.\n\nAnother directive issued by Mr. Biden revoked Mr. Trump's travel and immigration restrictions on a group of 13 countries, most of which are predominantly Muslim or African. The order instructed the State Department to begin processing visa applications from the 13 countries.\n\nThose actions are a stain on our national conscience and are inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all, Mr. Biden wrote, referring to Mr. Trump's restrictions, which he accused of being discriminatory.\n\nMr. Biden, through another directive, rescinded an order signed by Mr. Trump in January 2017 that broadened who immigration agents could arrest and deport. Mr. Biden said his administration would reset policies governing who immigration officials should prioritize for deportation.\n\nThe policy of my Administration is to protect national and border security, address the humanitarian challenges at the southern border, and ensure public health and safety, Mr. Biden wrote. We must also adhere to due process of law as we safeguard the dignity and well-being of all families and communities.\n\nIn a memo Wednesday, Acting DHS Secretary David Pekoske issued interim guidance instructing U.S. immigration officers to focus on deporting immigrants found to pose a national security threat, recent border-crossers and those who have been convicted of certain crimes.\n\nPekoske also said the deportation freeze would not apply to migrants who arrived in the U.S. after November 1, 2020; those who pose a national security risk or are suspected of terrorism or espionage; and immigrants who agree to voluntarily leave the country.\n\nA fourth presidential directive formally halted Mr. Trump's bid to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census figures used to award states seats in Congress.\n\nThrough a proclamation, Mr. Biden also ordered officials to pause barrier construction along the U.S.-Mexico border within seven days and ended the national emergency declaration Mr. Trump used to divert billions of dollars in military funding to finance his long-promised wall. During his last week in office, Mr. Trump had extended the proclamation through February 2022.\n\nAn additional memo extended work permits and deportation protections for certain Liberian immigrants in the U.S. It also required U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite adjudication of green card applications from Liberians who are eligible for a legalization program passed by Congress in 2019.\n\nAmong other changes, Mr. Biden and his advisers have also vowed to use executive authority to terminate the public charge rules that make it tougher for low-income immigrants to obtain green cards and end several asylum policies Mr. Trump instituted along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn its statement announcing the suspension of the Remain in Mexico policy, DHS noted that emergency rules adopted by the Trump administration that allow U.S. border authorities to rapidly expel migrants without a court hearing would remain in place until further notice.\n\nDHS instructed migrants waiting in Mexico to remain where they are, pending further official information from U.S. government officials.\n\nIn a not-so-thinly-veiled warning to would-be migrants, the department also noted that those apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border going forward would not qualify for the immigration overhaul Mr. Biden has proposed to Congress, which, if passed by Congress, would allow millions of undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. to obtain legal status.
Faced with at least two lawsuits accusing it of selling defective merchandise, apparel seller LuLaRoe is making it easier for consumers to get refunds.\n\nUnder what LuLaRoe describes as its Make Good Program consumers who bought an item between Jan. 1, 2016, and April 24, 2017, and are displeased with the quality of their garments can get a full refund, credit or exchange. Starting April 25, under its Happiness Policy, customers can get a refund, credit or exchange for up to 30 days after their purchase and may get a credit or exchange within 90 days. Certain restrictions apply, and receipts are required.\n\nSome people continue to have questions specifically about the quality of LuLaRoe leggings. We are sorry if we haven't adequately addressed their concerns. We hope these policies will, LuLaRoe CEO Mark Stidham said in a statement announcing the new refund and exchange policy. We want everyone to be happy and believe they received a fair value from their LuLaRoe clothing purchase.\n\nThe policy marks a change in tactics for the Corona, California-based multilevel marketing firm, known for colorful leggings. LulaRoe has repeatedly said its defective merchandise rate was below average for the apparel industry and insisted that its products get multiple quality assurance checks before going on sale.\n\nDespite those assurances, many customers have complained on social media and elsewhere that its leggings are prone to rips and tears after only minimal use.\n\nA private Facebook group with more than 26,000 members is chock full of posts from irate LuLaRoe customers. The two customers who started the group, Julie Dean of Boston and Suzanne Jones of Lafayette, California, are the lead plaintiffs in a March 23 federal lawsuit in California that accuses LuLaRoe of knowingly selling defective merchandise. A similar case was filed April 17 in state court in Oregon that accuses the company of unfair trade practices. Both cases are seeking class-action status.\n\nStidham, who co-founded LuLaRoe with his wife DeAnne in 2013, sounded less contrite in an interview with Business Insider, insisting that while he sympathized with customers who have experienced problems, he didn't think a blanket apology was necessary.\n\nChristina Hinks, a former LuLaRoe consultant who's a fierce critic of the marketer, argued on her blog that Stidham appeared to be waffling about whether the company owed anyone an apology.\n\nGenerally speaking as a businessperson, it's commonplace to issue an apology to a customer or group of customers that have felt betrayed and improperly served by a company, Hicks said. No, not LuLaRoe.\n\nLuLaRoe sales have reached $1.8 billion over the past year, making it one of the world's largest multilevel marketers, an industry that includes companies such as Amway, Herbalife (HLF) and Pampered Chef.\n\nA spokesman for LuLaRoe said neither Mark nor DeAnne Stidham were available for comment.\n\nBesides the product defect cases, LuLaRoe also faces a lawsuit alleging that it charged customers sales tax in states that don't collect the fees on sales of clothing. LuLaRoe also has been accused of infringing on a lion design created by a Hungarian artist. The company has denied wrongdoing in both cases.\n\nAnother suit, by a Utah payments processor Complete Merchant Services (CMS), accuses LuLaRoe of violating a contract that made CMS the exclusive supplier of credit and debit payments to LuLaRoe. CMS provided the point-of-sale system that LuLaRoe had blamed for wrongly collecting sales taxes in states that didn't charge it on clothing purchases.\n\nCurrent and former consultants have also accused LuLaRoe of understating the risks and overstating the potential rewards available to consultants. To join LuLaRoe, representatives are required to order a minimum of $5,000 worth of product, which is high for the direct-sales industry.\n\nAccording to internal LuLaRoe data provided to CBS MoneyWatch, more than 70 percent of LuLaRoe representatives sold less than $5,000 worth of retail goods in February.
Why are some people more successful in their careers than others?\n\nAs it turns out, our fates may be sealed long before we enter the workforce. A new study finds that birth order plays a big role in determining who makes it to the corner office.\n\nThe study by Sandra Black, an economist and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, contends that firstborn children are more likely than their siblings to eventually rise to become CEOs, government officials and others in high-ranking positions. Black collaborated on the study with Erik Gronqvist and Bjorn Ockert of Sweden's Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy.\n\nThe trio analyzed Swedish government data on a half-million men born between 1952 and 1982. Among other things, they examined the results of psychological and intellectual tests administered by the government before the men began their mandatory military service around the age of 18. (Sweden ended compulsory military service for men in 2010, although the country soon plans to reintroduce it in response to global security challenges.)\n\nBlack and her colleagues discovered that firstborn kids (in this case strictly men) were more likely than those with older siblings to have certain personality traits that breed career success, at least by traditional measures. Firstborn kids tend to grow up to be emotionally stable, persistent, outgoing and willing to take responsibility and initiative, according to the study.\n\nBlack has studied the effects of birth order in the past and come up with similar findings. In previous research, she analyzed data from Norway and discovered that, even within the same family, firstborn children tend to outshine their younger siblings when it comes to educational attainment, earnings, intellectual prowess (as measured by IQ) and health outcomes.\n\nHer latest study, which also analyzed occupational data, found that the personality differences between firstborns and their siblings have an influence over their career paths. Firstborn children are much more likely than their siblings to become managers. Meanwhile, later-born kids are more likely to be self-employed as adults.\n\nWhat's more, firstborns are more likely to hold jobs that require strong social and leadership skills as well as conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability and extraversion. Such jobs include chief executive officers, legislators and senior government officials.\n\nWhile the study focused on men, Black and colleagues found similar patterns for women when they analyzed occupational data.\n\nInterestingly, the effects of birth order are influenced by gender differences among siblings. For instance, a boy with an older brother is even less likely to possess certain career-enhancing personality traits than a boy with older sisters. And boys with older brothers are more likely to enter creative fields, such as writing and music, than boys with older sisters, according to the study.\n\nWhy does birth order seem to make such a big difference? In the age-old debate over nature versus nurture, nurture rules the day here. In other words, first-born kids tend to have certain traits because of their experiences growing up, rather than because of physiological differences tied to birth order, according to Black.\n\nTo test to role of biology on personality differences by birth order, Black and her colleagues studied a subsample of families in which biological birth order is different than social birth order, owing to the death of a child or an adoption. In the end, they concluded that the birth order effect is driven entirely by environmental factors, or experiential differences among siblings.\n\nAs teenagers, firstborn kids are more likely to spend time reading books and doing homework than their siblings are as teens. Firstborns also spend less time watching TV or playing video games.\n\nWhile most parents try not to favor one child over another, the reality is that many fall short of that goal. According to the study, parents tend to spend less time discussing school work with their youngest children than they do with their older kids -- which suggests that, despite their best intentions, many parents invest more of their time in their firstborns.\n\nBlack said her study is intended to shed light on factors that influence outcomes for children. We are chipping away at understanding what determines children's outcomes and how it relates to family and environment, said Black.\n\nShe added: There's something about birth order that really matters on a whole bunch of different dimensions.
Everywhere President Trump looks, he sees a wall.\n\nAs he lobbies for money for his long-promised border wall, Mr. Trump keeps talking up other barricades. He's pointing to walls in Israel, at the Vatican, even at former President Barack Obama's house — though fact checkers have pushed back on the accuracy of some of his claims.\n\nWith bricks and mortar on his mind, Mr. Trump declared at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Walls work.\n\nHe added: There's a reason why politicians and wealthy people build walls around their houses and their compounds. President Obama recently built a wall around his compound.\n\nMr. Trump also tweeted that Obama's wall was 10 feet high. But while fencing has been added around the Obamas' spacious house in Washington's tony Kalorama neighborhood, there is no 10-foot wall.\n\nIt's all part of the president's effort to prevail in an increasingly difficult standoff with congressional Democrats over border funding that has produced a partial shutdown of the federal government.\n\nBut David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said there is little comparison between the demands for private security and border security.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to compare the two, said Bier, pointing to the difference between a home break-in and migrants trying to seek asylum.\n\nAnother favorite structure for Mr. Trump is the fortifications at the Vatican, which he has cited in the past as an argument for the wall and brought up again at the Cabinet meeting, this time making a moral argument.\n\nWhen they say the wall is immoral, well then you better — got to do something about the Vatican, because the Vatican has the biggest wall of them all, Mr. Trump said.\n\nMuch of Vatican City is off-limits to the general public but walls there do not block all access. St. Peter's Square is not behind any walls. The Vatican Museums are walled but the public may enter with a ticket and security screening.\n\nThe president's immigration policies have drawn criticism from Pope Francis, who has said in the past that anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is not Christian.\n\nFormer Trump aide Sam Nunberg said that in some of these examples, Trump was trying to argue that his opponents are saying do as I say, not as I do.\n\nTrump and allies have repeatedly cited barriers in Israel as proof that walls are effective. The president said this week he had recently spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, adding In Israel, as you know, they built a wall. He said 99.9 percent it works. And it would with us too.\n\nBier said a direct comparison with Israel's border security is challenging because the U.S. border is much longer and has different terrain, including mountains, raising questions about whether building a physical wall is the best approach.\n\nI think it's fair to say that border barriers make it easier to catch people who are coming into the country, Bier said. The question is whether it is as effective in areas where the president wants to build.\n\nWith no end to the border fight in sight, Mr. Trump is likely to keep up his wall commentary — although at times his rhetoric sends mixed messages.\n\nHis message Thursday: You can call it a wall. You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want.
President Donald Trump signed another executive order at the White House Monday morning, this one aimed at reducing the number of regulations.\n\nThe order requires two regulations to be removed for every new regulation added, making good on a promise he made during the campaign.\n\nIf you have a regulation you want, number one, we're not gonna approve it because it's already been approved probably in 17 different forms, Mr. Trump said as he signed the order Monday morning. But if we do, the only you have a chance is we have to knock out two regulations for every new regulation.\n\nThe text of the order released Monday afternoon by the White House states this is being done to reduce the burden the private sector has in complying with federal standards.\n\nIn addition to the management of the direct expenditure of taxpayer dollars through the budgeting process, it is essential to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations, the order reads. Toward that end, it is important that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.\n\nThe order requires that federal agencies self-identify which regulations to cut based on their estimates of the cost. The White House will then make the ultimate decision on the cuts, which do not apply to the military or national security. According to the text of the order, each agency will be given a total amount of incremental costs for new and existing regulations each fiscal year, which they are unable to exceed without express approval.\n\nMr. Trump signed the order surrounded by small business owners, Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus and policy advisor Stephen Miller. The White House released the full text of the order several hours later.\n\nMonday's order is Mr. Trump's sixth executive order since taking office on Jan. 20. During his first 10 days in office, he signed orders pertaining to the Affordable Care Act, the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and a temporary ban on travel to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries, which has\n\nMr. Trump spent Monday morning meeting with small business leaders, and is expected to spend the rest of the day having lunch with Vice President Mike Pence and meeting with various aides and advisers.
There's a trade war raging between the top two Democratic presidential contenders. Since Super Tuesday left two main candidates standing last week, Bernie Sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and opponent Joe Biden disagree. Trade has taken center stage this week, as the two men fight for delegates in the industrial Midwest.\n\nThough neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy, a decisive primary win in Michigan on Tuesday or next week in Ohio could signal how the Democratic Party will approach trade and the nation's economic agenda.\n\nAcross one of the nation's most iconic manufacturing states, Sanders has been taking swipes at Biden's positions on trade. He slammed then-Senator Biden's support of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which eliminated most tariffs between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and the 2000 China Trade Bill, which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations (PNTR) with China. Sanders voted against both measures as a House member and continues to rail against the policies today, a point highlighted by a Sanders ad, Decimated, that's up in every March 10th and March 17th primary state.\n\nIf we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements, Sanders told a Detroit crowd Friday.\n\nThis playbook may seem familiar to Democrats, since Sanders waged a similar campaign against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries in Michigan. He skewered her at a Democratic debate held in Flint, Michigan, two days before the primary.\n\nSecretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America. NAFTA, supported by the Secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide; tens of thousands of jobs in the Midwest. Permanent normal trade relations with China cost us millions of jobs, he said at the time.\n\nThe argument helped Sanders eke out a win over Clinton in the Great Lakes state, in a 1.5-point upset. Later, Donald Trump, too, consistently criticized Clinton over NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nSanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character.\n\nI worked with the unions as a member of the House of Representative to defeat NAFTA and to defeat PNTR with China. I can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in Montpellier, Vermont in opposition to NAFTA. I knew what it was gonna do. I knew that you cannot ask American workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in Mexico, Sanders said Friday in Detroit.\n\nThe senator hit the same note during campaign stops in Michigan over weekend.\n\nHe said in Flint Saturday, I heard, during that period in the '90s, I heard all of corporate America say, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' And all of the media said, 'You gotta vote for these trade agreements.' I stood with the unions, the working families of this country; I voted against those agreements! Joe Biden voted for those agreements.\n\nThe reviews of NAFTA are somewhat mixed, and a new version of the deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, is expected to be implemented soon, after Canada ratifies it. In 2013, the liberal think tank Economic Policy Institute projected that NAFTA caused, 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power. At the same time, Foreign Affairs estimates that 14 millions American jobs still depend on NAFTA. And a 2016 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission concluded the policy, had essentially no effect on real wages in the United States of either skilled or unskilled workers.\n\nBiden has rarely brought up North American trade policy on the stump since the Iowa caucuses, where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with China. Instead, he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members, even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of U.S. production to cheaper alternatives in Mexico, as General Motors did in March 2019, eliminating 1,700 hourly jobs in Ohio alone.\n\nHe stands by his NAFTA vote, arguing that no, it wasn't a mistake to vote in favor of the deal, he said last May in Iowa. He has labeled himself a fair trader, rather than a free trader.\n\nWe should treat other countries in a way they treat us, Biden said, Just deciding it's all about trade deficit balancing...we need to do more.\n\nThe most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the USMCA agreement, an idea Barack Obama pitched in the 2008 primary. Biden said in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections, issues that he told CBS News last summer he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed from the beginning of the NAFTA negotiation in the '90s.\n\nSanders unapologetically voted against USMCA, stating that protections did not go far enough.\n\nOn this matter Sanders stood alone. His one-time Democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit. Elizabeth Warren, Sanders' fellow progressive in the race, promised to support the USMCA and bargain for a better deal if elected.\n\nThe distinction was noted by some in the Rust Belt.\n\nFrank Hammer, a retired 32-year General Motors employee, participated in a panel discussion on trade with Sanders Friday in Detroit.\n\nYou were the singular, sole [candidate] that said — consistent with your past positions — that you were opposed to [USMCA] and I think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers, Hammer said. And I'm so grateful. Thank you.\n\nOn the trail Biden has dismissed China's status as an economic powerhouse, pointing out basic challenges Chinese leaders face, like providing enough potable water for their people, and boasting about the U.S. dominance in the future. The idea that China is going to eat our lunch, it's bizarre, he said in Iowa in late January, suggesting that rather than viewing China as an existential threat, the U.S. could help China with some of its problems. The U.S. can compete with China and insist that they follow the rules, he proposed.\n\nUnlike the Social Security ads the Biden campaign is running in Michigan, two Biden advisers tell CBS News after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage Sanders on the intra-party trade war.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure voters are looking for a vote-by-vote analysis, one Biden adviser told CBS News, They're looking for a nominee.\n\nOthers agree that focusing on trade—even in Michigan—may not be as beneficial as Sanders hopes.\n\nI think it's a miscalculation from Sanders, Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, told CBS News, citing a Gallup poll that shows 67% of self-described Democrats say that NAFTA has been beneficial for the United States.\n\nWolfers said that with the election of President Trump everything is a little upside down in terms of trade politics because the GOP incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any Democratic nominee is likely to make.\n\nRelatively speaking, Democrats are now the pro-trade party, Wolfers added.\n\nBiden has a strong argument to make in Michigan on manufacturing, though, since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the Obama administration's 2009 auto bailout of two of the big U.S. automakers, General Motors and Chrysler.\n\nJust like the automobile industry came back, Detroit is going to come back, Biden said in 2014. It's not only an important city but it's an iconic city. It symbolizes the manufacturing might of the United States of America.\n\nAccording to an invitation obtained by CBS News, Biden is expected to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in Michigan this week, co-hosted by Cynthia and Edsel Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford.\n\nAdam Brewster contributed reporting for this story.
A woman from Phoenix and a man from Cleveland who were once strangers now share an unlikely friendship and a love for a baby girl.\n\nRubin Swift was in Phoenix to pick up his newborn daughter, Ru-Andria. He had just been granted custody of his daughter and was going to fly home to Cleveland with her.\n\nBut when Swift arrived at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport, he was told that he and Ru-Andria could not return home yet. Frontier Airlines' policy states that babies under seven days old cannot fly. Ru-Andria was just four days old.\n\nSwift says he had a note from the hospital saying the baby was clear to fly, but the airline would not allow it. He left the airport with no place to stay for the next three days.\n\nThat's where Joy Ringhofer comes in. Ringhofer volunteers at Banner University Medical Center, where Ru-Andria was born. She met Swift when he came to pick up his new daughter.\n\nI was rocking her when her father came in and we sort of made a connection right away, Ringhofer told CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO.\n\nJoy Ringhofer holding Ruben Swift's daughter, Ru-Andria KPHO\n\nWhen Swift left the airport he decided to call Ringhofer for help. Her answer surprised him.\n\nI didn't expect her to say, 'I'm coming to get you and take you home.' So, I'm thinking, 'She is going to drive me back to Cleveland?' But she actually brought me to her house and [is] feeding me and making sure my baby is alright, Swift said.\n\nSwift stayed with Ringhofer for the next three days, until Ru-Andria was able to fly.\n\nI had such a strong feeling that I needed to do this for him, Ringhofer said. I know he was a kind and safe man to have in my home and he has been a perfect gentleman.\n\nWe're two different colors and she opened up her door and it never was an issue. My color was never an issue, Swift said. She loves my baby... My baby was with her all night. She stayed up with her. Who does that?\n\nJoy Ringhofer holds baby Ru-Andria. KPHO\n\nSwift was able to fly back to Cleveland with Ru-Andria on Tuesday, but he promised to come back to Phoenix and visit the stranger who had become like family.\n\nShe's fed me, she took care of me. She's the grandmother to my child now. She looked after me, the new dad said about his baby's new grandmother. I'm grateful.
President Trump will not resign. Nor will he turn power over to Vice President Pence and ask him for a pardon, according to top White House advisers who have spoken with the highest ranking members of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Pence and chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\nThe president continues to ask senior advisers about his ability to pardon himself before he leaves office. It's a power that is untested and by no means settled. A Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel memo from 1976 says that the president cannot pardon himself or herself, so it would be a gamble. The president worries about his legal exposure post-presidency, but not necessarily related to the assault on the Capitol.\n\nGOP sources close to the White House and congressional leadership say the threat of a second impeachment is real and could find some support among House Republicans, who are facing pressure from lobbying firms and corporations that help fund their campaigns. They have made it clear they will cut ties with Republicans who back Mr. Trump in any impeachment vote.\n\nBut on the other side is the Trump-inspired GOP base that threatens to launch primary challenges against House Republicans who vote for impeachment.\n\nRepublicans wish House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wouldn't force the question, but the speaker, protecting the institution of Congress and maximizing political advantage, will force Republicans to choose. Privately, top Republican sources concede if the mob that attacked the Capitol had been egged on by a Democratic president, a GOP House speaker would do the same thing.\n\nMr. Trump continues to believe any impeachment talk is strictly partisan; top outside advisers keep telling him it not partisan, but institutional. Congress was under attack this week, and some Republicans feel it's necessary to push back with impeachment vote — for now and for history.\n\nThe idea of invoking the 25th Amendment remains remote and is mostly intended to keep the president in line in the remaining few days of his presidency. But top cabinet officials still holding positions, chief among them Mnuchin and Pompeo, have not refuted the suggestion internally or externally in order to send a signal to Mr. Trump that it's an action they'd be willing to take if he cannot control himself.\n\nTop advisers to the White House now know Mr. Trump was generally and initially pleased with the protest at the Capitol, seeing it as a reflection of his supporters' love for him, and not as an assault on the legislative branch and the foundations of a democratic republic. This misunderstanding has fed cabinet and White House resignations and denunciations.\n\nThere is likely not enough time to impeach and remove Mr. Trump from office. Bringing the Senate back would require unanimous consent of all senators, since it is in recess until January 19, based on another unanimous consent agreement.\n\nHowever, the sense from many GOP sources is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be equivocal about how he'd address an article of impeachment — for the sole purpose of warning Mr. Trump that the power to remove him from office is no longer in the president's control.\n\nOn Friday it became clear to President Trump and those within the Trump Organization — Donald Trump Jr., and Eric and Ivanka Trump — that substantial reputational damage had been done to the Trump brand. This week, the online-store platform Shopify removed all of Mr. Trump's campaign merchandise from its platform, saying those web pages violated the Canadian company's policy against sellers promoting violence.\n\nThe closure by some firms of Trump-branded online stores forced a rapid search for other online venues and brought about an awareness that Mr. Trump's post presidency may be damaged by the events of this week.\n\nMembers of the Trump family actively looked for other online safe harbor. The sense among those close to the Trump family was that the president had begun to realize that in a post-White House world, the viability of the Trump brand was now vulnerable. Those close to the family and still somewhat sympathetic to the president consider the protection of the brand possibly the best pressure point available to ensure Mr. Trump leaves the White House and government comparatively quietly and allows a peaceful — if not personally endorsed — transition to take place.
TOPEKA, Kan. -- Less than three weeks after GOP Gov. Sam Brownback signed tightened rules for Kansas amusement parks, lawmakers who were spurred by the death of a colleague's son are proposing to delay the law's implementation.\n\nThe House Federal and State Affairs Committee met Thursday afternoon and passed tweaks to the new requirement that amusement rides be inspected by qualified, outside inspectors. They also voted to push off the implementation until July 2018. The law was set to go into effect July 1.\n\nCaleb Schwab, 10, was killed while on the world's tallest water slide at a Kansas City, Kansas, water park. Family photo\n\nRepublican Rep. John Barker, who chairs the committee, has called the old regulations some of the loosest in the country. He led a charge to change the law after Republican Rep. Scott Schwab's son, Caleb, was killed last year on a water slide in Kansas City.\n\nBarker said the Department of Labor asked for some minor changes and to delay the new law's implementation. He said some local carnival operators were concerned they wouldn't be ready to comply by July 1 and wouldn't be able to run their rides.\n\nThe Department of Labor regulates amusement parks and will have to develop rules, regulations and permit processes in accord with the new law.\n\nDeputy general counsel J.L. McFarland also said in a statement that the department asked lawmakers to delay implementation over concerns that some parks wouldn't be able to come into compliance in time.\n\nWe look forward to developing the necessary permitting and registrations systems so that Kansans are afforded the safety protections of the original bill, McFarland said in the statement.\n\nBrownback said he had heard that people were hoping to adjust the law and its impact on rural, county-fair groups.\n\nLawmakers nearly unanimously supported the stricter inspection requirements for amusement parks when the bill passed both chambers last month.\n\nThe new law requires that rides be inspected by a qualified inspector who is either an inspector certified by one of several national boards; a certified engineer with two years of experience in the amusement park field, at least one of those in inspections; or someone with five years of experience in the amusement park field, two of those in inspections. The new law also requires parks to report injuries.\n\nKansas' previous law allowed parks to do their own inspections. That policy came under scrutiny after Caleb, who was 10, died last year on Schlitterbahn Water Park's Verruckt water slide, a 17-story tower that was dubbed the world's tallest.\n\nSchwab declined to comment on the implementation delay. He stayed quiet on the bill until he gave an emotional endorsement on the House floor last month.\n\nThe Schwab family has settled for nearly $20 million with the park's owners, the manufacturer of the raft that carried riders down the slide, a general contractor and a company that consulted on the slide.\n\nThe Verruckt water slide remains closed and will be torn down at the completion of an ongoing investigation by the Kansas attorney general's office.\n\nWhen it initially opened, the park advertised the ride for only people 14 years and older but was later removed from its website. The combined weight of the passengers in the raft must fall between 400 and 550 pounds.\n\nTwo other women, unrelated to Schwab, were in the raft when the boy died. They suffered injuries to their faces, according to authorities.\n\nThe apparent shift away from the age restriction could be one of the questions in determining liability, according to CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman, who said the park owner and ride designer face potential legal troubles over Schwab's death.\n\nThere's also anecdotal evidence of problems with the ride's safety equipment. Parkgoer Paul Oberhauser told CBS News his belt came off while riding with a friend and his 9-year-old son.\n\nAs soon as I hit the bottom of the first curve the shoulder strap just kind of busted loose, Oberhauser said.\n\nHe said he had to grip handles by his legs to hold on and told park staff what happened.\n\nThey kinda said, 'Oh no, really,' or something, 'Yes, that's not good.' And so it sounded like you know they were gonna do something about it, Oberhauser said.
DALLAS -- Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings called the ghost calls plaguing 911 the city's number one priority, CBS Dallas / Fort Worth reports.\n\nT-Mobile engineers arrived in Dallas Wednesday morning, vowing to stay until the problem is fixed. Rawlings, however, was unable to explain why the sense of urgency didn't come sooner.\n\nI don't know, he said. I'm very disappointed with that. It should have been taken care of, in my mind, some weeks ago, definitely last week.\n\nDallas resident David Taffet confronted Mayor Rawlings on Wednesday to say it took 20 minutes to get through to 911 after his husband stopped breathing last week.\n\nAt one point, Taffet was disconnected. He was placed on hold when he called back. Paramedics promptly arrived after he finally got through but his husband later died at a hospital.\n\nGhost calls happen when a person on a T-Mobile cell phone makes a single call to Dallas 911, but that call somehow gets caught in a loop. This means the emergency call center begins receiving hand-up calls from that same number and the loop can continue to happen over and over.\n\nEmergency policy dictates that 911 operators respond to every hang up call. In the case of ghost calls, this wastes the time of operators while leaving other callers on hold.\n\nDallas City Manager T.C. Broadnax said the ghost calls began in October.\n\nIn November, the City notified T-Mobile of the large number of calls it was receiving. In January, both Dallas city leaders and the wireless carrier say they believed the problem was fixed, only to see it re-appear in the last few weeks in even larger numbers.\n\nLast Saturday, there was an experience and spike in calls we had not seen before, said T.C. Broadnax.\n\nIt was during that spike that 6-month-old Brandon Alex's 19-year-old babysitter tried getting through to emergency services. She never did and Brandon later died from an injury still under investigation.\n\nThe baby's mother, Bridget Alex, said, When I came and picked up my son she [babysitter] was still on hold with 911.\n\nT-Mobile claims adjustments made Wednesday and Thursday should improve, if not solve, the issue.\n\nThe City of Dallas reported that T-Mobile phones were spontaneously dialing 911 leaving a babysitter unable to reach 911 on Sat., March 11, 2017, because their lines were swamped that evening. CBS Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nWe provide the same service all across the country, explained T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray. There is something unique in this complex, this system here, that we have not been able to identify.\n\nThe only other city experiencing a similar problem, Denver, has seen it on a much smaller scale, according to documents provided to CBS News.\n\nMeanwhile, officials in Dallas say they are increasing 911 staffing, asking officers trained to take calls to work overtime and offering training to other city staff. We have to make sure it never happens again, said Rawlings.\n\nAny Dallas resident calling 911 and who is placed on hold is being asked to remain on the line, because hanging up to redial will only bump them to the back of the line.\n\nA spokesperson for the FCC said the federal agency is aware of the issue and that its review is ongoing.\n\nA state report released in 2014 by the Commission on State Emergency Communications notes 911 service will erode as new digital technology is introduced. The report says that's because existing 911 systems in Texas and other states are based on wireline technologies established decades ago.\n\nThe phantom calls are happening at the same time Dallas-based AT&T experienced its own 911 problems. AT&T cellphone customers in Texas and other states were unable to call 911 for a time on March 8. The company has not explained the cause of the disruption.\n\nIn a T-Mobile statement provided to CBS News, the company says:
Police in Washington, D.C., on Thursday released photos of about two dozen people they say are persons of interest in Wednesday's riot inside the Capitol.\n\nAll but one of the images depict apparent supporters of President Trump inside the Capitol and suspected of unlawful entry. One shows a person outside the building, suspected of receiving stolen property. The person is holding a broken shard of what appeared to a wooden sign reading Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe FBI is also seeking the public's help identifying those who stormed the building Wednesday after Mr. Trump gave a speech nearby. The agency has received over 4,000 tips on its website.\n\nThe Justice Department has said a policy introduced last year to press sedition charges against those who damage federal buildings may be invoked in some cases stemming from Wednesday's chaos.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department arrested 68 people Wednesday and early Thursday morning, primarily for violating a curfew imposed by the city's mayor. All but one of those arrested lives outside Washington. The U.S. Capitol Police also arrested 14 people during the rioting.\n\nMichael Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney for D.C., told reporters his office has charged 40 people in D.C. Superior Court, mostly including crimes related to unlawful entry of the U.S. Capitol grounds, along with a handful of assault cases and eight firearms cases. Sherwin said the 40 cases included crimes over the past 36 hours, with some occurring prior to the Capitol breach.\n\nSherwin's office presented an additional 15 federal criminal cases Thursday afternoon to a federal magistrate judge directly in relation to the attack at the Capitol. The office was expecting to release criminal affidavits with more detailed information later Thursday night.\n\nThe federal charges included unauthorized entry into the Capitol, theft of materials from inside the complex and several weapons charges. Sherwin said one man had a military-style semi-automatic rifle and 11 Molotov cocktails ready to go.\n\nThis was obviously a very dangerous situation, and we are aggressively trying to address these cases as soon as possible, Sherwin said.\n\nSherwin said all options were on the table when it comes to considering more serious riot or sedition-related charges for those arrested and anyone else who may have been involved with planning the attack. When asked whether he would be examining the role of Trump's comments to his supporters prior to the assault, Sherwin repeated: We're looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role, and if the evidence fits the elements of a crime, they're going to be charged.\n\nHe said federal investigators were scouring social media and video footage in order to identify more suspects. He said he believes the 15 federal cases are just the beginning.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department is looking for the people pictured below. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Conte called the group a violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, and said the images have been shared with local hotels and airports, as well as the FBI.
CIA director Gina Haspel has named Cynthia Didi Rapp to the agency's senior-most position atop the Directorate of Analysis. Rapp, a career intelligence official with an analytic background, is not the first woman to hold the role, but she is the third female official and the fifth career intelligence official Haspel has named to a leadership post at the agency in recent months.\n\nDidi Rapp brings broad, deep expertise from across the agency and the intelligence community to her new role as the head of our Directorate of Analysis, said CIA Director of Public Affairs Brittany Bramell. With her engaging leadership style and reputation for objectivity, Didi will excel in leading our talented analytic cadre.\n\nRapp previously served as deputy chief operating officer at CIA and headed up intelligence integration at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where she helped oversee the production of the President's Daily Brief (PDB). The third woman to hold the post since 2002, Rapp succeeds longtime incumbent Richard Hoch, who will serve as chief strategy officer for the agency.\n\nAs head of the Directorate of Analysis – which was once known as the Directorate of Intelligence – Rapp will oversee the agency's efforts to synthesize intelligence from the CIA's operations arm and other elements of the intelligence community, including open source data and satellite imagery. Agency analysts take raw intelligence from abroad, offer regional expertise and put it into context. They interact directly with policymakers throughout government and play a lead role in informing the PDB.\n\nThe Deputy Director for Analysis is one of the most important positions at CIA, said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy and acting director who also served as the agency's head of analysis from 2008 to 2010. Didi has extensive experience as an analyst, she has deep integrity, and she has the confidence of the director — all things necessary for someone to effectively lead the DA. Morell is also a CBS News senior national security contributor.\n\nRapp will be the first to newly assume the role since former CIA Director John Brennan's modernization push, which shifted some oversight away from larger directorates and funneled them into discrete Mission Centers focused on some of the thorniest issue areas in national security. Under that structure, analysts and operations officers work side by side.\n\nAnalytic issues facing the agency range from the threat posed by near-peer competitors like Russia and China, to persistent proliferation concerns from North Korea and Iran, to the national security implications of climate change, to incorporating big data and other analytic inputs into its assessments, said David Priess, a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. The new DDA will have to see how well analysis is being incorporated into ops, and vice versa.\n\nRapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores Haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge. A former clandestine operations officer who in May became the first female director of the CIA, Haspel has surrounded herself by officials with whom she has worked for decades. Seldom in history have the agency's most senior ranks been filled with as many CIA veterans and insiders.\n\nThirty-four-year agency veteran Beth Kimber became the first woman to lead the agency's directorate of operations earlier in December. Sonya Holt, who likewise spent over three decades at CIA, assumed the role of chief diversity and inclusion officer in August, when similarly long-serving CIA officials Vaughn Bishop, now deputy director, and Andy Makridis, now chief operating officer (COO), were also named.\n\nYou've got a director, deputy director and COO who are all career intelligence officers, and two-thirds of whom are analysts – you'd have to go back decades for that to be true, Priess said. This is also leadership at CIA at a time of unprecedented institutional tension with the president – it's meaningful that it's not being run by the president's own people, but by career officers. This could have gone in a very different direction.\n\nHaspel's immediate predecessor, Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named Haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, Brian Bulatao, to serve as COO. Brennan chose associates from within the Treasury Department and National Security Council to be his deputies.\n\nThough some former intelligence officials have raised concerns about excessive insularity and the risks of creating an echo chamber at the agency, others praised the relative conservatism of Haspel's choices at a time when the churn of personnel at a number of other government institutions have plunged them into turmoil.\n\nThe leadership positions that she has filled give tremendous credibility to the idea that she is trying to keep the agency down a professional, honest path, said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who resigned in protest and with some controversy at the start of the Trump administration. They help ensure the agency remains a bastion of unvarnished analysis and operational proposals that are in our best interest.\n\nNow is not the time to radically remake the agency, Price, who is now a fellow at the New America Foundation, said. There's enough going on outside its walls.\n\nAlthough the CIA and Haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding President Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's security clearance last August; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, Haspel's own involvement in the CIA's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. In doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors.\n\nPompeo, during his year-long tenure as CIA director, made both public appearances and unusually personal statements with some regularity. He sent a letter to the Harvard Kennedy School announcing his withdrawal from a speaking engagement and denouncing the school's decision to name Chelsea Manning, a former soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks, a visiting fellow.\n\nPompeo also personally wrote and sent a condescending missive to Benjamin Wittes, the editor-in-chief of Lawfare, after Wittes publicly questioned the contents of a holiday card Pompeo distributed to CIA's workforce.\n\nFor her part, in the nearly eight months since she became director, Haspel has issued only a handful of brief statements and made public remarks essentially once – at her alma mater, the University of Louisville, in September.\n\nI think Director Haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, Morell said. In this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-Trump or anti-Trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table.\n\nFormer senior CIA official Carmen Medina, who spent over three decades at the agency and served as Deputy Director of Intelligence, agreed.\n\nWith this administration maybe the best thing she can do is make sure all the 'I's are dotted and 'T's are crossed – it's a difficult time, Medina said. You need a really firm foundation and to make sure everything is being done well before you have the space to innovate.\n\nMedina also applauded Haspel's decision to name both more experienced analysts and more women to senior leadership roles. Overall, about half of the agency's analysts are women, as are about half of the directorate's senior managers, according to those familiar with the agency's make-up.\n\nIt's unfortunate we still have to talk about gender, because it's not really relevant to the quality of the work – it's relevant to the diversity of the work. But I think she's very brave for appointing so many women, Medina said of Haspel's leadership choices.\n\nShe doesn't have to do that, and the fact that she is doing it is kind of awesome.
Michael Ellis, the recently installed general counsel at the National Security Agency, was placed on administrative leave Wednesday because his appointment is now the subject of an investigation by the Defense Department Inspector General, according to two sources familiar with the matter. There is also a separate allegation that he mishandled classified information.\n\nLast week, acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller directed that the position be filled by Ellis, a last-minute move that quickly sparked criticism from Democrats.\n\nI think it's very clear this is part of the administration's effort to embed people in the civil service who are political and partisan actors who don't belong there, said Representative Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, on Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday denounced the hire in a letter to Christopher Miller, the acting Defense Secretary under former President Trump. Pelosi cited reports that Ellis was involved in an effort to launder intelligence information and also shield information about Mr. Trump's call with the president of Ukraine that ultimately led to his impeachment.\n\nThe efforts to install him or 'burrow' him into a highly sensitive intelligence position 72 hours prior to the beginning of a new Administration manifest a disturbing disregard for our national security, Pelosi wrote.\n\nEllis declined to comment. A spokesperson for the NSA said, It's not our policy to comment on personnel issues.\n\nThose close to Ellis, a former lead attorney for Republican congressman Devin Nunes, defend him as a career intelligence professional, and one of the principal staffers who compiled the 2016 bipartisan House Intelligence Committee report on the Snowden leaks.\n\nAdditional reporting by David Martin.
Merck (MRK) will pay $830 million to resolve a federal class-action lawsuit involving shareholders and the painkiller Vioxx, which the drugmaker pulled from the market years ago over safety concerns.\n\nMerck said Friday that the case involved people who purchased its securities between 1999 and 2004. The litigation focused on statements Merck made regarding Vioxx's cardiovascular safety.\n\nMerck & Co. Inc. removed Vioxx from the market in 2004 after evidence showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe Justice Department has said that the Kenilworth, New Jersey, company made false statements about the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx to increase sales.\n\nFederal officials also have said that Merck began illegally promoting Vioxx as a rheumatoid arthritis treatment almost immediately after it was approved in 1999. Companies are not allowed to market drugs for conditions that have not been approved by the FDA.\n\nThe company pleaded guilty several years ago to a misdemeanor count of violating marketing laws and made a $950 million payment. It also settled around 50,000 patient lawsuits in November 2007 for $4.85 billion.\n\nMerck said Friday that it will wind up paying about $680 million for the latest settlement, after accounting for insurance policy funds. The company plans to record a charge for that payment in its fourth quarter report.\n\nMerck said the settlement doesn't constitute an admission of any liability or wrongdoing. The company still faces individual securities lawsuits tied to Vioxx.\n\nMerck shares fell 1.8 percent, or 93 cents, to $50.87 in trading Friday
A historic moon mission is setting the stage for a new space race, this time between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe Chinese Chang'e 4 lander captured the orange-tinted landscape on the far side of the moon Wednesday, becoming the first space probe to ever land there. It's a breakthrough that, as CBS News' Mark Strassmann reports, may intensify the U.S.-Chinese rivalry.\n\nChina intends to be a space power – to walk on the moon, and eventually, establish a lunar base.\n\nWhat a change it's been from a year ago, several years ago, when the question was, can China innovate? Can China keep up? And now it's more of a question of are they reaching parity and what happens next? said Isaac Stone Fish, an expert on U.S.-China relations.\n\nAll six crewed Apollo flights beginning in 1969 landed on the moon's near side. Twelve men, all Americans, left flags and footprints. The last time was in 1972, as NASA then shifted its focus to low-earth orbit.\n\nIn 2017, President Trump signed Space Policy Directive No. 1: the moon is again America's top spaceflight priority.\n\nIt's time to take all of what we've learned on the International Space Station and go the next step for a permanent presence on and at the moon, said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine.\n\n\n\nWe're the only nation that's done it. All these other nations want to do it, Bridenstine said.\n\nHe believes a lunar presence is critical to deeper space exploration.\n\nSo this gives us an opportunity to prove how are we going to live and work for a lengthened period of time on a world that's not our own, Bridenstine said.\n\n\n\nNASA's planning for a solar-powered mini-space station to orbit the moon called the Lunar Gateway, the next step to a Mars mission. Partners will include other countries and other companies. Their competition? China.\n\nWe are reaching a new era of U.S.-China relations that seems to be more defined by competition than collaboration … and a space race could certainly be a part of this future, Isaac Stone Fish said.\n\nA glimpse into that future just landed on the far side of the moon.
More businesses around the U.S. are declining to accept cash payments, forcing customers to use credit and debit cards only.\n\nAt busy New York City lunch spot Two Forks, owner Michael Kaplan has banned cash to keep the lines moving faster. With every cash transaction, the payment process was slowing down significantly, he said in an interview with CBS News.\n\nYet while cash is now barred at the fast-casual restaurant, most customers seem to be embracing the switch.\n\nI never have cash on me -- I always have my card on me. So for me, it's pretty much easier, said Two Forks customer Alex Yanoff.\n\nFrom coffee shops to larger restaurant chains, more businesses are now banning bills. Proponents say eliminating hard currency is not only faster, it also reduces the risk of robberies.\n\nBut not everyone's buying into it. Opponents argue that refusing to accept legal tender discriminates against people without cards, who may be on low incomes. And in some places, efforts are underway to actually ban businesses from banning cash.\n\nChicago Alderman Edward Burke is pushing the City Council to make it illegal for businesses to embrace the practice. It's user-unfriendly, he told CBS in an interview late last year. It's elitist, and it shouldn't be permitted. The policy is already illegal in Massachusetts.\n\nDos Toros Taqueria owners Leo and Oliver Kremer said they rarely have to turn away cash-loyal customers.\n\nIt just feels like that's where everything is going. China is there already. India is halfway there. A lot of parts of Europe are mostly cashless, Leo Kremer told CBS News.\n\nTo encourage establishments to go cashless, Visa (V) has offered thousands of dollars to small businesses to only take cards. None of the businesses featured in this story say they were given any money to go cashless.
Support for clean energy in the U.S. has risen to record highs in recent surveys, but adoption of those clean energy sources is lagging far behind.\n\nWhile a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, their energy production was mostly replaced by natural gas instead of renewable energy like wind or solar, according to a report by independent research provider Rhodium Group. The report estimates that in 2018 the U.S. posted the largest increase in heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions since 2010, up 3.4 percent.\n\nBefore 2018, the U.S. had three straight years of emissions declines despite economic growth. But last year the economy grew faster, illustrating the difficulty of kicking our addiction to fossil fuels when our economic engine revs up. Rhodium Group explains, Some of this was due to unusually cold weather at the start of the year. But it also highlights the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies.\n\nMany Americans support making that transition. A March 2018 study, Politics and Global Warming, by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities, finds majority support across party lines for developing cleaner energy.\n\nIn that survey, 87 percent of registered voters (94 percent of Democrats and 79 percent of Republicans) favor funding more research into renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nThese views are echoed in a recent Pew Research Center study which found large majorities of Americans favor expanding at least two types of renewable sources to provide energy: solar panel (89%) and wind turbine (85%) facilities.\n\nAt a time when political polarization divides Americans on so many issues, these points of agreement may seem surprising. But agreement is not enough. For an energy transition to happen, policy and incentives are needed.\n\nFor people, corporations, and governments to take action they're going to have to have incentives, William Nordhaus, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on putting a price on carbon, wrote in a recent Yale Alumni Magazine article.\n\nIncentives require specific government policy action. We can find clues to why this is tough to come by deeper in the Pew study. While Democrats are generally supportive of policies to combat climate change, most Republicans are skeptical. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans or Republican-leaning voters say these policies either make no difference or do more harm than good, and 57 percent think such policies harm the economy.\n\nBut there are signs of growing support for market-driven solutions among younger conservatives. According to the Pew study, Republican Millennials are less inclined than their elders in the GOP to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. For example, 75% of Republicans in the Baby Boomer and older generations support the increased use of offshore drilling, compared with 44% of Millennial Republicans.\n\nFormer Congressman Ryan Costello (R-Pennsylvania) just left the U.S. House of Representatives and is now the new managing director of Americans for Carbon Dividends, an advocacy affiliate of the Climate Leadership Council. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed this week he laid out the case for a Republican plan to tackle climate change, citing, in part, the need to keep younger Republicans on board.\n\nIn his new work, Costello is aiming to advance a plan by former GOP Secretaries of State James Baker and George Shultz, fine-tuning the details of a bill which would put a fee on carbon dioxide emissions and return the proceeds to individuals and families on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe plan claims, Over two-thirds of American households would be financial winners under a carbon dividends program, including the most vulnerable. The aim is to increase the cost and disincentivize use of products that generate carbon pollution, encouraging industries and consumers to opt for greener alternatives instead.\n\nEven though the group says its carbon fee plan would return money to Americans' pockets, it may still be seen as a tax. In reply, Costello says, I learned in Congress that no major policy solution comes without simplified rebuttals, which often aren't accurate. If families are receiving a check every three months and carbon emitters are transitioning to the cleaner energy, everyone comes out ahead.\n\nEd Maibach is a professor at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication and co-author of the Politics and Global Warming study. Commenting in general on policy, not specifically on the Climate Leadership Council plan, he says his public opinion research finds strong support for a range of climate solutions policies, even when we mention the costs explicitly. Sometimes, policy support actually increases when we mention the estimated cost per household, for example, about 50 cents per day, probably because the projected costs strike people as a good deal.\n\nBesides work on the bill, Costello plans to spend his time on education, advocacy and building grassroots coalitions that allow people to kick the tires on climate policy.\n\nHe recognizes he has an uphill battle selling this to Congress. But he says, You can't solve big challenges without ambitious solutions. That's what this seeks to do.
As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the U.S., President Donald Trump last Friday said he had a plan to help the 43 million Americans with federal student loans to repay: a waiver on their interest payments. But experts say the plan may not offer much immediate relief because monthly payments could remain unchanged.\n\nOur understanding is that this will mean monthly payments won't go down meaningfully (if at all) for borrowers, but payments will go entirely toward paying down the principal of the loan, Michele Streeter, a policy analyst for the Institute for College Access & Success, a think tank for higher education, said in an email.\n\nThere's much that is unknown about the president's call for an interest waiver on student loans, such as when the waiver will end or if a loan's mix of principal and interest owed will be recalculated (or re-amortized) at the end of the waiver period. But the bottom line is that the interest waiver is unlikely to provide immediate relief to graduates if they lose their jobs or their income is reduced as the coronavirus tramples the U.S. economy. Instead, bigger measures are needed, such as a pause payment on all federal student loans for at least six months, Streeter said.\n\nTo be sure, the interest waiver will help some college grads, but it's most likely to benefit those who continue to hold their jobs and can continue to manage their monthly payments through an economic downturn. Borrowers will also pay down their loans faster by putting more toward principal.\n\nBut it doesn't help low-income workers who are already struggling to pay back their loans, noted Charlie Javice, the founder and CEO of Frank, a company that helps students fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.\n\nThis helps upper and middle-income families, she said. It will be the higher segment that says, 'This is the best opportunity ever because I don't have interest to pay.' A lot of MBA students and med school students should be helped.\n\nThe Department of Education said it's still working out the details of the plan, and didn't provide information about how the waiver would or wouldn't change monthly payments. The interest rate on all federally held student loans will be set to zero, a spokesman added. It won't include commercial loans or loans held by other parties, he added.\n\nCancelling student loans would provide a massive stimulus to our economy, which has been slammed by coronavirus. And it would help millions of families stay afloat financially while helping close the racial wealth gap. https://t.co/Rb4atEQonK pic.twitter.com/FRuH2qe0or — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 13, 2020\n\nThe waiver is effective immediately, according to the education department, which said it plans to release more details as soon as it is able to do so.\n\nEven if it doesn't lower monthly payments, the interest waiver will impact many of the roughly 43 million borrowers who owe the federal government about $1.4 trillion. Student loan debt in the U.S. now stands at more than $1.6 trillion, with the remainder held by private lenders. State loans and loans from lenders such as Sallie Mae won't be covered by the waiver, according to the New York Times.\n\nBorrowers who can't pay because of financial hardship may need to go into forbearance. The good news: The interest that normally accrues during forbearance will be waived, which means the borrower's balance won't grow as they put their loan repayment on pause.\n\nAs the impact of the coronavirus deepens, there may be more calls on the federal government to take bigger action., especially if troubled industries like airlines and hotels seek multi-billion-dollar bailouts.\n\nOn Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, said canceling all student loans would provide a massive stimulus to our economy, which has been slammed by coronavirus.
It's no secret that millions of Americans are approaching their retirement years with meager savings and high anxiety about their financil security. And a recent study from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave reveals steps that Americans are willing to take to get their retirement back on track.\n\nThe overwhelming majority (88 percent) of people surveyed said their primary objective is peace of mind, while just 12 percent say they want to accumulate as much wealth as possible. But peace of mind means different things to different people:\n\n57 percent report they want to live comfortably within their means.\n\n39 percent say they want to have the financial resources to live the life they choose.\n\n34 percent want to feel they could handle a major unexpected expense.\n\n28 percent don't want to feel overwhelmed by debt.\n\n25 percent want to feel confident they won't outlive their money.\n\n17 percent want to provide for their family if something happens to them.\n\nActually, this is a good planning list -- it would be best to address all of these goals.\n\nOne challenge is that talking about your finances is generally taboo in America: Only 8 percent of survey respondents feel personal finances can be discussed openly, while the remainder consider the topic a private matter or one that can be discussed with a spouse or partner or only very close family and friends. In fact, many people would rather talk about their preferences for end of life than their financial status.\n\nIt would certainly help if older workers and retirees would share their ideas and insights with their family and friends. After all, they're all in the same financial boat.\n\nWhat changes are people willing to make to enhance their financial security in retirement? Here are 11 steps the survey found Americans are willing to take:\n\n90 percent would be willing to cut back on their expenses. Perhaps they can focus on spending just enough to meet their basic living needs and what truly makes them happy.\n\n79 percent would seek financial advice. In this case, they'll want to make sure their advisers are qualified and act in their best interests.\n\n77 percent would increase the use of tax-protected retirement accounts.\n\n75 percent would seek expert advice on how to pay lower taxes. Note that this may not be a good use of time for Americans with meager savings, since they could already be in a very low tax bracket when they retire.\n\n70 percent would buy a financial product that provides guaranteed income for life. These people would be wise to seek low-cost income annuities that maximize their lifetime income.\n\n66 percent would sell real estate or other personal belongings. Finding the best way to deploy home equity is a good use of time for older workers and retirees who own a home but have modest retirement savings.\n\n64 percent would postpone taking Social Security. This is a smart move for virtually all retirees.\n\n60 percent would take Social Security as early as they could. This strategy works only if you're sufficiently disciplined to save your Social Security benefits, don't spend them, and are skilled or lucky enough to out-earn the stock market. Oh, it also helps if you die fairly quickly after you retire. If you live to average life expectancies or longer, you'll receive more income over your lifetime by delaying the start of your benefits, and that doesn't even count the extra benefits to a surviving spouse that results from delaying the start of your benefits.\n\n43 percent would withdraw the cash value from a life insurance policy. Such people would want to explore their options: Many policies allow the holder to convert the policy's cash value into a lifetime annuity.\n\n39 percent would ask social services or charities for support.\n\n25 percent would declare bankruptcy.\n\nIn addition to taking these steps, older workers would be wise to develop a strategy for generating lifetime retirement income, explore their options for continuing to work and make sure they have adequate medical insurance that supplements Medicare.\n\nAs you can see, your financial security in retirement has many moving parts. It's well worth spending hours and days planning for peace of mind in your retirement years, so you can go enjoy the rest of your life.
On Wall Street, when it's the Federal Reserve vs. Apple, looks like the Fed holds sway. Despite the positive vibes from Apple's (AAPL) strong earnings report earlier in the week, stocks slid on Wednesday after the Fed's latest policy announcement.\n\nAs expected, the central bank left its benchmark interest rated unchanged in a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent -- but it added language acknowledging the recent rise in inflation, which lays the groundwork for another rate hike (this year's second) in June. The Fed's preferred core inflation measure, known as PCE, which filters out volatile food and fuel prices, was within spitting distance of the Fed's 2 percent target in March.\n\nThe Fed added that it would treat its inflation target as symmetrical, in that the monetary policymakers would allow an overshoot for a time, winking at a status quo pace of rate hikes despite growing inflationary pressure. However, the market interpreted the statement as carrying a hawkish bias. That pushed the dollar higher and stocks lower.\n\nCurrently, the futures market assigns 45 percent odds of three more quarter-point rate hikes before the end of the year, and that's something that hasn't been fully priced into stocks and bonds. Compare that to 30 percent odds of this happening just one month ago.\n\nThis aligns with the expectations of the team at Capital Economics, who note that the Fed was always unlikely to signal a major shift at its May meeting, but that it doesn't change their forecast for a total of four rate hikes in 2018.\n\nAnother reason for the market's wariness was the Fed's acknowledgment of some recent softening of the economic data -- with consumer spending slowing notably in the first quarter -- but it remained steadfast in its outlook for gradual interest rate increases.\n\nNo doubt this is because over the near term, inflation is accelerating to the upside: On a three-month annualized basis, core PCE inflation is rising at a 2.6 percent rate. That's near a decade high as prices at the producer level are surging, increasing the chances inflation continues to heat up into the summer months.\n\nAnother factor is the ongoing tightening in the job market, as employment costs rose in the first quarter at the fastest pace in 10 years. We'll learn more on Friday when the federal government's April jobs report is released. Analysts are looking for a payroll gain of 190,000 with a slight reduction in the unemployment rate to 4 percent. However, Wall Street is likely to give the closest scrutiny to the figures on wage gains.
Seventh-grader Lizeth Villanueva was shocked as she looked down at the disturbing honor listed on a certificate she received at a mock awards ceremony at school last week.\n\nMost likely to be a terrorist, the certificate reads, along with her name in capital letters.\n\nSeveral teachers, who held the ceremony at Anthony Aguirre Junior High in Channelview, Texas, laughed as she picked up the award. Villanueva told CBS affiliate KHOU-TV the teacher who signed it considered it a joke.\n\nBut to Villanueva, the certificate was no joke.\n\nShe said that some people might get offended, but she doesn't really care about our feelings, Lizeth said. She was laughing about it.\n\nSeventh-grader Lizeth Villanueva says her Texas junior high school named her most likely to be a terrorist at a mock awards ceremony. KHOU\n\nVillanueva's mom, Ena Hernandez, was appalled when her daughter came home with the paper certificate.\n\nI read it twice. I'm like, 'What is this?!' she said. It doesn't look good at all, especially coming from a teacher, a grown-up woman. It doesn't look good because everything that's going on right now.\n\nThe Channelview Independent School District told CBS News the teachers involved are being disciplined according to district policy, but would not elaborate, as the incident is still under investigation.\n\nThe Channelview ISD Administration would like to apologize for the insensitive and offensive fake mock awards that were given to students in a classroom, the school district said in an emailed statement. Channelview ISD would like to assure all students, parents and community members that these award statements and ideals are not representative of the district's vision, mission and educational goals for our students.\n\nVillanueva, who hasn't been back to class since receiving the certificate, hopes the school district will take further action against the teacher.\n\n[She should] get fired, at least, or something, she said.
With many U.S. cities in varying stages of shutdown for parts of 2020, travel was reduced — and so were greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report by the Rhodium Group, an economics and policy research provider, the drop in annual emissions was the nation's largest since the World War II era.\n\nThe group tracked the real-time energy and emissions impact of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020. It estimates that the historic shock to economic activity led to a 10.3% drop in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. This finding is based on preliminary economic and energy data.\n\nThe reduction means the U.S. is now expected to exceed the target set in a 2009 U.N. agreement known as the Copenhagen Accord of cutting emissions 17% below 2005 levels, with 2020 instead hitting 21.5% below 2005 levels.\n\nHowever, it still falls short of the goal the U.S. set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of a 26% to 28% drop below 2005 emissions levels. While President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in 2019, President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to rejoin it. Still, even with 2020's reduced emissions levels, the U.S. does not appear to be on track to meet the agreement's 2025 goal as economic activity picks back up, according to Rhodium Group.\n\nThe report also notes that the decline in emissions came with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering.\n\nWe expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the US economy, emissions will likely rise again as well, the report says.\n\nRhodium Group reported that three of the leading sectors for greenhouse gas emissions — transportation, electric power, and industry — were also among the sectors hardest-hit by pandemic-related shutdowns. For example, with travel far less in demand during the pandemic, emissions from the transportation sector declined 14.7% between 2019 and 2020.\n\nWhile the emissions decline was welcomed, the trend is not expected to last. Unfortunately, 2020 tells us little about what we can expect to see in 2021 and beyond, the report says.\n\nIf the pandemic and economic recession had never happened, the report estimates U.S. emissions would have dropped only about 3%, driven mainly by the decline of coal-fired power plants as well as lower heating demand due to a warmer winter.\n\nEmissions also shrunk globally during 2020, with the world expected to see the largest yearly global decline ever — as much as 17%, according to an estimate by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\nBut by September 2020, the WMO was already reporting a rise back to nearly pre-pandemic levels.\n\nExperts say the short-term decline will not be enough to make a lasting impact on the acceleration of climate change.\n\nThe lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph, WMO president Petteri Taalas said. We need a sustained flattening of the curve.\n\nWMO also warned the shutdown's impact on the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere was no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations.
This week, 60 Minutes reports on the tragic death of Warren Weinstein, an American aid worker in Pakistan, who was abducted from his home in Lahore in 2011 and ultimately killed accidentally in a U.S. drone strike.\n\nIn the previously unaired clip above, his wife Elaine tells Lesley Stahl the U.S. government should have done more to help her husband. They kept saying they were doing everything possible, she says. But if they went within their rules, then there was nothing possible.\n\nWarren Weinstein and his wife, Elaine\n\nWhen Elaine, who lives in Rockville, Maryland, was contacted by her husband's captors, they demanded $4 million for his release. She says she was willing to do whatever it took to bring her husband home. As far as I was concerned, give them the money, she tells Stahl. Let's get this over with. Give them the money.\n\nBut the FBI and a private firm she hired to help with the negotiations warned her that the captors might keep upping the price. They told her she needed to demand proof that Warren was alive and carefully orchestrate the ransom exchange. Her negotiations with the captors dragged on for months, and they eventually agreed to accept $243,000 for his release. Yet when she gave them the money, they didn't return him.\n\nThe U.S. government has a policy of not negotiating with terrorists, which has left many families of hostages feeling abandoned. Elaine met with top U.S. officials including Secretary of State John Kerry and Deputy National Security Advisor Lisa Monaco. She says she told Monaco about another concern: The FBI suspected Warren was being held in North Waziristan, a prime target for U.S. drone strikes, and she worried he could be killed.\n\nThe following year, those fears were realized. Warren and an Italian aid worker were accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting terrorists in January 2015. It was like, 'I told you so,' Elaine tells Stahl. I was worried about it from the first day.\n\n60 Minutes interviewed Senator James Risch (R-Idaho) of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is tasked with overseeing the secret drone program, about what went wrong. In the unaired clip below, he says the government takes these operations very seriously. He himself reviewed all the evidence that was available after the strike, he says, and found nothing amiss.\n\nYou saw nothing that indicated that anything but a terrorist was in that compound? Stahl asks him.\n\nThat is correct, he says. And I can tell you that had there been a scintilla of evidence, I am absolutely convinced that the operation would not have taken place.\n\nStahl also asked Senator Risch about media reports that there have been hundreds of civilian casualties due to drone strikes in Pakistan alone. In the clip below, Risch says the numbers are wildly exaggerated, but he can't comment on the actual numbers because the drone program is classified. Independent groups that monitor the drone strikes, like the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, refute the U.S. government's claims that these strikes are very precise with minimal casualties.\n\nStahl points out that if the numbers are, in fact, exaggerated, the government would benefit from revealing them. Risch agrees. But that is not my call to make, he says. Sixteen blocks up Pennsylvania Avenue, there's someone who you can talk to about that.\n\nIn reporting this story, 60 Minutes obtained never-before-seen call recordings, chat messages and video, including the video below, which was sent by Warren's captors to Elaine in 2012 during the ransom negotiations.\n\nThe private hostage negotiation firm working with Elaine called it a typical hurry up pressure tactic in a log reviewed by 60 Minutes. In the video, a haggard-looking Warren urges Elaine to pay the ransom.\n\nI know that you find it difficult, but I think we have to trust them, Warren tells his wife. I believe they're going to free me and they'll keep their word.
TOKYO - European shares fell Monday as oil prices slipped back below $32 a barrel while Asian markets were buoyed for a second day by stimulus hopes.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent to 9,717.15 and France's CAC 40 lost 0.7 percent to 4,306.61. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.6 percent to 5,863.96.\n\nWall Street looked set for a tepid open: Dow futures were down 0.2 percent and broader S&P 500 futures were essentially flat.\n\nA rally in battered crude oil prices that began Friday appears short-lived. After modest gains earlier in the day, U.S. crude was down $1.10 to $31.09 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Friday, it shot up $2.66 to $32.19 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, lost $1.11 to $31.07 a barrel. It gained $2.93, or 10 percent, on Friday to $32.18 a barrel in London.\n\nMarkets have rallied on hints of further easing by the ECB and speculation that the BOJ will follow suit. But there has been no major change in fundamentals to support the rally, and the concern is if and when it fizzles out, markets could even drop below their recent lows, Angus Nicholson of IG said in a commentary.\n\nOn Friday European Central Bank head Mario Draghi said the bank has a lot of options to boost inflation and is determined and willing to act. On Thursday Draghi suggested the ECB will consider more stimulus action at its next meeting in March. The signals from Europe also spurred expectations that the Bank of Japan would consider adding to its already lavish stimulus.\n\nInvestors shrugged off trade data for December released Monday that showed exports fell for three straight months, though imports fell at a faster pace thanks to the collapse in oil prices. The December trade surplus of 140.2 billion yen ($1.2 billion) compared with a deficit of 379.7 billion yen in November and a deficit of 665.6 billion yen in December 2014. Share prices were supported by speculation the central bank may opt for further monetary easing at a two-day policy meeting that starts Thursday.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent to 17,110.91 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.4 percent to 19,340.14. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent to2,938.51 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.8 percent to 5,006.60. South Korea's Kospi was up 0.7 percent at 1,893.43, and shares in Taiwan, New Zealand and Southeast Asia also were higher.\n\nThe dollar edged down to 118.30 yen from 118.79 yen on Friday. The euro rose to $1.0826 from $1.0799.
BEIJING -- China's rubber-stamp lawmakers on Sunday passed a historic constitutional amendment abolishing a presidential two-term limit that will enable Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely. The amendment upends a system enacted by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982 to prevent a return to the bloody excesses of a lifelong dictatorship typified by Mao Zedong's chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.\n\nThis marks the biggest regression in China's legal system since the reform and opening-up era of the 1980s, said Zhang Lifan, an independent Beijing-based political commentator.\n\nI'm afraid that this will all be written into our history in the future, Zhang said.\n\nVoting among the National People's Congress' nearly 3,000 hand-picked delegates began in the mid-afternoon, with Xi leading members of the Communist Party's seven-member all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee in casting their votes. He placed his orange ballot paper in a red box bearing the official seal of state placed front and center on the stage inside the cavernous hall.\n\nDelegates line up to cast their votes during a plenary session of the National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, on Sun., March 11, 2018. AP\n\nRank-and-file deputies then rose to vote on the floor of the hall as jaunty instrumental music played. Ten minutes later, the process had ended and delegates were asked to return to their seats while the votes were counted.\n\nShortly after 3:50 p.m., the results were read out over the public address system and flashed briefly on a screen in the hall. The delegates voted 2,958 in favor, with two opposed, three abstaining and one vote invalidated.\n\nThe constitutional amendment item has passed, the announcer declared to polite applause.\n\nThe 64-year-old Xi appeared to show little emotion, remaining in his seat with other deputies to listen to a report on the work of the congress delivered by its outgoing chairman.\n\nThe slide toward one-man rule under Xi has fueled concern that Beijing is eroding efforts to guard against the excesses of autocratic leadership and make economic regulation more stable and predictable.\n\nThe head of the legislature's legal affairs committee, Shen Chunyao, dismissed such concerns as speculation that is ungrounded and without basis.\n\nShen told reporters the party has accumulated extensive experience over its 90-year history that has led to a system of orderly succession to maintain the vitality and long-term stability of the party and the people.\n\nWe believe in the future that we will continue with this path and discover an even brighter future, Shen said.\n\nThe amendment also inserted Xi's personal political philosophy into the preamble of the constitution and phrasing that emphasizes the leadership of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nIt is rare nowadays to see a country with a constitution that emphasizes the constitutional position of any one political party, said Zhang, the political commentator.\n\nIn a sign of the issue's sensitivity, government censors have aggressively scrubbed social media of expressions ranging from I disagree to Xi Zedong. A number of prominent Chinese figures have publicly protested the move, despite the risk of official retaliation.\n\nOfficials have said the abolishing of the presidential term limits is aimed only at bringing the office of the president in line with Xi's other positions atop the Communist Party and the Central Military Commission, which do not impose term limits.\n\nWhile some scholars questioned the wisdom of the move, others said they saw value in sending the message that Xi would be setting policy for many years to come.\n\nIn fact, the more Xi Jinping's position is consolidated and the longer his governing time is to last, the more secure it is for the continuity of the policies, said Liu Jiangyong, a professor at Renmin University's School of International Relations.\n\nThe move is widely seen as the culmination of Xi's efforts since being appointed leader of the party in 2012 to concentrate power in his own hands and defy norms of collective leadership established over the past two decades. Xi has appointed himself to head bodies that oversee national security, finance, economic reform and other major initiatives, effectively sidelining the party's No. 2 figure, Premier Li Keqiang.\n\nIt has crushed faint hopes for political reforms among China's embattled liberal scholars and activists, who now fear even greater repression. China allows no political opposition in any form and has relentlessly persecuted independent groups seeking greater civic participation. Leading Chinese officials have meanwhile repeatedly rejected any chance of adopting Western-style separation of powers or multiparty democracy.\n\nTo be sure, Xi's confident, populist leadership style and tough attitude toward official corruption have won him a significant degree of popular support.\n\nZhao Minglin, 32, a vice president of an investment firm in Beijing, said it was easier for Xi to carry out his ambitious vision of raising living standards in China if more power were concentrated in his hands.\n\nI will definitely support this constitutional amendment and this government. This is a powerful and strong government, Zhao said. He added, however, that he was concerned that the public discourse lacked a space for dissenting voices.
A newly elected Virginia congresswoman is displaying a transgender pride flag outside her Washington office.\n\nRep. Jennifer Wexton, a Democrat from the 10th District in northern Virginia, was sworn in on Thursday. The pink-, blue- and white-striped flag is displayed at the door to her office, along with the U.S. and Virginia flags.\n\nIn a statement, Wexton said she's displaying the flag because she has family members and friends who are transgender. Chief of Staff Abigail Carter said Wexton is an aunt to a transgender person.\n\nThis is personal for me. We're talking about my family and friends. I want everyone in the trans community to know that they are welcome and loved even in the face of this administration's attacks, Wexton tweeted Friday.\n\nSince the flag went on display, Wexton said she's received messages of support and appreciation from across the country.\n\nVirginia state delegate Danica Roem, the first transgender person elected to the state legislature, thanked Wexton on Twitter. I'm proud to call you my congresswoman, Roem wrote.\n\nA transgender pride flag, right, is displayed along with U.S. left, and Virginia, second from right, flags, outside newly elected Virginia congresswoman Rep. Jennifer Wexton's office in Washington on Jan. 4, 2019. Office of Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton via AP\n\nThe 116th Congress is the most diverse in history, and includes a few new LGBT members. Four new representatives are openly gay or bisexual, and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., is the first openly bisexual person in the Senate. There has never been an openly transgender person in Congress.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken steps to limit transgender people's rights, such as implementing a policy barring transgender people from serving in the military. A federal judge ruled in favor of the Trump administration on this issue last week. The case may now go to the Supreme Court.
A spiraling controversy over anti-Semitic comments and conspiracy theories has roiled the Washington city government, seemingly getting worse with every public attempt to ease the tensions.\n\nThe issue nearly derailed a City Council meeting Tuesday morning and resulted in the resignation of a city official who organized a disastrous unity rally that featured a speaker who called all Jews termites.\n\nAt the heart of the debacle is City Councilman Trayon White, who ignited a firestorm on March 16 by posting a short video on his Facebook page claiming that an unexpected snowfall was because of the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters.\n\nFellow council members and Jewish community leaders accused White of spreading an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about Jewish control of world events. The Rothschilds, a prominent Jewish family whose banking dynasty dates back to the 18th century, are a frequent target of global conspiracy theories.\n\nWhite said he was unaware the Rothschild theory could be construed as anti-Semitic. The first-term African-American councilman reached out to try to mend fences, but several of the gestures seem to have made things worse.\n\nHe attended a Passover Seder and met with Jewish community leaders for breakfast over bagels and lox. He went on a guided tour of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum but abruptly left halfway through without explanation.\n\nThen video surfaced from a February meeting of top city officials that showed White floating a similar conspiracy during an innocuous presentation about the University of the District of Columbia. White posed a question centered on the claim that the Rothschilds controlled both the World Bank and the federal government.\n\nThe video shows city leaders in the room, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, awkwardly laughing it off and moving on, but the footage further upset Jewish community leaders.\n\nThen a further revelation: White had contributed $500 from a fund meant for his Ward 8 constituents to a Chicago event for Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam.\n\nFarrakhan and the Nation of Islam have a decades-old history of overtly anti-Semitic rhetoric. The Nation of Islam also does significant social and charitable work in black communities and retains some respect among those who don't share their views.\n\nLast week, supporters of White held a rally outside City Hall organized by a member of the city's public housing authority board. At the rally, a representative of the Nation of Islam called one of two Jewish DC council members a fake Jew.\n\nThe rally prompted calls for the resignation of Josh Lopez, the mayoral appointee who organized it. White did not attend the rally.\n\nThe events came to a head Tuesday morning before the council's regular session. A pre-session breakfast meeting ran an hour long as council members debated how best to respond to the rally and whether to call for Lopez's resignation. A local rabbi who was there as an observer shouted that the council members should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nThe council members then held an impromptu press conference outside the building where City Council President Phil Mendelson said that intolerant speech ... has no place in our city.\n\nAs the council returned inside and resumed its normal meeting, news broke that Lopez had resigned.\n\nBowser's office had called for Lopez to apologize but not resign, but she accepted the resignation and issued a statement calling for unity going forward.\n\nRepeated attempts to contact White for comment were unsuccessful. On Tuesday in City Hall, White pushed past a reporter who tried to ask him a question.\n\nCity officials hope the immediate controversy will die down with time, and White doesn't face re-election for another two years. The councilman may still face some sort of public censure if his contribution to Farrakhan is judged as a minor campaign finance violation. But the public and personal scars from the past few weeks could linger.\n\nYes, it got personal, said Councilman Jack Evans. I hope that relationships can be repaired, and they will be, and we will move on.\n\nThere's also the issue of White's relationship with the local Jewish community.\n\nI sincerely think he was just repeating conspiracy theories he had heard somewhere, said Rabbi Batya Glazer, who had met with White on the issue. It does mean he has an obligation to clarify what his position is.\n\nThe controversy has also poked at some long-dormant societal sore spots. The Rothschild conspiracy theory has persisted for decades on the fringes of both black and white culture in America.\n\nConspiracy theories are very dangerous ... because they exacerbate splits that already exist, said Andre Perry, who studies race and urban policy for the Brookings Institution. This isn't about one city council member. This is about how susceptible we are to tribalism that is created by a lack of trust in one another.
A year after it emerged, COVID-19 has now claimed more than 2 million lives worldwide. Experts have said for much of the last year that the only way to escape the coronavirus' grasp is through widespread vaccination. Weapons to win that war have been and continue to be approved by individual countries' drug regulators in record time.\n\nBut the pace — and a host of other unique factors — have left many around the globe with concerns about the vaccines' safety and efficacy.\n\nSafe, effective, and urgent\n\nNational regulatory bodies insist corners haven't been cut. They've reviewed and accepted data provided by pharmaceutical companies showing the major vaccines already approved, and those expecting a greenlight within weeks, are between 70% and 95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection.\n\nMore importantly, none of the trials carried out on the three vaccines to emerge first, by Pfizer/BioNtech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca, have shown any significant side effects.\n\nMillions of people have now had doses of all three of those vaccines, and apart from a small number of severe allergic reactions – mostly among those with a history of severe allergies – and the minor, short-term aches and pains associated with many long-established vaccines, the new drugs appear to be well tolerated.\n\nA survey published by the Pew Research Center in early December showed an increase in overall American confidence in the vaccines, with 60% saying they would get vaccinated.\n\nThere are divergent views among experts on the best near-term goals for vaccination programs, including the emphasis that should be put on achieving herd immunity, versus simply giving health care systems room to breathe.\n\nBut most experts agree with Dr. Anthony Fauci, who told CBS News in November that the bottom line is simple: We need to get as many people as possible vaccinated.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of sentiments on vaccination in nine countries from CBS News journalists:\n\nU.K.: The roll of race and income\n\nBy Haley Ott - A December poll by the Royal Society for Public Health showed that overall, 76% of adults in the U.K. would get a coronavirus vaccine if their doctor recommended it, but that willingness varied significantly based on a person's socio-economic status and ethnicity.\n\nThe vast majority of people in office jobs, 84%, said they would get a vaccine, but only 70% of people in unskilled/semi-skilled manual occupations or who were unemployed said they would.\n\n79% of White people said they would get a vaccine, compared to 57% of Black, Asian and other non-white people, according to the survey. This is reflects opinions in the U.S., too.\n\nMisinformation about the vaccine online was thought to be fueling some of the mistrust in the South Asian community and among certain religious groups, BBC News has reported. Messages falsely claiming the vaccines contain alcohol or animal products could deter Muslims and Hindus from wanting a shot.\n\nMosques across the U.K. have joined a campaign organized by the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board to counter the false narratives, saying they'd use their Friday sermons in January to urge people to get vaccinated.\n\nMore than 3 million people have had a first dose of either the Oxford or Pfizer vaccines in the U.K.\n\nFrance: Growing confidence\n\nBy Elaine Cobbe - The number of French people who say they're happy to be vaccinated has been on the rise. At the end of December, a poll found that just 40% were willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine. That reflected a drop from polling in November and over the summer.\n\nBut as the vaccine program in France actually got underway — slowly and fraught with bureaucratic problems — surveys showed growing confidence. A poll on January 7 found that 56% of French adults were in favor of getting vaccinated: 26% said they would definitely get the vaccine when it was their turn and 30% said they would probably get it.\n\nThe young appear to be the most reluctant, with more than half of those aged 25-35 consistently saying they don't want a vaccine.\n\nMore worrisome for health authorities is the number of health care workers voicing reluctance to being vaccinated has also been high. A poll conducted in the first week of December among nursing home workers found that just 19% were keen to be vaccinated, while 76% said they did not want a vaccine.\n\nFor many, however, it's looked more like a wait and see approach than a blanket no. In the December poll, 86% of those against the vaccines said they were worried about potential side effects, especially of the vaccines like Pfizer's and Moderna's which have been developed using new technology.\n\nSeeing the first wave of vaccinations — of nursing home residents and medical staff — go off without any serious side effects may have contributed to the rise in confidence in January.\n\nGermany: Nervous nurses\n\nBy Anna Noryskiewicz - Many German health care workers have also been skeptical of the coronavirus vaccines, but one doctor tells CBS News that's likely to change.\n\nA nationwide survey of medical staff, including many intensive care workers, carried out in early December found that 73% of physicians said they wanted to be vaccinated, but among nursing staff, the figure was only around 50%.\n\nDr. Petra Creutz, a pulmonologist in Berlin, told CBS News she believed it was more a matter of uncertainty than rejection.\n\nI think it's a common reaction to be reluctant with new drugs and vaccines. But in a few weeks' time, when more people get vaccinated and more explanatory work is done, the willingness to be vaccinated will eventually grow, she predicted.\n\nMedical staff line up forthe Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine at Havelhoehe community hospital in Berlin, Germany, January 14, 2021. FABRIZIO BENSCH/REUTERS\n\nGermany's leaders and health officials will be hoping she's right, as reluctance, particularly among health workers, can have a serious impact due to their inherent higher risk of contracting the virus.\n\nIt is particularly important that this group is vaccinated, Bavarian state premier Markus Söder said this week, sparking a debate among politicians after suggesting the consideration of compulsory vaccination for medical staff.\n\nItaly: Reluctant health workers\n\nBy Chris Livesay - Early last year, Italy was at the epicenter of the pandemic, and it became an early leader among European nations in the drive to inoculate people against the disease. Almost 1 million Italians had been given a first dose of coronavirus vaccine by Friday.\n\nBut there is resistance, and Italian officials may be hoping for the kind of growing confidence seen in France and predicted in Germany. Italian health care professionals have shown significant reluctance to get a shot.\n\nHealth workers prepare doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination centre in Naples, Italy, January 8, 2021. CIRO DE LUCA/REUTERS\n\nAccording to research published in December by Italy's ANSA news agency, one in five Italian health care workers said they would refuse a vaccine at the time. In some parts of the country that figure was even higher: In the northern Piedmont region, only 10-20% of nursing home workers said they planned to get vaccinated, according to the region's pandemic response unit.\n\nPope Francis was vaccinated this week, and he called on everyone to follow his example. Speaking to Italian TV on Sunday, he called refusal of the vaccines suicidal.\n\nIt's an ethical choice, because you are playing with health, life, but you are also playing with the lives of others, he told Italian television.\n\nRussia: Trust in Putin, trust in Sputnik\n\nBy Alexandra Odynova - The majority of Russians, 58%, are not ready to get the country's first domestically-made coronavirus vaccine — the only one available in Russia to date — according to the most recent independent survey. Despite the government's insistence that it's safe, many in the country remain wary of the Sputnik V vaccine, which was certified for use in August before Phase-3 human trials even began.\n\nDespite the lack of final data, the government lab that developed Sputnik V says it's 95% effective and causes no major side effects.\n\nThe independent Lavada Center's poll, published just after Christmas, found that most of those willing to get the vaccine were supporters of President Vladimir Putin. One of Putin's daughters was said to have received the Sputnik V vaccine before it was even approved, but the 68-year-old president hasn't received a shot yet himself.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the president's opponents are not ready to get vaccinated, noted the Lavada Center.\n\nOnly 38% of the overall respondents to the survey said they were willing to get the shot. About 30% said they wanted to wait at least until trials on the vaccine were completed. Only 10% said they opposed vaccines in general, while 12% of the respondents said they saw no reason to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nLast month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed suggestions of a link between Putin not getting vaccinated and the low public confidence in Sputnik V.\n\nWe don't see any connection here, Peskov told reporters. Putin said months ago that he was planning to get immunized. Sputnik V's developers say more than 1.5 million people in Russia have received the vaccine to date.\n\nJordan: Royals and refugees\n\nBy Amjad Tadros - Jordan launched its national vaccination campaign on Wednesday, and it was the first country to specifically include refugees in its COVID-19 inoculation drive.\n\nBut national uptake hasn't been enthusiastic off the starting block: Some 6 million people are eligible for inoculation in the first stage, including the elderly, people with chronic diseases, and medical workers. Registration was opened on December 24, but as of this week, only about 250,000 Jordanians had signed up for a shot.\n\nWe call on people to come to our centers to take the doses, Wael Hayajneh, a senior Jordanian health official, told reporters. To encourage vaccinations, Jordan's King Abdullah II, along with his 73-year-old uncle Prince Hassan and his eldest son Crown Prince Hussein, were shown on state television getting their first shots this week.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II (center), along with his 73-year-old uncle Prince Hassan and his eldest son Crown Prince Hussein, are seen on state television getting their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Jordanian government handout\n\nMinister of Health Dr. Natheer Obeidat told reporters that he hopes that the nationwide campaign will reach between 20% and 25% of the country's citizens in the coming months.\n\nJordan is home to some 750,00 Syrian refugees, and that population has been hit by the coronavirus. The United Nations refugee agency's representative in Jordan, Dominik Bartsch, told CBS News that the first few refugees who have the same medical priorities as their Jordanian brothers and sisters were included in that very first round of vaccination.\n\nAt least 43 refugees were among those vaccinated this week.\n\nJapan: History of rumors and mistrust\n\nBy Lucy Craft - Compared to the rush elsewhere to get shots into arms, Japan's tortoise-like approach to vaccination might seem incomprehensible. Japan's first round of vaccinations, using the Pfizer vaccine, is still more than a month away.\n\nPublic health officials here are under unusual pressure to reassure the public that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Japan, according to a recent study in The Lancet medical journal, is among the world's most vaccine-wary nations in general, and consequently has some of the highest rates of vaccine-preventable disease in the world.\n\nThere was a marked swerve toward vaccine hesitancy in the early 1990s, when reports linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) — without any definitive data — to cases of aseptic meningitis.\n\nHistory repeated itself in 2013, when anecdotal reports claimed the HPV vaccine was causing serious side effects, including one young woman who said she was left in a wheelchair by it. Researchers in Japan and Europe confirmed the vaccine's safety, but the damage was done.\n\nHPV vaccination rates dropped from 70% to less than 1%. That drop is now blamed for 5,700 needless cervical cancer deaths.\n\nSensationalized coverage of purported side effects, and what The Lancet describes as a passive government vaccination policy, have nurtured public suspicions.\n\nA recent poll by national broadcaster NHK showed 36% of Japanese wouldn't take a COVID-19 vaccine. That's not remarkably low trust, but public health officials will be incredibly alert to any unvetted reports of side effects sparking another media-fueled panic.\n\nIndia: Some convincing to do\n\nBy Arshad R. Zargar - India's mass-vaccination drive kicks off on Saturday. It's using a domestically produced stock of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and another Indian-developed drug.\n\nBoth the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use and there should be no doubt about their safety. They have been tested on thousands of people and side-effects are negligible, said Dr. V.K. Paul, of the Indian government's coronavirus and vaccines taskforce.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced.\n\nA survey by public engagement social media platform Local Circles earlier this month found 69% of Indians said they wouldn't take a coronavirus vaccine, or would at least wait for months before deciding to get one. Only 26% of respondents said they would get a vaccine shot as soon as it becomes available.\n\nDelhi-based marketing professional Rupali Dhanda, who has a masters in biochemistry, told CBS News she wasn't ready yet, arguing that there's not enough research yet on the vaccines.\n\nDelhi hospitality worker Ravi Kumar said he trusts the vaccines somewhat, but not the government's vaccination program.\n\nI would prefer to buy the vaccine on the market when it's available, he said, explaining that he lost trust in the government's health care system when he caught the coronavirus last year, but had six tests with different results. It was like a joke, he said.\n\nEpidemiologist Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Washington-based Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), told CBS News that attitudes towards the COVID vaccine will likely change a lot in coming months, based on any side effects and the speed and efficiency of the rollout.\n\nPakistan: Can't even beat polio\n\nBy Imtiaz Tyab - Pakistan's government has pinned its hopes of inoculating the nation's 230 million-plus citizens with a coronavirus vaccine created by a Chinese company. Officials say the CanSinoBio vaccine is near the end of Phase-3 human trials in Pakistan and has shown considerable promise.\n\nThe South Asian nation is one of seven countries testing the Chinese vaccine, but a recent poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan showed 37% of Pakistanis wouldn't get a COVID-19 vaccine when it's available.\n\nPakistan suffers from extreme poverty, rampant corruption, and has a tiny health budget. It's struggled to contain the virus largely because hospital space is limited and many areas only have rudimentary health care facilities.\n\nBut it's the nation's deep mistrust of vaccines causing the most concern. For years, Pakistan's efforts to wipe out polio have been thwarted largely due to public fear of foreign vaccines.\n\nThese anti-vaxx sentiments have been inflamed by tribal leaders and religious clerics claiming the polio drops are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslims.\n\nToday, Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where polio hasn't been eradicated.\n\nThe deep-rooted mistrust has, for years, seen dozens of people killed in attacks on polio vaccination teams, including an attack this week.\n\nThe vaccine conspiracy theories only got worse after a Pakistani doctor was accused of running a fake vaccination campaign to help the C.I.A. track down Osama bin Laden.\n\nWhile the dangers of polio have been well known for decades, COVID-19 is a new disease, and the government's weak messaging around the virus have likely made things worse.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan ordered a national lockdown early in the pandemic, but quickly abandoned it as the virus spread widely in the country.\n\nPakistan has officially recorded a total of over 423,000 coronavirus infections and close to 8,500 deaths. But experts say the real toll is likely much higher, because the government is only doing a fraction of the testing it should.
During an Alaska Airlines flight from Washington, D.C., to Seattle in early January, a number of passengers refused to wear masks and harassed crew members, the airline said. In response, Alaska banned 14 of the passengers on that flight — just some of a growing number of disruptive passengers airlines are putting on their own no-fly lists. And President Joe Biden has signed an executive order making face coverings mandatory on planes, the latest move to ensure passengers wear masks, after the Federal Aviation Administration announced several weeks ago it will start taking legal action over such behavior.\n\nCalling those passengers rowdy and argumentative, in a statement, Alaska Airlines said it has banned more than 335 passengers since August for violating its mask policy.\n\nTheir behavior was unacceptable. Because of their actions and non-compliance, we have banned 14 of those passengers from future travel with us, the airline said in the earlier statement. We apologize to our other guests who were made uncomfortable on the flight. We will not tolerate any disturbance on board our aircraft or at any of the airports we serve.\n\nThe lists compiled by individual airlines — different from the federal no-fly list, which aims to block suspected terrorists from the skies — has swelled to more than 3,000 people, CBS News has confirmed. The flight bans grew out of mask requirements put in place due to the coronavirus. Most flight bans will last until those mask policies are suspended at the end of the pandemic.\n\nMany of the bans have occurred since the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol, swelling to 2,700 in the week after January 6.\n\nThe order signed January 7 by FAA Administrator Steve Dickson means unruly passengers will no longer get a warning or counseling, which the agency said had been common practice in such incidents.\n\nThe FAA has seen a disturbing increase in incidents where airline passengers have disrupted flights with threatening or violent behavior. These incidents have stemmed both from passengers' refusals to wear masks and from recent violence at the U.S. Capitol, the FAA's announcement states.\n\nWhile American Airlines refused to disclose the number of customers banned, the airline did confirm it had added customers to its internal refuse list from flights to and from D.C. over the last week, including a passenger shown refusing to wear a mask on a Sunday flight in a viral video.\n\nWe are working closely with local law enforcement and airport authority partners to ensure the safety of our customers and team members on the ground and in the air, the airline said in a statement Thursday. We also have increased staffing at Washington D.C.-area airports and will not serve alcohol on flights to and from this area as a precautionary measure. We will continue to enforce policies that ensure our customers' and team members' safety and wellbeing.\n\nThe Association of Professional Flight Attendants, American's flight attendants union, said it has set up a hotline for members to report these encounters, which they told CBS include last week a union member being harassed with racial epithets while riding a hotel shuttle to Reagan National Airport and another being harassed by passengers who refused to wear their masks while on board the plane.\n\nA spokesman for United Airlines said they had banned 60 people in the week after the attack, and Alaska Airlines confirmed it banned 32 people.\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents nearly 50,000 attendants at 17 airlines including United and Alaska, called the behavior a new kind of threat in the air in a communication with its members.\n\nThe mob mentality behavior that took place on several flights to the D.C. area yesterday was unacceptable and threatened the safety and security of every single person onboard, said Sara Nelson, international president of the union in a January 7 statement.\n\nSome of the people who traveled in our planes yesterday participated in the insurrection at the Capitol today, she said. Their violent and seditious actions at the Capitol today create further concern about their departure from the DC area. Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight.\n\nDelta Airlines removed two people from a flight from D.C. to Minneapolis-St. Paul on Jan 8, and an American Airlines pilot scolded passengers on a flight that same day for their unruly behavior.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a reminder to passengers the day after the Capitol riot about unruly behavior in the air, warning it could lead to prison and an up to $35,000 fine.\n\nTravel Alert! Unruly behavior on an airplane may violate federal law. You could face imprisonment and fines up to $35K. Always follow crew instructions. They are there to keep everyone safe.

MUSKEGON HEIGHTS, Mich. -- Police say four people were injured, including one person who was shot by a deputy, in gunfire near a western Michigan high school.\n\nThe shootings happened around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday after a basketball game at Muskegon Heights High School.\n\nAuthorities say officers were stationed in a parking lot ahead of the game because they had been warned about the possibility of a dispute.\n\nMuskegon Heights Interim Police Chief Joseph Thomas tells reporters shots were fired nearby, injuring two females and a male, then a suspect ran toward the school, where he encountered a deputy.\n\nThomas says the deputy ordered the man to drop the weapon and shot him when he refused.\n\nNone of the injuries is believed to be life-threatening.\n\nThomas told CBS Lansing, Michigan affiliate WLNS-TV officers were searching for three other men they believe were with the shooter at the time.\n\nMuskegon County Sheriff Dean Roesler says it appears the deputy acted within policy and state law.\n\nAn investigation is ongoing.
Popular personal products chain Ulta Beauty is accused of reselling used products. The rapidly-growing company with more than 1,000 stores in 48 states is facing two class-action lawsuits that claim employees repackage products that were damaged or returned and then put them back on shelves\n\nPlaintiff Kimberly Brown says the beauty retailer used to be her one-stop shop for personal care products until she saw a Twitter post from a former Ulta associate who said managers at Brown's favorite Ulta location were allegedly reselling used products as new, reports CBS News' Anna Werner.\n\n\n\nWe were told by managers to repackage / reseal the item and put it back on the shelf the social media post reads. They would resell EVERYTHING. (makeup, hair care, skincare, fragrance, hair tools, etc.), the associate wrote in another post.\n\n\n\nThe former employee included photos of products. In one example, she alleges that Ulta employees would clean a used foundation stick with a Q-Tip and resell it. Other people joined in, posting their experiences from around the country.\n\nSome social media posts about Ulta Beauty\n\n\n\nI felt duped, Brown said. For somebody to come forward like that is a pretty big deal, it sends a big red flag in my book.\n\n\n\nBrown joined a class-action lawsuit that claims, Ulta has continued to deceive consumers for years, repackaging, restocking and reselling used beauty products including cosmetics at full price as if they were new.\n\n\n\nIn a video posted on Ulta's website, a company executive denied the practice. Ulta Beauty's policy does not permit the resale of used, damaged, or expired products. Period. We take protecting the integrity of the products we sell very seriously, she said.\n\n\n\nBut former Ulta Beauty store operations manager Brittany Ludwig says at one store she saw them cleaning lip products and eye shadows.\n\nFormer Ulta Beauty store operations manager Brittany Ludwig CBS News\n\nAt another, she said, shampoos, lotions, and other items in bottles were put back on the shelf.\n\n\n\nShe says some of that she did herself because higher-level managers pressured the stores to keep the dollar amount for damaged or returned goods down.\n\n\n\nWe had other managers come in from other stores and they were saying 'OK, yeah, you need to clean all these returns, you need to clean this, this is how you're going to get your numbers down,' and it was all a numbers game, she said. I don't feel so great about doing it now, but at that time that's what I was told to do my job.\n\n\n\nUlta told CBS News it is confident that our stores uphold our policies and practices.\n\nWe did speak to other Ulta associates who say they did not see this happen in their store, and one said she was told nothing that had been used should be put back on the shelves.\n\n\n\nBut Brown says she filed the lawsuit because she thinks it's a huge consumer protection issue and says consumers shouldn't have to worry they are being duped when making purchases.
About 50 percent of all tax filers pay a pro to prepare and file their tax returns. Even IRS Commissioner John Koskinen is in that boat. He has said he hires an accounting firm and pays a few thousand dollars to get his taxes done.\n\nIf you're among this group, especially if it's for the first time, how do you know how much should it cost?\n\nMost tax preparers base their charges on the complexity of your tax situation and the completeness of your information. In fact, many say they'll charge extra when a client is poorly organized and has incomplete records of their income and deductions.\n\nPreparers can also charge in a variety of ways, such as a set fee for each form and schedule required or an hourly rate for the time spent preparing your return. That hourly rate can be based on the actual time they spend on your returns or on IRS guidelines for estimated times to complete certain forms.\n\nRegardless of how you're charged, it's always best to provide the tax pro all of your information for review and ask for a firm estimate of the cost before you agree to go forward. This is especially needed if it's the first time you're working with this person.\n\nHow can you know what you're paying (or being quoted) compared to what others are being charged?\n\nHere's some good information. The National Society of Accountants asks its members about the fees they charge, and according to its 2016-2017 fee survey, the average fee to prepare and file a simple Form 1040 (with no itemized deductions) and a state tax return is $176. Add a Schedule A (itemized deductions) to that mix and the fee is $273.\n\nThe average fee for a Form 1040, Schedule A (itemized deductions), a Schedule C (profit or loss from business) and a state tax return is $457.\n\nThe survey also covered fees for several other forms such as:\n\n1040 and Schedule C: $184\n\nSchedule D (capital gains and losses): $124\n\nSchedule E (supplemental income, typically from rental real estate): $135\n\nThe survey found that fees vary by region, with higher charges in more metropolitan areas. For example, a 1040, Schedule A and state return is about $333 in New England and $329 in states on the West Coast. In Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi, they averaged about $210.\n\nThe survey proved that being well organized and having complete information can save you money. Nearly three-quarters of the preparers said they charge an additional fee averaging $117 for clients with disorganized or incomplete information.\n\nWhen you hire a tax professional, also ask what the policy is for responding to an audit. The average fee for preparing a reply to an IRS letter or notification (commonly called a correspondence audit) is $128. The average hourly fee for representing a taxpayer at an IRS in-person, or field, audit is $150.\n\nTax prep pros can also offer other services. They can inform you of the tax-saving strategies unique to your situation or profession. They can help you organize and plan for next year's taxes by suggesting what records to keep and what financial moves to make this year. They can also help with estimating quarterly tax payments.\n\nThe bottom line: Make sure the preparer you chose to work with offers services that meet your needs.
Ronna McDaniel, an ally of President Trump, was reelected Friday to another term as Republican National Committee chair at a party meeting in Amelia Island, Florida.\n\nThe meeting of GOP leaders came the same week that supporters of President Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol and when Republicans lost two Senate races in Georgia, which gave Democrats control of the chamber.\n\nThe violence does not represent acts of patriotism, but an attack on our country and its founding principles. Our Founding Fathers established a nation of laws, not a nation of anarchy, McDaniel said on Friday. As the transition of power continues over the next two weeks, I call on individuals to respect law enforcement, law and order, and our great system of governance.\n\nMcDaniel made few references to the president during her remarks before and after her election, except to thank him for his support and to note the share of votes he received from minority groups.\n\nThere's not too many people who would say, 'let's take that woman, a mom from Michigan, and have her run the national party.' And I think that says a lot about his support of women and I've certainly been encouraged and supported by him, McDaniel said. RNC co-Chair Tommy Hicks, another ally of Mr. Trump, was also re-elected on Friday.\n\nMcDaniel told Republicans that she was upset about the loss at the top of the ticket in November. But she touted some of the party's wins in the other races on the ballot amid projections that Democrats would have a big night.\n\nContrary to what every political pundit in the Beltway Bubble was predicting and not so secretly hoping for, no Blue Wave materialized on Election Day, McDaniel said. Still, just days after the losses in Georgia, she expressed frustration over losing critical elections.\n\nI am mad and I am not going to let socialism rule in this country, McDaniel said. I am going to work with every single one of you to make sure we squash it, we take back the House and we take back the Senate in 2022.\n\nMembers at the meeting described the week as bumpy and a roller coaster. They condemned the attacks at the Capitol and expressed disappointment about the losses in Georgia. One RNC member, who requested anonymity, told CBS News that many of the discussions during the week have been about how the party moves forward.\n\nThe conversations are soul-searching, the member told CBS News. We've got to pick ourselves up, move forward and win again. And how do we do that?\n\nThere were not many references to President Trump during the general session on Friday. But some members still expect him to have influence in the party moving forward.\n\nThe president is obviously going to have some influence on the party, said Jim DeGraffenreid, an RNC member from Nevada. There are a lot of people that like the policy decisions that he made over the last four years and so he has very strong support for the things that he did.\n\nDuring Friday's general session, party leaders made references to pushing for changes to voting laws, something many grassroots GOP activists are urging. McDaniel said the RNC is going to encourage state legislatures to provide more access for poll workers and to enact meaningful voter ID laws.\n\nI want to promise the grassroots of our party: we hear you, we hear your frustration. We know that you want us as the Republican National Committee to fight to make sure our elections are fair and free and transparent, McDaniel said. It is vital to our democracy that every American has faith in our election process.\n\nIn addition to the leadership elections, the party meetings present a chance for candidates with future political aspirations to speak to GOP leaders.\n\nOn Thursday, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem spoke to members at events that were closed to the press. Both Haley and Noem have been mentioned as potential 2024 presidential candidates. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul also spoke on Thursday.\n\nHaley offered a sharp rebuke of President Trump's words and actions since Election Day, telling GOP members that he will be judged harshly by history.\n\nPresident Trump has not always chosen the right words, Haley said, according to a person familiar with her remarks. He was wrong with his words in Charlottesville, and I told him so at the time. He was badly wrong with his words yesterday. And it wasn't just his words. His actions since Election Day will be judged harshly by history.\n\nHaley called Wednesday's attack on the U.S Capitol a terribly sad day for our county and un-American. She said Republicans need to lead the way on uniting the country.\n\nDemocrats need to do better. Big tech and social media need to do better. The news media needs to do better, Haley said. But I am talking about Republicans, too. If we are the party of personal responsibility, we need to take personal responsibility. We can and should talk about our major differences. But we must stop turning the American people against each other – and this Republican Party must lead the way.\n\nStill, Haley said Republicans should not shy away from our accomplishments during the Trump administration. She highlighted work on foreign policy such as withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and Israel signing diplomatic pacts with Arab nations. On the domestic front, she spoke about economic progress, cutting regulations and judicial appointments.\n\nOne of the key goals for Republicans moving into 2022 and 2024 will be trying to win back suburban voters who revolted against President Trump in 2018 and 2020.\n\nThis Republican Party is a home for anyone, because we stand for the principles that matter to everyone. This is not the time to abandon those principles. It is the time to proclaim them, proudly, from the suburbs to the cities to the farms all across the country, Haley said.
An undated photo published online by Iran's state-run English language TV network Press TV shows its news anchor, Marzieh Hashemi, born Melanie Franklin of New Orleans, whom the network said on Jan. 16, 2019, was detained in the U.S. Press TV\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department and the FBI continued on Thursday to refuse comment on the alleged detention of an American woman who has worked for years as an anchorwoman on Iran's state-run television. Marzieh Hashemi was arrested by the FBI during a visit to the U.S. on Sunday, Iran's English-language broadcaster Press TV reported Wednesday. Her son has said she is being held in a prison, apparently as a material witness.\n\nHashemi was detained in St. Louis, where she had filmed a Black Lives Matter documentary after visiting relatives in the New Orleans area. She was then taken to Washington, according to her elder son, Hossein Hashemi.\n\nContacted by CBS News, both the FBI and the Justice Department have declined to comment on the case.\n\nHashemi, 58, was born Melanie Franklin in New Orleans but has worked for Iran's state TV network for 25 years now.\n\nHossein Hashemi told The Associated Press that his mother lives in Tehran, the capital of Iran, and comes back to this country about once a year to see her family, usually scheduling documentary work somewhere in the U.S. as well.\n\nNo idea what's going on\n\nWe still have no idea what's going on, said Hossein Hashemi, a research fellow at the University of Colorado whom the AP interviewed by phone from Washington. He also said he and his siblings had been subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury.\n\nThe incident comes as Iran faces increasing criticism of its own arrests of dual citizens and other people with Western ties. Those cases have previously been used as bargaining chips in negotiations with world powers.\n\nFederal law allows judges to order witnesses to be arrested and detained if the government can prove their testimony has extraordinary value for a criminal case and that they would be a flight risk and unlikely to respond to a subpoena. The statute generally requires those witnesses to be promptly released once they are deposed, however.\n\nShe apparently was unable to call her daughter until Tuesday night. The family is trying to hire an attorney, but it has been difficult because she has not been charged with a crime, her son said.\n\nHashemi's detention and the material witness law\n\nHashemi, an American citizen, had not been contacted by the FBI before she was detained and would absolutely have been willing to cooperate with the agency, her son said.\n\nAsked whether his mother had been involved in any criminal activity or knew anyone who might be implicated in a crime, Hossein Hashemi said, We don't have any information along those lines.\n\nHossein Hashemi, from Denver, son of American-born news anchor Marzieh Hashemi, who works for Iranian state television, speaks during an interview with the Associated Press in Washington, Jan. 16, 2019. AP\n\nHashemi said his mother was arrested as she was about to board a flight from St. Louis to Denver. A spokesman for St. Louis Lambert International Airport declined to comment and referred questions to the FBI.\n\nThe constitutionality of the material witness law has never been meaningfully tested, said Ricardo J. Bascuas, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law. The government only relies on it when they need a reason to arrest somebody but they don't have one.\n\nNo matter the reason for Marzieh Hashemi's detention, she should have been granted a court appearance by now, Bascuas said.\n\nIran uses case to blast U.S. justice\n\nIran's state broadcaster held a news conference and launched a hashtag campaign for Hashemi, using the same techniques families with loved ones held in the Islamic Republic use to highlight their cases.\n\nWe will not spare any legal action to help her, said Paiman Jebeli, deputy chief of Iran's state IRIB broadcaster. Iran's Press TV aired footage of her anchoring news programs and discussing the war in Syria, set to dramatic music.\n\nThere were no references to any case against Hashemi in U.S. federal courts, nor in Missouri.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi told state TV that Hashemi's arrest showed the apartheid and racist policy of the Trump administration. We hope that the innocent person will be released without any condition, he said.\n\nAmericans held in Iran\n\nAt least four American citizens are being held in Iran, including Michael White, a U.S. Navy veteran whose detention was only confirmed last month. Also held are Iranian-American Siamak Namazi and his 82-year-old father, Baquer, both serving 10-year sentences on espionage charges.\n\nIranian-American art dealer Karan Vafadari and his Iranian wife, Afarin Neyssari, received 27-year and 16-year prison sentences, respectively. Chinese-American graduate student Xiyue Wang was sentenced to 10 year in prison.\n\nAlso in an Iranian prison is Nizar Zakka, a permanent U.S. resident from Lebanon who advocated for internet freedom and has done work for the U.S. government. He was sentenced to 10 years on espionage-related charges.\n\nFormer FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran in 2007 while on an unauthorized CIA mission, remains missing as well. Iran says that Levinson is not in the country and that it has no further information about him. His family holds Tehran responsible for his disappearance.

Amy Klobuchar suspended her presidential campaign Monday and endorsed Joe Biden at a rally in Dallas on Monday night, just hours before voters in 14 states go to the polls on Super Tuesday.\n\nHe can bring our country together and build that coalition of that fired-up Democratic base as well as Independents as well as moderate Republicans. Because we do not, in our party, want to eek by with a victory, we want to win big, Klobuchar said at the rally Monday night.\n\nKlobuchar on Biden: I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his. https://t.co/wQHTIvvUj9 pic.twitter.com/8fU2ALfnyN — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 3, 2020\n\nWhile the Minnesota Democrat often boasted about kicking off her campaign in the middle of a blizzard, the end of her run was marked by a storm of frustrations and stalled momentum. Aides and allies told CBS News they took solace in the fact that her campaign performed better and lasted longer than many had initially expected.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, Klobuchar was quick to admit she did not have the name recognition or financial resources enjoyed by some of her rivals. Besides hitting the trail, her prospects hinged on her performance in the primary debates, which were crucial for introducing herself to a national audience and raising money.\n\nKlobuchar positioned herself as a moderate Midwesterner who could unite the party, casting doubt on the feasibility of progressive policy proposals like free college tuition and Medicare for All put forward by Senator Bernie Sanders. She also largely steered clear of criticizing Biden, given the similarity in their views.\n\nArmed with her neighborly appeal, Klobuchar bet that a strong finish in the Iowa caucuses would catapult her candidacy into the top tier. She set out to visit all of the state's 99 counties, a feat she accomplished just before the weeks-long Senate impeachment trial trapped her on Capitol Hill. She came in sixth place, signaling that Iowa voters did not agree with her proposition that a Midwest moderate was best suited to win back the heartland.\n\nIn what would prove to be the high water mark of her bid, Klobuchar managed to bounce back with a strong showing at debate in New Hampshire just days before the Granite State's primary. She came in third, ahead of Elizabeth Warren, a surprising finish that allowed her to continue on to Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar seen February 29, 2020, in Richmond, Virginia. Getty\n\nThere were indications earlier Monday that Klobuchar's bid was coming to an end. After an event in Salt Lake City, Utah, the campaign held reporters for over two hours, with the lights turned off and no staff in sight. As late as Monday morning, a senior adviser said they had received no official word of her exiting the race but declined to elaborate. Multiple aides said they had expected her to remain in the race through Super Tuesday.\n\nThe senator broke the news to her staff entire shortly after 1 p.m. ET on a conference call from Salt Lake City on Monday, two campaign officials told CBS News. Klobuchar thanked her team for their work on the wild ride of the campaign, telling staff that she was proud of the operation they built.\n\nShe also acknowledged that the outcome was not what they wished, but that she felt it was right to consolidate support around Biden. The call lasted around 20 minutes, and Klobuchar and staff members were sad and a bit shell-shocked.\n\nOne longtime Klobuchar ally said the initial plan to remain in the race through Super Tuesday was becoming untenable as polls showed her coming in behind Sanders in her own state of Minnesota.\n\nThe feeling in the campaign really starting to change last week, this person said.\n\nKathryn Watson contributed to this report.
A website designed to screen people's possible coronavirus symptoms and direct them to testing sites went live Sunday night. Though officials at a White House press conference Friday indicated the site would be a national resource, the test version currently in operation serves just California's Santa Clara and San Mateo counties.\n\nAs of Monday morning, all available appointments were filled.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe website, called Project Baseline, was designed by Verily, a subsidiary of Google's parent company Alphabet, Inc. It requires users to have a Google account and begins with a survey to determine eligibility — residing within 50 miles of the two counties covered; having a mild cough, shortness of breath and a fever. Those who are eligible then receive a lengthier questionnaire to determine the risk of having contracted the virus.\n\nTesting in California is currently available only for those who are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, and may have had contact with a person with who has the disease, or who traveled to certain countries that have had outbreaks involving community spread.\n\nThose who are selected for tests are directed to sites where a nasal swab can be collected and sent to a lab.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said in a statement to CBS News that more appointments will be available in the future.\n\nAll appointments require a call-back confirmation to schedule an appointment. If someone were to fill out the questionnaire overnight, they would go into a queue to be called the next day should they qualify, the spokesperson said. In these first few days of this pilot, we expect appointment availability to be limited as we stand up operations and that testing capacity will increase in the days to come.\n\nThough the site requires a Google account, its privacy policy claims your data collected...will never be joined with your data stored in Google products without your explicit permission.\n\nJason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents digital publishers, has frequently criticized Google's data collection policies, but he says the Verily policy clearly states Google won't use the data for its own purposes.\n\nThe language in their privacy policy seems perfectly reasonable as it lines up nicely with what consumers would expect as opposed to the rest of Google's data surveillance operation which mines data across the majority of the web and our lives, Kint said.\n\nThe government hopes the website will ultimately streamline the process for Americans to determine if they should be tested and where they should go for testing, according to Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator.\n\nOn Friday, officials indicated the site would be a national resource for those who need to be tested, directing people to drive-through labs around the country.\n\nOfficials and Google later clarified that the site would first be rolled out in a small California region. It is not clear when or if it will expand.
Stocks suffered their worst one-day reversal since June 2016 on a points basis on Tuesday. First, the Dow Jones Industrials average zoomed past the 26,000 threshold, bagging the quickest-ever 1,000 point gain from its last round number (hit just seven days ago).\n\nBut with options traders increasingly over their toes -- positioned too aggressively -- and a combination of cryptocurrency carnage, a push higher in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and fears of a possible government shutdown later this week brought out the sellers. The day ended in the worst percentage reversal since Dec. 1.\n\nOther negative catalysts on the horizon include the start of fourth-quarter 2017 earnings reports and the Federal Reserve's looming monetary policy meeting.\n\nThe single biggest story of the day, outside of the price reversal (largest high-to-close move since March 2017) was the way the VIX was correlated to stock prices at Tuesday's open. This is a possible regime change because stocks and the VIX traditionally trade in opposition to each other.\n\nAnd it marks a potential shift to late bubble behavior seen in 2000 and 2007, when stocks pushed into their final highs alongside volatility expectations. Given the trillions in explicit and implicit short volatility strategies (traders betting against volatility) at the moment, according to Artemis Capital, panicked short covering and broken markets could result. That could lead to, for example, very thin trading volumes in many exchange-traded funds based on short VIX vehicles.\n\nThis comes at a time when risk appetites have reached their highest level of this cycle, according to Goldman Sachs (chart above). And buying demand is in a lull, with corporate stock buybacks in a blackout period because of earnings season.\n\nJason Goepfert at SentimenTrader noted that small options traders -- dumb money based on their historical performance -- spent 40 percent of their volume buying speculative call options last week. These are highly risky bets on stocks continuing to rise. That activity was at the highest level since 2011. Since the 2009 low, only five other weeks showed a similar dynamic. Two weeks later, stocks were lower each time.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, U.S. stock futures were up strongly again, but given Tuesday's action and the undercurrents threatening the bull run, watch for a nasty pullback soon on Wall Street. One that has been delayed for years.
The United States will evacuate some Americans in Wuhan on a flight out of the quarantined city Wednesday morning as concern over the spread of the coronavirus continues. But, there are roughly 1,000 Americans in the city and space is limited.\n\nSam Roth, a Wisconsin father, is doing everything he can to help get his family get out of Wuhan. His wife, Daisy, and two young children, Adalynn and Abagail, flew to China last week to visit Daisy's family for the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nFrom the moment they stepped foot on Wuhan, they were told, 'Stay inside. Don't get in big gatherings,' and then the city went on lockdown, Roth told CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio.\n\nAt least 106 people have died in China after getting the virus. Priority for the State Department's chartered flight out of Wuhan will be given to those at greatest risk, the government said.\n\nWe've got a 10-month-old, we've got a 5-year-old. They're susceptible, and they should be prioritized, Roth said.\n\nU.S. health officials said the virus is not spreading widely in America and that danger to the public is low, but there are five confirmed cases and more than 100 people being tested across 26 states.\n\nThe American public should not be fearful about this, but you really need to take it very seriously because as things evolve, our recommendations and our policy will change to be in accordance with what the evidence is, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nIn Wuhan, the city is racing to complete two hospitals that will be used to treat thousands of infected patients. The city's mayor offered to resign because of what he called an unsatisfactory response to the illness, saying about five million people left the city before it shut its borders.\n\nThe U.S. flight out of Wuhan is scheduled to touch down in Ontario, California, just east of Los Angeles.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday President Trump is proposing a 20 percent tax on imports, particularly on products and services from Mexico, so that revenues could be used to pay for the construction of Mr. Trump's proposed wall along the U.S. southern border.\n\nSpicer told reporters Thursday that the administration is considering using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico. The proposal is meant to raise the billions of dollars from Mexico needed to cover the cost of the border wall, a promise Mr. Trump has made since his days on the campaign trail.\n\nRight now our country's policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous, Spicer said. But if you tax that $50 billion at 20 percent of imports -- which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do...By doing that, we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That's really going to provide the funding.\n\nLater in the afternoon, however, Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters that the proposal was in fact just one of several options the White House was considering, including a border tax in the range of 5 - 20 percent. It is part of a buffet of options, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters, according to CBS News' Margaret Brennan. He said this is one of the many ways that the border wall could be funded.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has publicly said he had already figured out how to pay for the wall, Spicer said he's now willing to work with Congress to find a way to do it. That includes making it a part of comprehensive tax reform like that being proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan. White House officials said the proposed border tax would essentially be a way to derive payment from Mexico.\n\nWhen pressed as to whether this now meant that the Mexican government would not have to write a check to the U.S. to repay it for construction of the wall, Spicer stipulated that the president had never said that was going to happen. He made the point that there were multiple ways for Mexico – either via its corporations or other entities – to help fund the construction.\n\nThe border adjustment act that Ryan has proposed would include a tax on goods produced outside the country for sale inside the U.S. In short it would incentivize corporations to produce their goods in the U.S. and sell them here instead of seeking a cheaper labor source outside the country. Ryan's argument is that the corporate tax rate would be lowered to offset that increase in cost of doing business. He also argues that it would strengthen the dollar.\n\nIn 2015, the U.S. suffered a $58.4 billion trade deficit with Mexico, its third largest trading partner.\n\nIn a tweet early Wednesday, Mr. Trump lamented that $60 billion deficit.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Trade Representative, the top items exported by Mexico to the U.S. in 2015 were vehicles ($74 billion), electrical machinery ($63 billion) and machinery ($49 billion).\n\nIt's unclear, however, who would bear the brunt of an import tax on Mexican goods. For instance, any border tax hike could potentially be passed on to American consumers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was quick to point out that the U.S. isn't the only country that can impose an import tax.\n\nBorder security yes, tariffs no. Mexico is 3rd largest trading partner. Any tariff we can levy they can levy. Huge barrier to econ growth /1 — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017\n\nSimply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. (2) — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017\n\nOn Wednesday, the president signed an executive order to begin the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border.\n\nCBS News' Steven Portnoy contributed to this report.
MELBOURNE, Australia -- The most senior Catholic Church leader to be charged with sexual abuse came close to confronting his accusers on Monday in a video-linked Australian court hearing to test the strength of the prosecution's case. Cardinal George Pell's alleged victims began testifying in the Melbourne Magistrates Court against Pope Francis' former finance minister in testimony that cannot be made public.\n\nThe complainants, who cannot be identified, are avoiding the intense media scrutiny focused on the cramped courtroom and the company of their alleged abuser by giving their evidence via a video connection from an undisclosed location. The number of alleged victims has not been made public, and their testimony is scheduled to continue for up to two weeks.\n\nThe 76-year-old Australian cardinal has denied any wrongdoing and has foreshadowed pleas of not guilty if the committal hearing that is scheduled to run as long as a month finds there is sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial.\n\nPell was charged last June with sexually abusing multiple people in his Australian home state of Victoria. The details of the allegations have yet to be released to the public, though police have described the charges as historical sexual assault offenses - meaning the alleged crimes occurred decades ago.\n\nOne of the charges was withdrawn last week because the accuser had recently died.\n\nPell's lawyer Robert Richter did not object to the complainants appearing in court on a television screen Monday rather than in person. But he did question why one would be allowed to appear with what prosecutor Mark Gibson described as a support dog while testifying.\n\nI always thought that dogs were for children and very old people, Richter told the court.\n\nMagistrate Belinda Wallington replied, No, they're also there for vulnerable and traumatized people.\n\nWhen Pell last lived in Melbourne, he was archbishop of Australia's second-largest city. He progressed to archbishop of Australia's biggest city, Sydney, before moving to the Vatican as a prefect of the church's economy ministry in 2014. He intends to return to that job once the criminal charges are resolved.\n\nIn 2016, it was Pell who was testifying by video to an official inquiry into sexual abuse.\n\nHe was in Rome and had health reasons for not making a long flight to testify in person to Australia's longest-running royal commission, the country's highest form of inquiry. It had been investigating since 2012 how the Catholic Church and other institutions responded to sexual abuse of children in Australia over 90 years.\n\nThe inquiry issued its final report in December. Pell was questioned about his knowledge of and response to allegations of child abuse when he was a priest and bishop, but no allegation was made that he was a perpetrator.\n\nPell's lawyers told the court last month that the current criminal charges stemmed from publicity surrounding the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.\n\nThe lawyers said the first complainant approached police in 2015, 40 years after the alleged crimes, in response to media reports about that inquiry.\n\nOn Monday, Richter cited Pell's age and medical condition as reasons why the cleric should be allowed to be accompanied in court by a supporter.\n\nHe told Wallington, the magistrate, that he understood the prosecution has an objection to that support person being a priest, although I can't understand that.\n\nGibson, the prosecutor, replied, That's not quite right.\n\nPell was silent as he entered and left the court to a crush of media cameras and police, as well as throughout the initial 25 minutes of the hearing that was open to the public.\n\nRichter said police had 21 witness statements provided by the defense that were favorable to the cardinal, but were not party of the case.\n\nThese documents are certainly relevant to the alleged offenses, Richter said. I know it doesn't suit the prosecution because they are exculpatory of the cardinal.\n\nThe case places both the cardinal and the pope in potentially perilous territory. For Pell, the charges are a threat to his freedom, his reputation and his career. For Francis, they are a threat to his credibility, given that he famously promised a zero tolerance policy for sex abuse in the church. Advocates for abuse victims have long railed against Francis' decision to appoint Pell to the high-ranking position in the first place.\n\nWhen Pell was promoted in 2014, he was already facing allegations that he had mishandled cases of clergy abuse during his time as archbishop.\n\nAfter years of alleged cover-ups and silence from the church over its pedophilia scandal, abuse survivors and their advocates have hailed the prosecution of Pell as a monumental shift in the way society is responding to the crisis.\n\nSo far, Francis has withheld judgment of Pell, saying he wants to wait for Australian justice to run its course. And he did not force the cardinal to resign. Pell said he intends to continue his work as a prefect of the church's economy ministry once the case is resolved.
In a widely shared social media thread, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday stood by last week's decision to ban President Trump from his company's platform, saying it was something he does not celebrate or feel pride in, but something that was decided based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter.\n\nTwitter permanently banned Mr. Trump's account on Saturday because of the risk of further incitement of violence in the wake of the deadly siege on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDorsey said it was the right decision in his post Wednesday.\n\nWe faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety, he said. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\n\nI believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all. — jack (@jack) January 14, 2021\n\nHowever, Dorsey said, banning accounts has real and significant ramifications.\n\nWhile there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation ... Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.\n\nHaving to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation. — jack (@jack) January 14, 2021\n\nHe also said that Twitter is just a small part of a larger conversation across the internet.\n\nDorsey said that if people do not agree with a platform's rules and the enforcement of those rules then they can simply go to another service. But that ability is limited when events unfold as they did last week, when multiple social media sites, seemingly uncoordinated, censored Mr. Trump and others who allegedly incited violence in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet, Dorsey said. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same.\n\nIn efforts to help combat this, Dorsey said he is working on a platform that can serve as a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity.\n\nFor the time being, however, he said global public conversation is the best and most relevant solution.\n\nEverything we learn in this moment will better our effort, and push us to be what we are: one humanity working together.\n\nMr. Trump addressed social media censorship on Wednesday in his first video message after the House impeached him on one count of incitement of insurrection for willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States on January 6.\n\nAfter condemning last week's riots at the Capitol — without taking ownership for any of the incitement that he has been impeached for — Mr. Trump talked about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days.\n\nShortly after the riots, Twitter permanently suspended Mr. Trump's personal account, and Facebook suspended his account for the rest of his presidency. On Tuesday, YouTube temporarily banned Mr. Trump from uploading new content.\n\nMeanwhile, free speech platform Parler was suspended from the Apple and Google app stores, and eventually shut down by Amazon Web Services, for its failure to moderate content that incited violence. Several posts showed Trump supporters calling on others to partake in a million militia march on January 20, and for patriots to take their weapons to Washington.\n\nMany individuals called for a second civil war because Mr. Trump lost the election.\n\nThese are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous, Mr. Trump said in the video, which was posted on the White House Twitter account. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose.
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- The U.S. Navy says two Virginia-based sailors threw compacted trash off their ship.\n\nCBS affiliate WUSA-TV reports the table-top sized trash discs had been on the USS Whidbey Island. The landing dock ship is based at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story in Virginia Beach.\n\nThe Navy compresses plastic waste into discs for easy storage until ships reach port. The discs were found last month washed up on beaches on North Carolina's Outer Banks. One resident said she collected 17 discs in Kill Devil Hills.\n\nThe Navy says marking on the discs confirmed they came from the ship. So far 19 discs have been recovered. It's estimated that up to 60 were thrown overboard.\n\nShips are not supposed to dump plastic into the ocean. In fact, throwing trash overboard violates Navy policy and environmental regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Navy says mysterious disks of trash that washed ashore on the Outer Banks came from their vessels. Two sailors have been accused of throwing the trash over the side of the ship. WUSA-TV\n\nTed Brown, with the Navy's Fleet Forces Command, said the disks are supposed to be stored in a trash room until a ship reaches port, WUSA-TV reported.\n\nThe Navy says appropriate action will be taken regarding the sailors.
The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits surged to their highest level in over two years, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday.\n\nIn the week ending March 14, workers filed 281,000 jobless claims, a jump of 70,000 from the previous week. This is the highest level for initial claims since September 2, 2017, when applications for aid reached 299,000. The 33% jump from the week before is the highest one-week increase since 1992.\n\nThe latest figure likely underestimates the true number of newly unemployed workers. Many states reported a surge in layoffs in just the last few days, as many restaurants, bars, hotels, gyms, malls and other businesses closed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThis is a small preview of the dramatic surge in claims that we're likely to see next week, economists at Oxford Economics said in a note. Anecdotal data reported by some states point to a rise in claims above 1.2 million, double the previous record set in 1982.\n\nIt takes anywhere from two to four weeks for a laid-off worker to show up in federal unemployment claims data, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at global accounting firm RSM told CBS MoneyWatch. During the current economic expansion, workers file an average of 243,000 jobless claims per week, he said.\n\nWhat's more, many people who recently lost work won't show up in the official unemployment figures. Uber and Lyft drivers, many of whom have lost much of their business as Americans stay put, won't be eligible to receive compensation because they are classified as independent contractors. Actors, tour guides and fitness instructors are among the many other so-called gig workers who've lost business during the crisis but who are ineligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nAs many as 4 million hospitality workers could lose their jobs this summer, according to an estimate from outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that as many as 3 million workers could be laid off by this summer. The Travel Industry Association estimates 4.6 million workers in that field alone will lose their jobs this year.
Facebook said Thursday it will take down advertisements from President Trump's campaign that falsely present a survey on the campaign's website as an official 2020 census survey. Facebook made the announcement after initially allowing more than 1,000 of the ads to remain online.\n\nThe ads urge supporters to take what it calls the Official 2020 Congressional District Census. One of the ads says the survey is ESSENTIAL to our team's 2020 strategy, and calls it a national effort (to) provide us with detailed data we need for YOUR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.\n\nThe ads appeared on Facebook just days before households across the U.S. will start receiving official mail from the Census Bureau about the actual 2020 census.\n\nFacebook said it would take down Trump campaign ads that falsely claimed to be official 2020 census surveys. Trump campaign ad\n\nThe ads started running this week on the Facebook pages for Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, and are paid for by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee.\n\nThe newsletter Popular Information first reported on the ads and said Facebook initially refused to take them down. A few hours after Popular Information's story was posted, Facebook reversed its decision.\n\nThe ads do not link to any official government form or anything relating to the 2020 U.S. census. Instead, they lead to an opinion survey on President Trump's campaign website, which is labeled: OFFICIAL 2020 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CENSUS.\n\nQuestions on the survey include:\n\nDo you think Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left are putting their personal anti-Trump agenda ahead of what's best for the American people?\n\nDo you approve or disapprove of the Democrats' big government socialist agenda?\n\nDo you think that Democrats' failed Impeachment Witch Hunt against President Trump will actually end up helping his chances of winning in November?\n\nThe campaign survey also includes a question about whether respondents support adding a citizenship question to the U.S. census — something the Trump administration attempted to do but was blocked by the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter filling out the form, users are asked to donate to the president's reelection campaign.\n\nPopular Information reported that Facebook at first said the ads didn't violate its policies because they are campaign ads and not about the official U.S. census. But Facebook reversed course a few hours later and said the ads would come down.\n\nThere are policies in place to prevent confusion around the official U.S. Census and this is an example of those being enforced, the company said in a statement to CBS News. Facebook's policy communications manager Andy Stone also posted it on Twitter.\n\nRegarding the Trump/census ads, I want to share Facebook's statement: There are policies in place to prevent confusion around the official U.S. Census and this is an example of those being enforced. — Andy Stone (@andymstone) March 5, 2020\n\nOn Friday, the ads were listed as inactive in Facebook's Ad Library and replaced with a label reading, This ad was taken down because it goes against Facebook Advertising Policies.\n\nThe decision also came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose San Francisco district has a Facebook office, blasted the social media giant for allowing the ads.\n\nI'm particularly annoyed today at the actions of Facebook, she said at her weekly press conference, calling the Trump ads a lie that is consistent with the misrepresentation policy of Facebook.\n\nBut now they're messing with who we are as Americans, she added. I know the profit motive that is their business model. But it should not come at the cost of counting who is in our country.\n\nFacebook came under fire last year for its decision to not take down political ads with false information. But the company said it would take a harsher stance on misinformation about the U.S. census.\n\nFacebook announced a new policy in December banning misleading information about when and how to participate in the census and the consequences of participating. It also said it would prohibit ads that portray census participation as useless or meaningless or advise people not to participate in the census.
BEIJING - Washington has restricted the access of one of China's biggest telecoms equipment makers, ZTE Corp., to American components after concluding the state-owned company improperly exported U.S. technology to Iran.\n\nThe sanctions took effect Tuesday after ZTE was found to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the U.S., the Commerce Department said. The department released documents it said showed ZTE set up front companies to evade U.S. controls on high-tech exports to Iran.\n\nThe Chinese government said it opposes the U.S. sanctions. ZTE's technology purchases support thousands of U.S. jobs that might be in jeopardy, the Commerce Ministry said.\n\nThis approach will only hurt others without necessarily benefiting oneself, said China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, at a news conference Tuesday during the meeting of the national legislature.\n\nZTE said it was fully committed to obeying the law wherever it operates.\n\nZTE has been cooperating, will continue to cooperate and communicate with all U.S. agencies as required, said a company statement. The company is working expeditiously toward resolution of this issue.\n\nThe conflict reflects the complex ties between U.S. and Chinese technology companies despite Washington's concerns about sharing advanced know-how with China.\n\nMost of the world's smartphones and personal computers are assembled in China. ZTE and other Chinese companies are developing their own technology but rely on Western chipsets and other components.\n\nThe sanctions could prompt Chinese leaders to push for faster development of their own fledgling technology suppliers, said Nikhil Batra, research manager for Asia-Pacific telecoms for IDC.\n\nIt might be a boon to officials who want to reduce reliance on foreign sources, said Batra.\n\nIt's not likely to be their chief concern that one of their companies has been sanctioned when it can lead to better development of China as a technology marketplace, he said.\n\nAmerican companies also might be vulnerable to retaliation, Batra said. He noted Beijing fined American chip supplier Qualcomm Technologies (QCOM) and investigated software giant Microsoft (MSFT) on anti-monopoly charges after Huawei Technologies was forced out of the U.S. server market following complaints it might be a security risk.\n\nFounded in 1985 as Zhongxing Semiconductor, ZTE is a major supplier of network switching gear and other telecoms products. It assembles smartphones for other companies and has launched its own brand.\n\nZTE and three other entities, including one in Iran, were identified in the scheme developed by ZTE Corp. to re-export controlled items to Iran contrary to United States law, said a Commerce Department announcement.\n\nIt said they will face additional requirements to apply for export licenses and gave no indication whether they would be granted.\n\nTwo documents released by the department described a detached (business) model and detached (shell) companies set up to handle sales to Iran of products covered by U.S. trade embargoes. The documents were marked Top Secret Highly Confidential. The Commerce Department did not say how it obtained them.\n\nThe sanctions threaten to disrupt sales by U.S. technology suppliers such as Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm. They earn billions of dollars a year from chip sales, license payments and other revenue from Chinese customers.\n\nZTE spends about $450 million every quarter on U.S. technology, according to Batra. In addition to Qualcomm and Intel, he said suppliers include Avnet (AVT), which makes electronics used in routers.\n\nIntel is still assessing the possible impact, a company spokesman, Will Moss, said in an email.\n\nPotential non-U.S. suppliers include MediaTek Inc., a Taiwanese maker of chipsets used by Chinese smartphone brands Huawei and Xiaomi, and South Korea's Samsung, said Batra. But he said for components in network routers and other advanced products, there is no alternative to Intel or rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nIt's going to be a big impact for both sides -- for ZTE as well as the U.S. companies, he said.\n\nZTE, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, said it earned 2.6 billion yuan ($400 million) on revenue of 81.5 billion yuan ($12.5 billion) in 2014, the most recent year for which it has reported results.\n\nU.S. authorities earlier cited ZTE as a possible security risk. In 2012, a congressional panel said the company and rival Huawei were potential threats and Americans should avoid doing business with them.
By all accounts, the Whitakers were a perfect family living in a community outside of Houston, Texas. That was all shattered on Dec. 10, 2003, when the family of four was gunned down as they entered their home. Tricia Whitaker, a retired teacher, and her 19-year-old son, Kevin, died from their injuries. The dad, Kent, survived as did their son, Bart.\n\nI think, Oh my God, he shot all four of us,' Kent Whitaker told 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant.\n\nThe Whitaker family, from left, Kevin, Trisha, Bart and Kent.\n\nThe investigation into the shooting revealed an intricate plot and a ruthless conspiracy to eliminate three of the four Whitaker family members. The mastermind of the plot? Bart, who hated his family and wanted their money. In 2007 he was tried and convicted of hiring the hit man to kill his family and hurt him, too, to cover up the crime. He was given the death penalty.\n\nThis is where most cases end; not this one. Since his son was convicted, and to the disbelief of some, Kent Whitaker has fought to save Bart from being executed.\n\nWhitaker, now remarried, made one last plea to the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole in February 2018. We're not asking them to forgive him or let him go. We just want them to let him live, Whitaker said.\n\nWhitaker got some reprieve from the board, but his son's fate still rested in the hands of the governor of Texas, who would have the ultimate decision.\n\nThe emotional story of murder, conspiracy and forgiveness goes all the way down to the day Bart Whitaker was scheduled to die. Bart had a final meal. His father visited the prison for the last time before his scheduled execution.\n\nWe touched hands through the glass and said our goodbyes, Whitaker said.\n\nCould Bart Whitaker be saved before time ran out?\n\nFOUR SHOTS FIRED\n\nJohn Flores: Sugar Land is very middle class … upper class, white collar. It's a nice place. Everything's new. You hang out with your neighbors. You hang out with your neighbors' kids.\n\nFor John Flores and his best friend Kevin Whitaker, life was sweet in Sugar Land, Texas.\n\nJohn Flores: Almost anything is at your fingertips. You can do whatever you want, lot of fun.\n\nBut that all changed on the night of Dec. 10, 2003, when Kevin and his family were gunned down in their home.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: That night, when we'd just gotten home from church, and got the call of a quadruple shooting. That just doesn't happen out here in Sugar Land.\n\nMarshall Slot was the lead detective assigned to the case.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: It looks as if it's a burglary gone wrong. The family is coming home from dinner. It's plausible that they could have surprised a burglar.\n\nBut as Detective Slot combed through the Whitaker home, he realized things weren't adding up.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: In the master bedroom, the dressers, an armoire, all had drawers open on them, but they were all open equal distance. It was very neat and orderly.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Normally a burglar would throw everything out of the drawers to see if there's any valuables in there.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Yes, sir.\n\nDetective Slot began to suspect the burglary had been staged.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: None of the items of value inside the house had been moved around. The electronics, laptops, jewelry, none of those items that are typically taken in burglaries.\n\nAnd then there was the murder weapon: it was the Whitakers' own gun.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: The gun safe had been pried open and it was in a very isolated portion of the household. This is looking more and more like this person knew this gun was here and obtained it for a specific reason.\n\nDetective Slot turned his attention to the Whitaker family's history, hoping it might provide some answers. He started with Kent Whitaker's relationship to his wife Trisha.\n\nKent Whitaker: We met on a blind date. Walked in her house and I didn't know what I was expecting, but she came down and I thought I've never had a blind date like this before. And we hit it off very well right from the start.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How long after you first met Trisha did you realize to yourself, I'm in love with this woman?\n\nKent Whitaker: Couple of months, maybe.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Really?\n\nKent Whitaker: Yeah.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And did she feel the same way about you?\n\nKent Whitaker: Yeah. Yes, she did.\n\nKevin, left, and Bart Whitaker Kent Whitaker\n\nAnd then came their two boys, Bart and Kevin.\n\nThe Whitakers were doing well. Kent was a successful accountant. Trisha, an elementary school teacher.\n\nBarbie Harrington: Trisha had a great rapport with children. Parents adored her. The staff adored her. She was just fun.\n\nBarbie Harrington and Peggy McLane, Trisha's close friends and coworkers, knew her true love was being a mom.\n\nPeggy McLane: They were everything. That's all she talked about. She loved those boys.\n\nBart, the eldest, did well in school and had a quirky sense of humor.\n\nPeggy McLane: He was fun. He was witty. He was respectful.\n\nPeter Van Sant: A good son?\n\nPeggy McLane: A good son.\n\nA son who shared a passion for biking with his dad.\n\nKent Whitaker: He and I would spend hours and hours on training rides and on organized rides.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What would you talk about on those trips?\n\nKent Whitaker: Everything.\n\nKevin was the sensitive one.\n\nKent Whitaker: Kevin was man at a young age. He would not back down from injustice. But he would be so quick to forgive.\n\nPeter Van Sant: This was as healthy and vibrant and loving a family as you'd find, wasn't it?\n\nKent Whitaker: Thought so. I was very happy with my family. I loved them.\n\nThen came Dec. 10, 2003.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How did that day begin?\n\nKent Whitaker: Bart was supposed to be graduating from college. He called and said he was through with his finals and he wanted to go out to eat and celebrate.\n\nPeggy McLane: Trisha was so proud. She was telling Bart she was going to jump up and down and scream, Thank you, Jesus.\n\nKent Whitaker: We all celebrated. We laughed. We told some jokes. We -- we teased each other and took some pictures and gave Bart his graduation gift, which was an expensive watch.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What kind of watch was it?\n\nKent Whitaker: It was a Rolex. It was what he'd always wanted. It was just a happy night.\n\nAfter dinner the Whitakers headed home. Then, unimaginable horror -- four shots fired.\n\nKent Whitaker: I start praying and I say, Father, you know, if it's my time to die, I'm ready. It's OK. But protect my family. And it just was awful.\n\nCliff Stanley: I saw Kent lying down. I went up to him and he was shot. He says, I'm bleeding very badly.\n\nNeighbor Cliff Stanley, the first person on the scene then went to check on Trisha.\n\nCliff Stanley: She was still alive, was kind of moaning. I said, What happened? And Trisha said, He shot us.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did she say who he was?\n\nCliff Stanley: No.\n\nBart was lying in the living room, wounded. As for Kevin --\n\nCliff Stanley: I could see Kevin clearly and Kevin was finished.\n\nCliff Stanley: Kent, Trisha, and Bart were rushed to the hospital, but Trisha didn't survive.\n\nKent Whitaker: It was horrible.\n\nPeggy McLane [crying]: I lost a friend that taught me how to be a better teacher and a better mother. She was just a really good person and I miss her so much.\n\nJohn Flores: And I remember I walked over to my friend's mom, and I just said, Was it Kevin? And I felt her -- I felt her nod on my-- on my head. I just kind of shook my head and said OK.\n\nNEWS REPORT: Detectives spent the day searching for anything that would lead them to a killer ...\n\nBy the next day, grief turned to anger.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Kent, in no unclear terms, told me he wanted us to catch whoever did this. He was upset, he was hurt.\n\nAnd Bart seemed to share that anger.\n\nJohn Flores: He didn't say much. But he pulled my friend Matt and I to him and he said, We're going find who did it.\n\nDetective Slot continued his routine questioning of the survivors. Bart told Slot he was about to graduate from Sam Houston State University. But the next day came stunning news.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: The information had come into the Sugar Land Police Department from Sam Houston State University that Bart was not enrolled as a student.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Wait a second. He was not a student?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: He was a freshman on academic probation.\n\nPeter Van Sant: A freshman?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Yes, sir.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Wasn't even a senior.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Correct.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, what do you do with this information?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Bells and whistles start going off that why is this kid lying to us? … What's he got to hide?\n\nKent Whitaker: What were you thinking? You lied to us about being in school? You weren't even near graduating. How could you have done that?\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ask Bart why he had lied to you? Why he had said he was a student at Sam Houston State?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Yes, sir. He just didn't want to disappoint his family. He had needed a break; the stress of school had gotten on him.\n\nThen, just five days after the shooting, another bombshell.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: It was about 11, 11:30 at night. …The sergeant on duty paged me and said, Hey there's somebody here who wants to talk to you.\n\nSlot met the stranger in the darkened parking lot behind the police station.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: He explained to me that he felt he had information that was crucial to the investigation.\n\nThe man said that Bart Whitaker wanted him to help kill his family.\n\nBLUEPRINT FOR MURDER\n\nSix days after Trisha and Kevin Whitaker were gunned down at their home more than 1,000 friends and family gathered to celebrate their lives.\n\nBrittany Barnhill: So many people, it was incredible.\n\nIt was a time to share fond memories.\n\nFriend of Trisha [at funeral]: Almost every conversation with Trisha included something about Kent, Bart, and Kevin.\n\nJohn Flores [in tears at funeral]: Kevin was a faithful loyal friend. He never compromised anything.\n\nBrittany Barnhill [in tears at funeral]: I loved Kevin so much. I cried with him. I went to senior prom with him.\n\nBrittany Barnhill [at funeral]: Bart, I cannot tell you how much Kevin looked up to you. You were his hero.\n\nAmid the sadness there was also anger.\n\nMan at funeral: This murderer is still out there. The police needs our help. For your own families for everybody's sake, let's catch him.\n\nBut what no one here knew, among the mourners was a man police were closely watching.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Your suspicions are focusing on which person?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Bart, definitely.\n\nThat stranger Marshall Slot had met in the police parking lot turned out to be an old friend of Bart's named Adam Hipp. And he told the detective an extraordinary story: that Bart had approached him several years earlier with a detailed plan to kill his family.\n\nThe diagram that Adam Hipp drew for Det. Slot called for Hipp being the shooter, shooting the Whitaker family members as they came in the residence. CBS News\n\nDet. Marshall Slot [at computer]: This is a diagram that Adam Hipp drew for me during our three-hour long conversation. It called for Adam Hipp being the shooter, shooting the family members as they came in the residence.\n\nAccording to Adam Hipp, the plan even included a twist to fool police: Bart wanted Hipp to shoot him in the shoulder, so he'd look like a victim, not a suspect.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: It was unbelievable.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So what Adam Hipp was telling you was essentially the blueprint for what happened in 2003, the real shooting?\n\nMarshall Slot: The exact blueprint.\n\nBut Bart appeared to have nothing to hide. He agreed to help detectives by reenacting what happened the night of the shootings:\n\nBART WHITAKER [police video]: That's when I heard a bang. And I don't remember if, I probably would have run up this way.\n\nBut Bart's behavior only heightens Slot's suspicions.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Everything is very vague. It could have been this, but it could have been this.\n\nMARSHALL SLOT [police video]: So that's about the distance you were from him when you got shot? BART WHITAKER [police video]: Yeah. I guess. It might have been closer, I don't really remember.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: The fact that he wasn't able to give me a lot of detail about it … It was just unusual to me.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Police had indicated to you that he was a suspect in this case.\n\nKent Whitaker: Yes.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Were you wondering at all in the back of your mind, maybe he had something to do with this?\n\nKent Whitaker: I considered it but -- but didn't consider it seriously. He promised me that there was nothing to it, that he did not have anything to do with it, that he loved Trisha and Kevin and me. …It was inconceivable.\n\nBut after Adam Hipp's story, Detective Slot felt otherwise. He decided to check out two of Bart Whitaker's closest friends -- Chris Brashear and Steven Champagne.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Let's see if he approached any of his current friends to do this.\n\nChris Brashear and Steven Champagne worked with Bart at a country club just months before the murders. Slot asked them to provide what police call scent samples. Using bloodhounds, he compared those samples to evidence collected at the crime scene. Slot's hunch paid off when he got a match.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: The dogs indicated that Chris Brashear's scent … was on the drawers that had been moved that night.\n\nMore importantly, Brashear's scent was found on the gun used in the homicides.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Bingo. We've got our next prime suspect.\n\nWhen Detective Slot grilled Brashear, he denied any involvement in the shootings.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: We told him we had a definitive link between him and the murder weapon on the night of the shooting.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What are you seeing on Brashear's face?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Horror. Panic. We struck a nerve with this kid.\n\nSlot was now closing in on Bart Whitaker. Then one night, seven months after the shootings, Bart told his dad he was heading out to a club.\n\nKent Whitaker: Bart told me he would see me the next day. …Well, that was the last I saw him. …He disappeared.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Just fell off the face of the earth?\n\nKent Whitaker [affirms]: Um, hmm.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: I was angry. We'd kind of let him get away. That's what I felt like.\n\nBart's disappearance was a setback. But Detective Slot pressed on, focusing on the suspects still in Sugar Land -- especially Steven Champagne.\n\nMarshall Slot: We stayed on him and stayed on him and stayed on him.\n\nEventually, Champagne cracked.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: He informed me that he participated in the crime … and that Chris Brashear had killed the family.\n\nChampagne confessed that he was the getaway driver, Chris Brashear was the shooter, and that Bart Whitaker was the mastermind behind the plan.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: This was the floodgates opening.\n\nChampagne led Slot to a treasure trove of physical evidence.\n\nAmmunition from the gun used in the Whitaker shootings Sugar Land Police Dept.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: He led me to the place on the bridge over Lake Conroe where he and Chris Brashear had thrown items of evidence.\n\nA chisel --\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: -- that Chris Brashear had used to break into the gun safe.\n\nAmmunition --\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: -- which happened to be the ammunition that was in the gun.\n\nAnd two cell phones.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Bart Whitaker had provided those to them to use during the course of carrying out the plot.\n\nSteven Champagne, left, and Chris Brashear, were arrested for the murders of Trisha and Kevin Whitaker in September 2005. Sugar Land Police Dept.\n\nIn September 2005, Sugar Land police arrested both Steven Champagne and Chris Brashear for the murders of Trisha and Kevin Whitaker. But they still didn't know where to find Bart Whitaker.\n\nBART'S NEW LIFE\n\nWhen Bart Whitaker fled Sugar Land, Texas seven months after the shootings, he left behind a community and a father in disbelief.\n\nPeter Van Sant: As a general rule, people don't run if they're innocent.\n\nKent Whitaker: No, they don't. Oh, it was horrible. It was awful. …I just sat down and I just cried.\n\nLike many a desperado before him, Bart headed south into Mexico. He ended up in a tiny village called Cerralvo, located about forty miles from the Texas border.\n\nBart started his new life in Cerralvo with about $7,000 in cash, money he had stolen from his father's house. He could speak a little Spanish and soon he had a small apartment in town and a job at a local furniture store. He also had something else: a new identity.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Who is this man?\n\nGabriella Gutierrez [through translator]: Well, I know him as Rudy.\n\nGabriella Gutierrez remembers her American friend named Rudy Rios.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How would you describe him?\n\nGabriella Gutierrez [through translator]: Well, he was a friendly person. He liked to drink. He liked the beer. He liked to go with girls. He was very charming. He had a way with the ladies.\n\nCindy Lou Salinas [through translator]: I saw him, and I said, Wow, he's gorgeous.\n\nCindy Lou Salinas first saw Bart in church of all places.\n\nCindy Lou Salinas [through translator]: I don't know, I found him very interesting. The guys that I've known -- I don't know, he just had something nobody had.\n\nAfter Bart and Cindy Lou began dating, her father, Omero, gave Bart a job at the family's furniture store.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What kind of a worker was he?\n\nOmero Salinas [through translator]: Very good, very obedient. …I really liked him and held him in high esteem.\n\nCindy Lou's brother, Ubaldo, befriended Bart and was impressed with his stories of adventure -- like the one explaining his bullet wound.\n\nUbaldo Salinas [through translator]: He said he got the scar in the Afghanistan war. …He said there was a surprise attack on his group by the Afghanis. Most of those in his group were killed. He shot at one with his rifle, but there was another one who got him in the shoulder.\n\nThe entire Salinas family took Bart in as one of their own, and Bart told them they were the family he never had.\n\nCindy Lou Salinas [through translator]: He used to tell me that he was an only child. That he never loved his mother because his mother never loved him either. And that his mother was a prostitute, he used to say that. …His family never gave him the love he wanted. They only gave him money. They ignored him.\n\nFor 14 months, Bart lived a carefree new life as Rudy Rios – but it was all about to come to an end.\n\nRudy Rios [phone call]: To me he seems like a cool guy, but if he did that then he needs to pay of it, you know, what I mean.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot [phone call] I agree.\n\nBack in Sugar Land, Detective Slot got a phone call from the real Rudy Rios.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: He called me, anonymously one day at my office and said, I know where Bart Whitaker is. I helped him get there.\n\nRudy Rios and Bart had worked together at a Houston restaurant.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Bart explained to him that there was pressure on him from law enforcement. Rudy said, Well if you ever need any help, let me know. I've got family in Mexico that can help you out.\n\nAccording to Rudy Rios, Bart paid him $3,000 to escort him to Cerralvo. But when word spread of a reward for Bart's capture, the real Rudy looked to get paid again.\n\nRudy Rios [on the phone]: If there's a reward, you know, I don't care. I'll turn his ass in.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How much?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Ten thousand dollars.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Ten thousand bucks.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, Rudy had dollar signs in his eyes when he came forward?\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: Yes, sir.\n\nMarshall Slot was there waiting when Mexican authorities dumped Bart back across the border.\n\nDet. Marshall Slot: He glanced at me and then just down to the floor. I don't know if it was a you got me look, but it was very satisfying to walk in that jail.\n\nKent Whitaker: The first time I saw him when they took him back from Mexico. I walk in and we're separated by the bulletproof glass. I said, Well, you look like you're OK. And he says, Yes, I am. And he says, Dad, I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry for all of it. It's all my fault.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what was the it in that sentence that he was referring to?\n\nKent Whitaker: The murders. He's responsible for the murders.\n\nBart Whitaker Sugar Land Police Dept.\n\nAlso waiting for Bart were Fort Bend County prosecutors Jeff Strange and Fred Felcman with an indictment for the murders of his mother and brother.\n\nProsecutor Jeff Strange: It is just the ultimate act of betrayal. …It doesn't get any worse than this.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Why did he have to kill them?\n\nProsecutor Jeff Strange: One, because that was the way he was going to inherit $1.5 million.\n\nProsecutor Jeff Strange: I think also to some extent deep down, Bart thinks he's smarter than everybody else. And he just wanted to see if he could get away with the perfect crime.\n\nIn Fred Felcman, Bart had an adversary who is one of the toughest, no-nonsense prosecutors in Texas.\n\nHow would you describe Bart Whitaker?\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: There is a term they use in psycho lingo, psychobabble, of sociopath. In other words, a person who knows he's doing something wrong but really doesn't care. The old time Texas thing was that he's just a mean sold on of a bitch, OK?\n\nBecause this was a multiple murder, prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Bart Whitaker.\n\nFRED FELCMAN [in court]: Four shots fired. Four hits.\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: It's a good strong case.\n\nIn fact, it's an overwhelming case. So much so that Bart's defense attorney decides on a unique strategy. He will all but concede that Bart is guilty and use the trial to try and convince jurors that Bart's life should be spared. And he has a man of unshakeable religious faith in his corner.\n\nKent Whitaker: Even knowing that he'd been guilty and responsible for this, I just can't understand why it's so necessary to put him to death.\n\nFRED FELCMAN: Do you have any inkling whatsoever Mr. Whitaker that your son had been lying to you? KENT WHITAKER: No, I didn't.\n\nIncredibly, Kent Whitaker has forgiven Bart.\n\nKent Whitaker: The first night in the hospital … I forgave everyone who was involved in this. …It is a gift of God that allows me to do this. …I think he gave me that gift so that when I found out that it was my son, that it would be a legitimate forgiveness.\n\nThe question now is: will a jury be as forgiving?\n\nA RUTHLESS CONSPIRACY\n\nSugar Land, Texas has never seen a trial like this.\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: This crime affected all of Sugar Land.\n\nA case of multiple murder where the accused is being passionately defended by one of the people he tried to kill.\n\nKent Whitaker: If the state pursues the death penalty and receives it, then they will kill the last surviving member of my family.\n\nKent Whitaker enters court as his son, Bart, goes on trial for his role in the Dec. 10, 2003 murders of his wife, Tricia, and son, Kevin. Kent was injured in the attack. KHOU\n\nKent Whitaker believes his son's eternal soul is at stake.\n\nKent Whitaker: I believe, as a Christian, that God can and does forgive and change people's hearts. If they are sorry, if they repent, if they ask His forgiveness for real, He will forgive them.\n\nBut Jeff Strange and Fred Felcman say their duty is to uphold Texas law, not God's law.\n\nProsecutor Jeff Strange: Kent Whitaker's religious faith is genuine. Forgiveness is a big tenet of what he believes. And I respect that and I -- I totally understand that. That's not my job though.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Does Bart Whitaker deserve the death penalty?\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: Yes. He meets the criteria we have in the state of Texas. He is a continuing threat. He intentionally caused these people's death. And there is nothing mitigating about him. He wasn't abused. He wasn't surrounded by crime. I find it hard to believe anybody wouldn't think he deserved it.\n\nThree years after Trisha and Kevin's murders, Bart Whitaker's trial gets underway. Prosecutors present crime scene analysis, forensic evidence, and eyewitness accounts.\n\nSteven Champagne testifies that two months before the shootings, Bart Whitaker offered both him and Chris Brashear a cut of a $1 million insurance policy to help kill the Whitaker family. On the night of the attack, Champagne was waiting in the getaway car.\n\nBut it's the testimony of Steven Champagne, one of Bart's alleged accomplices, that everyone in the courtroom is waiting to hear:\n\nJEFF STRANGE: What are you charged with? STEVEN CHAMPAGNE: Capital murder.\n\nChampagne says two months before the shootings, Bart offered both him and Chris Brashear a cut of a million-dollar insurance policy to help kill the Whitaker family:\n\nSTEVEN CHAMPAGNE: The conversation was about … when the family got back from eating dinner, that Chris would be in the house and shoot them.\n\nOn the night of the attack, Champagne was waiting in the getaway car when Chris Brashear quickly got inside:\n\nSTEVEN CHAMPAGNE: I asked him what happened. …He told me that he had shot all of them.\n\nDefense attorney Randy McDonald can do little except attack Champagne for agreeing to kill for money:\n\nRANDY MCDONALD: And it really didn't bother you that three other human beings would be killed so you could have a better lifestyle? STEVEN CHAMPAGNE: The way that I looked at it was they weren't human.\n\nAs prosecutors build their case, more shocking details emerge. Investigators learn the 2003 attack wasn't the first time Bart had tried to kill his family. He had made at least three other attempts using other friends as recruits.\n\nJEFF STRANGE: Was it just a general conversation, I want to kill my family. I want you to help me? WILL ANTHONY: Yes, sir.\n\nIn December 2000, Bart approached his college roommates Will Anthony and Justin Peters:\n\nWILL ANTHONY: I was supposed to, as they enter the home, shoot the family, sir. JEFF STRANGE: Will who was supposed to actually go into the house, was he going to be given anything to hide his identity? JUSTIN PETERS: Yes. …He was given … black pants and black shirt and a ski mask. JEFF STRANGE: By who? JUSTIN PETERS: Bart.\n\nPeters and Anthony actually made it to the Whitaker home. As planned, Will Anthony went to open a back window:\n\nWILL ANTHONY: As soon as I touch it, sir, I tried to open it, an alarm went off.\n\nThe two men fled. But Bart Whitaker wasn't scared off. Two months later he approached another friend with another plan. Remember Adam Hipp, Bart's old friend-turned police informant? Under oath, Hipp publicly admits that he too once agreed to help kill the Whitaker family:\n\nJEFF STRANGE: Why did you say yes? ADAM HIPP: You know, I don't know. I'm not proud of it, but for the simple fact I was kind of interested to see how far he would take it.\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: We're going, Huh? These were kind of people you would think, this is what you want your son to be, goes to college, gets a banking job, stuff like this.\n\nPeter Van Sant: All-American boys.\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: All-American boys.\n\nLike Bart, all three young men came from well-to-do families.\n\nProsecutor Jeff Strange: Clean cut, kind of all-American kids. Justin Peters had been a national merit scholar. …I just could not see how this could happen.\n\nBesides money, Prosecutor Felcman believes Bart Whitaker is a gifted liar and manipulator.\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: He would actually seek out people, OK? …He would seek out the ones that were maybe a little weaker, that he got to know a little bit better, that had some investment in him.\n\nBart's second plan to murder his family with the aid of Adam Hipp never went beyond talk. But by April 2001, Bart had hatched yet a third plot.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, Bart Whitaker was a determined young man?\n\nProsecutor Jeff Strange: Absolutely.\n\nThis time, the plan unraveled after Jennifer Japhet, a college acquaintance of Bart's, found out about it:\n\nJENNIFER JAPHET: I asked Bart if he was seriously going to let this happen. JEFF STRANGE: And how did he react to that? JENNIFER JAPHET: He came up to me and he gave me a hug and whispered in my ear that everything was going to be OK. JEFF STRANGE: Did you called the police? JENNIFER JAPHET: I did call the police.\n\nPolice, in turn, notified Kent and Trisha.\n\nKent Whitaker: It was just the far-outest thing that you can conceive of and we immediately said, there's no way.\n\nBart told his parents it was all a misunderstanding. His parents believed him.\n\nKent Whitaker: In retrospect, you say, What an idiot. How could you possibly have not seen this? But the truth is we didn't know they were lies.\n\nEven after his wife and youngest son were murdered two years later, Kent still refused to believe that Bart was capable of such evil.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Aren't you putting two and two together here and saying maybe Bart's responsible for this?\n\nKent Whitaker: Perhaps I should have, but I didn't.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you believe this crime could have been prevented if people had paid attention to the warning signs?\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: No…. Look at the actions of Bart Whitaker. You're already caught, alright? But you still proceed to it. And you still go through it. Now, you tell me where along this line would Bart Whitaker, do you think, is going to stop?\n\nBart Whitaker's trial lasted six days. The jury deliberates just two hours, returning with a verdict everyone was expecting:\n\nJUDGE CLIFFORD VACEK (reads verdict): We, the jury, do hereby find the defendant, Thomas Bartlett Whitaker, guilty of the offense of capital murder as charged in the indictment.\n\nBut the real drama of this case is the punishment phase. Now, for the first time, Bart Whitaker will speak openly about his obsession with killing his family:\n\nBART WHITAKER [crying on the witness stand]: I feel horrible about myself, what I've done.\n\nA FATHER'S PLEA\n\nThe punishment phase of Bart Whitaker's trial is underway.\n\nKent Whitaker: This is daunting. Our son's life is hanging in the balance.\n\nAnd his father Kent hopes he can persuade the jury to forgive Bart as he has.\n\nDEFENSE ATTORNEY RANDY MCDONALD: The ladies and gentlemen of the jury may not have the same faith. They may not have the same beliefs about what should happen to somebody. But is it your desire that they assess a life sentence in this case? KENT WHITAKER: It has been from the start and it still is. RANDY MCDONALD: Would Trisha feel the same way? KENT WHITAKER: I promise you, she would have been appalled that the state chose to pursue the death penalty in this case.\n\nBut it will take more than the wishes of Kent or Trisha to spare their son's life.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, Bart decides to put his fate in his own hands and speak directly to the jury:\n\nBart Whitaker takes the stand in his trial for the murders of his mother and brother KHOU\n\nBART WHITAKER: I am 100-percent guilty for this. I put the plan in motion. If I had not done so, it would not have happened. RANDY MCDONALD: And did you realize that you robbed your mother of a full life? BART WHITAKER: Yes. RANDY MCDONALD: You robbed Kevin of a full life. BART WHITAKER: Yes. RANDY MCDONALD: You actually even robbed your father of a full life. BART WHITAKER [whispers]: Yes, sir. RANDY MCDONALD: Do you feel any remorse for this? BART WHITAKER: Yes, sir, I do. RANDY MCDONALD: Who do you feel remorse for?\n\nBART WHITAKER: For everyone involved starting with my dad, my mom, and my brother. [Cries, pauses.] Everyone I ever met in my life, I feel sorry for having come in contact with me.\n\nBart is finally asked the question on everyone's mind:\n\nRANDY MCDONALD: Can you answer the question why? BART WHITAKER: No, sir. I have come up with a lot of the reasons for how I -- how I got to where I was going, but they do not explain it. I always felt that whatever love they sent me was conditional on a standard that I just never felt I could reach.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Bart Whitaker claims that he felt unloved. He felt he couldn't live up to his parents' expectations.\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: Yeah, I heard all that crap, too. …There's no evidence whatsoever this family ever did anything to him.They loved him unconditionally.\n\nKent Whitaker: I think he came to the decision that, you know, I hate myself. I hate this life I'm in. If there's just some way I can get out of it -- maybe if my parents, maybe if my family was gone, I could be free of this and live a real life.\n\nFor Bart's life to be spared, he must convince the jury he is no longer a threat to anyone in or out of prison:\n\nRANDY MCDONALD: Do you have any designs on any conduct that would in any way, shape or form, hurt another individual? BART WHITAKER: No. The only people I've ever hated, and I know it was not for the right reasons, but the only people I ever hated were my parents and my brother. RANDY MCDONALD: But the irony of it all is that your dad is actually the one that's come to your rescue and put you back on track. BART WHITAKER: He's become my best friend in the last year. JUDGE CLIFFORD VACEK: Mr. Felcman, I assume you're going to be a while. FRED FELCMAN: That's a good chance.\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman has waited nearly two years for this moment:\n\nFRED FELCMAN: Your mother loved you, that her whole life was you and Kevin. But then you tell me you never felt loved by your parents? BART WHITAKER: Yes, sir. FRED FELCMAN: You find anything scary about this? BART WHITAKER: I find something tragic about it. FRED FELCMAN: Tragic, that I've got a defendant who's that out of touch with reality?\n\nFelcman wants to convince the jury that Bart Whitaker's disconnect with reality makes him dangerous:\n\nFRED FELCMAN: Somebody interacts with Bart Whitaker, it can be on a totally innocent basis, and you decide to perceive it different. You could kill that person. BART WHITAKER: No, I could not. FRED FELCMAN: But you killed your mother and brother on totally false circumstances, right? BART WHITAKER: Yes, sir. I was a different person then.\n\nTrisha, Kevin and Kent Whitaker Kent Whitaker\n\nFelcman reminds the jury of the lives Bart took:\n\nFRED FELCMAN: Did you see your brother when you ran in? BART WHITAKER: Yes, I did. FRED FELCMAN: He was gurgling in his own blood, wasn't he? BART WHITAKER [crying]: Yeah. FRED FELCMAN: You know, I've watched this whole trial and you never cried 'til now. BART WHITAKER: I did earlier. FRED FELCMAN: Why are you crying now? BART WHITAKER: Horrible memory.\n\nBart tries one last time to convince Felcman, and the jury, that he has changed:\n\nBART WHITAKER: You believe a person can't be sorry for the things he did? FRED FELCMAN: No. I think they can be sorry Mr. Whitaker. But I don't think you are. I think you're sorry you got caught and now you're figuring out how to get out of the death penalty.\n\nIt took jurors only 10 hours to reach a verdict.\n\nJUDGE CLIFFORD VACEK [in court]: The court does at this time upon those verdicts determine to you'd be sentenced to death.\n\nBart Whitaker is to die.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did that do to you inside?\n\nKent Whitaker: The feeling was a great deal of disappointment.\n\nDespite all that he now knows, Kent Whitaker says he will never abandon his son.\n\nKent Whitaker: I mean, Trisha and Kevin, I miss them. But they're in heaven and I'm going to heaven. And I have no doubts about that. I want Bart up there too.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Some day in the future you're going to get a phone call from somebody to tell you that Bart Whitaker has been put to death?\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: Yeah.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What will that day be like for you do you think?\n\nProsecutor Fred Felcman: There'll be a certain sadness. But it won't be for Bart Whitaker. It would be for the father. It will also be a sense of satisfaction too, though. Justice has been done in this case.\n\nOver the next decade, Kent Whitaker lobbies the state tirelessly for his son's death sentence to be commuted to life. But when Bart's appeals were exhausted, his execution is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Feb. 22, 2018.\n\nThe week before his son is to be out to death, Kent, now remarried, made one last desperate plea for mercy to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\n\n\nKent Whitaker [to reporters]: We're not asking him to forgive him or let him go we just want them to let him blive. …Bart was my the last surviving member of my natural family and no one in my family wants to see him executed.\n\nJust two days before the sentence is to be carried out, the board makes what could be a life-saving recommendation for clemency.\n\nKent Whitaker [to reporters, smiling] I don't think he's going to believe it. You're not going to believe it.\n\nKent Whitaker [to reporters]: This is Texas, this doesn't happen. I'm just so encouraged the system has worked. This was the right thing -- the right thing to do.\n\nBut the final decision has to come from the governor. And when execution day arrives, there's still no word from him. So, Kent went to see his son for the last time.\n\nKent Whitaker: We touched hands through the glass and said our goodbyes.\n\nBart eats his last meal. He gets ready to be strapped to the gurney. With less than 40 minutes to go, the governor finally decides:\n\nNEWS ANCHOR: Breaking news. Less than an hour before Thomas Bart Whitaker's 6 p.m. scheduled execution Governor Abbott spares his life.\n\nKent Whitaker [to reporters]: We were actually standing together praying when my phone rang … and so he said that we have a commutation. At that point, I put it on speaker and let everybody hear and the whole room erupted.\n\nKent and Bart Whitaker\n\nBar releases a statement saying, I'm thankful for the decision not for me, but for my dad.\n\nKent Whitaker: It was overpowering. I was so grateful.\n\nKENT WHITAKER STATEMENT AND TDCJ RESPONSE\n\nLate Friday, Jan. 4, 2019, 48 Hours received the following statement from Kent Whitaker regarding his son, Thomas Bart Whitaker:\n\nIt has been 11 months since Bart's sentence was commuted. The normal procedure is for TDCJ [Texas Department of Criminal Justice] to reclassify him from Death Row solitary confinement, using the same extensive file that the Pardons and Parole Board based their unanimous decision upon. His intake officer said he should be cleared for general population in 2-3 weeks, where he would receive phone privileges and interaction with other inmates for the first time in 11 years. Eventually he could earn a contact visit with me. Yet, to this day, he remains in solitary confinement with no reclassification. What is the point of commutation if his life does not improve? No one within TDCJ can explain why. Administrative segregation is a lingering death that defeats the purpose of commutation. Life is more than drawing breath and pumping blood alone in a prison cell; it means interacting with others, such as family for whom commutation was given as much as to Thomas.\n\nIn response, Texas Department of Criminal Justice director of communications Jeremy Desel said:
Washington — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi regained the gavel on Thursday, announcing a dramatically new direction for the House after eight years of Republican control. She promised to end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, address gun violence and climate change.\n\nPelosi also administered the oath of office to members of the most diverse new Congress ever. More than 100 female House members were sworn in, including the first two Native American women and the first two Muslim women.\n\nCongress overturned a two century-long ban on hats so that Minnesota's Ilhan Omar could wear her hijab on the House floor. Twenty-five new members are under the age of 40, their youth reflected by the swarm of congressional offspring who filled the chamber.\n\nNancy Pelosi of California, surrounded by her grandchildren and other children raises her right hand as Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, the longest-serving member of the House, administers the oath to Pelosi to become the Speaker of the House at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 3, 2019. Carolyn Kaster / AP\n\nAt 78, Pelosi is the first person to reclaim to the speakership in more than 60 years, winning support from all but a dozen Democrats after two months of horse trading and policy promises.\n\nOn Thursday Democratic committee chairs — newly vested with subpoena power — began to lay out their plans to investigate President Trump and his administration. They filed legislation to go after the president's tax returns and vowed to reopen a Russia probe House Republicans closed last year. As special counsel Robert Mueller continues his investigation, Pelosi disputed the Justice Department's claim that a sitting U.S. president cannot be indicted.\n\nHouse Democrats are also planning to vote to fund the parts of the government that have been shut down for two weeks. But the Democratic bill doesn't contain the border wall money the president is looking for, so the president said it's a non-starter. He's invited House and Senate leaders to the White House on Friday to continue negotiations.
Baghdad -- The U.S. military has begun the process of withdrawing troops from Syria, a U.S. defense official confirmed to CBS News on Friday, saying it was expected to take between 90 and 120 days. The official told CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that equipment had begun moving out earlier this week.\n\nAmerica's operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the country were to continue during the withdrawal process.\n\nCol. Sean Ryan, spokesman for the coalition fighting ISIS, confirmed earlier in the day to The Associated Press that the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria was underway.\n\nOut of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movements, he said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict in Syria through a network of activists on the ground, said the withdrawal began Thursday night. It said a convoy of about 10 armored vehicles, in addition to some trucks, pulled out from Syria's northeastern town of Rmeilan into Iraq.\n\nConfusion over U.S. plans in Syria\n\nConfirmation of the first withdrawals comes amid confusion over plans to implement President Donald Trump's pullout order and threats from Turkey to attack the Kurds, who have been America's partners on the ground in the war against ISIS in Syria.\n\nThere are 2,000 American troops in Syria. Mr. Trump's abrupt decision in December to pull them, declaring in a tweet the defeat of ISIS, sent shockwaves across the region and led to the resignation of U.S. Defense Minister James Mattis and the top U.S. envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition. It also led to major criticism that the U.S. was abandoning its local Kurdish allies amid Turkish threats of an imminent attack.\n\nOn Sunday, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said American troops would not leave northeastern Syria until ISIS is defeated and the American-allied Kurdish fighters are protected. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is on a tour of the region, has also sought to reassure the Kurds that they will be safe after U.S. troops withdraw from the country.\n\nThese have been folks that have fought with us and it's important that we do everything we can to ensure that those folks that fought with us are protected, Pompeo said of the Kurds while visiting Erbil, the capital of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, after talks in Baghdad.\n\nGiving a subsequent speech about broader U.S. policy in the Middle East at the American University in Cairo, Pompeo said now is the time to bring America's forces out of Syria. He stressed that the fight against ISIS would continue, but he did no repeat the need for the Kurds to be protected, or mention Bolton's previous vow to curb Iran's presence in Syria.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said Friday that it suspected the U.S. government was really intent on maintaining a military force inside Syria indefinitely, in spite of the pullout officially being announced by the Americans. Russia, the Syrian government's most vital ally, would be happy to see the U.S. pull out entirely of the war-torn country, where it has military bases and a significant troop presence.\n\nTurkey's threat to Kurds could slow pullout\n\nWhile the U.S. military pullout is now officially underway it is making a slow start.\n\nThe White House has not yet publicly altered it's most recent criteria, those announced by Bolton a week ago: that ISIS must be defeated and the Kurdish forces' security guaranteed before the American troops all come out. The first of those criteria is unmet, but feasible, as the terror group now holds only a small patch of land in Syria. The latter will no doubt prove the more difficult objective to meet.\n\nTurkey considers America's Kurdish allies of the YPG militia -- who were vital in the ground war against ISIS -- a terrorist group. On Thursday, Turkey's foreign minister said President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had already made the decision to launch an offensive against the Kurds in northern Syria, and that it would go ahead regardless of the presence of American forces.\n\nForeign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu went so far on Wednesday as to say that if the U.S. withdrawal from Syria was delayed, then we will put this decision into practice, suggesting Turkey could go after the Kurds in short order.\n\nThe U.S. announcement that Mr. Trump's ordered withdrawal is underway might be enough to convince Turkey to hold fire against America's Kurdish battleground allies, for a while, but Erdogan still wants to go after them, and he could make good on his threats -- even on a small scale -- at any time.\n\nThe challenge for the United States will be to strike a deal with Turkey's government that ensures the YPG militia, that was so invaluable to Washington over the past handful of years, is protected when the withdrawal is complete. If not, the Trump administration would be accused of abandoning an ally to a grim fate.
Frontier Airlines has changed its in-flight tipping policies to allow flight attendants to pocket gratuities from serving food and beverages to passengers. The Jan. 1 shift in rules ended a three-year policy of pooling flier tips among crew members.\n\nThe program has resulted in millions of dollars in tips since its inception more than three years ago, showing how much our customers appreciate the great work of our flight attendants, Frontier spokesperson Jonathan Freed told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nBut the shift comes amid strained contract negotiations with Frontier's unionized employees, who are fighting for higher wages and other concessions, including better healthcare benefits and more flexible work schedules. Flight attendants made a median salary of $50,500 in 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Frontier lags other airlines in terms of wages, in some cases earning 20 percent to 30 percent less than their peers at rival airlines, like Spirit, according to Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants.\n\nFrontier gives passengers the option to tip flight crew for exceptional service in the air -- a practice union leaders and others say reduces flight attendants from safety professionals to flying waiters and waitresses, according to industry analyst and Atmosphere Research Group founder Henry Harteveldt.\n\nNelson argued the tipping policy was designed to pass the cost [of labor] onto passengers. The Jan. 1 change represents only a small victory, she said, in that it will create better transparency to ensure flight attendants are receiving the tips passengers intended to give.\n\nThe AFA in 2011 negotiated its first contract with the airline after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization in 2008. The contract is currently amendable, and Frontier flight attendants voted in November to strike unless their demands are met.\n\nIt's a significant pay increase we are looking for, Nelson said. Frontier has gotten away all this time paying less than the market rate and they are really dragging at the bottom of the industry.\n\nSome analysts say the change in the tipping policy disadvantages both flight attendants and customers -- and only benefits the airline, the eighth-largest carrier in the U.S. with a reported $1.8 billion in revenue in 2017.\n\nI think it's a bad idea. I think it's also clearly a way for the company to reduce the amount of money it pays flight attendants. They're now at a point where they believe they should be able to pay the flight attendant less because they are making it up in tips, Harteveldt said.\n\nHe also worries about the competition the new model could create among colleagues. It could pit the flight attendants against one another in terms of serving customers, and I am concerned about this policy creating tensions between flight crew members -- tensions that could boil over to Frontier's customers, he said.\n\nSome Airlines ban tipping altogether, including Allegiant, whose policy states that flight attendants should decline tips if offered.\n\nNelson doesn't worry that the policy will catch on at other airlines.\n\nMost airlines understand that they don't want to set a tone in the cabin that flight attendants are there for service. They need to keep control -- they are in a safety environment, not a restaurant. First and foremost you need to get there safely and flight attendants need to be able to fill that role of authority in the cabin, she said.
DAVOS, Switzerland - Lawrence Summers, the former U.S. Treasury Secretary, has warned that Donald Trump's threats to firms using Mexico as a manufacturing base will be counterproductive and could lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\n\nSummers told a panel at the World Economic Forum that the president-elect's rhetoric and announced policies over Mexico have led to a big fall in the value of the Mexican peso against the dollar.\n\nThat, he said, is a dagger at Ohio, as it will make it even more attractive for firms to move to Mexico.\n\nThe lesson of history, he added, is that classic populism is invariably counterproductive for those in whose name it is offered as a policy regime.\n\nReporting for CBS News from Davos, Switzerland: Lulu Chiang, Lauren Hoenemeyer and Gilad Thaler
CROWN POINT, Ind. -- A Marine was turned away from his high school graduation ceremony in Indiana this week when he showed up in his dress blues instead of the standard cap and gown.\n\nThe Northwest Indiana Times reports Jacob Stanley graduated from Crown Point High School in December and joined the Marines. He completed boot camp last week and flew home for Tuesday's ceremony.\n\nSchool principal Chip Petit tells the newspaper tradition calls for all students to wear a cap and gown to graduation. He says individual students can recognize achievements such as military service by wearing stoles or chords over their gowns.\n\nHe says the policy isn't intended to be disrespectful to students entering the military.\n\nSome of Stanley's classmates told the newspaper that they were disappointed by the decision.\n\nStanley isn't the first Marine to make headlines over a clothing discrepancy at graduation.\n\nA Redlands High School prevented a student named Elias Valezquez from wearing a sash he earned for enlisting in the U.S. Army at graduation. CBS Los Angeles\n\nCBS Los Angeles reports a Redlands High School prevented a student named Elias Valezquez from wearing a sash he earned for enlisting in the U.S. Army at graduation.\n\nThe school's rules say students aren't allowed to wear any cords or sashes over their caps and gowns. It doesn't matter if it's from a school, club, college or branch of the military.
BEIJING -- Xi Jinping was reappointed Saturday as China's president with no limit on the number of terms he can serve. The National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp legislature, also appointed close Xi ally Wang Qishan to the formerly ceremonial post of vice president.\n\nAt the Great Hall of the People, Xi, Wang and other officials took turns stepping to the lectern to place their left hands on the constitution and raise their right fists as they delivered an oath swearing loyalty to the constitution, the motherland and the people.\n\nXi, 64, is considered the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong and last Sunday was given the right to continue in office indefinitely after the legislature scrapped term limits for the president and vice president.\n\nChinese officials defended the move saying it would bring the presidency in-line with Xi's other two main positons of head of the ruling Communist Party and commander of the armed forces.\n\nCritics say the move overturning a push to institutionalize China's ruling practices dating from 1982 will likely lead to increased political repression and possible infighting among party factions seeking to promote their own candidates within the closed system.\n\nXi took office as president in 2013 and hasn't said how many additional five-year terms he intends to serve. State media has said the removal of term limits will not alter conditions for retirement or create a president in perpetuity, but has offered no details.\n\nXi is expected to expand his yearslong campaign against corruption within the party to include all state employees through the creation of a new National Supervisory Commission, while continuing to pursue a muscular foreign policy and policies to upgrade the slowing economy.\n\nEconomic growth and social stability have allowed Xi to amend the constitution and carry out other moves that once seemed highly contentious, said Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese Studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London.\n\nReally no one is going to shout and moan too much because growth and stability are considered so important, Brown said Friday in a talk to foreign media in Beijing.
Washington — The Trump administration on Friday unveiled a new set of immigration restrictions on six African and Asian countries, expanding the so-called travel ban that has been denounced as discriminatory by critics to effectively halt the admission of immigrants from Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria.\n\nThe move adds Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan to the third version of President Trump's travel ban, a policy that elicited confusion and massive uproar during his first days in office when he banned most travelers and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations. The proclamation signed by the president on Friday also maintains the restrictions currently in place for Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea.\n\nUnder the new proclamation, people from Nigeria, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Eritrea will be ineligible for immigrant visas to move to the U.S., while citizens of Sudan and Tanzania will be prohibited from enrolling in the diversity visa lottery — a program that Mr. Trump and immigration hawks have long railed against. Residents of the six countries will still be eligible for short-term business and tourist visas.\n\nImmigrant visas petitioners from the new group of countries could be eligible for waivers and exemptions under the order, which is slated to take effect February 22, according to senior officials from the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the restrictions. About 12,000 people could be affected by the new stringent measures, the officials said on a call with reporters.\n\nFriday's expansion, the officials said, was the culmination of a comprehensive assessment by the department and is designed to ensure the designated countries improve information-sharing about criminal and terrorist activity, travel vetting procedures and other security safeguards. The six nations could have their restrictions lifted if they address these concerns, the officials added.\n\nIt is logical and essential to thoroughly screen and vet everyone seeking to travel or immigrate to the United States, acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement. However, there are some countries from whom the U.S. does not receive the necessary information about its travelers and, as a result, pose a national security or public safety risk that warrants tailored travel restrictions.\n\nDespite assurances by officials that the restrictions were solely grounded in national security concerns, Democrats said there was still a discriminatory intent underpinning the expansion. Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee said the administration could've included other countries that pose national security concerns in the ban, but that it chose to only add countries with populations of color.\n\nThere are bad actors in Russia. There are bad actors in China. None of those places have been put on any ban, Jackson Lee said during a call with reporters earlier Friday. It is pure discrimination and racism.\n\nOn the same call, fellow Democratic Congressman Joe Neguse of Colorado portrayed the new list of countries as a move by the administration to continue its efforts to severely restrict immigration without the consent of Congress.\n\nThe data speaks for itself. It is clear that this administration, and they have been unabashed about it, they are doing everything they can to restrict immigration, of all kinds, Neguse said, pointing to Nigeria, one of the countries on the new list.\n\nWith more than 210 million inhabitants, Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and the largest source of African immigration to the U.S. According to a 2016 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 400,000 people in the U.S. reported having Nigerian ancestry. In fiscal year 2019, about 6,700 Nigerians were granted immigrant visas to move to the U.S., according to State Department data compiled by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Mr. Trump in 2017 criticized Nigerian immigration, reportedly saying immigrants from there would not go back to their huts once in the U.S. The president has also reportedly referred to African nations as sh*thole countries. Like Sudan and Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria is also a Muslim-majority country.\n\nAlthough administration officials said Friday's measures will not affect refugee admissions, advocates denounced the inclusion of Myanmar, also known as Burma, to the list. Rohingya Muslims in the predominantly Buddhist country were targeted in a bloody government crackdown in 2017 that led to thousands of deaths and that United Nations officials considered a campaign of genocide. In a recent ruling ordering the government in Myanmar to protect its minority Rohingya population, the International Court of Justice said the group remained extremely vulnerable.\n\nIssued days after Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2017, the first travel ban restricted entry by most residents of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The White House's executive order targeting seven majority Muslim countries and temporarily shuttering the nation's refugee program led to widespread protests, with critics branding it the Muslim ban. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump advocated for a a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\n\nAfter the first order was held up in court, a second iteration of the ban, which removed Iraq from the list and added travel restrictions on Chad, Venezuela and North Korea, was unveiled in March 2017. That order was also struck down in court, with a federal judge saying it discriminated against Muslims.\n\nThe third and current version of the ban was issued in the fall of 2017 and ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the court's majority failed to consider the president's rhetoric towards Muslims.\n\nBy blindly accepting the Government's misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security, the Court redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying Korematsu and merely replaces one 'gravely wrong' decision with another, Sotomayor wrote, referring to the Court's ruling in 1944 which effectively allowed President Roosevelt to continue interning Japanese Americans.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has mounted legal challenges against the different versions of the travel ban, was quick to condemn Friday's expansion.\n\nThe ban should be ended, not expanded. President Trump is doubling down on his signature anti-Muslim policy — and using the ban as a way to put even more of his prejudices into practice by excluding more communities of color, Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement. Families, universities, and businesses in the United States are paying an ever-higher price for President Trump's ignorance and racism.
The booming business of legalized marijuana may be seeing a favorable shift from the Trump administration. Attorney General nominee William Barr's testimony this week signaled potential relief for business owners in states that have enacted various laws legalizing cannabis products.\n\nMarijuana remains illegal under federal law, and there's no consensus in Congress on a recent proposal to change that.\n\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Barr said he doesn't plan on using federal resources to go after companies if they are complying with state law. That would be a reversal from the approach taken by his predecessor, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who vowed to pursue federal violations more aggressively.\n\nAccording to Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), Barr's stance is a good sign for advocates but it remains to be seen if his actions will follow through on his pledge.\n\nIt's encouraging but we do need to remain vigilant to keep him to hold his word to the American people, Altieri told CBSN's Reena Ninan. His organization is a non-profit that supports responsible pro-marijuana policy.\n\nWhile 10 states and Washington, D.C. have legalized recreational adult use of marijuana, and more than 20 other states allow some medical uses, U.S. attorneys can still prosecute its possession and sale under federal law. Last year, Sessions reversed an Obama-era policy that encouraged federal prosecutors to take a hands-off approach in states where marijuana is legal. This put business owners back at higher risk of coming under federal scrutiny.\n\nWhile Barr's stance may seem like a departure from his previous get-tough approach to drug policy, he made it clear during his testimony that he doesn't support federal legalization.\n\nI think it's a mistake to back off on marijuana, said Barr. However, if we want a federal approach, if we want states to have their own laws, then let's get there and let's get there the right way. He said Department of Justice policy should align with congressional legislation.\n\nAltieri agrees that the federal government's official acknowledgment of state legislation should be in the hands of Congress, and he urged lawmakers to embrace what he sees as popular support for legal pot among Americans.\n\nThere's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube on this one. The American people want to end our failed prohibition and any attempts to really slow that down or stop it will be incredibly unpopular across all party lines and demographics, Altieri said.\n\nAltieri also argues that federal marijuana legalization would help address many of the issues that concern people about marijuana's potential risks.\n\nA recent book by by Alex Berenson, Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence, highlights some of those risks, including marijuana's links to mental illness, harder drug use, and violence. Berenson argues that legislation and public perception in the U.S. have sped ahead of the science, and that the growth has happened in the face of powerful new evidence that marijuana can be deeply harmful to mental health.\n\nWhen asked about Berenson's warnings, Altieri said legalization would give the government greater ability to address these concerns.\n\nThat is not a knock against legalization if you have concerns about it. Prohibition is defined by the absolute lack of control of marijuana. If you have concerns about its use, particularly with youth and other health concerns, the answer is to regulate it and have those controls — not to leave it in the hands of criminal elements completely unregulated in back alleys and street corners.
ATHENS, Greece — Greece and its creditors have reached a deal that will restart bailout loan payments and keep the country from facing default and reigniting a eurozone crisis this summer, officials said Tuesday.\n\nFollowing months of tough negotiations, the sides agreed that Greece should make another round of pension cuts in 2019 and commit to maintain a high budget target once the current bailout program ends next year.\n\nPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras' left-wing government is set to approve the new cuts in parliament by mid-May, so that finance ministers from the nations using the euro can unfreeze more bailout funds at a scheduled meeting on May 22.\n\nTsipras' governing coalition has a majority in parliament of just three seats.\n\nGreece has been surviving on bailout loans since 2010 in return for harsh spending cuts and tax increases that have put nearly a quarter of the workforce out of work and seen more than a third of the population living in poverty or at risk of poverty.\n\nWe have said many times ... that this is a painful compromise, Interior Minister Panos Skourletis told state-run ERT television.\n\nTsipras' governing Syriza party is trailing badly behind rival conservatives in the polls, and he has insisted it will not seek elections until his term ends in 2019.\n\nThe agreement with creditors was reached after a nightlong session of talks at a hotel in Athens. Government officials said lenders dropped their demands to abolish a long list of employment rights and also agreed to the expansion of benefit schemes for jobless and low-income families.\n\nHours before the deal, protesters had gathered at the entrance of the hotel during large May Day rallies in the capital, but riot police blocked them from entering the building.\n\nThe European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European financial institutions welcomed the agreement and noted that the Greek authorities have confirmed their intention to swiftly implement this policy package.\n\nThey said in a statement that the deal will now be complemented by further discussions in the coming weeks on a credible strategy for ensuring that Greece's debt is sustainable.\n\nEU Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said it is time to turn the page on this long and difficult austerity chapter for the Greek people. With this agreement, we need now to write a new story of stability, jobs and growth for Greece and for the euro area as a whole.\n\nTsipras' government, which rose to power on an anti-bailout platform, had initially aimed at finalizing the current round of negotiations with creditors last December.\n\nThe delay has threatened hopes to return to economic growth after years of recession and stagnation fueled by austerity measures and a reversal of chronic overspending by the state.\n\nGreece faces a spike in bailout loan repayments in July, and needed to unlock the additional funds to avoid the threat of bankruptcy.
Facebook may be handed the biggest fine ever imposed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations involving the personal information of its 2.2 billion users.\n\nThe FTC is considering hitting Facebook with a penalty that would top its previous record fine of $22.5 million , which it dealt to Google in 2012 for bypassing the privacy controls in Apple's Safari browser, according to The Washington Post. The story published Friday cited three unidentified people familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn an automated response, the FTC said it was unable to comment, citing its closure due to the U.S. government shutdown. Facebook declined to comment.\n\nThe potential fine stems from an FTC investigation opened after revelations that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica had vacuumed up details about as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. While Facebook sells ads based on the information consumers share with it, many consumers were unaware their data had been provided to Cambridge Analytica through a policy that allowed app developers to gain access to their friends' data.\n\nSettlement breakdown?\n\nThe FTC has been exploring whether that massive breakdown violated a settlement that Facebook reached in 2011 after government regulators had concluded the Menlo Park, California, company had repeatedly broken its privacy promises .\n\nThe FTC decree, which runs through 2031, requires Facebook to get its users' consent to share their personal information in ways that aren't allowed by their privacy settings.\n\nSince the Cambridge Analytica erupted 10 months ago, Facebook has vowed to do a better job corralling its users' data. Nevertheless, its controls have remained leaky. Just last month, the company acknowledged a software flaw had exposed the photos of about 7 million users to a wider audience than they had intended.\n\nThe FTC's five commissioners have discussed fining Facebook but haven't settled on the amount yet, according to the Post.\n\nFacebook's privacy problems are also under investigation in other countries and the target of a lawsuit filed last month by Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine.
The bodies of two Florida teenagers were misidentified after they were killed in a car crash near Pensacola last July. The mistake wasn't caught until just before a wake, and not until after organs had been taken from the wrong body.\n\nNow the families of 15-year-old Samara Cooks and 18-year-old Deleigha Gibson are suing Florida Highway Patrol, the county medical examiner's office and two funeral homes.\n\nI'm not at peace. I'm not at peace. I feel like I haven't had a chance to mourn, said Ranada Cooks, Samara's mother.\n\nRanada had asked the funeral home to see her daughter before her wake.\n\nThat's when I noticed that it was not Samara and it was a mix-up, she told CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez in an exclusive interview. I was thinking, 'Well maybe there's a chance that she's still alive.'\n\nIt gave her a little hope, she said, until the mix-up was discovered.\n\nDeleigha's parents, Tammy and Demetrius Gibson, claim the director at another funeral home tried to switch the bodies back without their knowing.\n\nTracy was like, 'I need to talk to y'all,' and then she called us into the office and told us that the bodies were switched, Tammy said.\n\nDemetrius said hearing that was just heart-dropping.\n\nAccording to John Givens, an attorney with The Cochran Firm, the families' lawsuits allege that Florida Highway Patrol officers incorrectly tagged the victims at the crash site, Escambia County's former medical examiner did not enforce appropriate policies and procedures and the medical examiner's office extracted several organs from the body of Samara Cooks, who was not an organ donor.\n\nBoth families also claim the county medical examiner told them it was against policy to view the bodies.\n\nI don't sleep. I think about what happened or I try to put the puzzles together, Ranada Cooks said.\n\nTammy and Demetrius Gibson said they don't have any closure.\n\nAnd didn't get the joy of laying her to rest the way we really wanted to, Demetrius said.\n\nIn a statement to CBS news, the Florida Highway Patrol said in part, Due to the nature of this crash involving multiple ejections, positive identifications at the scene were not made.\n\nNow, the parents say they won't stop pushing for more answers.\n\nI don't want this to ever happen to any other parents. No one should go through this, Ranada Cooks said.\n\nThe Florida Highway Patrol said a further review of the case is ongoing to verify additional information. The medical examiner's office told CBS News, Our sympathies and support remain with the families. The funeral homes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
TOKYO - European shares rose Friday, shrugging off a bad day in Asia, as the sell-off in banking shares abated and oil prices rebounded from a 12-year low. But Japan's main stock index lost nearly 5 percent, leading other Asian markets lower.\n\nIn early trading, Germany's DAX was up 1.3 percent at 8,863.25 and Britain's FTSE 100 leapt 1.3 percent to 5,611.99. France's CAC 40 advanced 1.3 percent to 3,948.44. Wall Street was set to snap its losing streak. Dow futures rose 0.8 percent to 15,737.00 and S&P 500 futures added 1 percent to 1,842.20.\n\nShares in Germany's Commerzbank AG jumped 11 percent after it reported strong gains in fourth quarter net profit and forecast further gains for this year. Deutsche Bank AG's shares rose 3.8 percent and Credit Suisse Group AG jumped 5 percent.\n\nNews that Germany's economy expanded at a 0.3 percent pace last quarter, as earlier estimated, further underpinned buying.\n\nIt was a sharp turnaround from trading in Asia, where Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 4.8 percent to 14,952.61 after earlier sinking as much as 5.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2 percent to 18,319.58. Markets in China and Taiwan have been closed all week for Lunar New Year holidays and will reopen on Monday.\n\nJapan's finance minister, Taro Aso, and other senior leaders said Friday they hoped for a united response from major economies to the market volatility. Finance ministers of the Group of 20 nations that account for most of the world economy are due to meet in Shanghai later this month.\n\nA surprise decision by the Bank of Japan late last month to introduce a negative interest rate for some deposits it holds for banks has so far not helped to stabilize markets.\n\nGlobal central bank policy is increasingly becoming a symptom of what's wrong with the financial markets and real growth than a cure for economic ills, said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG in Singapore. We may not have seen the worst yet. The performance of Chinese equities when they return next week will be key to whether the global stock rout would go on or not, he said in a market report.\n\nGlobal stocks have been in a slump since the beginning of the year when China's market, which had been propped up by government buying, plunged dramatically. Concerns about China, however, are now just one of several factors behind the slide.\n\nInvestors recognize that prices rose too high during several years of artificial support from the ultra-easy monetary policies of central banks that were trying to foster economic recovery following the 2009 global recession. A crunch moment has arrived as global economic growth wanes again and the Federal Reserve signals it is still committed to raising U.S. interest rates from record lows.\n\nAmong other Asian markets, South Korea's Kospi gave up 1.4 percent to 1,835.28 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.2 percent to 4,765.30. Shares in New Zealand and Southeast Asia also fell.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude was up $1.27 to $27.48 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract tumbled to $26.21 in New York on Thursday, its lowest level since May 2003, as investors fled to the traditional havens of bonds and precious metals.\n\nBrent crude, a benchmark for international oils, gained $1.46 to $31.52 a barrel in London. It dropped 78 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $30.06 on Thursday.\n\nThe dollar rose to 112.52 yen on Friday from 112.29 the previous day, while the euro fell to $1.1269 from $1.1315.
Neil Young has become the latest musician to strike gold with his song catalogue, selling a 50% stake in his music to a British investment company in a deal announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe Hipgnosis Songs Fund said it had acquired half of the copyright and income interests in some 1,180 songs written by the 75-year-old rock star, composer of Heart of Gold, Rockin' in the Free World and Cinnamon Girl.\n\nTerms were not disclosed.\n\nThe deal comes a month after Bob Dylan sold publishing rights to more than 600 songs to the Universal Music Publishing Group for a reported fortune of between $300 million and a half billion dollars. Stevie Nicks sold an 80 percent stake in her music to Primary Wave for a reported $100 million.\n\nMerck Mercuriadis, founder of Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited, said that he bought his first Neil Young album when he was seven years old.\n\n'Harvest' was my companion and I know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately, he said. Neil Young, or at least his music, has been my friend . . . ever since.\n\nThe businessman also said Young's late manager, Elliot Roberts, was equally an idol to him.\n\nIn an industry where music sales have dwindled and the concert industry is on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, song publishing is seen as an increasingly valuable asset. The companies generally push for use of an artist's songs in movies, video games and advertising.\n\nThe latter use has been a sticking point for Young, whose 1988 song This Note's For You sharply criticized artists who leased their music for advertising campaigns. The accompanying video parodied ads that featured Michael Jackson and Eric Clapton.\n\nAin't singin' for Pepsi\n\nIn the song, Young sang: Ain't singin' for Pepsi, ain't singin' for Coke. I don't sing for nobody. Makes me look like a joke.\n\nIn the years since, it has become much more common for musicians to earn income through advertising campaigns. But at least through 2016, Young continued to resist having his music used this way, according to Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nIt was unclear whether the Hipgnosis deal augers a change in that policy.\n\nIn Wednesday's announcement, Mercuriadis said that his company and Young have a common integrity, ethos and passion born out of a belief in music and these important songs. There will never be a 'Burger of Gold' but we will work together to make sure everyone gets to hear them on Neil's terms.\n\nYoung has released some 70 albums as a solo artist and with bands like Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic — which is believed to have first spread to humans at a wet market in Wuhan, China, where live animals were sold for food — China has created new guidelines on which animals can be bred for eating. In one significant change, the rules reclassify dogs as pets rather than livestock.\n\nThe move signals an official turn against dog meat consumption, and animal welfare activists hope it will lead to an outright ban of the practice.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said Wednesday that dogs would no longer be considered livestock, meaning they cannot be bred for food, milk, fur, fiber, medicine, or for military or sports purposes.\n\nIn a memo explaining its choices, the ministry listed the progress of human civilization and the public's concern for animal welfare as reasons for reclassifying dogs as companion animals from traditional domestic animals. It also said that dogs are not considered livestock elsewhere around the world, and China now aims to follow those global standards.\n\nThe draft, which details which animals are allowed to be bred for meat, medical and other uses, lists 18 traditional livestock species, such as cattle, sheep, horses and chickens and 13 special species such as reindeer, alpacas, ostriches and foxes. The ministry is now seeking public comments on the guidelines by May 8, before they are finalized.\n\nResearchers believe the novel coronavirus originated in bats and then passed through another species to humans at a wet market in Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected in December. Since then, COVID-19 has infected more than 1.6 million people worldwide and caused over 100,000 deaths.\n\nIn January, China temporarily banned the breeding and trading of wild animals during the pandemic, but it will soon resume the practice under the revised guidelines.\n\nWhile dog meat remains a delicacy in some regions, it has become increasingly less popular. Last month, the city of Shenzhen became the first in the country to ban its consumption.\n\nHealth officials suspect COVID-19 originated from animals in Chinese wet markets, where exotic live animals, from marmots to muntjacs, are sold. Around the world, they remain open -- a grave concern to infectious disease experts. Here's @RamyInocencio https://t.co/GVMrSTQtMA pic.twitter.com/RYo9n8tpBq — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) April 9, 2020\n\nHumane Society International (HSI) called the new guidelines a potential game-changer moment for other cities in China to follow Shenzhen's lead and outright ban the consumption of cats and dogs.\n\nThis is the first time we've ever seen China's national government explain that dogs are companion animals, Dr. Peter Li, China policy specialist at HSI, said in a press release. Recognizing that dogs hold a special bond with humans is an essential first step towards eliminating the consumption and trade in dog meat. This could be a pivotal moment that provides encouragement for other cities across the country to follow Shenzhen's lead to ban the eating of dogs and cats.\n\nAccording to HSI, around 30 million dogs are killed each year for meat in Asia, despite warnings from the World Health Organization that their trade spreads rabies and other health risks.\n\nTens of millions of dogs and cats every year, mostly stolen pets, suffer for the meat trade which is almost entirely fueled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera, Li said.\n\nWhile HSI applauded the move, it remains concerned about the other animals on the list, both in terms of welfare and disease prevention.\n\nRebranding wildlife as livestock doesn't alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in commercial captive breeding environments, and that their welfare needs simply can't be met, said Dr. Teresa Telecky, vice president of wildlife at HSI. In addition, there's clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as COVID-19, which is why we're urging governments around the world to stop trading in wildlife.
For many, the New Year is a time to get back on track with health goals, making it a period ripe for marketers to tout unfounded claims about the benefits of detox diets.\n\nMethods that promise to rid your body of toxins can include anything from an all juice or liquid diet to pumping your body with multiple herbal supplements and even taking laxatives.\n\nBut in a new paper published online in the journal BMJ Case Reports, doctors warn that not only do such detox diets not have scientific evidence behind them, they can also be life threatening.\n\nThe report describes the case of a previously fit 47-year-old woman who was hospitalized after following a New Year's detox last year that involved drinking lots of fluids and taking various herbal remedies. She was admitted after a brief period of confusion and repetitive behavior such as grinding her teeth. She then collapsed and suffered a seizure.\n\nAccording to the woman's family, she had been drinking more water and tea in the previous few days, but they did not think it was excessive. However, she had also been taking herbal remedies, including milk thistle, molkosan, l-theanine, glutamine, vitamin B compound, vervain, sage tea, green tea and valerian root.\n\nThe doctors concluded that her initial confusion and seizures were caused by a condition called hyponatraemia, which occurs when the level of sodium in the body is abnormally low, typically brought on by drinking too much fluids. However, they were unsure what exactly caused the condition in this patient's case.\n\nAfter researching the herbal remedies that the woman used, the doctors came across another case of a man who had suffered from seizures due to severe hyponatraemia after consuming large amounts of herbal remedies that contained valerian root, along with lemon balm, passion flower, hops and chamomile.\n\nIn the report, they explain that both patients didn't seem to drink enough excess fluid to bring on hyponatraemia (typically more than 10 liters per day for someone with healthy kidneys). But they hypothesize that the valerian root may have played a role, potentially altering the body's threshold and allowing for hyponatraemia to occur at an earlier stage.\n\nHowever, they caution that more scientific evidence is needed in order to draw definitive conclusions that valerian root was to blame.\n\nStill, they say the two cases highlight the fact that despite marketing suggesting otherwise, all-natural products are not without side effects.\n\nDr. Nieca Goldberg, cardiologist and director of the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU Langone Medical Center, notes that while detoxing can be a necessary process for people addicted to drugs and alcohol, the average person does not need to take extreme steps to cleanse so-called toxins out of their system. In fact, the body detoxes naturally.\n\nThat's the function of your kidneys, Goldberg told CBS News.\n\nThe author of the case report, Dr. Oliver Toovey of the Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the U.K., also said that he would not recommend such a detox regimen to patients.\n\nThe liver plays an important role in breaking down toxins in the body and getting rid of them, he told CBS News. There is no way to artificially enhance this, nor should anyone need to.\n\nToovey also points out that the notion of drinking excess water as a way to purify and cleanse the body can be dangerous.\n\nThe best policy is to rely on your body's own senses, he said. If you're thirsty, drink, and if you're not, don't. And bear in mind though that some of your fluid requirement will be in your food so you don't need to drink all of that amount in glasses of water.\n\nGoldberg recommends that if you're interested in achieving better health, stick to old-fashioned methods like a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe best way you can keep your body toxin free is living a healthy lifestyle and getting your nutrients from food, she said.\n\nAs for the woman in the case study, doctors said she was released from the hospital after treatment and did not appear to suffer lasting neurological damage.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a marijuana enforcement memo Thursday rescinding the Obama administration's guidance, which enabled states to legalize marijuana without federal intervention. His one-page memo makes it clear that marijuana possession and distribution is against federal law, and it will direct U.S. attorneys to approach these cases as they do all other cases when enforcing them.\n\nThe move now injects uncertainty into the growing industry in the regions of the country that have legalized the drug, CBS News' Jeff Pegues points out. Many are likely to be confused about whether it's okay to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where it's legal, since long-standing federal law prohibits it.\n\nSo far eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized the drug for recreational use, and it is now helping to fund schools and even law enforcement. California just began selling recreational marijuana in recent days. The new guidance threatens to upend sales by giving federal prosecutors more discretion in how they enforce federal law. According to a senior DOJ official, This is the return of the rule of law, Pegues reports.\n\nSessions told reporters Thursday that the Obama guidance in the Cole memo -- written by then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole -- wasn't consistent with federal law.\n\nIt was interpreted as a safe harbor for individuals, Sessions said. This memo does not have safe harbors in it.\n\nHe said that U.S. attorneys should understand that the attorney general believes marijuana is against federal law, and should there be prosecutions that need to be brought in order to enforce that law, then they should bring those cases.\n\nToday, 29 states have adopted medical marijuana laws. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, and since then, five more states have passed recreational marijuana laws, including Massachusetts, where retail sales are scheduled to begin in July.\n\nStates that have already legalized marijuana are likely to protest Sessions' directive. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner said before Sessions' announcement that the attorney general is going back on what he'd told Gardner earlier.\n\nHe tweeted that this contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation. With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states.\n\nThis reported action directly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation. With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states. — Cory Gardner (@SenCoryGardner) January 4, 2018\n\nAnd he's also threatening retribution. I am prepared to take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation, he tweeted, along with a reminder that @realDonaldTrump had it right. This must be left up to the states.\n\nBut any private assurances Sessions may have given Gardner before his confirmation hearing were not necessarily evident in that testimony. He told senators who asked him about this very issue that one obvious concern is that the United States Congress has made the possession of marijuana in every state and distribution of it, an illegal act.\n\nHe went on to suggest that it fell to Congress to change the classification of marijuana as an illegal drug if it didn't want DOJ to enforce the law against it.\n\nIt's not so much the attorney general's job to decide what laws to enforce, Sessions said. We should do our job and enforce laws effectively as we're able.\n\nSessions' action is a departure from the Obama administration's policy, which issued guidance in 2013 that it would not interfere in state and local initiatives to legalize marijuana, as long as they didn't interfere with federal law enforcement priorities.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone just after he left office, Obama explained the dilemma for the Justice Department in prosecuting the federal ban on pot, which is considered a Schedule 1 drug, one which the FDA says has no medical use and has a high potential for abuse.\n\n[I]t is untenable over the long term for the Justice Department or the DEA to be enforcing a patchwork of laws, where something that's legal in one state could get you a 20-year prison sentence in another, Obama told Rolling Stone. There's something to this whole states-being-laboratories-of-democracy and an evolutionary approach. You now have about a fifth of the country where this is legal.\n\nSessions, however, compares marijuana to heroin and blames it for spikes in violence.\n\nCBS News' Julia Kimani Burnham and Alan He contributed to this report.
FRANKFURT, Germany - European stocks fell Monday amid ongoing jitters over the Chinese economy following weak manufacturing data. Japanese stocks, however, extended gains following the Bank of Japan's decision last week to introduce a negative interest rate policy to boost lending and spur growth.\n\nEurope got off to a weak start with Britain's FTSE 100 down 0.4 percent to 6,059.68. France's CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent to 4,392.95 and Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent to 9,746.29. Futures augured a lackluster start for Wall Street: Both Dow and broader S&P 500 futures fell 0.6 percent.\n\nAn index based on a survey of factory purchasing managers fell to 49.4 in January, its lowest in more than three years, in the latest sign of weakness for the world's No. 2 economy. January's reading was down from December's 49.7; numbers below 50 indicate contraction.\n\nThere are precious few indicators that point to a recovery within China and this continues to spell bad news for the global economy which has been hugely reliant upon Chinese demand to help compensate for weak western demand post-2007, said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG.\n\nThe U.S. economy will also be in focus this week. A busy calendar kicks off later with the monthly manufacturing report from the Institute for Supply Management. The week ends Friday with the January nonfarm payrolls report, which could go a long way to determining whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again in March.\n\nJapan has also been in focus after the country's central bank introduced a negative interest rate policy on Friday. Analysts say that move may impact on other central banks around the world by making them to current stimulus measures or be more cautious about tightening policy.\n\nThe Bank of Japan's move sets a more dovish tone for major central banks around the world, said Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. At the margin, he said it will increase the incentive for the European Central Bank to do more at its March meeting as it seeks to keep currency relatively weak. And the Fed and the Bank England may be a little more cautious about lifting rates, Spooner said.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 rose 2 percent to 17,865.23 and South Korea's Kospi added 0.7 percent to 1,924.82. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.5 percent to 19,595.50 and the Shanghai Composite in mainland China lost 1.8 percent to 2,688.85. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.8 percent to 5,043.60.\n\nBenchmark U.S. oil was down 41 cents to $33.21 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It finished Friday at $33.62 a barrel, up 40 cents, or 1.2 percent. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, fell 6 cents to $35.93 a barrel in London.\n\nThe dollar rose to 121.31 yen from 121.12 yen on Friday. The euro strengthened to $1.0867 from $1.0831.
Shortly after taking office this week, President-elect Joe Biden plans to begin gradually making it easier to seek asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border, impose a deportation moratorium and extend protections for so-called Dreamers using his executive authority, people briefed on the plans told CBS News.\n\nHe also plans to propose a broad immigration bill that, if passed by Congress, could legalize millions of immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission.\n\nBut in an early sign that the incoming president could struggle to fulfill some of his bolder campaign promises, Mr. Biden is asking immigration reform advocates for patience, cautioning that his administration and Congress may not be able to pass a large-scale immigration revamp in the first 100 days of his presidency, according to three participants in a meeting the Biden team held with Latino leaders last week.\n\nMr. Biden and his team cited the ongoing pandemic, the economic downturn and the upcoming Senate impeachment trial as reasons for a likely delay. Participants in the meeting, all veterans of past fights for changes in immigration policy, said the warning is understandable, and they praised the ambitious legislative proposal.\n\nDomingo Garcia, who attended the meeting on behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said Biden's proposal plan would be transformative for millions of new Americans. Hector Sanchez, executive director of Mi Familia Vota, said the plan is the most progressive I've seen from any president.\n\nBut Ramiro Cavazos, the president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said he and other participants stressed to Mr. Biden's team that they still expect action on immigration, despite the other challenges.\n\nWe made it very clear, all of us collectively, that because it's a new administration and the Senate and the House will be under the control of the same party, that they need to tackle immigration, Cavazos told CBS News. We missed that opportunity under President Obama and clearly, over the last four years, Latinos have been under attack.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and his nominee for secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, in Wilmington, Delaware, on November 24, 2020. The Washington Post\n\nDuring that meeting, Mr. Biden and his advisers reiterated his pledge to immediately introduce a bill that would allow the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to become lawful permanent residents and eventually U.S. citizens. Immigrants hoping to benefit from the proposal, which would be the first major legalization law since 1986, would need to pay fees to apply.\n\nAdvocates were also assured during the meeting that the incoming administration would quickly start reversing the flurry of executive actions on immigration taken by President Trump. They were told Mr. Biden will halt wall construction along the southern border, implement a 100-day freeze on deportations from the interior and bolster the government's capacity to review cases of migrants seeking asylum, which the Trump administration has severely restricted.\n\nMr. Biden's team said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program — which Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to end — would be extended for four years, safeguarding the work permits and protections from deportation of more than 640,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nIn a memo on Saturday, incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Mr. Biden will also issue executive orders during his first days in office to help advocacy groups locate and reunite migrant families separated during the zero tolerance border crackdown and to rescind Mr. Trump's travel and immigration restrictions on 13 countries, most of which are majority Muslim or African.\n\nAccording to Garcia and Cavazos, Mr. Biden and his team did not discuss any border security and immigration enforcement components to the legalization plan, items that have been historically seen as essential to garnering Republican support for an immigration reform bill. The text of the bill has yet to be disclosed and Mr. Biden's transition team did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Biden distanced himself from the Obama administration's high rate of deportations in the closing weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign. In his final debate with Mr. Trump, he conceded that not prioritizing immigration reform during the Obama years was a mistake.\n\nIt took too long to get it right, Mr. Biden said at the October 23 debate.\n\nDuring a rally in July 2019, immigration activists reminded the campaign of then presidential hopeful Joe Biden of the more than 3 million deportations that were carried out during the Obama administration. NurPhoto\n\nThat night, the former vice president also made his pledge to work with Congress on immigration reform in his first 100 days. How that might happen is still up for debate.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Congressman Raul Ruiz said he and his team have been in touch with Mr. Biden's legislative team to sort out how immigration bills could be passed in a closely divided Congress. One option, he said, is to try to pass smaller bills on specific immigration issues that were passed by the Democratic-led House in 2019. These include plans that would legalize hundreds of thousands of farm workers, place DACA recipients on a pathway to U.S. citizenship and grant Temporary Protected Status to some Venezuelans in the United States.\n\nThey are low-hanging fruit in the sense that they already passed, so we know that they have broad support in the Democratic caucus. And they provide the basis and the building blocks of a larger, comprehensive immigration bill on Day One, Ruiz, recently elected as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told CBS News.\n\nAnother potential standalone bill being crafted by Texas Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro would allow a broad group of immigrant workers deemed essential during the pandemic — from health care personnel, to food service and hotel staff — to apply for green cards and obtain deportation relief while their cases are adjudicated, according to an outline reviewed by CBS News.\n\nRepresentative Lou Correa, a moderate from California, said he worries immigration reform may not be prioritized due to the pandemic and other issues. He agreed that Mr. Biden should prioritize the response to the coronavirus crisis, but said immigration should take precedence over other issues like changes to the health care system.\n\nOtherwise, Correa said, the chance to pass immigration reform could fade away like it did during Mr. Obama's first term, when he dealt with the Great Recession and prioritized the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Like in Mr. Obama's honeymoon period, Democrats will now control the Senate and the House, but with slimmer majorities.\n\nPresident Obama made some promises that he didn't keep, Correa told CBS News, referring to Mr. Obama's pledge to introduce an immigration reform bill during his first year in office.\n\nAnd we can all look at the excuses of why Obama wasn't able to deliver — and they're all good, Correa added. But politically the reality is this: you as a president have only so much political capital and you can only do so much heavy lifting before you can't anymore.\n\nSanchez, whose group registered and mobilized thousands of Latino voters in swing states including Arizona and Georgia — voters that helped Democrats narrowly win the White House and other key Senate races — said his group intends to continue pressuring Mr. Biden and congressional Democrats to act quickly, especially with so many Latino workers reeling from the health risks of the pandemic or struggling to stay employed.\n\nWe'll keep putting on pressure, Sanchez told CBS News. There will always be in their eyes another priority and not immigration. But no excuses this time.\n\nBo Erickson contributed reporting.
Social media companies may have been dreading the fireworks marking the start of the new year. On Jan. 1, Germany began enforcing strict rules that could fine companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube up to 50 million euros ($60 million) if they don't remove posts containing hate speech within 24 hours of receiving a complaint.\n\nThe new hate speech rules, passed last June, require companies to maintain an effective and transparent procedure for dealing with complaints that users can access readily at anytime. Upon receiving a complaint, social media companies have to remove or block obviously illegal content within 24 hours, although they have up to a week when dealing with complex cases.\n\nSocial media companies haven't been viewed too favorably in many countries due to the massive volume of hate content on their platforms. To fight that, Facebook in June said it removes 66,000 posts every week, saying it wants to do better but admitting the task is not easy. Last month, Twitter escalated its fight against hate, enforcing an updated policy that bans users from promoting violence and hate in their usernames and bios, and threatening to remove accounts if users tweeted hate speech, symbols and images.\n\nGerman isn't the only country that wants social media companies to do more about hate speech. While the European Union acknowledged Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft for being better at the job, it said it managed to block twice the volume of hate content at a faster rate than those companies did in the beginning of the year.\n\nWe're committed to being part of the solution to illegal hate speech and extremist content online -- around the world, and in Germany, working within its new legal framework, a YouTube spokesperson told CNET in an emailed statement. We'll continue to invest heavily in teams and technology to allow us to go further and faster in removing content that breaks our rules or German law, and by working with government, law enforcement, civil society groups and other companies.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNET, titled: Germany kicks year off with strict online hate speech law.
The group that manages the Michigan State Capitol Building banned the open carry of firearms inside of the building on Monday. Michigan was one of just a handful of states that allowed people to openly carry guns in the state Capitol.\n\nIn a unanimous vote, the Michigan Capitol Commission passed a motion that bans openly carrying weapons in the building, except for law enforcement officers, and still allows open carry on the grounds surrounding the Capitol. People who have a concealed pistol license can carry concealed weapons in the building.\n\nSome of Michigan's top Democrats are calling for further action, but commissioners said the open carry ban was as far as they could go.\n\nWe determined that the extreme limit of our real authority to actually implement something was to implement a ban on open carry, Commissioner William Kandler said. We have no authority to implement the infrastructure to go beyond that at this point. We have no budget to do it. We're not experts in security.\n\nA militia group with no political affiliation from Michigan stands in front of the Governors office after protesters occupied the state capitol building during a vote to approve the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's emergency declaration/stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus outbreak, at the state capitol in Lansing, Michigan, on April 30, 2020. SETH HERALD / REUTERS\n\nThe commission had been studying the issue for several months. The policy change came several days after pro-Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. John Trustcott, vice-chair of the Michigan Capitol Commission, said commissioners were going to address the issue later this month, but moved it up because of what happened in Washington last week. Truscott added that Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey throwing his support behind an open carry ban last week helped the commission decide to take up the issue.\n\nThe Majority Leader respects the decision by the Capitol Commission and supports the ban on open carry inside the Capitol, said Amber McCann, a spokeswoman for Shirkey.\n\nMichigan's rules about guns in the Capitol drew national attention in April when armed protesters were in the Senate gallery while the Legislature was considering whether to extend Michigan's COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nAccording to the Michigan Advance, nine other states allow both open and concealed carry of weapons in their state capitol buildings. Michigan was one of only three states that lack related security measures of any kind, such as metal detectors.\n\nNine additional states have some restrictions on weapons, most of which only allow concealed carry. Thirty-one states prohibit firearms in their state capitol buildings.\n\nDespite the open carry ban, some Michigan Democrats said the ruling does not go far enough and called for prohibiting all firearms in the Capitol. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the open carry ban is a good start, but more action is needed.\n\nOn a normal day, hundreds of people walk through the Capitol, including groups of fourth graders, teachers, and parents on school field trips to learn about state government. That's why we must take action to ban all weapons at the Capitol to keep Michiganders safe, Whitmer said in a statement.\n\nMichigan's Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel wrote a legal opinion in May 2020 saying he commission could ban guns at the state Capitol. In a statement on Monday, Nessel urged commissioners or the Michigan Legislature to take further action.\n\nFirearms – whether explicitly visible or concealed by clothing — possess the same capability to inflict injury and harm on others and only banning open carry does little to meaningfully improve the safety and security of our Capitol, Nessel said.\n\nWhile Shirkey supports the open carry ban, Michigan's incoming House Speaker, Jason Wentworth, said in a statement that the Capitol Commission does not have the authority to set policy in the Capitol and will look to address that moving forward. Wentworth acknowledged that the Michigan State Police will be enforcing the rule and urged people to respect the Michigan State Police and the rules they enforce.\n\nSeveral incidents over the past year, including armed protests over the COVID-19 restrictions and the 2020 election, have raised questions about security among some Michigan lawmakers. CBS News has confirmed that the FBI sent out an alert to law enforcement across the country warning that groups are calling for the storming of government buildings in all 50 states if President Trump is removed from office prior to Inauguration Day.\n\nIn addition to the armed protesters at the Michigan Senate in the spring, federal and state law enforcement officials announced in October that they foiled a plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer and to attack the state Capitol and kidnap other government officials.\n\nThe Michigan Capitol was closed for a few hours on January 7, the day after the assault on the U.S. Capitol, due to a bomb threat. A suspect was charged Friday with calling in the threat. He also made threats against a Michigan Democratic state lawmaker in December, according to a complaint released by the Michigan Attorney General's office.\n\nState Senator Dayna Polehanki posted the picture last April of armed men in the Senate gallery. She recently tweeted a photo of a helmet, gas mask and pepper spray that she plans to keep under her desk.\n\nCommissioners said they don't have the authority to enact more strict firearm bans, but Polehanki disagreed and said they should have gone further.\n\nWhat they're saying is guns are still welcome, we just don't want to see them, Polehanki said. It sends a false message that you're safe here.
An outraged mother gained widespread attention with a video she posted to Facebook showing her 13-year-old son getting a thorough pat-down by a Transportation Security Administration officer at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Jennifer Williamson accused the TSA of treating her family like dogs, and noted that her son has sensory processing disorder (SPD).\n\nThe video shows a TSA officer methodically patting down her son from head to toe for about two minutes.\n\nWe were treated with utter disrespect as if we were criminals, Williamson said in an interview with CBS This Morning.\n\nJennifer Williamson posted a video to Facebook on Sunday showing a TSA agent patting down her 13-year-old son. Jennifer Williamson\n\nShe called the pat-down her son was given excessive. They went over his sensitive areas, a little more than necessary, especially given that he wasn't wearing bulky clothing or anything like that, Williamson said.\n\nHer son's condition made the ordeal even more upsetting. My son has sensory processing disorder so the touch can be very difficult for him to handle, Williamson said.\n\nSPD is a neurological condition in which the brain has trouble receiving information from the senses. Symptoms can range in severity from mild to incapacitating, and they differ from person to person, but often involve hypersensitivity to sound, sight, and touch.\n\nElysa Marco, M.D., a pediatric cognitive and behavioral neurologist and director of the Sensory, Neurodevelopment & Autism Program (SNAP) at the University of California San Francisco, said some of her patients liken the feeling of a light touch to that of a profoundly itchy sweater times 100.\n\nEverybody's going to feel uncomfortable when you scrape your nails down a chalkboard or when you wear that itchy wool sweater, Marco told CBS News. Everyone can understand that, but it's important to realize that some people have a better ability to modulate their response to stimuli and for our patients the threshold is very low.\n\nConversely, some people with SPD may under-respond to sensations and show little to no reactions even to extreme pain, heat, or cold.\n\nA study done in 2004 estimates that at least 1 in 20 children are affected by SPD. While the condition is more commonly reported in kids, Marco says adults can have it, too.\n\nSPD is not an official medical diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), an authoritative guidebook for doctors, but is part of the criteria for autism and is currently under study to be considered for inclusion in the next update.\n\nMarco says the condition is more common in children who were born prematurely, those with fetal alcohol syndrome, and kids with certain genetic conditions.\n\nTreatments include occupational therapy that can help patients tolerate different sensations. Certain medications may also help.\n\nIn Williamson's case, the TSA said it was complying with new policy procedures, which took effect on March 2. The Facebook video shows the officer explaining the process first, then conducting the pat-down in which the officer used the backs of his hands when touching sensitive areas of the body, as the agency requires.\n\nWilliamson said the whole ordeal began when agents found a laptop in her son's book bag as it went through the scanning machine.\n\nShe says she worries that her son will now have anxiety around traveling, something she says the family does quite often. She said she and her son have had open conversations about the event since it took place, but that if it continues to pose problems, she will seek professional help to help him cope.\n\nWhile the experience was troubling for the family, perhaps there may be a silver lining in that the video she posted is bringing some awareness to SPD.\n\nWe need to make sure that there is a growing public awareness that there are people — adults and kids — who are particularly sensitive to different types of information from the environment and that giving these individuals the help that they need is important and appropriate, Marco said.
Minko Chernev / Getty Images\n\nThe divergence between rich and poor is growing in some regions, creating affordability problems and straining fiscal budgets.\n\nAmerica is increasingly the land of haves and have-nots, but the problem isn't shared equally across the country. Some cities are struggling with greater income inequality than others, leading to crises concerning wages and affordability, according to a new study from The Brookings Institution, which examined income data from the country's biggest 100 cities.\n\nInequality is typically viewed as a national problem, yet the issue is also local, given that some cities are struggling with how to cope with a widening gap between rich and poor. That can affect everything from housing affordability to public safety, especially in tech-heavy cities where wealth divisions are exacerbating social and financial problems.\n\nCities that sprawl and those with strong middle-class employment tend to have lower levels of income inequality, while older cities that lack stable middle-class neighborhoods are more likely to suffer from a widening gulf between rich and poor, the researchers said.\n\nSome cities posted stunning increases in top incomes from 2014 to 2016, Alan Berube, senior fellow and deputy director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings wrote in the report. The most astonishing changes in the mid-2010s occurred among high-income households in a few cities characterized by booming technology economies.\n\nThat has implications for the city that Amazon (AMZN) picks as home to its HQ2, or its second headquarters. The online retail giant has narrowed down its list to 20 contenders, ranging from Boston to Los Angeles.\n\nMany cities' aggressive bids for Amazon's second headquarters are heightening anxieties that the company's expansion could further accelerate inequality wherever it eventually lands, Berube noted.\n\nNevertheless, it's not only the rich who are better off. Poor residents in some cities have also enjoyed income gains, which paints a complicated picture of income inequality. The past decade of economic growth has created separate ebbs and flows for households at different extremes of the distribution, he noted.\n\nThe problem, however, occurs when poor or middle-class families don't see that flow at the same time as the city's richest residents. In that case, they could get priced out of the region before they have a chance to catch up.\n\nRead on to learn about the nine cities with the deepest income inequality.
HONG KONG - World stock markets were mostly higher Tuesday as a strengthening yuan and hopes for more central bank stimulus gave investors relief from the mauling that markets have suffered so far this year.\n\nAlso, a tentative offer by Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela to freeze oil production at January levels gave oil prices a boost. The offer would only take effect if other oil producing countries followed suit, Russia's energy ministry Alexander Novak said following a meeting in Qatar.\n\nEuropean stocks were higher in early trading. France's CAC 40 climbed 0.4 percent to 4,131.18 and Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.2 percent to 5,831.64. Germany's DAX dipped 0.3 percent to 9,181.45.\n\nU.S. benchmarks were poised to open sharply higher after a long weekend. Both Dow and broader S&P 500 futures jumped 1.4 percent.\n\nInvestor sentiment remained positive that central banks would continue to ease monetary policy thanks to comments from the head of the European Central Bank. With the ECB set to discuss policy measures on March 10, Mario Draghi told the European Parliament on Monday that the bank has a range of instruments it can deploy if it decides more stimulus is needed. Earlier, a disappointing report on Japanese economic growth also raised hopes for more policy easing.\n\nChina's strengthening currency also helped boost sentiment. The yuan hovered near its strongest level so far this year a day after the central bank guided the currency, also known as the renminbi, sharply higher. Previous weakness in the yuan triggered worries the Chinese economy was in worse shape than thought. Meanwhile, new yuan loans jumped 71 percent in January, the official Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday, suggesting solid demand in the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nSince the start of January everything went south and we really needed some positive news, said Jackson Wong, associate director at Huarong International Securities. Factors that were affecting the markets negatively have turned positive now: the yen is weaker, the renminbi is stronger, global markets like the U.S. are stabilizing. All the negative catalysts from January are turning better.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 added 0.2 percent to close at 16,054.43 after soaring 7.2 percent the day before, which was its biggest daily gain since September. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.4 percent to 1,888.30 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.1 percent to 19,122.08. The Shanghai Composite Index in mainland China surged 3.3 percent to 2,836.57 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 1.4 percent to 4,910.00. Benchmarks in Taiwan and most of Southeast Asia also rose.\n\nThe dollar eased to 114.06 yen from 114.54 yen in Monday's trading. The euro edged up to $1.1174 from $1.1168.
NEW ORLEANS -- A majority of people in Louisiana oppose taking down Confederate monuments, a Louisiana State University poll has found.\n\nThe survey released Monday examined feelings statewide about New Orleans' plan to remove prominent Confederate statues, including a towering figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nSeventy-three percent of respondents said they opposed removing the Confederate memorials. The poll found 88 percent of whites opposed removal, while 47 percent of blacks also opposed removal.\n\nResults varied by political party, CBS affiliate WWL reported. Ninety-two percent of Republicans oppose removing Confederate monuments compared with 54 percent of Democrats.\n\nn Southwest Louisiana, a majority said they oppose removing Confederate statues. In every region of the state except New Orleans, more than 72 percent of respondents said Confederate monuments should not be removed, WWL reported.\n\nA different poll, released earlier this month by the University of New Orleans, looked only at New Orleans residents and found about half in favor of removal.\n\nAt the urging of Mayor Mitch Landrieu, the City Council voted in December to remove the monuments, which are still a source of passion in this Deep South state.\n\nThe poll, which had a plus-or-minus 3 percent margin of error, was based on interviews conducted in February with 1,001 people.\n\nThe views expressed were not surprising, said Michael Henderson, the research director at LSU's Public Policy Research Lab. He worked on the poll.\n\nLouisiana is a socially conservative state, a Southern state, he said.\n\nBoth polls found tolerance toward Confederate symbols, even among blacks.\n\nTaking the monuments down has been anything but easy. And they still haven't been removed, stalled by lawsuits and even death threats against contractors.\n\nThe city's plan is considered bold. Landrieu has wanted the removal to coincide with the city's 300th anniversary celebrations in 2018.\n\nThe monuments slated for removal include a 60-foot-tall marble column and statue dedicated to Lee in Lee Circle, and a large equestrian statue of P.G.T. Beauregard, a Louisiana-born Confederate general at City Park. Also up for removal are a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and an obelisk dedicated to a group of white supremacists who sought to topple a biracial Reconstruction government in New Orleans.\n\nMalcolm Suber, an organizer with Take Em Down NOLA, a protest group demanding removal, said LSU's poll demonstrated the need to challenge Confederate history.\n\nThe history we are taught is a Confederate history and glorification of all things Confederate is part of the history of this state, Suber said.\n\nHe said this is a teachable moment for Louisianans to challenge its Confederate past.\n\nThomas Taylor, head of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Louisiana, said the poll shows how people care about history.\n\nAre we going to erase four years of history? Taylor said, referring to the Civil War. He added: These aren't just monuments. These are works of art.
The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has ousted its leader after a power struggle.\n\nThe Washington nonprofit's board of trustees unanimously asked for and received the resignation of Jim DeMint at a meeting Tuesday. The board chairman said in a pull-no-punches statement afterward that significant and worsening management issues led to the ouster.\n\nWhile the organization has seen many successes, Jim DeMint and a handful of his closest advisers failed to resolve these problems, Chairman Thomas Saunders III wrote in a statement\n\nHeritage has never been about one individual, but rather the power of conservative ideas, the statement added. Heritage is bigger than any one person.\n\nDeMint, a former South Carolina senator, could not immediately be reached.\n\nDozens of Republican in Congress wrote a love-letter of sorts to DeMint on Monday. They praised him for serving as an inspirational conservative figure even when confronted by overwhelming opposition, bitter criticism and nagging skepticism.\n\nRep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, called DeMint's ouster a tragedy.\n\nHe's just kind of an ideal person who understood the think-tank world and understands the timing and the strategy along with policy, Brat said. And to lose that, it's incomprehensible. I don't get it. At all. I don't get it.\n\nSome board members called the decision a painful, but necessary, one.\n\nKay Cole James said it was purely about management, organizational and structural issues — not philosophical differences with DeMint.\n\nJames said Saunders expressed admiration for DeMint during an all-staff meeting late Monday to announce the leadership change. She added that DeMint had already left the building by then.\n\nHeritage, which has 500,000 members, brought in about $92 million in revenue in 2015 and paid DeMint more than $1 million every year. That's according to its most recent publicly available tax filings.\n\nThe nonprofit has been a crucial ally of President Donald Trump and his still-young administration. The president thanked Heritage — and specifically DeMint — during his speech Friday to the National Rifle Association.\n\nFounder Ed Feulner will serve as president and chief executive officer during a search for DeMint's replacement.\n\nThe statement adds that Feulner has led Heritage for more than three decades and returns to the organziation after serving on Mr. Trump's transition team.
The Federal Reserve is getting set to announce Wednesday how it will unload its massive holdings of long-term bonds. Unwinding the $4.5 trillion portfolio would tend to put upward pressure on long-term rates, especially mortgage ones.\n\nThe Fed is hiking interest rates two ways. For short-term borrowings, it is boosting rates in increments of a quarter percentage point, and is expected to do that again on Wednesday. Then there are the long rates: Fed Chair Janet Yellen is widely anticipated to detail a plan to gradually lighten the Fed's bond trove, which consists of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThis will be measured and deliberate, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. The impact will be on the long end of the curve, mainly affecting corporate bond and mortgage rates, whose yields often are correlated to 10-year Treasury notes.\n\nThe central bank's long-term securities stash amounted to $900 billion before the financial crisis. But as an economic stimulus move, the Fed launched its program to buy bonds, which was aimed at keeping long-term rates low, and thus aid borrowing.\n\nNow, with the economy on fairly firm ground -- gross domestic product growth is lackadaisical, but unemployment is low -- Yellen wants to reverse the process, perhaps trimming the bond portfolio to about $2 trillion. The Fed halted its program to add bonds in 2014, and has maintained its hoard at the $4.5 trillion level by reinvesting the principal in new bonds when the older ones mature.\n\nUnder the new policy, the Fed wouldn't reinvest the principal but instead remit it to the U.S. Treasury Department. That way, bond buyers would no longer have to compete for a smaller supply of publicly available bonds by paying less in interest. More publicly available bonds would tend to lower their prices -- and lift their yields, which move in the opposite direction from prices.\n\nThis will unleash government bonds into the public market, said Paul Eitelman, multi-asset investment strategist with Russell Investments, rather than leaving a big batch of them quarantined at the Fed.\n\nThe trick is to avoid a reprise of the 2013 taper tantrum, triggered when Yellen's predecessor, Ben Bernanke, said the Fed would begin scaling back its bond purchases. This sparked a selloff in the stock market, which had benefited from lower rates because, among other things, they drove investors in search of better returns to riskier alternatives such as equities. Interest rates also jumped on the news.\n\nThe Fed may allow $10 billion in bonds per month to mature and run off its balance sheet, predicted Russell's Eitelman. He said he believed the program would start in December and last perhaps five years. The size of the holdings not recycled likely would increase with time.\n\nOf course, there is a debate on whether the bond-buying program did much good. David Levy, chairman of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center, pointed out that high demand for U.S. bonds in recent years occurred for reasons other than Fed actions.\n\nThe woes of southern Europe, emerging market troubles, a Chinese growth slowdown and other perceived calamities drove investors -- particularly foreign ones -- to the safety of Treasury bonds. That bid up the bonds' prices and pushed down yields, exactly what the Fed sought to do. The Fed's buying is not the issue most people think it is, he said.\n\nWhy is the Fed eager to reduce its bond holdings? The bloated balance sheet is a political liability on Capitol Hill, where Republicans continue to eye imposing more oversight on the independent Fed. Plus, during the next recession, the Fed will have more room to expand its holdings again to try goosing the economy.\n\nBy proceeding at a gradual pace, the Fed would minimize any market disruption. Anthony Karydakis, an adjunct economic professor at New York University, predicted in a Barron's article that this policy should keep the 10-year Treasury yield at 3 percent through early 2018.\n\nNow, the 10-year T-note yields 2.2 percent, down from 2.6 percent in March. So any change at the outset would not likely be radical.
SEOUL, South Korea - Global stock markets were subdued on Thursday as investors digested mixed economic data in Europe and looked ahead to the key U.S. monthly jobs report on Friday.\n\nBritain's FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent to 6,167.17 and Germany's DAX fell 0.2 percent to 9,761.59. France's CAC 40 declined 0.2 percent to 4,414.80. Futures augured a tepid start for Wall Street. Dow futures and S&P futures were both roughly unchanged.\n\nIndicators for the 19-country eurozone showed economic activity eased slightly in February, though retail sales rose. The upshot is that investors still expect the European Central Bank to unveil more stimulus at its March 10 meeting. Overall, today's data do not alter our view that growth in the eurozone is slowing and that the ECB will need to loosen policy next week, said Jessica Hinds, analyst at Capital Economics.\n\nChinese leaders were expected to lower their growth target during the upcoming gathering of the National People's Congress this week as China seeks more flexibility for structural reforms for the slowing, state-dominated economy. The growth target due to be announced on Saturday is expected to be a range of 6.5 to 7 percent, down from 2015's goal of about 7 percent.\n\nAsian markets closed mostly higher after solid U.S. jobs survey. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.3 percent to 16,960.16 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.6 percent to 1,958.17. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index underperformed other benchmarks in the region, falling 0.3 percent to 19,941.76, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4 percent to 2,859.76. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.2 percent to 5,081.10 and stocks in Taiwan and Southeast Asia also were higher.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 9 cents at $34.75 per barrel in New York. The contract rose 26 cents on Wednesday. Brent crude fell 5 cents at $36.88 a barrel in London.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0891 from $1.0870 and the dollar rose to 114.02 yen from 113.61 yen.
Editor's Note: In this story, as originally broadcast, footage of the 2015 Freddie Gray street protests in Philadelphia was mistakenly used. It has been replaced with footage of the Freddie Gray protests in Baltimore.\n\nOn Thursday, we learned President Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. It marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the Donald Trump Reality Show with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave Democrats control of the House of Representatives. Among the recently empowered is Congressman Elijah Cummings, the new chairman of the House oversight committee. It has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the Trump administration and making Cummings one of the most powerful people in Washington.\n\nElijah Cummings has been a familiar face on Capitol Hill for a long time, a respected 13-term Maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. And he was handpicked by the Democratic leaders for this job.\n\nCongressman Elijah Cummings\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: We are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. And you've got to understand that. This is serious business.\n\nYou can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of President Trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. And there are 17 other investigations underway. Not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new Democratic House of Representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents.\n\nSteve Kroft: So how are you gonna run this committee?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to work with the Republicans as I have in the past. You know why? Because that's our job. And when it comes to subpoena, I know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. In order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. You gotta have emails. You gotta have information.\n\nFor the first two years of the Trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house Democrats. The power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the Republican majority. As ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, Cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like White House security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, and the Justice Department's refusal to defend the Affordable Care Act. All of them were blocked by the Republican chairman.\n\nSteve Kroft: You've asked the White House for a bunch of things. you've asked for documents connected to Jared Kushner's use of private emails. Child separation policy at the border. Have you ever gotten anything?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Zero.\n\nSteve Kroft: Nothing?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. --that's the point. Now, I-- I don't know if any president has ever done this. None. None that has ever said, I'm not givin' you anything. For anything. Nothing.\n\nSteve Kroft: But you're sitting here telling me you think somehow, miraculously, he's going to change.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: it's not about miraculous. It's about-- adherence to the Constitution. And the American people and the Congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. Basically what the president has done and the Republicans have done, they've joined hands. And the Republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. Okay. But no documents? I mean, come on.\n\nCummings with his wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\n\nNow as chairman of the oversight committee, Cummings no longer has to consult with the Republicans to issue subpoenas, initiate investigations or call hearings, and he has a much bigger budget and staff. So will Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, but their inquiries will be limited to their specific jurisdictions. Cummings' committee has the authority to investigate anything inside or outside the federal government.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: We can look at anything.\n\nSteve Kroft: You could--\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Anything.\n\nSteve Kroft: --look at Interior, you could look at E.P.A.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Anything. but the fact that we can look at anything is part of the problem. There's so much. No, I'm-- I'm serious. There's so much.\n\nSteve Kroft: And you only have two years.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Less than that. Actually, less than that. The Congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. And all I'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying.\n\nSome Democrats believe Cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. He says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. His staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the White House, and the Trump Organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. The issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various Trump enterprises like his hotel in Washington.\n\nSteve Kroft: You think he's making money off this job?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Please.\n\nSteve Kroft: A lotta money?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: A lotta money.\n\nSteve Kroft: And-- and you say the Constitution and the laws say it's not okay?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: It's not okay. And, but this is the other piece. I still believe that people-- the average citizen, the guys on my block, they oughta know if the president is making a deal, whether he's making it-- making it in his self-interest or that of the country.\n\nIn response, the White House said: these claims are completely baseless, but we cannot comment further about ongoing litigation.\n\nElijah Cummings has been in Congress for 23 years but he is not a creature of Washington. When he needs to be there he commutes from his Maryland district, an hour's drive to the north, where he represents 700,000 people and most of the city of Baltimore. He was born here 67 years ago to parents with fourth grade educations who'd been sharecroppers in South Carolina before moving north for a better life. His father worked in a chemical plant, his mother was a domestic. Both were pentecostal ministers.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: First it was religion, and then it was the education. My father, Steve, had a saying. He said-- he told us, If you miss one day of school, that meant you died the night before. And he meant that. I did not miss one second of school between kindergarten and graduating from high school. Not one second.\n\nHe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University before earning a law degree at Maryland. He says he is one of the few congressmen who live in an inner-city, working-class neighborhood.\n\nCorrespondent Steve Kroft with Cummings at the congressman's home in Baltimore\n\nSteve Kroft: How long have you lived here?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: 37 years.\n\nHe says he keeps a campaign poster in the front window so people will know where to find him.\n\nSteve Kroft: So you like to be among your constituents?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go-- I might as well stay home.\n\nWhen riots broke out in Baltimore three years ago after the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, who was fatally injured in the back of a police van, Cummings gained national attention walking the troubled neighborhoods trying to keep the peace. He is part of the city's fabric.\n\nBut now he has stepped onto a much larger stage, under the bright lights of the oversight committee.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Well, I sit here. And the Democrats'll be all over here. And the Republicans will be over there. Our hearings can go anywhere from an hour and a half to 11 or 12 hours.\n\nSteve Kroft: So you got a good, comfortable chair.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Got a good, comfortable chair. And I gotta tell you, Steve-- standing here, it just-- it sorta gives me chills in a way because I think about my journey to this chair.\n\nAfter years as the committee's ranking minority member, he is ready to wield the gavel and the subpoena.\n\nSteve Kroft: You've got a lotta power. But you don't have unlimited power. I mean--\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: No.\n\nSteve Kroft: --and the Republicans are going to put a lot of obstacles in your way.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Sure. I expect that. Now, there's one big elephant that's sittin' around here that we don't know-- what it's gonna yield. And that is Mueller's report. I don't know what that report is gonna have in it. One thing I do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it-- if it exonerates the president, fine. But this I do know: I want whatever it is, for the Congress to have it, and I want the public to have it, so that everybody can make a judgment.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you think it's possible the Republicans will try and suppress the report?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: I hope not. But that's a possibility. But I hope not. I hope they don't.\n\nCummings' Republican foil on the committee is Ohio's Jim Jordan, one of the president's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters.\n\nSteve Kroft: You've known Elijah Cummings for a while. How would you describe your relationship?\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: Well, look, there's-- there's not much of anything that-- that Mr. Cummings and I agree on, policy-wise. But-- I certainly respect his toughness-- his tenacity. You know, he's demonstrated that he's-- he's a fighter and I kinda-- my background is such that I kind of appreciate that.\n\nA founding member of the Freedom Caucus, Congressman Jordan is a one-time college wrestler and coach, still known for his scrappiness. He's seldom seen wearing a jacket, and always ready to go to the mat.\n\nCongressman Jim Jordan\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: Taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, the economy growing at an unbelievable rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years. 312,000 jobs added last month alone. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the courts. We're out of the Iran deal. The embassy's in Jerusalem. Hostages are home from North Korea.\n\nAnd oh, by the way, there's a new N.A.F.T.A. agreement. So it's an amazing record and that's what I know about the two years that we've had Donald Trump as President of the United States.\n\nSteve Kroft: After the midterms, you wrote a letter to the Republicans saying, You must valiantly defend the president. Is that your job?\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: My job is getting to the truth. If the president is getting a raw deal I'm going to defend him.\n\nSteve Kroft: I feel like I would be remiss in this if I didn't point out that truthfulness has not exactly been President Trump's strongest asset.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan: Well, I mean, Steve, look, this-- this president's probably been attacked more than any president that-- in my lifetime. And here's what I know. Over the last two years, in spite of the unprecedented attacks that have come against President Trump, the last two years have been amazing.\n\nChairman Cummings wouldn't disagree that the past two years have been amazing, but in a much different way.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: I don't think the other presidents-- called a lie the truth and the truth a lie. I-- I'm gonna tell you, that's what makes the relationship so difficult. It's hard to trust. You-- you wanna believe that if you make an agreement with someone, and I believed that with the other presidents it was this way, their word was their bond. I don't know how to compare. I-- I-- I don't. And I'm not tryin' to be smart.\n\nSteve Kroft: We're in new territory here.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Yes, it's new territory.\n\nThe new territory now includes a beefed-up White House counsel's office. It has added more than a dozen new lawyers to fight what it anticipates will be a barrage of requests and subpoenas from congress.\n\nSteve Kroft: What happens if you issue a bunch of subpoenas and the administration doesn't respond? Or invokes executive privilege.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: We probably will end up in the courts. And one of the interesting things about the courts is that our president has been making sure that some of the most conservative judges are being p-- appointed-- to the federal bench. And I think he relies on that, and I think that he assumes that the courts will-- will possibly be, it all depends-- be helpful to him.\n\nIt promises to be a demanding time for a man who spent nearly six months in the hospital over the last year and a half for heart and knee surgery. As he showed us the victory prayer chapel, a church founded by his mother, Congressman Cummings relied on a cane and a walker. He says his chairmanship will be a physical burden on him, but his strong faith and awareness of his mortality will see him through.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you feel like you have the strength--\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Oh yeah, man--\n\nSteve Kroft: --and the stamina to do this?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings: Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Like I tell my-- my constituents, Don't get it twisted. You know, I may-- my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. My mission is clear. And I am prepared and able to do what I have to do. And I will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me God.\n\nThis story was produced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate producer, Alex Ortiz.
The lowest U.S. employment rate in 18 years hasn't done much to lift wages, but the difficulty of finding workers is having one effect: convincing companies to stop testing job candidates for marijuana.\n\nCaesars Entertainment made headlines this week for its decision to opt out of screening potential hires for pot use, with the casino operator implementing the policy nationwide, a spokesman confirmed, adding: It was one factor disqualifying a lot of good people.\n\nWhile garnering attention in recent days, the spokesperson said the policy has actually been in place since the end of 2016. AutoNation, the country's biggest auto dealership chain, also quietly made the move more than two years ago, the company's CEO told Bloomberg in January.\n\nCaesars will continue testing for cannabis use for jobs, such as drivers, where federal rules mandate screening for marijuana. We still test for pot -- and other drugs -- if we believe an employee is high on the job, the spokesman said.\n\nThe rules at Caesars potentially impact tens of thousands of workers, given it employs some 63,000 people in 13 states. About half of Caesars' workforce reside in Nevada, where voters legalized recreational pot use, starting in January 2017.\n\nThe less stringent stance toward marijuana use, at least off the job, comes as businesses struggle to hire workers. U.S. employers advertising 6.6 million open jobs in March, up 7.8 percent from February and the highest count since the Department of Labor starting compiling the data in December 2000.\n\nIn Nevada, positive tests for marijuana use increased 43 percent last year in the state, according to data released by Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest drug-testing labs in the country. Overall, 2.6 percent of workers tested by Quest tested positive for marijuana.\n\nEmployers in Colorado and Washington, the states where recreational use of pot has been legal the longest, have lower rates of including marijuana in drug tests, according to Barry Sample, Quest's senior director, science and technology. Last year, 98.4 percent of all urine drug tests conducted for employers nationwide included marijuana, versus 96.2 percent in Colorado and 97 percent in Washington.\n\nIn the states that have more recently enacted recreational use statutes, it is still too early tell what will happen with testing patterns, Sample said in emailed statement.\n\nThe shift away from marijuana testing is expected to pick up as more states legalize cannabis for recreational use. About 30 states already allow medical use of the drug, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nSurveys conducted by the Federal Reserve last year found employers relaying experienced or qualified employees, some citing candidates' inability to pass drug tests as among the factors making hiring more difficult.\n\nIn Maine, employers are effectively barred from testing job prospects for marijuana, a provision that took effect in February as part of the state's recreational marijuana law.
Before being sworn in as Utah's junior senator, Mitt Romney said he looks forward to building a trusting relationship with President Trump, despite strong disagreements between the two.\n\nI look forward to being able to have a trusting relationship with the president and others despite differences from time to time, Romney told reporters on Thursday outside his temporary office.\n\nIn a scathing New Year's Day editorial for the Washington Post, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee accused Mr. Trump of not rising to the mantle of the office and questioned the president's character as America's commander-in-chief. Romney criticized the White House's foreign policy agenda, in particular, the president's plans to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, and vowed to speak out against statements or actions by president which he deemed divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.\n\nAs a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit. With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring, Romney wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, Romney defended his decision to write the op-ed, which his niece and chairwoman of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel denounced as disappointing and counterproductive.\n\nI think it's important as I step into the Senate in this new responsibility to lay out my priorities and my perspectives which I was able to do, Romney said of his opinion piece.\n\nI'm not worried about what other people think about what I have to say. I just want to hear what they have to say about their priorities and their perspective, he added.\n\nAlan He contributed to this report.
WARREN, Mich. -- A man who stopped a stabbing attack Wednesday was initially asked to leave the GM Tech Center where he worked as a contractor, because he had a gun, reports CBS Detroit.\n\nBut the mayor of Warren, Mich., says Didarul Paco Sarder, a contracted valet driver at the facility, soon got his job back after outrage quickly spread in the community.\n\nThe situation unfolded Wednesday morning when 32-year-old Chavonne Taylor entered the visitor lobby at facility and asked for 52-year-old Stephanie Kerr.\n\nTaylor, who is reportedly Kerr's daughter, walked outside and got into an argument. Police say Taylor pulled out a steak knife and stabbed Kerr several times in the neck, abdomen and back, according to Warren Mayor Jim Fouts.\n\nSarder saw the attack unfold and rushed to Kerr's aid, pulling out his firearm and ordering the suspect to drop her knife. He then held her at gunpoint until police arrived and placed her under arrest.\n\nKerr was rushed to the hospital with life-threatening injuries and underwent surgery. She was last reported in stable condition. Taylor was charged with intent to murder and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent.\n\nAfter the incident, Sarder was escorted off the property by GM security officials. He was initially told he could no longer allowed to work at the Tech Center because he violated policy by carrying a gun on the property. The decision was criticized by Fouts, who announced on Facebook that it was reversed.\n\nThat decision was over-ruled by higher ups and he now has his job back, Fouts said. I hope to honor and reward this good citizen for being a hero in time of need. Hero's should be rewarded not terminated.
NEW YORK - Stocks posted steep losses Friday, ending the week with broad declines, as investors fretted over a report showing that U.S. job creation slowed last month.\n\nTechnology stocks fell especially hard, and shares of LinkedIn (LNKD) had their worst day in history.\n\nEnergy and consumer discretionary stocks fell as oil prices declined and investors continued to worry that the risk of the U.S. economy slipping into recession, while low, is growing.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 211.75 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 16,204.83. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 35.43 points, or 1.9 percent, ending at 1,880.02 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 146.41 points, or 3.3 percent, to finish at 4,363.14.\n\nStocks were mostly lower throughout day, but losses accelerated as the end of trading approached. With Friday's losses, the Dow was down 1.6 percent for the week, the S&P 500 fell 3.1 percent and Nasdaq lost 5.4 percent.\n\nInvestors were discouraged by a report that showed U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs last month, a sharp deceleration from recent months as companies shed education, transportation and temporary workers. That was below economists' forecasts of 185,000 new jobs, according to data from FactSet.\n\nThe report included some positive signs, however. The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent from 5 percent, the lowest level since February 2008. Average wages jumped 2.5 percent over the past year to $25.39 an hour, evidence that the past years of job growth are helping to generate larger pay raises.\n\nIt's a rather difficult report to interpret. It confirms there has been some deceleration in the U.S. economy. We're not falling off the cliff, but it clearly shows the U.S. economy is not immune to the global slowdown, said Russ Koesterich, global market strategist with asset manager BlackRock.\n\nThe jobs report, while less than what economists were looking for, still showed that the U.S. economy is growing, albeit slowly. The report caused the dollar to strengthen against other currencies, reversing some of the last two days of declines.\n\nThe report also raised a new worry about Federal Reserve interest rate policy. Investors had been betting in recent weeks that a slowing U.S. economy might prompt the Federal Reserve to delay plans to raise interest rates. But the Fed could see the data showing the growth in hourly wages as an early sign of inflation, which in turn might cause it to keep raising rates even in a slowing economy, Koesterich said.\n\nYou have the possibility of soft growth and monetary tightening, and that's not a great place to be as an investor, he said.\n\nTechnology stocks were hit hard by disappointing results from professional social network company LinkedIn and data analysis company Tableau Software (DATA). LinkedIn shares dropped $83.90, or 44 percent, to $108.38, its worst single-day performance in the company's history. The company provided a weak outlook for 2016 and announced it was winding down an advertising platform that was supposed to be a new venture.\n\nTableau Software plunged $40.40, or 49 percent, to $41.33 after the data analytics company reported a wider-than-expected loss and its software license revenue missed analysts' predictions. Tableau's dismal results spread to other software companies, like Salesforce.com (CRM), which fell 13 percent, and Adobe Systems (ADBE), which fell 8 percent.\n\nU.S. government bond prices were mostly unchanged. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remained at 1.84 percent.\n\nThe dollar rose to 116.89 yen from 116.71 yen. The euro fell to $1.1164 from $1.1214, inching back from its highest level in more than three months.\n\nIn the energy markets, U.S. crude fell 83 cents to $30.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 40 cents to $34.06 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.059 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 3.6 cents to 99.27 cents and natural gas rose 9 cents to $2.063 per thousand cubic feet.\n\nIn precious and industrial metals trading, gold edged up 20 cents to $1,157.70 an ounce, silver fell 7 cents to $14.78 an ounce and copper fell 3 cents to $2.10 a pound.
Aghan police stand guard at the entrance of the Ministry of Public Works a day after a deadly militant attack in Kabul, Dec. 25, 2018. An hours-long gun and suicide attack on the compound killed at least 43 people, the health ministry said, making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital of 2018. Getty\n\nKabul, Afghanistan -- An Afghan official said Tuesday that the Taliban launched two blistering attacks in northern Sar-e-Pul province, killing 15 members of the country's security forces. In one attack, on the outskirts of the provincial capital, heavy artillery fire by Afghan forces trying to repel the insurgents sent local residents fleeing for safety.\n\nProvincial council chief Mohammad Noor Rahmani said along with 15 policemen killed, 21 were wounded in the two attacks which took place late on Monday. He said fierce gun battles raged for several hours in Sayyad district and outside Sar-e-Pul, the provincial capital.\n\nTaliban spokesman Qari Yousof Ahmadi claimed responsibility for both attacks.\n\nThe Taliban have carried out near-daily attacks targeting Afghan forces, as U.S. policy in Afghanistan appears headed for a significant change. While the U.S. pushes for a negotiated truce between the Afghan government and the Taliban, President Trump has indicated he will halve the number of American forces in the country.\n\nCBS News correspondent David Martin reported before Christmas that the Pentagon was ordered to start planning the withdrawal of roughly 7,000 troops from the war-torn country, almost half of which remains under Taliban control.\n\nThe former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said Sunday that withdrawing so many of the U.S. forces from the country would reduce the incentive for the Taliban to negotiate a peace deal after more than 17 years of war. Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal said the U.S. had, basically traded away the biggest leverage point we have.\n\nMcChrystal spoke in response to questions about former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who mentioned Mr. Trump's withdrawal order in his resignation letter. Mattis' last day in the administration was Monday -- earlier than he initially announced, after Mr. Trump moved up his departure date.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in 2014, but American and allied troops remain, conducting strikes on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) affiliate there and the Taliban, and working to train and build the Afghan military.\n\nIf you tell the Taliban that we are absolutely leaving on date certain, cutting down, weakening ourselves, their incentives to try to cut a deal drop dramatically, McChrystal said on ABC's This Week.\n\nMcChrystal also said he was worried that the Afghan people would lose confidence in the U.S. as a reliable ally.\n\nI think we probably rocked them, said McChrystal, who commanded U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan for about a year.
Norman, Okla. -- Two University of Oklahoma students have voluntarily withdrawn from the school after one appeared in a video posted on social media wearing black face paint and using a racial epithet, the university's president said Monday. Jim Gallogly said the two women apologized for what he called a shocking, racist video and that they appeared taken aback by the backlash after the video appeared on Twitter Friday.\n\nThose students will not return to campus. This type of behavior is not welcome here and is condemned in the strongest terms by me, and by our university, Gallogly said at a news conference, noting that Monday is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, in celebration of the slain black civil rights leader.\n\nI ask you to hold his ideals high as we work toward a more inclusive and caring future for our university, Gallogly said.\n\nHe said the university is investigating whether a third student was involved in the video.\n\nSince the video surfaced, the OU Black Student Association has called for a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech, more social and cultural classes, more multicultural faculty and staff, and additional financial assistance for African-Americans at the school in Norman, Oklahoma. The association has yet to respond to Gallogly's announcement.\n\nOU severed ties with a fraternity and expelled two students in 2015 after several members took part in a racist chant caught on video that referenced lynching.\n\nObviously we've had a second incident in several years. These kinds of things are totally unacceptable to our community. It shows that there must be something systemic. We have work to do, Gallogly said.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, London Moore, the president of the Theta Gamma chapter of Delta Delta Delta, condemned the racist, offensive and disgraceful behavior seen in the video. Moore said the video is in no way consistent with Tri Delta's ideals and apologized to students for this senseless act of racism.\n\nThe woman who participated in, filmed and posted the video is no longer a member of our organization, Moore said.\n\nCBS affiliate KWTC reports that students reacted with shock to the video. I opened the video and my heart sank to my stomach. And my mouth was just open. I had no words for this, Senior Janae Reeves said.\n\nThe Black Student Association has announced an on-campus Rally to Stop Racism on Tuesday. Gallogly said he has accepted an invitation to address students at the rally.
For our series Three Meals, Major Garrett traveled to three cities in Texas to talk to voters over breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nIn Texas, impeachment came up frequently; overall, most voters were fatigued by it all. But those paying close attention defied party stereotypes.\n\nAt the Avalon Diner in Stafford, Texas, Jeannine Benoit said she supported President Trump; her husband, Scott, did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, but will this year. CBS News\n\nBreakfast: Stafford, Texas\n\nGarrett started in a diverse area outside of Houston with eggs, hash browns and pancakes at the Avalon Diner in Stafford.\n\nThe economy is going really well, said dentist Scott Benoit. I think overall we're safe as a country. Everything's going pretty well.\n\nThe Now Hiring sign outside backs that up; the Avalon's owner told us she's lost workers to better jobs elsewhere.\n\nBenoit did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, but will this year. His wife Jeannine, a speech therapist, was with the president from the beginning. I just have more conservative values, so I tend to go more with that person, she said.\n\nJust across from Scott and Jeannine, Garrett met Bernard and Sharon Maynore. Both work in health care. Bernard said, I feel mystified when I'm listening to what Donald Trump has to say.\n\nGarrett asked, How frequently now, or during the Trump presidency, have you found yourself shaking your head?\n\nEvery day, Sharon replied.  My co-workers said that we needed a change, they wanted to make America great again. I'm wondering, do those same people, do they think that he has made American great again?\n\nAt Mac's Bar-B-Q in Midland, Alison Loera and Laura Ortega discussed President Trump's divisive rhetoric. CBS News\n\nLunch: Midland, Texas\n\nThen it was on to lunch in conservative Midland, a boom town in West Texas, where oil and natural gas production runs around the clock.\n\nAt Mac's Bar-B-Q, a local favorite, the brisket is slow-cooked out back for 18 hours. Customers start arriving for lunch around 11.\n\nKyle Davis, his brother Jake, and their business partner Tom Hull run a construction and drilling company. Kyle and Jake support President Trump and expect him to be re-elected.\n\nI don't like all the nonsense that comes with him, Kyle said. But yeah, his policy has been spot-on.\n\nJake added, I really don't want another Obama. I kind of feel like he divided our country.\n\nGarrett asked both about impeachment. Kyle's answer surprised him: Was it an impeachable offense? Yeah, it sounds like it probably was, he said.\n\nJake took the long view: I'm sure at some point every president could have been impeached.\n\nTom Hull calls himself a New England Republican and considers Mr. Trump a failure. The economy's been propped up with record levels of deficit spending, he said. And he picks fights that he doesn't know how to get out of.\n\nGarrett also met Alison Loera, Laura Ortega and Jennifer Reyes. Loera works in insurance; Ortega and Reyes are data specialists for drilling companies.\n\nThey criticized the president for his comments about the Hispanic community. Loera said, We feel targeted.\n\nGarrett asked, Do you feel lumped in or somehow demonized?\n\nIn a way, I guess, Loera replied.\n\nReyes said, Comments like that shouldn't be made by someone with that much power and authority.\n\nBlake Hammerton and Daniel Torres discuss the 2020 campaign with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, at The Flying Saucer pub in Garland, Texas. CBS News\n\nDinner: Garland, Texas\n\nDinner took Garrett to The Flying Saucer pub in Garland, a politically-moderate area northeast of Dallas.\n\nI voted for Trump, said Rita Dusek. I did, because I thought we need somebody who's not a politician. But that didn't seem to work out, she laughed.\n\nGarrett asked, Will you vote for him again?\n\nNo, she said.\n\nHer husband, Al, a registered Republican, said, I did not vote for him. I don't like extremism on either side.\n\nJust across the way Garrett met David Lindsay, who owns a construction firm. The economy has probably been the best since I've owned the company, he said.\n\nDo you give anyone in the political world credit for that? asked Garrett.\n\nI will solidly give the president credit for doing it, said Lindsey.\n\nThe president's volatile style was raised: Do you ever wish he would tone it down? asked Garrett.\n\nOh, yeah, I think somebody should hide his cellphone on him, Lindsey said.\n\nBlake Hammerton and Daniel Torres both opposed Mr. Trump in 2016, and will vote in the March 3 Texas Democratic primary.\n\nI have very, very strong feeling: the young vote will come out this year, Torres said.\n\nGarrett asked, When you think about the Democrats, what are your thoughts?\n\nStop making everything a battle to the end, Hammerton said. The Democrats are exhausting themselves and exhausting the public.\n\nSounds like they're exhausting you? Yes! he said.\n\nGarrett said of his excursion that, among Democrats, he did not find hard-core supporters of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. Flat line across the board, Texas Democrats are waiting for Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada to sort this out, he said. Democrats said they were keeping an open mind for Texas' 'Super Tuesday' primary.\n\nOne person they were keeping in mind, because he's on TV so frequently in Texas, is Mike Bloomberg, he added, noting the billionaire's strategy of creating an impression with voters via paid ads while his opponents — fighting it out in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere — have yet to make an impression in the Lone Star State.\n\nGarrett asked everyone if they had seen or remembered a Bloomberg TV ad. All but two had. Trump supporters said they thought Bloomberg might give the president the toughest challenge.\n\nOne other thing: when we asked people what they thought about the November election, they said two words: anticipation, and dread.\n\nOther entries in our Three Meals series:
HONG KONG - China's manufacturing sector continues to gear down, highlighting the country's slowing economic growth.\n\nChina's manufacturing outlook deteriorated in February, according to two surveys of factory activity released Tuesday, a day after Beijing loosened credit to counter sluggish conditions in the world's second biggest economy.\n\nAn index based on an official survey of factory purchasing managers declined to 49.0 in February from 49.4 in January in the seventh straight month of contraction. The index has not been at a lower level in seven years; it fell to 45.3 in Jan. 2009 as the global financial crisis was unfolding.\n\nThe economy's road to stability remains bumpy, said He Fan, Caijing magazine's chief economist, said of the manufacturing report Tuesday. The government needs to press ahead with reforms, while adopting moderate stimulus policies and strengthening support of the economy in other ways to prevent it from falling off a cliff.\n\nThe reading by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing is based on a 100-point scale with the 50 mark dividing expansion from contraction.\n\nSeparately, a private survey also showed further weakening in manufacturing.\n\nThe Caixin/Markit purchasing managers' index slipped to a five-month low of 48.0 last month from 48.4 the previous month.\n\nThe index readings for all key categories including output, new orders and employment signaled that conditions worsened, in line with signs that the economy's road to stability remains bumpy, said He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group. He said the government faces more pressure to continue rolling out moderate stimulus policies to prevent growth from slowing too sharply.\n\nThe latest such move came Monday night when the central bank freed up more money for lending by cutting the amount banks need to hold in reserve.\n\nCaixin's survey mostly covers smaller, private enterprises while the federation report focuses on larger, state-owned companies.\n\nEconomists cautioned the numbers were distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday, which falls at different times in the first two months of the year. Factories typically stock up on raw materials and scramble to fill orders before shutting for an extended break that began this year in early February.\n\nAttempting to iron out the distortions, ANZ Bank economists Raymond Yeung and Louis Lam noted that the official index's average for January and February together was 49.2, which still indicates contraction.\n\nThere was some better news for China's services sector, with an official survey of non-manufacturing business activity slipping but continuing to grow last month, coming in at 52.7 from 53.5 in January. Services have helped offset manufacturing weakness in China's economy, which last year posted its slowest expansion in a quarter century as growth ebbed to 6.9 percent.\n\nChina's economic slowdown comes as policymakers in Beijing try to wean the economy off a tired model based on manufacturing and investment and refocus it on self-sustaining services and domestic consumption. To spur lending, the government on Monday moved to cut how much capital China's lenders must keep on deposit at the country's central bank.\n\nThe change reduced required reserves by 0.5 percent points effective Tuesday, which will release several hundred billion yuan (tens of billions of dollars) into the market. Chinese trading is heavily influenced by the availability of credit, so an easing can lead to higher prices.\n\nWith respect to the manufacturing side of the Chinese economy, the government is getting serious about slashing excess capacity in a variety of industries, said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst with the Lindsey Group, in a note.\n\nSome forecasters expect China's efforts to loosen monetary conditions to succeed in shoring up growth.\n\nGiven the usual impact of such easing on investment, we don't think growth is set to weaken much further this year as many expect, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist with Capital Economics, in a report. If anything, we still think a small policy driven uptick in growth is the most likely scenario.\n\nBut questions remain about whether China can avoid a hard landing given the massive overcapacity in its industrial base, with many state-run factories around the country sitting idle. Without sufficient domestic demand to fill the vacuum, the government is reportedly planning to lay off 1.8 million coal and steel workers, and perhaps millions more over the next few years.
A creative executive's account of being told she could no longer eat alone at the bar of an upscale Manhattan restaurant due to a crackdown on prostitutes is prompting an outcry on Yelp and elsewhere.\n\nIn an essay published Tuesday and entitled The Night I was mistaken for a Call Girl, London resident Clementine Crawford relays how she has for years frequently dined at the bar of a Madison Avenue eatery while in New York on business.\n\nDuring a recent visit, Crawford describes being ushered to a table and told nobody is allowed to eat at the bar anymore. Then, after spotting a man perched at her favorite spot, eating a meal, Crawford inquired further, learning the owner had ordered a crackdown on hookers and he could run his business as he pleased.\n\nAll these years we have been battling for a room of one's own; and, little did we know it, but we are still fighting for a seat at the table (or bar, to be strictly accurate), she wrote.\n\nWhile Crawford did not identify the restaurant, and could not be reached for comment, she told Page Six it was Nello, a pricey Italian restaurant known for being frequented by celebrities including Beyoncé and Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nNello did not respond to an emailed request for comment, and the person who answered the restaurant's phone declined comment.\n\nMultiple reviews on Yelp soon offered comment in the wake of Crawford's story, however.\n\nOne reviewer wrote: If you want pasta with a side of sexism, eat here... Another Yelper expressed hope that Nello would amend its policy, saying: I eat alone at NYC bars all the time, and relish the fact that I've earned the right with my hard work to spoil myself. I can't imagine this happening in any of the places I frequent.\n\nThe restaurant was also called out on Twitter, including calls urging its customers to eat elsewhere.
A week after Iowa's caucus debacle, the nation casts its first votes of the 2020 primary cycle Tuesday in New Hampshire. After months of shopping for the right candidate at town halls and house parties, voters here will weigh in on the crowded Democratic field, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports.\n\nNew Hampshire is celebrating 100 years of holding the first in the nation primary this year, but it's not entirely clear how long the state will be able to hold on to that designation. In recent years, some in the Democratic Party have begun to complain that the state's lack of racial diversity makes it ill-suited to be the first vetter of the presidential candidates.\n\nThe state has already taken some measures to protect its first in the nation status, passing legislation before the 1976 election that would prevent other states from preempting the state's primary election. The presidential primary election shall be held on the second Tuesday in March or on a date selected by the secretary of state which is seven days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election, the law reads.\n\nThe candidate next door\n\nCandidates from next door have historically over-performed in the New Hampshire primary compared with national outcomes, a point Joe Biden brought up on Friday as he tried to downplay expectations for a better performance here after the gut punch he acknowledged getting from his fourth-place finish in Iowa.\n\nWith former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick's late entry into the race, there are three candidates from neighboring states campaigning in New Hampshire for the Democratic nomination. The others are front-runner Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThis year, they may have a slight advantage, with neighboring volunteer reinforcements, New England commonalities and a familiar media market. But that hasn't stopped Pete Buttigieg, of Indiana, and Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota from surging in polls over the past few days.\n\nSince 1952, when New Hampshire's modern primary began, there have been 17 Democratic races. Seven of those included candidates from the Granite State's three neighbors — Massachusetts, Maine or Vermont. In those races, New Hampshire's neighbors have won six times. Additionally, two other times candidates from neighboring states finished in second place.\n\nThe Electorate\n\nNew Hampshire's longtime secretary of state, Bill Gardner, has set his quadrennial 2020 primary turnout prediction at 420,000 voters (292,000 Democratic ballots and 128,000 Republican ballots.) If realized, that would be the most votes cast in a presidential primary featuring an incumbent president.\n\nHowever, on a phone call with reporters Monday, New Hampshire Democratic Chair Ray Buckley said, I don't think anyone is predicting anywhere near the 2008 turnout. I think we will have a terrific turnout. It will certainly be higher than any other state in the entire nominating process. But there's no indication we'll match or be near 2008.\n\nIn New Hampshire, undeclared or independent voters, who make up 42% of the current electorate, may pick up either a Democratic or Republican ballot on primary day. There are more independents this cycle compared to 2016 (38%), the majority coming from the Republican Party.\n\nIn 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary by over 22 points (56,838 votes). Hillary Clinton went on to win New Hampshire against Donald Trump by just 0.3% (less than 2,700 votes.) In New Hampshire alone, over 4,400 wrote in Senator Bernie Sanders' name during the general election.\n\nRead about New Hampshire and the candidates here.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nTOM STEYER\n\nAs 2020 hopefuls swarm New Hampshire ahead of the state's primary contest Tuesday, Democratic candidate Tom Steyer wrapped his eighth visit to South Carolina on Monday, just weeks before the first in the South primary election. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that Steyer was met with cheers and applause upon arrival at his campaign-sponsored block party in Winnsboro, which featured musical performances and food truck vendors—all expenses paid by the campaign.\n\nSteyer, whose South Carolina campaign has continued to grow now totals 102. The hedge fund manager was introduced by South Carolina Representative Annie McDaniel who was a former Cory Booker supporter but has decided to support Steyer in part because of the time he's spent in rural communities throughout the state.\n\nIn a gaggle with press after the event, Steyer answered questions about this decision to bring up race during the Democratic presidential debate Friday. Look, I was frustrated because we had gone through—I don't know how much of the debate but a lot of it, without anyone ever mentioning the word race, said Steyer.\n\nI felt like several times in that debate, we were having policy discussions that are relevant once we've won but we're not dealing with the facts…not talking about race in the United States of America is overlooking a hugely important topic and sweeping it under the rug means you're not dealing with the facts on the ground, he said.\n\nTangee Bryce Jacobs who was one of 256 people who attended the party, is a leader in the Fairfield County community. Mitchell reports that Jacobs was one of a few attendees to participate in a roundtable with Valerie Biden Owens at a restaurant on the block where Steyer's event was held Sunday. When asked which candidates were resonating with voters in her community, she said a lot of voters are still undecided, but that when a candidate shows up for this community, it matters.\n\nThey really need to see the candidates, Bryce Jacobs responded. This is rural America. They've got to see the candidates even if they just come through for 30 minutes.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nIOWA\n\nOne week after Caucus Day, Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) Chair Troy Price updated reporters on recanvassing requests the party received today. Senator Bernie Sanders' and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaigns both submitted recanvassing requests covering 143 precincts. The Sanders campaign requested recanvassing at 28 precincts and the Buttigieg campaign requested 66 precincts along with all of the in-state satellite caucus sites. The party now has 48 hours to respond with any updates. The recanvassing process will involve comparing math worksheets showing how many delegates each candidate won, compared to the numbers reported on the public website.\n\nThe state party says it cannot fix errors on the math sheets during recanvassing. After the recanvassing response, campaigns will have 24 hours to respond with any requests for a recount from precincts that were recanvassed. That will involve opening presidential preference cards that people filled out to show which candidates they supported.\n\nPrice today said that the IDP believes it cannot alter math sheets, even if there are clear errors, because they are the official record of what happened. That means only errors showing differences between the math sheets and what's on the party's site publicly can be adjusted during recanvassing.\n\nThese sheets are signed not only by the precinct chair and the precinct secretary, they're also signed by campaign representatives, Price said. And so, for us they are the official record of what took place in the room. And we do not believe that we should be altering what is the official record of what happened in the room.\n\nGary Dickey, an attorney who served as former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack's General Counsel, said the party's view that it can't correct obvious errors is legally indefensible. Dickey told CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, The sections of the Iowa Code to which the party cites do not prevent it from making corrections…The First Amendment right to freedom of association allows political parties to make their own rules for choosing their presidential nominees. No court is going to block the party's decision to correct mathematical and transposition errors.\n\nNEVADA\n\nAfter frustrations erupted on Twitter over the Nevada State Democratic Party's hiring of a former staffer of Pete Buttigieg's campaign, both the state party and the Bernie Sanders campaign sought Sunday to cool online tempers.\n\nNo staffer working at the Nevada Democratic State Party is affiliated with any campaign, and no one person has the ability to affect results, party spokeswoman Molly Forgey said in a statement to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, pointing out former Harris, Sanders, and Warren staffers also now work for the party.\n\nEveryone working at NV Dems now has the same job: executing the most transparent, accessible, and expansive caucus yet, added Forgey. In the wake of the delayed and now-questioned results from Iowa, Democrats in Nevada have raced to shore up their own contest with an iPad-based caucus tool previewed over the weekend at volunteer summits ahead of early voting this week. Though the party has refused to disclose the developer behind its new tool or publicly outline details of its process for caucus chairs to report results, multiple Democrats in the state tell CBS News they believe the party will rely in part on Google's Forms and Sheets apps to relay early vote information.
Ed Privé cannot vote for Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard in New Hampshire's primary on February 11th. A registered Republican, the 69-year-old may only vote for candidates belonging to the GOP in a contest President Trump is all but certain to win. But that did not stop him from attending one of the Hawaii congresswoman's town halls in December.\n\nHonestly, I disagreed with Trump, but I voted for him, Privé said. I'm here now because she makes sense. The rest of them don't.\n\nPrivé, a Marine Corps veteran, voted twice for President Obama before casting his ballot for Mr. Trump in 2016. He's the kind of swing-voter that Democrats are desperate to win back in November. And he says Gabbard is just the kind of candidate who could make that happen.\n\nLingering on the edge of the photo line, Privé exhaled. She doesn't want to give away the farm, but she wants to help people.\n\nAnd if she were to be the nominee of the Democratic Party, I would have a very difficult time voting for Trump, Privé added.\n\nTulsi Gabbard with Ed Privé in Northfield, NH Nicole Sganga\n\nGabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in New Hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. Over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in February. And while other candidates focus on next week's Iowa caucuses, Gabbard has all but moved to New Hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other Democratic candidate across December and January.\n\nGabbard, a 38-year-old Iraqi War veteran who backed Bernie Sanders in the last Democratic primary, fuses progressive policy stances with the kind of patriotic displays sometimes more associated with Republican campaigns. Before she makes her hour-long pitch to voters at rallies throughout New Hampshire, her audiences are often instructed to stand for the pledge of allegiance or bow their heads for a moment of silence.\n\nA recent analysis by the New York Times reveals just one-fifth of Obama-Trump voters returned to the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted Republican.\n\nToby McIntire, a former Army captain, says she first became aware of Gabbard after spotting one of her huge billboards off of Interstate 95. Before long, McIntire and her wife Katie Duffey were hosting a house party for Gabbard to introduce the congresswoman to their friends and neighbors.\n\nTulsi Gabbard speaks at a rally in Merrimack, NH. Nicole Sganga\n\nMcIntire, however, is a Republican who says she will vote for Mr. Trump if Gabbard isn't the Democratic nominee. I'm not going to lie. His messaging of 'Make America Great Again' and defense of the country, from a military perspective, resonated with me.\n\nThat is the double-bind of Gabbard's candidacy. She appeals to some independent voters Democrats are anxious to win in the general election, but not many party stalwarts. In a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll released earlier this month, Gabbard earned 5% support among likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters. But among independents, Gabbard is the first choice for a whopping 21%.\n\nRoughly half of the New Hampshire towns Gabbard has visited backed Mr. Trump in 2016. Her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and former Democratic Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich. But she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream Democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.\n\nWhile her chances of winning the primary are extraordinarily slim, national Democrats are worried that Gabbard could still find a way of spoiling their chances of beating Mr. Trump. Some have even gone so far as to insinuate the combat veteran, who infamously met with Syrian dictator Bashir al-Assad in 2017, might be the agent of a foreign power.\n\nTulsi Gabbard speaks during a panel with former Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich and Stephen Kinzer, and moderated by Lawrence Lessig in Concord, NH. Nicole Sganga\n\nIn an apparent reference to Gabbard, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton suggested late last year that the Russian government is grooming a candidate for a third-party run to disrupt the 2020 election. Gabbard is now suing Clinton over the remark for a lump sum of $50 million.\n\nFor her part, Gabbard, who is not running for re-election to the House, has repeatedly insisted that she will not run as an independent or third-party candidate in the general election. But if Gabbard were to change her mind, Steve Bannon told CBS News, her appeal to Republicans and Republican-leaning voters is so intense it might actually help Democrats reclaim the White House.\n\n[S]he's pulling from Trump voters. It could make it even tougher for Trump to win, particularly in states like Michigan and New Hampshire, Bannon told CBS News.\n\nClinton doesn't get it — she thinks she's a Russian asset or something of a spoiler for the Democrats. As usual, Clinton misses the point. It shows you how out of touch she is. These are Trump voters going to see her. They're not democratic voters. Or they're Democrats who voted for Trump. Or independents who voted for Trump.\n\nBannon, who calls Gabbard beyond a rock star and a real populist-nationalist, invited the congresswoman to meet with Trump officials after the 2016 election. She's one of the first people we got up there. I was just blown away by her level of sophistication on national security and her understanding of 'America First,' Bannon said.\n\nDennis Kucinich, who ran for the presidency twice as a stalwart progressive, is one of Gabbard's left-leaning supporters. Tulsi is one of the few individuals who provides a categorical challenge to U.S. foreign policy...She can appeal to both libertarians and Republicans. That's a winning approach, he told CBS News.\n\nFirst, however, Gabbard needs to find a way to win over Democrats. The Hawaii lawmaker has not qualified for the debate stage in months, and while other candidates' boast hundreds of staffers and dozens of offices in key early states, Gabbard employs a team of just over a dozen paid employees nationwide, according to FEC filings. The campaign opened up their very first field office earlier this month in downtown Manchester, operated by a round of 50 full-time volunteers in New Hampshire.\n\nTo vote or not to vote for Gabbard is not a question for Republican Brian Lindsay of Hudson, NH. The lifelong Republican committed to casting his ballot for Trump in November, but agreed to tag along with his teenage girls to the candidate's town hall.\n\nLindsay liked what he saw. Hands down, she should be the democratic nominee. I think the others are a bunch of crackpots, he volunteered. She's not really one of them. A little less abrasive.\n\nHe paused. Much less abrasive.
As part of an 11th hour blitz of regulations, the outgoing Trump administration has finalized several asylum restrictions that are set to take effect shortly before or after President-elect Joe Biden takes the oath of office in nine days.\n\nThe rules represent President Trump's last major effort to reshape the U.S. asylum system, which his administration has argued is abused by economic migrants. One set of rules, which was slated to take effect Monday until a federal court blocked it last week, would erect restrictions throughout the asylum process and generally disqualify victims of gender-based persecution, domestic abuse and gang violence from U.S. refuge.\n\nAnother rule set to take effect a day before Inauguration Day would revive a policy struck down in court last summer that bars non-Mexican migrants, including unaccompanied children, from applying for U.S. asylum at the southern border.\n\nA third regulation, set to take effect two days after Mr. Biden is sworn in, would allow officials to render asylum-seekers ineligible for U.S. protection if they are determined to exhibit symptoms of a contagious disease, like COVID-19, or if they have hailed from or traveled through countries where a disease is prevalent or epidemic.\n\nThese rules, if they are actually implemented, will have a devastating effect on asylum-seekers and lead the United States to turn away people seeking refuge back to the very countries that they have fled, Eleanor Acer, the director of the refugee protection program for the group Human Rights First, told CBS News.\n\nMichael Knowles, the president of AFGE Local 1924, a union representing thousands of U.S. immigration adjudicators and asylum officers, called the rules a trio of cruel and inhuman policies.\n\nA migrant boy walks amid tents at a migrant shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, on December 17, 2020. GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nU.S. asylum law, largely based on international refugee treaties brokered after World War II, is designed to offer protection to immigrants on American soil who have been persecuted, or fear being persecuted, in their home countries because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group.\n\nLast month, U.S. asylum officers were informed of the rules' implementation dates and told they would receive training and guidance, according to three internal emails reviewed by CBS News. But two U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officers said no training or guidance has been forthcoming.\n\nThe officers did receive a notice from Andrew Davidson, the chief of the asylum division at USCIS, on Saturday informing them that the rules set to take effect Monday had been blocked by a federal judge and that training for them would be postponed until further notice. USCIS spokesperson Joe Sowers said asylum officers will be trained before they address any cases impacted by the new regulations.\n\nThe rules finalized at the tail end of Mr. Trump's presidency would add additional layers of restrictions to a network of policies that have severely narrowed asylum eligibility and allowed U.S. border officials to rapidly expel people who ask for humanitarian refuge at the southern border.\n\nMr. Biden's advisers have said they plan to gradually undo many of the Trump administration's border policies, including a program that led to the return of 70,000 non-Mexican asylum-seekers to Mexico. But the president-elect and his aides have cautioned that the policy reversals will take time amid the pandemic. He has also yet to say whether he will rescind the asylum limits unveiled towards the end of Mr. Trump's tenure.\n\nThe asylum ban on public health grounds set to take effect January 22 could be suspended by a memo that Mr. Biden's advisers said will be issued on Inauguration Day to halt or delay Trump-era rules that have yet to take effect. The other rules, however, would have to be reversed through the regulatory process, settlements in federal court or by Congress voting, with Mr. Biden's consent, to invoke the little-known Congressional Review Act.\n\nThere's also the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) order that the Trump administration has been using to expel migrants without an asylum interview or court hearing. Mr. Trump's aides have said the policy has helped contain the coronavirus, but some CDC experts opposed the White House's efforts to implement it last spring, as they believed there was no public health basis for such a broad measure.\n\nLee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who has filed lawsuits against many of Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including the CDC order, urged Mr. Biden to take swift action once in office.\n\nThe Biden administration must eliminate the Title 42 policy that was conceived of and pushed by the Trump White House over the apparent strong objection of CDC, Gelernt told CBS News, using the government name for the border expulsions.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr. Biden's transition, which has not committed to ending the border expulsions policy, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLast month, Mr. Biden's immigration advisers vowed to create a fair and humane system at the U.S.-Mexico border by accepting asylum requests at ports of entry, dispatching funds to migrant shelters, working with nonprofits to identify the most vulnerable migrants, whose cases would be prioritized, and testing asylum-seekers for the coronavirus before allowing them to enter the U.S.\n\nOvercoming the challenges at the border is going to take time but the president-elect is committed to moving forward as quickly as possible, a Biden transition official said.\n\nThe transition officials also said the incoming administration would assign asylum officers to review the cases of migrants who ask for protection along the U.S.-Mexico border in order to ease some of the burden on the backlog-ridden immigration courts.\n\nA U.S. asylum officer who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press said the Biden administration would need to hire more asylum officers to accomplish this objective. He said migrants should have access to lawyers and not be required to wait inside jail-like detention centers while their cases are reviewed, suggesting that complexes where they have freedom of movement may be a more humane alternative.\n\nBoosting the morale among the asylum corps should also be a priority for the incoming administration, the officer said, echoing concerns raised by other USCIS employees who believe Mr. Trump's asylum restrictions run contrary to international refugee law and America's image as a safe haven for the world's persecuted.\n\nWe now need to emphasize our humanitarian mission, the asylum officer said. We can never be used again as bricks in the wall, as a deterrent.
It is unknown how many children have been separated from their families by immigration authorities, but the total could be thousands more than the government has previously acknowledged, according to a report released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General.\n\nHHS started formally tracking separated migrant children following a June 2018 court order, which was issued after the Justice Department initiated a zero tolerance policy in April last year that led to a jump in the number of separated children. HHS said that following the order, it identified 2,737 children in its care who were separated from their parents.\n\nBut the inspector general's office determined that an uptick in separations began long before HHS starting tracking separations — and long before the zero tolerance policy was announced by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nIn late 2016, .3 percent of (HHS) intake were noted as separated children. By summer of 2017, a year prior to the court order, that had spiked to 3.6 percent of their intakes, said Ann Maxwell, assistant inspector general for Evaluation and Inspections, on a call with members of the media Thursday.\n\nMaxwell said it's unclear how many children were separated from their families in the year and a half before the court order, because the government was not required to track separations until the June court ruling.\n\nThe point was highlighted as a key takeaway in the report Thursday from the inspector general's office.\n\nThe total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown. ... However, thousands of children may have been separated during an influx that began in 2017, before the accounting required by the Court, and HHS has faced challenges in identifying separated children, the office said.\n\nAs of December 2018, nearly all of the children identified following the June court order as being separated from their parents had been reunited with parents or released to a sponsor, according to the report. But Maxwell said there's no telling where previous separated children ended up.\n\nWe don't have any data on how those children were released, Maxwell said.\n\nAfter Yordy Pablo, now 16, from Guatemala, and his younger brother were separated from their mother at the border last summer, the children were sent to New York City.\n\nFor Pablo and his brother, The Door, a nonprofit youth development organization that provides free legal immigration assistance to teens and young adults, stepped in and is fighting for the boys to stay safely in the U.S. Pablo's attorney at The Door is helping him apply for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status — a form of humanitarian relief available to young, vulnerable immigrants.\n\nAs his case works its way through the immigration system, Yordy has become conversant in English and is thriving in his classes. He hopes to graduate from high school, attend college and become a lawyer.\n\nThe conclusions were made following a months-long analysis of agency data and interviews with staff that included senior HHS leadership, according to the report.\n\nA spokeswoman for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) criticized the report in an emailed statement.\n\nFor the HHS OIG to claim it was not known that as a result of DHS actively enforced this policy in the same manner for more than a decade children were placed in HHS custody brings casts doubt on the HHS OIG's credibility on this topic, said DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman.\n\nIn a follow-up email to CBS News, she said the office failed to provide evidence for its conclusion that thousands may have been separated but not tracked, and questioned how it arrived at that figure.\n\nLee Gelernt, lead attorney and deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, which led a lawsuit about separated children, said in a statement, We will be back in court over this latest revelation.\n\nThis policy was a cruel disaster from the start. This report reaffirms that the government never had a clear picture of how many children it ripped from their parents, Gelernt said.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, HHS pointed to its response to the inspector general's findings which was included in the report. The response notes that processes for identifying and tracking newly separated children 'are effective and continuing to improve.\n\nBut Christi Grimm, the Inspector General Chief of Staff, said Thursday it's too soon to tell if the systems for tracking children have improved. The jury is still out on that, Grimm said.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was confident that U.S.-North Korea summit is still scheduled for June 12 despite the president casting doubt on the date on Tuesday. He testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on strengthening U.S. diplomacy, but was questions focused primarily on the administration's work on achieving denuclearization in the Korean peninsula as well as next steps for the U.S. after formally withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn prepared remarks, Pompeo cited the administration's maximum pressure campaign of diplomatic and economic sanctions as laying the groundwork for the June 12th summit. He vowed, however, that the U.S. posture towards North Korea will not change until we see credible steps taken toward the complete, verifiable, and irreversible de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\n\nWe are clear-eyed about the regime's history. It's time to solve this once and for all. A bad deal is not an option. The American people are counting on us to get this right. If the right deal is not on the table, we will respectfully walk away, Pompeo added.\n\nHis comments come as Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday, We will know next week about Singapore.\n\nHighlights from the hearing:\n\nNorth Korea\n\nPompeo told House members that the U.S.-North Korea summit is still scheduled for June 12 despite the president casting doubt on the date on Tuesday. We have an opportunity. Our eyes are wide open to history but we are hopeful, Pompeo said. He added that the final decision on if the summit indeed takes place will be up to Kim Jong Un. He asked for the meeting, President Trump agreed, said Pompeo. He aded that he was very hopeful that meeting will take place.\n\nPompeo was confident that we have the timing and the leaders right for this meeting to be historically successful.\n\nThe secretary says so far, U.S. demand have been unambiguous and maintains that the administration has made zero concessions to Kim. Pompeo reiterated that in his talks with the dictator so far, Kim made clear that it was important to him that when the time came, he would receive economic assistance in the form of private sector business and American know-how. Pompeo added that Kim wanted security assurances from the world.\n\nAs for details on the summit's framework and participants, Pompeo was tight-lipped. He said Mr. Trump was in charge of the negotiations but the team would be led up by himself. The secretary told lawmakers that Kim and the North Korean regime has viewed the use and development of nuclear weapons as their security blanket.\n\nWe have this chance to stand that on its head, said Pompeo, saying that the U.S. aims to communicate that nuclear weapons present the greatest risk to the regime and the people of North Korea.\n\nRussian interference\n\nPompeo said there is a great deal more work do with regards to safeguarding the U.S. election process but said that he's greatly proud of the work the this administration has done to counter Russia. He said that the Trump administration has been lightyears better than the previous administration but noted the U.S. has not been able to achieve effective deterrence to prevent future attacks.\n\nWe will not tolerate Russian interference in the 2018 elections, he told lawmakers. We will take appropriate countermeasures to continued Russian efforts.\n\nChina health concerns\n\nAmid reports that the State Department has urged U.S. citizens in China to report any symptoms or medical problems they notice while in the country, Pompeo told lawmakers that the medical indications are very similar—and entirely consistent with—the medical indications that've taken place to Americans working in Cuba. Multiple U.S. and Canadian nationals suffered from what the U.S. government called health attacks in Havana.\n\nIn Guangzhou, employees have reportedly experienced subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.\n\nWe have medical teams that are moving to be on the ground there, Pompeo added.\n\nBenghazi/Diplomatic Security\n\nDuring a particularly contentious exchange with Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-New York, Pompeo was adamant that diplomatic security would not be impacted by the amount of dollars spent by State. Meeks reminded Pompeo of a heated exchange he engaged in with previous Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her testimony in the aftermath of the attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, September 2012.\n\nUnder the Obama Administration, over $3 billion went to diplomatic security, but once President Trump came in, I see it went to down $2.1 billion...and down to $1.6 billion, Rep. Meeks says. So where is the concern now about diplomatic security? he asks Pompeo pic.twitter.com/8u0ZdwaiDj — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 23, 2018\n\nUnder the Obama Administration, over $3 billion went to diplomatic security, but once President Trump came in, I see it went to down $2.1 billion...and down to $1.6 billion, Rep. Meeks said So where is the concern now about diplomatic security? he asked Pompeo\n\nI take a backseat to no one with respect to caring about protecting the people, Pompeo relied. Rep Meeks then reorted, Nor did Hillary Clinton take a back seat to no one.\n\nIran\n\nIn opening remarks, Pompeo reiterated details of the administration's exit plan from the Iran nuclear deal which he unveiled earlier this week.\n\nWe will apply unprecedented financial pressure, coordinate with our DOD colleagues on deterrence efforts, support the Iranian people, and hold out the prospect of a new deal for Iran – it simply needs to change its behavior. We seek to work with as many partners, friends, and allies as possible to achieve the common objective of stopping all of Iran's nuclear and non-nuclear threats, said Pompeo.\n\nHe told lawmakers that the demands outlined in his plan were were not fantasy, and that he's just asking Iran to behave like a normal country. The secretary added that State will come back to Congress to seek further authority in the administration's plan.
U.S. allies relieved, but wary as Biden takes over\n\nU.S. allies relieved, but wary as Biden takes over\n\nLondon — Donald Trump's administration was not a conventional one in the view of many U.S. allies and some of the international reaction on Inauguration Day to the change in Washington didn't follow diplomatic norms.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he was, greatly relieved that Joe Biden will be inaugurated as president and move in the White House.\n\nAfter 4 long years, Europe has a friend in America, said Ursula Von der Leyen, president of the European Union's governing body.\n\nIran had a different take. President Hassan Rouhani, whose country was hit by round after round of damaging economic sanctions under Mr. Trump, said: A tyrant's era came to an end today.\n\nIn Moscow, Vladimir Putin's spokesman insisted that, nothing will change for Russia.\n\nPerhaps the most candid comment came from Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the government in Scotland, who said she was, very happy to say 'cheerio,' to Donald Trump, adding: Don't haste ye back.\n\nThere had been suggestions that Mr. Trump might take post-presidential refuge at one of his golf clubs in Scotland. Such a visit was discouraged by Sturgeon herself, and not just on coronavirus grounds.\n\nBut, much as a change in administration has been anticipated among America's allies and adversaries, no magic switch will be thrown that changes all the problems that have existed under — and in many cases been exacerbated by — the outgoing U.S. president.\n\nThere is an understanding in Europe and elsewhere that there won't be a complete reversal of course in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nYes, President Biden said the U.S. will re-join the Paris Climate Accords, but what does that mean? Paris was a declaration of intent, and the world will be waiting to see what specific cuts in greenhouse gas emissions the Biden administration will actually commit to.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Biden's team has said they'll bring the U.S. back into the Iran nuclear deal, if Tehran comes back into compliance. But what price might Tehran demand to cut back its refinement of nuclear fuel? What expansion of that deal to curtail Iran's disruptive non-nuclear activities, including the state sponsoring of terrorism, might the new administration insist on?\n\nEuropean allies certainly expect the Biden administration to reengage, to take a more cooperative approach to solving the world's biggest problems. The incoming team has clearly hinted at intentions to do just that.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) receives U.S. Vice President Joe Biden at the Federal Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, in a February 1, 2013 file photo. Maurizio Gambarini/picture alliance/Getty\n\nBut those allies know not every element of Mr. Trump's foreign policy will be rolled back.\n\nAnthony Blinken, Mr. Biden's pick for Secretary of State, has confirmed, for instance, that the U.S. Embassy so controversially moved by the Trump administration to Jerusalem in 2017, is staying put. Some of America's closest European allies were quick to condemn that move.\n\nOverall, America's allies are approaching the new White House with optimism, but it is optimism tempered by a wariness learned over the past four years.\n\nThey know that Trumpism, and the 74 million Americans who voted for the last president, represent a real thing, and one that isn't simply going to disappear after Wednesday's swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol.\n\nBehind every comment welcoming America back into the fold on Wednesday was an unspoken worry that many in the U.S. have demonstrated a happy willingness to sit outside of that fold.\n\nThe hope is that the Biden presidency will re-establish the post-World War II equilibrium and commonality of purpose that bound the United States to its allies. But there are no more illusions that the bond is unbreakable.
Amid a post-holiday wave of returns of gifts and other items purchased online, retailers are telling some customers to keep the unwanted goods while still giving back their money.\n\nAmazon has long offered shoppers refunds on inexpensive or bulky items, like basic yoga mats and dog food, without requiring that they physically return the goods. Customers report getting refunds on all manner of low-cost items, such as napkin rings, baby bottle nipples, clocks and paperback books while still being allowed to keep the goods.\n\nOther retailers are following suit, weighing the cost of processing customer returns against items' resale value. Often, it doesn't make financial sense to ask customers to send their purchases back.\n\nJust keep it\n\nRetailers are reluctant to disclose their exact rules or indicate precisely what share of return-less refunds they issue so these policies aren't abused.\n\nBut Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, uses a general formula to decide whether to allow a shopper who wants to return a product to keep it while still getting a refund, a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. It considers a customer's purchase history, the value of the items being returned and the cost of processing the return.\n\nWalmart doesn't disclose its exact keep it threshold, but the spokesperson said the policy is designed to reduce the costs and environmental toll associated with returns as well as to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nA spokesperson for Target also said it occasionally encourages customers to keep or donate items they don't want instead of sending them back. But the policy applies only in a very small number of cases when we determine it's easier, the spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nMore returns than ever\n\nA growing number of retailers are reconsidering their returns policies and procedures amid a boom in online shopping during the pandemic. Online returns are expected to reach a record $70.5 billion for the holiday season just completed, a 73% increase from the previous five-year holiday average, according to an estimate from CBRE, a commercial real estate and investment firm, and Optoro, a returns technology company.\n\nIndeed, returns are a financial strain for many retailers, costing them on average nearly 60% of the item's original sales price, according to the report.\n\nThree types of expenses contribute to the cost of processing a return, according to Amit Sharma, founder and CEO of Narvar, which processes online returns for retailers. They include shipping and transportation fees, warehousing costs and customer-service hours.\n\nA retailer has to get the item back, so there is a shipping fee. When it hits the warehouse someone has to inspect the item, and customer-service agents have to field calls around, 'Where is my refund, when will I get my money back?' Sharma said.\n\nUnwanted probiotics and pet food\n\nA number of Amazon customers have said they were pleased when the company told them to keep items they didn't want or no longer needed because they had arrived late.\n\nDana Rich, a Westchester, New York, mother of two, said she tried to return probiotics for her baby she ordered on the site that were so delayed that she instead purchased the supplements at another retailer's store. Amazon told her she didn't have to send the product back — and still issued her a refund, she said.\n\nI've had other items arrive late that weren't pricey, and therefore I assume it wasn't worth it for them to pay for return shipping, Rich said.\n\nAmazon didn't immediately reply to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.\n\nAndrew Schrage, founder of personal finance site MoneyCrashers, described a similar experience shopping at the online retail giant. Amazon recently told him to keep 25 pounds of dog food he had shipped to his home in Los Angeles and then tried to return. It also refunded the $22.68 purchase.\n\nIt makes me more confident in future purchases that I can return them if needed, or if there is an issue, it will be resolved in a customer-friendly manner, Schrage said.
The world is watching closely as China begins investing billions of dollars into a hyper-ambitious New Silk Road aimed at broadening the country's financial scope and enhancing global trade. The plan is called One Belt, One Road and is essentially a network of land and maritime routes to improve the flow of goods and access to Central Asia, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBut many people living in the region fear that China is also attempting to gain overwhelmingly political power that could threaten their current way of life.\n\nBeijing intends to connect more than 60 countries, with a collective population of 4.4 billion people -- more than half of the world. It's expected to spend close to a trillion dollars on the initiative, primarily focused on major infrastructure development projects including thousands of miles of railroad tracks to create routes from China all the way to Western Europe.\n\nPhotojournalist Davide Monteleone recently produced an essay for the New Yorker in which he met with locals where the routes are being developed. It's very complicated to understand how does this actually affect people's lives in the region -- in China, in Khazakstan, Monteleone said in an interview with CBSN. Regular people don't really understand what it is. They aren't very interested in what's going to happen on a global, geopolitical level. They are more concerned about how it's going to affect their everyday life.\n\nBut, Monteleone said, geopolitics plays a huge role in why China is pushing the project. This is the thing: It looks like an economical initiative, but in fact it is probably more of a foreign policy initiative. This is leverage China will have on countries once they start economic relations.\n\nChinese officials insist the initiative is purely commercial, but foreign diplomats and political analysts also see an effort by the Communist Beijing government to promote its ambitions to rewrite global rules on trade and security and reduce the U.S. presence in Asia.\n\nDiplomats have expressed concern that Beijing is promoting a vision of trading networks centered on great powers such as China, which would erode the rules-based system under the World Trade Organization in which all competitors are treated equally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's plan to focus on domestic issues and downplay foreign affairs has given Beijing an opening to try to play a bigger leadership role in trade, climate and other global issues.\n\nChina is the biggest trading partner for all of its Asian neighbors and a growing investor. But some Asian governments are uneasy about Beijing's strategic ambitions, especially after it built artificial islands and military bases in the South China Sea to enforce its claim to most of the region.\n\nMr. Trump's decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed regional trade pact, has left Asian governments that want to use ties with Washington to offset China's growing dominance off balance.\n\nThey have the strongest leader in Xi Jinping they've had at least since Mao [Zedong], Eurasia Group president and CBS Contributor Ian Bremmer said in an interview with CBS This Morning last week. And because the United States is America first, it's transactional. It's unilateral. It's undermining a lot of alliances. You put those things together, and suddenly you actually have a China that is willing to engage in what is increasingly a geopolitical vacuum.\n\nBremmer added: In other words, this is the first time we've ever seen as U.S. leadership erodes, no one else has been standing up. Now the leader of China is saying we're prepared to stand up whether it's on climate or the global economy, you know, regional security, you name it -- that's a big change for the world.
CUPERTINO, California -- Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's opposition to the FBI's iPhone-hacking plan at its annual shareholder meeting, one day after the tech giant formally challenged a court order to help the FBI unlock an encrypted iPhone used by a murderous extremist in San Bernardino, California.\n\nWe do these because these are the right things to do, Cook said in a brief reference to the company's privacy stance in the case.\n\nMajor tech companies are also rallying to Apple's cause, and now plan a joint friend of the court brief on its behalf. Facebook said it will join with Google, Twitter and Microsoft on a joint court filing. A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed that plan, but said that different companies and trade associations will likely file multiple briefs.\n\nFederal officials have said they're only asking for narrow assistance in bypassing some of the phone's security features. But Apple contends the order would force it to write a software program that would make other iPhones vulnerable to hacking by authorities or criminals in the future.\n\nApple filed court papers on Thursday that asked U.S. Magistrate Sheri Pym to reverse her order on the grounds that it over-reached the government's legal authority by forcing the company to weaken the security of its own products. The company accused the government of seeking dangerous power through the courts and of trampling on its constitutional rights.\n\nThe dispute raises broad issues of legal and social policy, with at least one poll showing 51 percent of Americans think Apple should cooperate by helping the government unlock the iPhone.\n\nBut it's unclear how the controversy might affect Apple's business. Analysts at Piper Jaffray said a survey they commissioned last week found the controversy wasn't hurting the way most Americans think about Apple or its products.\n\nAt least one shareholder at Friday's meeting voiced support for the company's stance.\n\nApple is 100 percent correct in not providing or doing research to create software to break into it, said Tom Rapko, an Apple investor from Santa Barbara, California, as he waited in line to enter the auditorium at Apple's headquarters. I think if you give the government an inch, they'll take a yard.\n\nThe company also received support from the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a representative from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet rights groups.\n\nWe applaud your leadership, Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader and former adviser to Martin Luther King Jr., told Cook. I recall the FBI wiretapping Dr. King in the civil rights movement, he added. We cannot go down this path again. Some of us do remember the days of (former FBI director J. Edgar) Hoover and McCarthy and Nixon and enemies lists.\n\nApple's share price has seen little change since the issue erupted in the news last week. Overall, though, the company's stock has declined in recent months over worries that iPhone sales were slowing around the world.\n\nA hearing on the iPhone legal dispute is scheduled for next month.
For weeks, President Trump cried foul, repeating unverified claims that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump Tower to spy on him, accusations that remain unsubstantiated.\n\nBut Mr. Trump, with the power of the presidency and executive branch as a whole at his fingertips, has said little of how he intends to approach the authority he now wields over the country's surveillance policies. As developing policing technologies continue to outpace laws restricting their use, and as Mr. Trump and top members of his administration like Attorney General Jeff Sessions take a hard line against illegal immigration, terrorism and crime, experts in constitutional law and civil liberties fear the lack of an accompanying conversation on privacy protections could contribute to the erosion of Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nI think we will see a push from the Trump administration to expand surveillance powers, and that of course could directly implicate Fourth Amendment protections, said Christopher Slobogin, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School who has studied and written on Fourth Amendment, privacy and surveillance issues for years.\n\nAnd they're going to push I think also for greater militarization of the police, which could affect Fourth Amendment issues, Slobogin added.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is currently taking the Department of Justice to court to determine when the government notifies people they are under surveillance.\n\nIn May 2015, before announcing his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump said he supported legislation allowing the National Security Agency (NSA) to hold bulk metadata, and later in the year reiterated he would tend to err on the side of security. On the campaign trail, and after taking office, Mr. Trump has emphasized the importance of bulking up police forces and eradicating terrorism. Sessions fought against reforms of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 2012, and against limits on the NSA's spying powers.\n\nIt's not as though this didn't exist before Trump, because it's all in this terrorism -- war on terrorism stuff, said Robert Bloom, a professor at Boston College Law School who focuses on criminal procedure and civil rights law. We've loosened up on protections of individuals. But now you've really got an abusive executive. A president and attorney general who don't really give two whits about individual protection and about the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe White House and Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nGuaranteeing Fourth Amendment rights has become increasingly complicated in the digital age. One longstanding legal theory dating to the 1970s, known as the Third Party Doctrine, asserts that once a person gives personal information to a third party, for instance, to a cell service provider, he or she loses the expectation of privacy, and the information can be given to other entities without the person's explicit permission -- without violating the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Obama administration placed some limitations on surveillance technology, but mostly through policy. The Obama administration required the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to obtain warrants for the use of their 400 Stingrays or cell site simulators, devices that mimic cellphone towers, so all phones within a range connect to it instead of their cellphone provider's nearest tower, and the devices collect cellphone data. The IRS also acquired the technology in recent years.\n\nBut that's the kind of thing that Jeff Sessions could do away with with the stroke of a pen, said Alvaro Bedoya, founding executive director for the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies say Stingray technology helps them catch suspected criminals -- and it does. But privacy advocates fear the technology's ability to collect nearby cellphone owners' data without their permission or knowledge -- and often, without a warrant -- compromises Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nFederal authorities have said the devices they use are not configured to collect the content of communications, but the capabilities of the technology aren't clear. That's partly because federal authorities have shrouded cell site simulators in mystery, sometimes dropping cases against criminal suspects rather than reveal their policing methods and agreements with private cell site simulator companies that swear the government to product secrecy in contracts.\n\nThe ability to put the warrant requirement through the shredder at any moment is why policy is an insufficient safeguard, said Matthew Feeney, policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nWe're relying heavily on government policy rather than law, and that I think is a problem, Feeney said.\n\nMany states also use automatic license plate readers, technology that can scan hundreds of plates per minute. In the 2008 election cycle, Virginia State Police used automatic license plate readers on attendees' cars at political rallies for Barack Obama and Sarah Palin, the ACLU revealed. Alone, license plates may not amount to much information, but police have the ability to check those plates against other records, and -- over time -- can observe patterns about a driver's habits, the ACLU argued.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government is quietly ramping up its surveillance approach at airports, using technology that was, in most cases developed for the battlefield, Bedoya said.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection began testing facial recognition software -- called Biometric Exit -- at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., in 2015, and pilot programs are expanding to other large airports. The software -- the concept of which was first required by Bill Clinton-era legislation in 1996 -- is intended to check visa holders entering or leaving the country through facial matching systems. That scan can be checked against a person's passport. As Mr. Trump looks to toughen immigration policies, it's a timely tool.\n\nBut Bedoya worries the technology's use won't stop there.\n\nThere aren't many people talking about biometric exit, when it might fundamentally change the way we travel, Bedoya said.\n\nIt's unlikely the technology will only be used on foreign nationals, Bedoya said. Many airports mix international and domestic terminals, and it's more practical and realistic to use the technology at the main Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint, Bedoya said.\n\nThat means you have a flow of both domestic and international travelers, Bedoya said.\n\nOnce it's in place, facial recognition software -- like other kinds of policing technology -- can be used to match other federal databases and tell a story.\n\nWe shouldn't forget that all of these tools can be put together, Feeney said.\n\nDrones can be used to mount a license plate reader, Feeney said. Body cam footage could be linked to drone footage.\n\nCongress has made some efforts to strengthen privacy in recent months. In February, the House passed the Email Privacy Act, which would require a warrant for any access to stored digital communications. But the Senate has yet to take any action on it, and threats of terrorism may easily quash any momentum on similar legislation, Slobogin said.\n\nIf we have an event like Manchester in the United States -- or Manchester itself -- that might push Congress in the other direction, Slobogin said.\n\nAbsent much guidance from Congress in the way of laws, the courts are deciding the future of surveillance as it pertains to the Fourth Amendment, Slobogin said.\n\nSome of the lower courts have looked at warrants and searches and things of that nature, but the Supreme Court really hasn't weighed in on those kinds of issues, Bloom said.\n\nSlowly, that's changing, as cases work their way up to the highest court in the land.\n\nThis year, the Supreme Court will decide United States v. Carpenter, on whether the warrantless seizure and search of historical cell phone records revealing location and movements of a person over the course of months is constitutional.\n\nThat is arguably going to be the most significant Fourth Amendment case in decades, Feeney said.\n\nThe Third Party Doctrine theory needs to be grappled with significantly, and could be reviewed in that case, Bloom said.\n\nThe lack of legal protection against an expanding availability of policing technologies may not concern law-abiding citizens, but it should, Feeney said.\n\nAt the moment, we seem to be mostly concerned about radical Islamic terrorism, Feeney said.\n\nMaybe in 15 years it's progressives, or libertarians, pro-life people or pro-choice people, he added.\n\nThis, Feeney said, is the fundamental question people should ask themselves: Would I be happy with the state of the Fourth Amendment if my enemy is in charge?
The FDA is reportedly taking unprecedented action to try and stop the teen vaping epidemic. Under the direction of the Trump administration, it will likely announce a ban on mint, fruit and dessert flavored e-cigarette cartridges as soon as Friday.\n\n\n\nThe ban reportedly will not include the sale of menthol or tobacco flavors.\n\nInsiders told CBS News that President Trump has been hesitant to ban flavored e-cigarettes based on advice that his supporters would react negatively to it. Now anti-vaping activists accuse the administration of siding with e-cigarette companies and the vaping industry.\n\nMatt Myers heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. He says banning flavors is good, but leaving menthol and tobacco vaping products on the market is dangerous.\n\n\n\nThis policy is one that was dictated by the e-cigarette industry, Myers said. Menthol cigarettes are used by more than half of all kids as they start a product.\n\n\n\nHis group says one-third of all e-cigarette users in the U.S. are middle and high school students, and 97% of kids use flavored pods.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump hinted at the ban this week.\n\n\n\nWe'll be taking it off, the flavors for a period of time-- certain flavors, Trump said. We're gonna protect our families, we're gonna protect our children and we're gonna protect the industry.\n\nA few months ago, CBS News spoke to 18-year-old Chance Ammirata. His doctor believes his vaping may have contributed to a lung injury.\n\nI never thought I'd be addicted, Ammirata said. And I'm sure every other teenager or young adult would say the same exact thing.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control counts more than 2,500 cases of people hospitalized with e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury and 55 deaths. The CDC says the chemical vitamin E acetate, found in some vaping products, is closely associated with the deaths and illnesses.\n\nIn August, Tony Dokoupil sat down with then-Juul CEO Kevin Burns, who said the company never intended to target kids to grow the business.\n\nI've said this before, I'm sorry that their kids are using the product, Burns said. We never intended for our product to be used by them.\n\nSome vape shop owners worry a ban will also hurt business. Arizona vape shop co-owner Scout Stubbs says she's already expanding to hemp products to offset a drop in sales.\n\n\n\nIf we just enforce the laws we already have, or maybe beef them up, have some marketing restrictions, there are solutions out there to combat youth usage that don't involve banning adult products, Stubbs said.\n\n\n\nMyers disagrees.\n\n\n\nThis is not an issue about jobs, this is an issue about the health of our nation's children, Myers said.\n\nCBS News reached out to the American Vaping Association for comment on this story but have not heard back. Juul, the market leader, declined to comment.\n\nIn the past, Juul has said none of its products contain vitamin E acetate.
Whole Foods Market is reducing paid breaks from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for many of its more than 90,000 workers, with the policy shift coming as retail and other front-line employees contend with surging COVID-19 cases in their communities.\n\nWorkers at Whole Foods stores in Southern California, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest and the South who'd previously been given 15 minute breaks during their shifts will now get 10 minutes of paid down time instead.\n\nA group of Whole Food employees called Whole Worker Union called out the new rules on social media, saying the time now being allowed for breaks includes coming and returning from the break room.\n\n🚨 Whole Foods just reduced their paid break time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. This includes the time when you are coming and returning from the break room. pic.twitter.com/OszaeiDWtR — Whole Worker Union #BlackLivesMatter (@WholeWorkerWFM) January 10, 2021\n\nWhole Foods' workers in many states get two paid breaks during a typical eight and a half hour shift. They'll now have 10 minutes less to rest each work day.\n\nThe upscale grocery chain and Amazon subsidiary confirmed the new rules, saying the goal is to make break policies uniform for all its employees at 487 stores in 12 regions. Workers previously had differing break times. Now, the same rest- and meal-break rules will apply to all, according to the company.\n\nMost Whole Food workers will benefit from the change, according to the grocery chain.\n\nThis updated policy will provide the vast majority of team members with more break time throughout their work day. It is part of our ongoing work to streamline regional policies and processes in order to create clear and uniform policies for Team Members across all regions, a Whole Foods spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.\n\nThe move comes roughly eight months after Whole Foods cut the extra $2 an hour in hazard pay for employees coming to work during the pandemic. Amazon in June announced $500 bonuses for workers, including at Whole Foods.\n\nGrocery store deaths\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which does not represent Whole Foods workers, on Tuesday said a new surge in grocery COVID outbreaks — specifically in Southern California and the Seattle area — have heightened the risks facing workers.\n\nAmong the UFCW's members, there have been at least 124 grocery worker deaths from COVID-19 and at least 23,100 workers infected or exposed, the union stated in an email.\n\nLike many other companies, Amazon and its subsidiary don't disclose the number of employees who've died or been infected by COVID-19.\n\nOne former employee, Katie Doan, was fired from her job stocking shelves at a Whole Foods in Tustin, California, in late May after leaving work for 45 minutes due to a panic attack. Doan, who'd started tracking cases of COVID at Whole Foods in April, told The Associated Press that she believes her outspokenness played a role, while Whole Foods said Doan's leaving her post was the sole reason for her dismissal.
Doctors, lawyers, asylum-seekers and former officials are urging the Trump administration to release thousands of immigrants from detention to avoid a potentially deadly coronavirus outbreak in scores of facilities across the country.\n\nUnless Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) dramatically reduces the number of immigrants in its custody, experts warn the coronavirus could spread quickly among the roughly 37,000 detainees in the system.\n\nIt's a vulnerable situation, John Sandweg, an acting head of ICE during the Obama administration, told CBS News. You have the exact situation everyone is cautioning against. You have a bunch of people contained in a very small environment.\n\nCan you imagine if you get an outbreak in these detention facilities? It's going to spread like wildfire, Sandweg added.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has upended American life, straining the country's public health institutions and killing more than 180 people in the U.S. As the crisis has grown, ICE has faced intensifying pressure to release immigrants with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, detainees over the age of 60 and those seeking humanitarian protections who don't pose a threat to public safety.\n\nOn Wednesday, the agency announced it would stop arresting most undocumented immigrants in the U.S. who don't pose a threat to the public during the pandemic. The move is a significant shift in enforcement priorities, but doesn't address the growing calls for ICE to release many immigrants.\n\nICE should try to shrink this down to only those individuals to whom they can credibly say pose a threat to public safety, Sandweg said. The overwhelming majority of people in ICE detention don't pose a threat to public safety and are not an unmanageable flight risk.\n\nDetainees waiting to be processed at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in Adelanto, California, on August 28, 2019. Chris Carlson / AP\n\nDr. Amy Cohen, a child physiatrist who specializes in detention conditions of migrant families, said officials need to bring the detention population to the lowest level possible to reduce the risk to detainees, guards and other ICE personnel. An outbreak would be nearly impossible to contain, she said.\n\nOne has to see these detention centers are powder kegs, Cohen told CBS News. They are going to be petri dishes. They are going to be places where this virus is going to thrive and spread and where some people are going to get desperately ill — and some of those people are going to die.\n\nImmigration lawyers have been scrambling to file requests asking ICE to release their clients, many of whom have chronic health problems. In the past few days, Texas attorney Lorena Perez McGill has filed four parole requests on behalf of clients detained in rural for-profit jails in Louisiana, including three asylum-seekers from Cuba and Venezuela and a 27-year-old Guatemalan migrant who recently tried to kill himself after spending nearly nine months in solitary confinement.\n\nOf course they are sitting ducks, Perez McGill told CBS News. It's a perfect place for any illness to breathe and to thrive. Just do the math. We're talking about inadequate medical conditions.\n\nCarlos, 33, a Cuban asylum-seeker who has been in ICE custody for about 10 months, is currently detained at the private Catahoula Correctional Center in northeastern Louisiana. He said he and other immigrants at the detention center have not received any instructions related to the pandemic. Access to hand soap is very limited and the sanitary conditions are subpar, he added.\n\nWe don't have the means here to protect ourselves. Anyone can get sick here, Carlos, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, told CBS News during a phone call from inside the Catahoula facility. We are very exposed to any disease here.\n\nExtraordinarily inadequate\n\nICE's network of more than 200 detention centers and jails across the country forms the foundation of the multi-billion-dollar U.S. immigration detention system, the largest in the world. The agency has the capacity to detain more than 50,000 immigrants on any given day.\n\nThe detention centers have long been criticized for the poor medical care offered to detainees, with concerns raised not just by advocates but from within the government itself. A report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general last year documented inadequate medical care at some ICE detention centers.\n\nThat criticism has intensified as President Trump's administration has moved to detain asylum-seekers for longer periods of time, often in remote and private jails in the Deep South with little oversight.\n\nICE has confirmed eight deaths in its custody in the past six months, including three who died of serious medical conditions or complications. Those eight deaths match the number of detainees who died in custody in the entirety of the 2019 fiscal year, and on Wednesday, BuzzFeed News reported yet another death.\n\nThe agency's detention centers have also been susceptible to communicable diseases. Last year, the agency quarantined thousands of detainees because of outbreaks of measles, mumps and the flu.\n\nIn addition to their extraordinarily inadequate medical services, Cohen said ICE detention centers could become breeding grounds for the coronavirus because immigrants can't take the kind of precautions recommended by experts to curb its spread, like frequent hand-washing and avoiding close contact with others.\n\nPeople are being encouraged to isolate themselves more, to be much more careful in terms of the contact that they come into with other people in other environments, Cohen said. The detention population has no such power.\n\nDetainees waiting to be processed at an ICE facility in Adelanto, California, on August 28, 2019. Chris Carlson / AP\n\nDr. David Cennimo, a professor at Rutgers University who specializes in infectious diseases, said detention makes it challenging for immigrants to maintain the level of personal protection recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other experts. Many detention facilities are overcrowded, and detainees gather in communal settings for meals and recreation, he added.\n\nWhat are we telling people right now? We're saying, 'Isolate, social distance yourself, stay six feet away from everybody else, don't go out,' Cennimo told CBS News. How much can you do that there?\n\nLorilei Williams, a senior staff attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said ICE facilities are susceptible to outbreaks because they are closed environments with some contact with the outside world, not because they hold immigrants.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that migrants are bringing COVID-19 from anywhere, Williams told CBS News. It's probably going to be a staff member bringing in community spread.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, ICE said it has implemented new internal procedures, including plans to screen new detainees and isolate those with symptoms related to COVID-19. The agency has also temporarily suspended visits by family members and friends at detention centers.\n\nICE has yet to confirm any COVID-19 cases among its tens of thousands of detainees. However, an officer at a jail in northern New Jersey used by ICE to detain immigrants tested positive for the virus, officials announced on Thursday. Later in the day, officials revealed that a medical staffer at the ICE detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey had also tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson declined to answer directly when asked about calls to release immigrants, saying only that no announcements have been made regarding the current detainee population.\n\nHomero López, a New Orleans-based attorney who represents indigent immigrants detained in Louisiana, said the measures ICE has announced so far are insufficient to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, especially in the detention centers where his clients are being held. Responding to outbreaks in these facilities, he said, will be more difficult because of how isolated they are from major metropolitan areas with large medical institutions.\n\nReleasing some detainees, López added, is the only way to reduce the risk. But he said the administration is reluctant to do so because the government doesn't see it as the humanitarian issue he believes it is.\n\nIt's political and policy driven, to not release folks when they could be released, López told CBS News.\n\nA detainee sits in a holding cell at the Stewart Detention Center, Friday, Nov. 15, 2019, in Lumpkin, Ga. The city's 1,172 residents are outnumbered by the roughly 1,650 male detainees that ICE said were being held in the detention center in late November. David Goldman / AP\n\n100% discretion\n\nSandweg, the former ICE head, said he knows what's driving the reluctance to release detainees.\n\nYou're kind of balancing the operational needs to frankly shrink the detention population right now — which seems like a glaring, overwhelming need to me — with the political environment of this administration not wanting to be seen as soft on immigration, he said.\n\nBut Sandweg said shrinking the population is exactly what he would do if he still led the agency, focusing first on releasing people over the age of 65 and those with compromised immune systems. According to the CDC, older adults and those with underlying medical conditions like heart, lung and liver diseases and diabetes are at increased risk of severe illness if infected by the coronavirus. Earlier in the week, the American Civil Liberties Union asked a federal court in Seattle to order ICE to release a group of immigrants with health conditions.\n\nSandweg said he would also look to release those who do not pose a risk to a threat to public safety, including families and asylum-seekers.\n\nAs of Saturday, ICE was detaining nearly 6,000 asylum-seekers who had passed initial fear of persecution screenings. The agency was also detaining 1,542 people at two facilities designed to hold families with children.\n\nAccording to government statistics, more than 14,000 of the people ICE is detaining have committed a crime and about 5,000 have pending charges. The rest, nearly 18,000, are being held for immigration violations and don't have criminal records. Since 2017, the agency has been detaining fewer and fewer immigrants with serious criminal convictions, while the number of those who committed misdemeanors, such as unlawful entry and traffic offenses, has increased, according to data compiled by Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC).\n\nThere's a good reason to detain those who have committed violent crime, but not the rest, Sandweg said, especially during a pandemic.\n\nBecause the immigration detention system is a civil and administrative matter, ICE wields the authority to release virtually everyone in its custody. That power is recognized, Sandweg said, even among the most hawkish immigration policy makers or officials at ICE.\n\nUnlike the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ICE has complete control over the release of individuals. ICE is not carrying out the sentence imposed by a federal judge, he added. It has 100% discretion.\n\nUnder federal law, detention is only mandatory for immigrants who have committed certain crimes. One of the ways ICE can release people is by paroling them for humanitarian reasons or if doing so is in the public interest. They would be required to check in with ICE and supervised through ankle bracelets, unannounced home visits and telephonic meetings.\n\nA 2009 ICE directive said asylum-seekers who entered through a port of entry should generally be paroled after establishing credible fear of persecution. But under Mr. Trump, parole grant rates have dramatically dropped, with the government arguing it needs to detain those with no criminal history because they pose a flight risk.\n\nCésar Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, an immigration scholar and author, said even immigrants deemed a flight risk should be considered for release during a global pandemic, especially those with family members in the U.S., so they can continue immigration proceedings outside of detention.\n\nEven if they don't show up for a court date, that's to me outweighed by the very real possibility of death or serious illness, García Hernández said. The fewer people you have in close quarters, the better.\n\nFor García Hernández, ICE needs to rapidly take drastic measures as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the U.S. As of Thursday, the outbreak had killed more than 9,000 people worldwide, including more than 180 in the U.S., where there are more than 9,400 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nI think it's only a matter of time before we see the number of confirmed cases grow exponentially across the United States, García Hernández said. And I have no reason to believe that the ICE detention centers are going to be exempt.\n\nCohen, the psychiatrist, said detention centers are often portrayed as islands that are disconnected from the communities around them. But she said that's not the case, and said resources in the surrounding area are going to be zapped in the event of an outbreak, making it more difficult for communities to respond.\n\nThere's an intimate connection between what goes inside these facilities and what goes on in the communities around them, she said. And I think that we will see this to our serious detriment if this isn't something that is taken into consideration and dealt with now.
The following is a transcript of an interview with former CISA Director Chris Krebs that aired Sunday, January 10, 2021, on Face the Nation.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. For more context on some of the online discourse that fueled the assault on the capital. We want to go now to the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Chris Krebs. Good to have you back with us.\n\nFORMER CISA DIRECTOR CHRIS KREBS: Hey, good morning, MARGARET.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal has reported that the FBI and Homeland Security never issued a threat assessment to local law enforcement here in D.C. about what happened on Wednesday ahead of time. Given that there were explicit online conversations about storming the Capitol, how is it possible that this was not a known threat?\n\nKREBS: So, you know, I'm sure that the ensuing investigation will get to the bottom of what happened. I- I think to a certain extent we may have had some negative learning from the summer's protests and riots and maybe there was an overreaction in the wrong way that led to some of the- some of the breakdowns here. But again, there's an investigation. But to be clear, you know, we- at least when I was there, we certainly anticipated physical violence as the ultimate manifestation of the president and the campaigns' and his attorneys' and his supporters' claims that the election was rigged or stolen. And, you know, those claims continue. The latest dog whistle is election irregularities. So, those that are promoting these- this narrative, these conspiracies have to stop. They have to denounce these- these claims.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, Homeland Security warned back in October that right wing groups may use political rallies and they actually pose a direct threat in terms of action. But then during the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, you know, the homeland security secretary was on this program and others touting the fact that the federal government could put federal agents in cities, whether mayors or governors wanted them there or not, that they had the power to do more. So, you know, why not do more if within the agency there were the threats that you just highlighted? Whose fault is that?\n\nKREBS: Again, the investigations will get down to it. The- and particularly in the District of Columbia, the federal authorities on federal land, like the National Mall, like the Capitol grounds, have even greater authorities than they would in- in any American city. So clearly, there was some sort of coordination and preplanning breakdown. You know, what I would be thinking about right now is what happens on the 20th, what are the protections that are going to be in place. But there- there is an opportunity here, I think, to- to prevent further- further bloodshed. And I don't know if the president is capable of doing it, but he has to resign. He has to tell his supporters that he lied to them, that this was all his own fraud. He has to come out. We have to set an example for the rest of the free world that attempted coups, which is what this was, will not be tolerated. And there has to be an accountability. So whether it's the 25th Amendment push, whether it's an impeachment, the president needs to be held accountable for- for supporting and really inciting the activity of this past week.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And our reporting shows that he has no intention to do that, to resign. We know, though, that he does plan, and our CBS News team is reporting, he does plan to speak tomorrow, but we're told it's going to be to blast big tech for decisions like what Twitter just did to ban him. We also know Apple, Amazon, Google, they have blocked the Parler app, which is also been used as a forum to plan these kind of events. What is the impact of that?\n\nKREBS: Well, look, I think at this point, particularly after Wednesday, the president's legacy is a heap of ashes. There's- there's nothing redeemable at this point, given the fact that he incited this attempt to overturn democracy, a fair and free election. There is an opportunity, though, for a redemption story. Again, he can resign. He can tell his supporters that it was all a long- a big con and that he is sorry. I don't know if he's capable of doing it, but that's the best way to prevent further violence, to prevent further erosion of confidence in democracy over the next four years. And every single Republican on the Hill that continues to support these erec- election irregularities has to do the same thing. They have to denounce it and they have to come back to the middle.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, on the issue of cyber and social media, which you've spent a lot of time thinking about, a lot of conservatives are speaking out not against the president and his use of it, but against the idea that Twitter is censoring somehow conservative thought. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is likely to run in 2024, is out there tweeting this is un-American and a tactic of the left. Is this a free speech issue?\n\nKREBS: No. The First Amendment doesn't apply to private sector organizations. That's not how this works. That's government in- impeding speech and the ability to hear. And that's not what's happening here. These are companies that have their- their own ability to enforce their- their standards and their policies. I think there was a legitimate public policy interest over the last four plus years in- of maintaining the president and his voice on Twitter and other platforms. But- but clearly, what is- what he has done has exceeded any reasonable public policy interest. Now, the- the hard part is in implementing these standards--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nKREBS: --globally, consistently. Other foreign leaders, for instance, you know, they need to be consistent. They need to probably take similar action.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Chris Krebs, thank you for your time.
The contest in South Carolina looks very different heading into its final week than it did last fall. Joe Biden (28%) has only a single-digit lead with Bernie Sanders (23%) now right behind him. The race has narrowed considerably since the fall, when Biden led the field by a whopping 28 points. Support for the former vice president has fallen by double-digits as Sanders and businessman Tom Steyer have made gains. Steyer is at 18%.\n\nThis poll was finished before Sanders coasted to a win in the Nevada caucuses Saturday night — though most South Carolina voters told us the Nevada results would not impact them.\n\nAlthough Biden continues to lead among African Americans — who make up a majority of the state's Democratic electorate — his support with black voters has declined 19 points since the fall.\n\nBiden has lost ground with white voters, too. He led with whites in November, but Sanders does now.\n\nSteyer has shot up into the top tier in this race with 18% of the vote, up from 2% in November. Support for him has risen sharply among black voters.\n\nAmong South Carolina Democrats who were recontacted as part of the survey, three in 10 voters who supported Biden in November have switched to another candidate — half of them (15%) now support Steyer.\n\nDefeating President Trump is the top priority for South Carolina Democrats, including both black and white voters, but black voters express more confidence than white voters that the Democrats will nominate someone who can actually do that: 46% are very confident, compared to just 19% of white voters.\n\nBlack voters pick Biden as the candidate with the best chance to beat Mr. Trump, while whites are split between Biden and Sanders.\n\nMany black voters feel Biden understands the needs and problems of black voters a lot — higher than any other candidate. Steyer and Sanders also do well on this measure. For most of the candidates, a majority of black voters say they understand their concerns, at least some.\n\nButtigieg has not gained much traction with black voters since the fall, and just 13% say he understands the needs and problems of black voters a great deal — far lower than current frontrunners. Buttigieg is getting 4% of the black vote now, compared to 2% in November. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar are also getting single-digit support among black voters.\n\nBiden's performance in the early contests of Iowa and New Hampshire may be hurting him some. Nearly four in 10 South Carolina Democrats (including most white voters) think the results of those two races make it less likely he will be the nominee. Among this group of voters, Sanders is the top choice and the candidate they think has the best chance of defeating Mr. Trump.\n\nIn the days leading up to the primary, health care is the top issue South Carolina Democrats want to hear about (42%), followed by the economy and jobs (30%) and gun policy (12%).\n\nThis CBS News survey is conducted by YouGov between February 20-22, 2020. A representative sample of 2,000 registered voters in South Carolina was selected, including 1,238 self-identified Democrats, as well as independents who plan to vote in the Democratic primary this year. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race and education based upon voter registration lists and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as the 2016 presidential vote. The margin of error is approximately 5.5 points.\n\nFull results
NEW YORK - Energized by the #MeToo movement, two national advocacy groups are teaming up to lodge sexual harassment complaints against McDonald's (MCD) on behalf of 10 women who have worked at the fast food restaurant in nine cities.\n\nThe workers -- one of them a 15-year-old from St. Louis -- alleged groping, propositions for sex, indecent exposure and lewd comments by supervisors. According to their complaints, when the women reported the harassment, they were ignored or mocked, and in some cases suffered retaliation.\n\nThe legal effort was organized by Fight for $15, which campaigns to raise pay for low-wage workers. The legal costs are being covered by the TIMES UP Legal Defense Fund, which was launched in January by the National Women's Law Center to provide attorneys for women who can't afford to bring cases on their own.\n\nThe complaints, filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, are being announced on Tuesday, two days ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting in Oak Brook, Illinois.\n\nResponding to the claims, McDonald's spokeswoman Terri Hickey said there's no place for harassment and discrimination of any kind in the workplace.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation takes allegations of sexual harassment very seriously and are confident our independent franchisees who own and operate approximately 90 percent of our 14,000 U.S. restaurants will do the same, Hickey said by email.\n\nFight for $15 said the restaurants named in the complaints are run by franchisees, not directly by McDonald's. But the complaints name both McDonald's and the franchisee -- part of Fight for $15's effort to hold the company responsible for wage and employment issues at franchised locations. The company claims its franchisees are independent business owners, a stance that has complicated efforts to unionize workers across the entire McDonald's chain.\n\nWhen Fight for $15 workers lodged similar sexual harassment charges two years ago, McDonald's promised a review of those allegations. However, in her new response Hickey declined to say whether that review led to any changes of policies and practices aimed at curtailing such harassment.\n\nAmong the new complainants is Tanya Harrell, 22, of New Orleans, who alleges that her two managers teased her but otherwise took no action after she told them of sustained verbal and physical harassment by a co-worker.\n\nHarrell, who makes $8.15 an hour, said going public with her complaint may be emotionally taxing, but she's proud of her decision.\n\nI feel like I have a voice now, she said in a phone interview. It gives me a bit of motivation and a bit of courage.\n\nIn addition to New Orleans and St. Louis, charges were filed by workers in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and Miami as well as in Orlando, Florida; Durham, North Carolina; and Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThe new allegations come almost two years after 15 McDonald's workers in Fight for $15 filed a series of sexual harassment complaints against the company. Attorneys for the workers plan to ask the EEOC to consolidate or coordinate the newly filed charges, as well as some of the 2016 charges that remain pending.\n\nWhat's different this time, organizers said, is that all of the women bringing charges are represented by attorneys due to the defense fund's support. More broadly, the #MeToo movement that exploded last October has emboldened more women to speak out and has prompted some employers to alter their approach to harassment, said National Women's Law Center CEO Fatima Goss Graves.\n\nMost companies have a policy saying no sexual harassment, but how do you make that work? she asked. Right now, because of the huge power disparities, it's easy to just wait out the complaints and nothing really changes.\n\nEve Cervantez, a lawyer with San Francisco-based public interest law firm Altshuler Berzon, is working on the new complaints. She said they represent an effort to extend the power of #MeToo to low-wage women whose predicaments haven't drawn as much attention as harassment victims in Hollywood, the media and other sectors.\n\nThe women filing charges want McDonald's to take sexual harassment seriously and enforce its already existing zero tolerance policy, Cervantez said. We think McDonald's can use its power and influence to guarantee a safer workplace for all its employees'\n\nFight for $15 is calling on the company to hold mandatory training about sexual harassment for managers and employees, and to create a safe, effective system for receiving and responding to complaints. As part of the initiative, Fight for $15 said it's establishing a hotline workers can use to have attorneys review their complaints.\n\nActivists say sexual harassment is pervasive in the fast-food industry. They cite a 2016 survey by Hart Research Associates -- conducted for three advocacy groups -- which calculated that 40 percent of female fast-food workers experience unwanted sexual behavior on the job.
He became the first Dreamer to win the prestigious Rhodes scholarship, but for recent Harvard University graduate Jin Park, the joy of that achievement has given way to uncertainty.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who lives in New York City, risks not being allowed back in the country if he enrolls at the University of Oxford in England in the fall.\n\nPresident Trump's administration rescinded the option for overseas travel for those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, or DACA, when Mr. Trump moved to phase out the Obama-era program in 2017.\n\nBut travel abroad, which was allowed under limited circumstances such as academic study during the Obama administration, should still be permitted because the federal courts have upheld the program for now, argue Park and his supporters.\n\nIf I leave, there's a very real possibility that I won't be able to come back. That's the biggest fear for sure, said Park, whose family came to the U.S. from South Korea when he was 7 years old. I haven't really thought about what that's going to mean if I'm not allowed back.\n\nU.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which administers DACA, didn't respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nHarvard University grad Jin Park, who holds a degree in molecular and cellular biology, during interview in Cambridge, Mass., on Dec. 13, 2018 Charles Krupa / AP\n\nDACA recipients, commonly called Dreamers because of never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act, are protected from deportation because they were brought into the country illegally at a young age.\n\nDiscussing the risks has been a delicate topic to broach with his parents, who cried out of joy when he won the scholarship, Park said.\n\nI've been avoiding that question, he said days after graduating from Harvard last month. This was especially meaningful for them. It was like a validation of the sacrifices they've made for me.\n\nNearly 700,000 individuals are currently on DACA, which was created in 2012 and can be renewed every two years. To qualify, immigrants must have entered the country by 2007 and been under age 16 when they arrived.\n\nThe Trump administration issued an order winding down the program in 2017, but federal judges in New York, California and Washington, D.C., ruled against those efforts last year and have effectively kept the program running. The administration is now seeking a Supreme Court review.\n\nPast Rhodes scholars and other Rhodes Trust supporters are volunteering their private counsel to Park in the meantime, but it's a matter of American law and not anything the Rhodes Trust can resolve alone, said Elliot Gerson, the British organization's American secretary.\n\nOur hope is for federal action, he added.\n\nThe government should enforce the law as it currently stands, to allow Jin to fulfil his scholarly work, said Kristian Ramos, a spokesman for Define American, an immigrant advocacy organization that supported Park in his Rhodes scholarship bid.\n\nPark could turn down the scholarship but has decided against that route. He wants to continue to be a voice in the immigration debate and believes the benefits of going to Oxford outweigh the risks.\n\nI'm looking forward to having that unstructured time to think about these broader questions of who belongs in America and the value judgments we make about others, he said.\n\nPark has been a vocal advocate for DACA recipients since he was in high school. In 2015, he founded Higher Dreams, a nonprofit organization that helps students without permanent immigration status navigate the college application process.\n\nWith the backing of Harvard, Park applied for the Rhodes scholarship last year as part of a broader effort to underscore how DACA recipients didn't qualify for the venerated award and others like it. The scholarship was created in 1902 by British businessmen and politician Cecil Rhodes and provides all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford.\n\nPark's application - like a number of others in recent years - was rejected, but the message was received. The Rhodes organization changed its policy effective this year. Park re-applied and was accepted.\n\nGerson said the change reflects the organization's efforts to expand eligibility. Legal permanent residents and residents of U.S. territories like Puerto Rico have also been allowed to apply in recent years.\n\nAt Oxford, Park hopes to study migration and political theory as he weighs his future.\n\nThe molecular and cell biology major has also applied to medical school, but he hasn't ruled out working in city government, where he believes he can make an impact on immigration policy no matter who is in the White House.\n\nAnd regardless what happens next, Park has the conviction of knowing where home is.\n\nFor me, I think of Queens, New York, he said. Whatever happens, I'm always going to know that fact. Even if I have to spend the rest of my life convincing the administration, or whoever comes next.
Hundreds of federal employees, contractors, small-business owners and others are going online to raise money to help make ends meet amid a partial government shutdown prolonged by a impasse over President Trump's demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMore than 700 accounts have been created on fundraising site GoFundMe related to the shutdown, with a total of roughly $50,000 raised so far, GoFundMe spokeswoman Katherine Cichy told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.\n\nSome of the 800,000 government employees working without pay or on furlough since the shutdown started on Dec. 22, along with thousands of contract workers, are also turning to Twitter using the hashtag #Shutdownstories. Among their most pressing financial needs are making mortgage and rent payments and taking care of basic necessities like food and diapers, according to the GoFundMe campaigns.\n\nJohanna Petrocelli, a NASA safety engineer based in Houston, said she was at the agency during the 2013 government shutdown and saw people struggling to get by. This time around, Petrocelli, 26, has some savings as well as financial support from her family. But she wanted to do something for her colleagues and co-workers who don't have that kind of support. So she set up a GoFundMe page.\n\nThey don't spend beyond their means\n\n\n\nThese aren't people who are irresponsible or haven't saved for emergencies or spend beyond their means, the description for her page, Feds Who Want to Help, reads. They're highly educated people who work at NASA. People with PhDs in astrophysics from MIT, flight controllers who keep the International Space Station and astronauts safe day after day. They're also janitors, administrative assistants, facility maintenance, and security guards who work long hours for very little pay.\n\nShutdowns can also create bureaucratic messes that lead to unexpected consequences. For instance, some new hires haven't received their first paycheck, so they don't have proof of employment to help get an apartment, Petrocelli noted.\n\nThere's women who are sole providers for their family. The janitorial staff is contract and on furlough and probably won't get paid beyond their contract dates. I want to do what I can, Petrocelli said.\n\nJulie Burr, a contract worker with the Department of Transportation in Kansas City, Missouri, said on her GoFundMe page that she is losing pay every day the shutdown continues. I've taken on extra shifts at my 2nd job but it isn't going to pay rent and all my bills. Being a single mom, I'm in panic mode right now.\n\nTo guard against scams, GoFundMe set up a team to review shutdown campaigns using proprietary technical tools and multiple processes to verify organizers and beneficiaries, Cichy said. Before money is transferred, GoFundMe's payment processor also verifies an individual's information, including banking details, she said.\n\nGoFundMe also guarantees donations. If funds are misused as determined in our sole discretion, GoFundMe will pay up to $1,000 per donor per campaign, according to the company's policy.\n\nWorking without a net\n\nTyler Fralia, a tax examining technician at the IRS in Ogden, Utah, had some savings until the cost of replacing old tires on the family car drained his account. His wife was on unpaid maternity leave to take care of now six-month old Luke, leaving the family without much of a financial net. He's now searching for temporary work, and has looked into part-time jobs at Domino's and Uber,\n\nIn the meantime, Fralia has set up a page on GoFundMe. As of Tuesday night it had yielded about $250. That helps, but it's not even a car payment, he said.\n\nAlthough his wife is back at work, Fralia, 28, still worries about the mortgage. And when he's called back to the IRS later this month as the agency promises to begin processing taxes on Jan. 28, it might still be without pay.\n\nWe want to go back to work, Fraila said. Americans entrust IRS workers to do their job, he said. It's all we want.\n\n-- CBS News' Irina Ivanova contributed reporting.
Washington — The attack on the Capitol a week ago has left lawmakers with a heightened sense of vulnerability about their own security — and fresh questions about whether their own leaders and the U.S. Capitol Police are adequately equipped to handle those concerns.\n\nThe sense of unease has been heightened by President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration next week. The Capitol Police have erected a fence around the Capitol, and the National Guard is now planning to bring 20,000 troops to Washington — an increase of 5,000 from earlier plans, according to a Defense Department official.\n\nBut members of Congress have not been advised on how they should plan to enter the Capitol security perimeter if there are large crowds gathered outside the fence.\n\nOne House Democrat questioned the current policy for guests at the inauguration, which allows members to be accompanied by one person but does not require them to submit the name of the guest for any list or background check. Guests will only need a paper ticket issued by the Joint Inaugural Committee to enter the building.\n\nThere are also no rules in place about whether members or their guests will be allowed to carry guns at the inauguration, a debate that arose when another member attending Monday's briefing asked whether a personal security guard could come as a guest — and whether that security guard could carry a gun.\n\nOne person's personal security is another person's Proud Boy, the member said.\n\nA security briefing Monday night by the U.S. Capitol Police left attendees gravely concerned about their safety as they learned about threats of armed militias plotting to surround the Capitol and kill Democrats in order to install Republicans in power.\n\nThere is no way in God's green earth there are no threats leading up to January 6, and now it's like every organized militia creates in a period of three days a plan to descend upon the Capitol, one House Democrat told CBS News. The intelligence failure leading up to the sixth is absolutely undeniable.\n\nAdding to members' concerns is the fact that at least two members of the Capitol Police have been suspended in the wake of the riots — one for taking a selfie with people breaking into the Capitol; another for donning a Make America Great Again hat and providing directions. There are also 10 to 15 other investigations that are ongoing.\n\nWe can't have a democracy if too many members of our police force and our military are acting to overturn it and undermine it, Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, a New Jersey Democrat, told constituents in a Facebook livestream Tuesday night. She also accused other members of leading reconnaissance tours on the day before the rioting on January 6.\n\nSherrill has not answered subsequent questions about which members she saw but vowed, I'm going to see that they're held accountable, and if necessary, ensure that they don't serve in Congress.\n\nLawmakers and their staff used to feel relatively safe inside the Capitol, but last week changed that.\n\nThe idea that everyone is untouchable? No, we're all touchable now. If there's a nuclear bomb, we accept we're probably the first to go. But we never though that a mob would be able to get into the Capitol, a House staff member said. People are scared that more things will happen before the 20th. People who have been up here for 20 years — even since 9/11 — have never been this scared.\n\nThe Democratic House member added that the failures on January 6 have prompted questions about the inauguration security plan and also worried that some House leaders hold the misguided belief that those who are planning new attacks on the Capitol will simply stop trying once President Trump leaves office.\n\nThere is a level of naivete that exists within House leadership where they don't see what a threat this is, the lawmaker told CBS News.\n\nHouse Republicans, meanwhile, have already begun to chafe at some of the new additional security measures, including the installation of magnetometers outside the House chamber. In the past, lawmakers have enjoyed deference on security matters and have only been required to wear their Congressional pins to get into the House chamber and bypass magnetometers at the doors of the Capitol and House office buildings.\n\nIllinois Congressman Rodney Davis, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, which oversees Capitol Hill housekeeping issues including the Capitol Police, called the move political correctness run amok at a Capitol Police briefing Tuesday evening.\n\nThe threat is outside, not inside. Every resource used inside is one that can't be used outside, he said.\n\nSeveral Republicans reportedly refused to go through the magnetometers at House votes Tuesday evening, and the number two House Republican, Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, had a heated exchange with officers stationed outside the House chamber, asking, You're impeding the ability of members to come and vote?...This was never discussed.\n\nA House Democrat said the fact that members of Congress are given deference on such measures makes members less safe.\n\nThe power dynamic with members of Congress is so detrimental to our own security, the lawmaker said.\n\nBeyond the security failures on January 6, other lawmakers have raised concerns about the disparity in treatment between the overwhelmingly White rioters that day compared to peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters who demonstrated last summer in response to George Floyd's death.\n\nI thought for sure that we would see at least the kind of presence we saw during the Black Lives Matter administration when the building was protected from peaceful protesters, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American official in Congress, told reporters last week. I want to emphasize that peaceful demonstrators, people who came in peace, not bringing Molotov cocktails…came to peacefully protest. And yet, the Capitol Building was wrong with all kinds of shows of force.\n\nOhio Democrat Tim Ryan, who oversees the House subcommittee that funds the Capitol Police, also said there had been a much larger police presence ahead of the protests over the summer.\n\nJust being candid, if there were Black people out there I think there would have been a much different response in what they did and so that to me was very, very frustrating, he told reporters.\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus convened a hearing Wednesday about the white supremacy that was on display in last week's attacks. Black Lives Matter and other civil rights leaders were invited to testify.\n\nAt this point, the caucuses representing Black, Hispanic and Asian-American members of Congress have not had a collective discussion around disparities in treatment by the Capitol Police or diversity within the organization itself.\n\nOne Congressional source didn't want to put the cart before the horse and wanted to see what the investigation bears before recommending reforms, but at the same time acknowledged some members are concerned and the issue could be addressed in the future.\n\nThose who were calling the shots...were certainly unprepared and underprepared and that was not acceptable, Congressional Black Caucus Chair Representative Joyce Beatty told CBS News.\n\nThe Capitol Police is now under the command of its first Black leader. Yogananda Pittman is serving as the acting chief after former chief Steven Sund resigned following the January 6 attacks. The department faces some of the same diversity challenges as other police departments nationwide. While it does not publish diversity statistics, the Capitol Police have faced multiple lawsuits brought by Black officers alleging discrimination.\n\nDavid Martin and Mary Walsh contributed to this report.
WASHINGTON -- The Syrian government has released an American freelance photographer who was captured after entering the country about four years ago, the State Department said Friday.\n\nU.S. officials said Kevin Patrick Dawes, a 33-year-old freelance photographer from San Diego, was turned over to authorities from Russia, which has been backing the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the civil war that now is in its sixth year.\n\nThe U.S. officials said Dawes was abducted in 2012.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. continues to work through Czech officials in Syria to get information on the welfare and whereabouts of Austin Tice and other U.S. citizens missing and detained in Syria. The Czech embassy represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Syria.\n\nKirby declined to give further details on the release.\n\nTice, of Houston, Texas, disappeared in August 2012 while covering Syria's civil war. A video released a month later showed the journalist blindfolded and held by armed men, saying Oh, Jesus. He had not been heard from since then.\n\nIn June, Tice's father, Marc, told CBS News that the new hostage policy announced by President Obama was an excellent step forward.\n\nIf there was ... any opportunity to bring Austin home, we would do everything we could to make it happen, he said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the release of Dawes and quoted FBI officials as saying that he was taken after crossing into Syria from Turkey. The Post said Dawes recently was permitted to call his family and receive packages.\n\nIn 2011, Dawes told NPR that he traveled to Libya initially as a medical aid worker but then ended up fighting with anti-Qaddafi forces.\n\nHe told NPR that he went to Libya to see the world, experience new things, get in way over my head, but, you know, ultimately survive.
President Trump is making the case to the nation Tuesday night that his border wall must be funded — and it must be funded now — as the partial government shutdown continues into its third week. It will be his first prime-time address from the Oval Office.\n\nAccording to the White House, the president will address border security, the partial government shutdown, and the looming threat of the first missed paycheck for federal employees on Friday. Still unclear is whether the president will use his bully pulpit to announce any new policy or approach. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Jordan the president would make a lot of news, but didn't say what.\n\nIt's gonna be about the border, mostly about our southern border. I saw an early version of it. He'll make a lot of news, Pompeo told reporters on the ground in Jordan.\n\nDemocrats are requesting air time, too, to respond to Mr. Trump's remarks.\n\nVice President Mike Pence would not say, in an interview with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett Tuesday morning, whether the president will announce a national emergency in his address. The president is considering doing so, but hadn't decided as of Monday afternoon, Pence told reporters at the time.\n\nPence told CBS This Morning Mr. Trump will use the Oval Office address to lay out the facts about what the American people view as a humanitarian and genuine crisis at our southern border.\n\nThe time has come for the Democrats to come to the table, and we have to start negotiating, Pence said. Not just to address the government shutdown but to address the humanitarian crisis at the border.\n\nThe White House is demanding $5.7 billion for barriers at the border, in addition to $7 billion for other border-related expenses, like more immigration judges to adjudicate immigration cases. Democrats have yet to formally respond to those demands, but they have already insisted in the past they won't hand the president billions for his border wall.\n\nMeanwhile, the government shutdown is starting to affect airports, where more Transportation Security Administration officers are calling in sick than usual. The White House has said tax refunds won't be affected by the shutdown, but other government services, like food stamps, hang in the balance if the shutdown continues.\n\nThe longest government shutdown lasted for 21 days under former President Bill Clinton over 1995-1996. Tuesday marks the 18th day of the current government shutdown.\n\nThe Oval Office address will air on CBS stations and CBSN at 9 p.m. ET.
In this episode of Intelligence Matters, host Michael Morell speaks with Dr. Ken Wickiser, a biochemist and associate dean of research at U.S. Military Academy West Point, about his piece Engineered Pathogens and Unnatural Biological Weapons: The Future Threat of Synthetic Biology. Wickiser describes the growing influence of synthetic biology and what can happen if it gets in the wrong hands.\n\nHighlights\n\nWhat is synthetic biology? Synthetic biology is the process of engineering natural genetic systems. In terms of engineering: taking what nature has provided us and optimizing it, co-opting it, repurposing it, making it more efficient, and making it more cost effective. In large part for good purposes, to make new and novel biomaterials, to make new and novel pharmaceuticals. To make existing pharmaceuticals cheaper, more abundant, more available for the population.\n\nNefarious use of synthetic biology: What we're concerned about is the production of either small molecules or gene products that could be used in a way that is a negative influence on someone's health. Whatever you can consider in your mind, is probably capable of being produced in the synthetic biology.\n\nNext generation needs to learn about synthetic biology: Whether we're talking about budding scientists or people who are interested in ethics or people who are interested in economics. We need people to understand the benefits of synthetic biology and the potential threats. That way we can develop common sense policies that will allow the science to progress, will allow us to benefit from the development of the science, but at the same time will assure our safety.\n\nDownload, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher.\n\nIntelligence Matters: Ken Wickiser transcript\n\nProducer: Paulina Smolinksi\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER INTELLIGENCE MATTERS TRANSCRIPT\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: This discussion will be part of a series of episodes that we're doing between now and the inauguration on the key national security issues facing the United States. I'll let our listeners know this one is going to be a bit scary. You and your colleagues wrote a paper published in August that caught my attention. It was published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, which is one of the best-known counterterrorism think tanks in the world. Your piece was titled Engineered Pathogens and Unnatural Biological Weapons: The Future Threat of Synthetic Biology which is what I really want to dig into today with you. But before we do that, I wanted to give you an opportunity to mention the other authors of the piece because there were quite a few.\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: Absolutely. Thank you for allowing me that opportunity. This was a team effort. One of the great things about West Point is that we have a really great combination of both active duty military and the government civilian faculty and staff here in our effort to help develop the next generation of army leaders. My colleagues on this particular paper include Colonel John Burpo, who has a Ph.D. from MIT in bioengineering, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Washington, who has a Ph.D. in microbiology from the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Dr. Kevin O'Donovan, who is a Title 10 government civilian and the deputy director of the Life Science Program here at West Point, his Ph.D. is in neuroscience from Johns Hopkins University. We also have a returning active military officer, Lieutenant Colonel, who is now getting his Ph.D. at at Boston University. We have a group of people who are not only subject matter experts, but they are people who have operational experience. They have operational experience in the military, or in both government and in the civilian academic labs across the United States. We took a holistic view of this in the context of what do our cadets really need to know about this technology? The point here was not to be scared, but to be prepared and understand from a holistic standpoint what synthetic biology is, where it could go, and what we need to be concerned about.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: What is synthetic biology?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: That's a great question, because it depends on who you ask. In the broadest interpretation, synthetic biology is the process of engineering natural genetic systems. In terms of engineering: taking what nature has provided us and optimizing it, co-opting it, repurposing it, making it more efficient, and making it more cost effective. In large part for good purposes, to make new and novel biomaterials, to make new and novel pharmaceuticals. To make existing pharmaceuticals cheaper, more abundant, more available for the population. Synthetic biology has been around for a long time, but it's really increased in its prevalence and its significance since the genomic age. Its prevalence increased since we really understood the nature of DNA and have been able to catalogue the structure of DNA and how genomes in particular are organized: the controlling components, the parts that make proteins, the parts that serve as stoplights or speed bumps along the way.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Can you explain the concept of modularity and why that's important to synthetic biology?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: I think most people understand if you take a look at an electronic circuit, there's parts that go into the electronic circuit and you have a resistor here that gets set aside, a capacitor over there. You can construct very complicated machinery with some very simplistic parts. If you take that viewpoint of how perhaps a genome is organized, you have this long strand of DNA and embedded within that DNA are the instructions for certain proteins. Some proteins are going to be turned on all the time. Some proteins are going to be turned on only some of the time. Sometimes there's an age or development aspect to it. In terms of modularity, what we're focused on is being able to lift that one segment of DNA out of one particular organism and place it in a completely different novel context, in a completely different organism, and yet have it work. Perhaps not in the way that nature intended, but in the way that you, as the bioengineer, intends for it to function. That's really what we talk about when we use the term modularity is that drag and drop, cut and paste, lift and shift, mentality when you think about engineering DNA and engineering genomes.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Can you talk about the good uses that synthetic biology can do for mankind? Your piece was about a potentially bad use. I'd love for you to talk about that from the 50,000 foot level.\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: Synthetic biology is a tool just like a hammer. You can use it for good or you can use it for nefarious purpose. We are typically in academia focused on the good. That's the whole point of going through a PhD program, learning about how to better mankind in terms of novel materials, novel pharmaceuticals, and understanding the basic machinery of biology so that we can take care of ourselves just that much better.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: We can cure diseases that we've never been able to cure before.\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: Absolutely. We're certainly on the cusp of that. If you take a look at it from the other vantage point, if you understand biology, if you understand this network of small molecules and genes and environmental influences, then you can disrupt that. Not only for good, but perhaps for bad. What we're trying to do here is just to call attention to this tool and to bring this to the attention of developing leaders, saying 'look, you have to take this into account when developing plans for security and for operations.' We have to understand what might happen out there if technology falls into the into the wrong hands, the hands of someone who is trying to do harm to others. In our case, we're concerned about Americans. We're concerned about the American military in particular. We in no way, shape, or form want to disparage or undermine the support that synthetic biology has in the community. We value it. We use it every day in our labs here at West Point. It's used across the world, in labs, in industry, academia, government labs, all the way down even to high school labs. But I do think that we need to understand that the bar has been lowered in terms of being able to produce something that other people haven't thought of. If that something happens to be perhaps negative in nature. We need to be prepared for that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: What is the risk here? What is the threat?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: What we're concerned about is the production of either small molecules or gene products that could be used in a way that is a negative influence on someone's health. Whatever you can consider in your mind, is probably capable of being produced out there in the synthetic biology.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: So we are talking about a bioweapon here, right?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: We are talking about bioweapons. Whether you talk about a material or something that happens to be infectious, that's just different levels of threat.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Can you talk about the concept of binary weapons and why that's important in the context of what we're talking about here?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: If you were able to take two different chemicals, each of them inert, very stable. But then when you mix them, they become robust, explosive, that would be considered a binary weapon. So you need both components in order to have that weapon. So biology could be the same thing. If I have protein X, that happens to be a poison, I could cut that in half in two different segments and have a gene product in one organism, and the gene product in another. I could produce a considerable amount of each one of those subcomponents to the poison and then mix these two together and develop that active poison for nefarious purposes. Likewise, if these two gene products happen to be housed in prokaryotes and bacteria, I could mix these together. Under favorable conditions, they could exchange genetic material and the product could be one single organism that is producing an intact product. So you have both of those halves that can come together and form that particular poison. When we talk about a binary weapon, most people think about it in terms of chemical or mechanical means. But the analogy holds when you talk about biological macromolecules.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: What I'm thinking is this is the biological equivalent of al-Qaida trying to bring on chemicals to those 10 to 15 aircraft flying from Heathrow. Chemicals that were inert separate, but when you put them on the plane and mix them together, all of a sudden, they became an explosive.\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: Unfortunately, science goes hand in hand with creativity and curiosity. It really comes down to someone with nefarious purpose, having creativity mixed in with some scientific capability that allows them to produce something that is going to be of significant concern.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: What's the range of risk here from the least dangerous bioweapon to the most dangerous bioweapon in terms of what synthetic biology could produce?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: Part of this is fear. And then part of it is the physical infectivity that a substance might have. Or an organism might have an entity. I use those terms very broadly because it's arguable whether one calls a virus alive. Because it doesn't in and of itself have the machinery required for self replication, it requires the host to hijack and and replicate itself. But ignoring that distinction is something that is going to have that very careful balance in between lethality and infectivity across a particular population. If something was so incredibly deadly that it's going to hamstring itself in terms of being able to pass that on to the next host, then that's going to tend to die out faster than something that has that careful balance. That something is likely a virus. It could be an engineered virus. It can be microbes, living systems, small individual cells that produce toxins.\n\nWhether you think about something that's endemic across humankind, like E. coli, without having that one genetic switch that'll change it into something that's virulent. But you can think about something that is genetically engineered like a virus. Knowing that we use this for good, it can also be used for bad. For example, in 2011 Dutch scientists wanted to create a virus and see what mutations were required in order to make it more aerosolized. They did this and they were frightened that it took so few mutations in order to make something that was very dangerous into something that was incredibly deadly. There was a large public outcry. People came back and said, 'you should not even publish this.' There was a lot of ethical considerations that went into the sharing of those data and the publication of that particular work. They used natural selection in the context of the lab in order to generate those five mutations. Now it's known that the information can be used by people to engineer a particular protein in the context of DNA and have that produced by any DNA synthesis companies. Some of them are American, but many of them are outside the continental United States. It's that information that allows us and empowers someone with nefarious purpose to use synthetic biology for their ends.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: In the paper, you and your co-authors give some examples of where this has already been done. Can you describe very briefly a couple of those? The first was work done in 2002 by scientists at the State University of New York at Stony Brook on the polio virus.\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: It's always been a goal for someone to build a genome from scratch. The question is, using state of the art chemical synthesis tools, can you construct something that is functional? That is really where that effort was born. It spawned several other efforts that eventually led up to the idea could you actually create a living cell from scratch?\n\nIt goes hand in hand with what do you actually need for a living system. What can you throw away? If you take out of a car every bit that you don't need for it to run. Seat warmers etc. That's what has been a major goal in synthetic biology efforts across the globe, because once you have that minimal structure, that biological scaffold, you can then add in whatever you want and and it's less of a load. For example, if you and I are going on a run. If you add a large backpack onto yourself, it's going to be much more exerting. The same thing happens when you engineer a small microbe. You increase the metabolic load and slow it down. But if you can get rid of all the non essential requirements, then when you actually load it up with that new system, then you will have a biological system that is not going to be loaded down as much of a natural one.\n\nThat's been the progression, going from the construct of a virus to the construct of an actual living cell. Another piece that we really wanted to bring up here is, on the good part. We have these amazing contests, international genetically engineered machine contests born out of MIT. You have this incredibly rich international group of young men and women. Primarily it was college students. Recently, they've lowered the bar of entry because so many young high school students are really interested in this work. In 2019 there was three hundred and sixty teams from across the world. About 50 percent of them came from Asia. About 20 percent were from North America. There was about one quarter of the teams that were from the high school level. About 65 percent of them are from Asia, predominantly they're from China. The great thing about synthetic biology is that there are no borders. Then again, that applies to the context of threat, to the context of force protection amongst the American population and the DOD. There might be something here of concern.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Then no borders become a bad thing. It's this interesting dichotomy. You just raised an issue that caught my attention. When people used to ask me about this threat, I would say, 'yes, terrorist groups have shown interest, but doing this is very, very difficult.' One of the things that really jumped out to me in your article is that this is getting easier and easier.\n\nLet me read a few sentences. 'The sophistication of high school and undergraduate student research projects has matched that of many highly trained personnel who are working in advanced laboratories less than a decade ago.' The second is 'these synthetic bio tools are lowering the education, training, cost, time and equipment threshold required to modify and employ pathogenic organisms as biologic weapons.'\n\nTalk about the extent to which this is getting easier and obviously why that's important.\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: Let's take a look at the iGEM organization. I'm a huge fan. I participated in it for many years. They have a biosafety and security committee. They're very much attuned to the potential misuse. Outside of the context of a competition, going into perhaps non-state actors who have ill intent toward the United States, you say 'if high school students can do this across Asia, across Europe, across the United States, then take that threat scenario and apply that to something chemical or nuclear. You're not going to have high school students making the next generation nuclear weapon. But one of the amazing things about science is we're all about sharing information. We're all about publishing, we're all about planting your flag and generating bragging rights about these great advances that we make. But that also provides a great recipe for that next person.\n\nThat next person can certainly be a young individual that does not have decades of experience in laboratories. He or she can essentially do garage level science that in the past would have taken a lot of people a long time in sophisticated labs. Going back to our polio example, how long did that take these experts in the Stony Brook lab? How many years was that? How many millions of dollars was spent on that? Whereas when you talk about a young team of students, this is on the thousands of dollars scale.\n\nIf they needed ten thousand dollars worth of materials, that's highly attainable for a lot of people. These materials then really comes down to synthetic DNA, DNA that has been produced by chemically synthesizing them in a facility. These facilities are all across the world. They're all across the United States. They're all across Europe, but they're all across Asia as well. Honestly, when I have a gene synthesized or when I have a plasmid, which is a small circular chunk of DNA that has many different genes embedded within it, if I have that synthesized and I want to pay someone three thousand dollars to do that, it will probably be subcontract out to China. That's where the materials are coming from. When you talk about the sharing of materials, there's high levels of access for anybody throughout the world. This is not just something that is available to American students or postdocs or professors in American universities. This is available worldwide.\n\nThere are no boundaries when it comes to information. There are no boundaries when it comes to science, and there's certainly no boundaries when it comes to scientific expertise and interest. There is such an enormous level of interest coming out of Asia, particularly China. It's something to consider when thinking about where synthetic biology could go, not only for the good, but potentially for the bad.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: In your article, you and your co-authors push back on those who say that making bioweapons is much too difficult for a non-professional. You use two metaphors. Can you share those?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: Twenty years ago, I would have said, 'yes, they're absolutely right, the bar is way too high.' 10 years ago, I would have said, 'yeah, sure, it's a little bit lower, but that's going to be a tough ask.' But today, it's just really not. If you go back to some of the examples we used in the paper, our home PC example. When I was young, I vividly remember my very first Apple computer. Seeing that at a college. It was almost like a museum where I was looking behind the glass, not allowed to touch it. Today look where we have gone. Along with Moore's Law. This has just exploded in terms of technology where people now have the ability to customize their entire home and have that controlled by a cell phone.\n\nYou have Moore's Law that has been allowing us via the increased computational power to do so many amazing things that we just couldn't have dreamed of 20, 30 years ago. Biology and our understanding of biology has followed a similar path. There's been an absolute explosion in our understanding of what a gene is, how to control a gene, how to get these genes from one context and put them into another.\n\nIt comes down to being able to design this online. You can do genetic engineering right from your phone. You can purchase DNA on the spot. At the end of the purchasing process, there's a little form to sign that says 'is this a poison, yes or no? Can this impact human health? Yes or no?' It really comes down to you as the purchaser being honest. We have this incredible capability in biology. Yet the controls haven't caught up to that yet, whereas perhaps controls in electronic means have. That's because to the regular nonscientist the capabilities and limitations of electronics are a lot more understandable compared to that of biology.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: In terms of your concerns about this, it sounds like it's primarily non-state actors, terrorist groups rather than states. Is that fair to say?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: That's absolutely fair to say. At the end of the day, both Russia and China have incredibly robust scientific programs. The United States has taken steps after the fall of the Soviet Union to provide scientists from the former Soviet Union opportunities to engage in science for the benefit of mankind by setting up laboratories in countries like Georgia. But our concern here is the lowering of that bar and allowing for the ability for an untrained group of people to develop something that might negatively impact human health.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Let me read two more sentences from your article. The first sentence is, 'as molecular engineering techniques of the synthetic biologists become more robust and widespread, the probability of encountering one or more of these threats is approaching certainty.' The second is 'the change to the threat landscape created by these techniques is rivaled only by the development of the atomic bomb.' Those are two pretty significant sentences, so what do we do about this? What's the right policy response? How do we defend ourselves?\n\nDR. KEN WICKISER: I go back to say the iGEM field. They are very much interested in biosecurity and infusing the thought of biosecurity in these young budding scientists. Whether they be Americans or people from foreign countries. But we also have in the United States several organizations dedicated to biosecurity, including the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and their chemical biological defense division. The entire research there is a lead by Dr. Ronald Han, and he has an amazing portfolio. They are very dedicated to addressing this field. There's BARTA. There's DARPA. DARPA has several different programs that are addressing the potential threat of synthetic biology, whether it be a normal genetic engineering or the whole CRISPR effort. That has really exploded the field over the past several years. So we do have organizations, whether they be private, non-profits, or governmental organizations that are addressing this. I think it's probably incumbent upon us to weave this into the educational experience of young people. Whether we're talking about budding scientists or people who are interested in ethics or people who are interested in economics. We need people to understand the benefits of synthetic biology and the potential threats. That way we can develop common sense policies that will allow the science to progress, will allow us to benefit from the development of the science, but at the same time assure our safety.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL: Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for your service to our country, which continues to this very day. And in educating the young women and young men who will lead the United States Army in the future.
The government shutdown became the longest in American history overnight, leaving 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay. Federal workers received $0 pay stubs on Friday, their first pay day covering the shutdown period.\n\nIn light of the struggles federal employees may be having in trying to live without pay, the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) says it is holding five free pop-up markets in the Washington, D.C. area, which has the highest concentration of federal workers in the country. It says the markets are being held in Giant stores in Virginia, Washington and Maryland, offering fresh produce and shelf-stable food items for the first 250 federal workers who arrive between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe CAFB published a blog post describing efforts by volunteers to prepare for the pop-up food banks, describing the efforts of 80 volunteers packing 30,000 pounds of produce for the pop-up markets, including assistance from some federal workers.\n\nI need the extra help right now, Pamela Leftrict, a policy analyst with the EPA, told CAFB. This is a scary time for me, especially because I have a child at home. Volunteering makes me feel like I'm contributing, like I'm giving something back for what I receive. She also said that she was telling federal workers in need who may be unwilling to accept help that this is not your fault.\n\nFree groceries aren't all that's being provided for federal workers. Sweetgreen and &Pizza in Washington, D.C., are offering free meals for federal workers between certain times, and all restaurants by celebrity chef Jose Andres in the city are providing free sandwiches for any federal employee with ID, according to Patch.\n\nSome museums and parks are also offering free admission or discounts to federal employees, including the Newseum and Montgomery's Parks. They can also get free movie tickets from Alamo Drafthouse in the month of January, and free GW basketball tickets. Some gyms are also offering free classes.\n\nWe do live paycheck by paycheck, Erin Kidwell, a federal employee in Oregon, said about her struggles as a furloughed worker, in December. I heard a congressman say that we didn't, but we do.\n\nKidwell said many federal workers take their jobs in part because of the security of working with the government. But with an impasse in budget negotiations between the White House and lawmakers over President Trump's $5.7 billion demand for a border wall, Kidwell and her husband, who is also a furloughed federal employee, face an uncertain future.\n\nThe hardest part is the demoralizing of our employment, she said. Playing around with our jobs like they're a political game.\n\nRob Legare contributed reporting
The Afghan War has cost America 2,400 lives and a trillion dollars, but 16 years later, the country's capital may be at its most dangerous. The threat of roadside bombs is so high, U.S. personnel must fly the two miles from Kabul's airport to their headquarters. As costly as America's longest war has been, to fail in its mission there would be even costlier says the U.S. commanding officer in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson. Lara Logan interviews Nicholson and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, for a report on the War in Afghanistan to be broadcast on 60 Minutes, Sunday, Jan. 14 at 7:00 p.m., ET/PT.\n\nLogan and crew under heavy security toured the inner city of Kabul, where they encountered a maze of protective checkpoints and concrete blast walls. 21 international terrorist groups are operating in this country, says President Ghani. Dozens of suicide bombers are being sent. There are factories…producing suicide bombers. We are under siege. And conditions of siege require protective responses.\n\nThe protection is nearly all paid for by American taxpayers, who foot 90-percent -- more than 4 billion a year -- of the Afghan military budget. We will not be able to support our army for six months without U.S. support, and U.S. capabilities, Ghani tells Logan.\n\nThe airport road is so vulnerable to bombings, U.S. and allied personnel are shuttled from the airport by helicopter. Logan observes that this maneuver could be considered ceding territory to the enemy. Not so says Nicholson. I disagree. I think it's answering our moral imperative to protect the lives of our soldiers and civilians. So that's what we do.\n\nThe U.S. began the war in Afghanistan as part of a response to the foreign terrorists who attacked the U.S. on 9/11. When Logan points out that Americans are now more afraid of domestic terrorists, the general says all the more important to beat Islamic militant terror wherever it is. We need to defeat the ideology, says Nicholson. If we were to lose here or if we were to leave here, the cost would be unacceptable. Why? It would embolden jihadists globally, those living in our own countries…In my view the cost of failure here is unacceptable.\n\nPresident Trump shares Nicholson's view. President Obama announced a withdrawal date and began drawing down troops before he left office. Mr. Trump gave Nicholson 3,000 more troops and a change in policy the general says will help him kill more Taliban leaders. Yes, this is the end game. This is a policy that can deliver a win, says Nicholson.
It's a technological miracle of sorts -- actors seemingly performing from beyond the grave. How do they do it? Call it a double take, as David Pogue of Yahoo Tech found out:\n\nThe new Star Wars movie, Rogue One, was a big hit at the box office. Exciting story, thrilling effects, and gifted actors -- including one who's been dead for over 20 years.\n\nThat's right: British actor Peter Cushing was there, reprising his role as Grand Moff Tarkin, even though he passed away in 1994.\n\nHow did they do that?\n\nActor Guy Henry performed the new scenes, and then the Oscar-nominated special effects engineers replaced his face with Peter Cushing's.\n\nAnd how did the computer know exactly what Peter Cushing's face looked like, down to the tiniest detail? That's where Paul Debevec comes in.\n\nDebevec invented the Light Stage, which sits at his office at the Institute for Creative Technologies, at the University of Southern California.\n\nSurrounded by more than 10,000 LEDs, the subject is photographed with about 20 high-quality DSLR cameras, producing a series of high-resolution photos from different angles to reconstruct a 3-D model of the subject's face.\n\nMore than a hundred famous actors have stood on this spot to be scanned for movies, including Angelina Jolie, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Sigourney Weaver and Duane Johnson.\n\nOnce an actor has been scanned into the Light Stage, engineers can digitally insert him or her into scenes, even if that actor is unavailable, much older or younger, or deceased. That's how actor Paul Walker was able to appear in Fast and Furious 7, even though he died partway into filming.\n\nDebevec said, We'll have the actor make a succession of about 50 different facial expressions. And that produces all of the different motions of their face. But we also can record a facial performance from all these different angles, and then create a digital performance of that character that does exactly what they did in the video.\n\nThe Light Stage might have cost several million dollars 10 years ago. But today, you can build a person-scanning setup with parts you pick up at the hardware store.\n\nJust ask Ari Shapiro. He runs the Character Animation and Simulation research group at the USC. He's been developing a human scanning system that uses one hundred $20 cameras, sewn into a shower curtain purchased at Home Depot. The subject steps into the shower and presto!\n\nCOMPUTER: Please remain still … Scanning completed.\n\nAnd in just minutes Shapiro has a digital version of you, which he can animate.\n\nBut here's the thing: It's fine to create virtual clones of people as long as everybody knows it's for entertainment purposes. But how long will it be before someone tries to pass it off as reality?\n\nPogue said, Let's say I decide to make a presidential candidate do something heinous and I release that as news. Is that plausible?\n\nI think it's not only plausible, I think that there are definitely people in various countries that are working on exactly that, said Todd Richmond, the director of the mixed reality lab at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies -- and a man who thinks a lot about the implications of digital clones.\n\nShould the government be involved? Should there be a new Bureau of Digital Ethics? I think artists should have a place at the table, Richmond said. Technologists and practitioners need to be at the table because they're the ones who are knee-deep in the goo of this stuff. Politicians have to have some understanding of this, because invariably, policy will need to be made to address this.\n\nAccording to Richmond, it's past time for us to consider the very real power of make-believe people.\n\nI can create a virtual version of somebody who can walk and talk and say things that they never actually did, he said. And that's a power that's never existed ever in the history of humans.\n\n\n\nFor more info:
Is it safe to come out now?\n\nThe stock market has found firmer footing following its breathtaking drop earlier this month, when the S&P 500 lost 10.2 percent in just nine days. Stocks climbed Tuesday for the third straight day, and the S&P 500 is now down 7.3 percent from its record high, set on Jan. 26.\n\nBut investors have seen this playbook before. Even in past recoveries, it has sometimes taken months or more for momentum to fully turn around.\n\nHere's a look at what history shows about past corrections, and what market watchers are expecting going forward.\n\nQ: How bad was this market drop?\n\nA: Drops of 10 percent or more for stocks are regular occurrences but the speed with which this last correction struck was unusual. Only 19 times since World War II has the S&P 500 lost at least 10 percent in 10 days or fewer, according to strategists at UBS.\n\nBesides this month's sell-off, those rapid retreats include a drop in August 2015 sparked by worries about slowing economic growth for China and a plunge in August 2011 after the U.S. credit rating got downgraded from AAA and worries about Europe's debt crisis were near their peak.\n\nQ: What happened after the last such corrections?\n\nA: Months of muddling along.\n\nIn August 2015, the S&P 500 lost 11.1 percent in six days. That was followed by two straight days of big gains, each at least 2.4 percent, a sign that the worst could be over.\n\nBut stocks ended up bobbing higher and lower for months. The market recovered all its losses by November, only to fall back into correction territory again by the ensuing January. It took 15 months for the index to climb 5 percent above where it was when the August 2015 slide began.\n\nAfter the 2011 correction, where the S&P 500 fell 11.2 percent in three days, it took nearly three months for the index to claw back all its losses.\n\nQ: Before this month's drop, analysts were saying the stock market was expensive. Is it cheap now?\n\nA: It's cheaper, but not necessarily cheap.\n\nAnalysts look at several measures to gauge how expensive stocks are, and many of these measures are lower than they were a couple weeks ago but still above their long-term averages.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at 16.8 times its expected earnings over the coming 12 months, for example. That's a more attractive price-earnings ratio than the 18.6 it sported when the index set its record on Jan. 26. But it remains more expensive than its median of 14.8 over the last 15 years.\n\nBack in 2009, I knew that it couldn't go much lower because I'd never in my life seen valuations as good as they were, but we're not at that point yet, said David Brown, chief market strategist at Sabrient Systems.\n\nQ: So, is this most recent correction all over?\n\nA: In truth, no one knows. But many market pros say that they're confident the stock market will recover and eventually reach new heights. They don't see this as another market catastrophe like the Great Recession, which caused stock funds to lose half their value.\n\nI think the big one will come at some point, but typically to get a sustained drawdown you have to have a recession, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. We're not looking like we'll have one of those for at least six months.\n\nPlus, corporate earnings are going up. That helps make the market look less expensive. A stock's price-earnings ratio can go down in two ways: Either its price falls, or earnings rise. Both seem to be occurring now.\n\nA little more than two thirds of the companies in the S&P 500 index have reported how much they earned in the last three months of 2017, and they're on pace to show growth of 14 percent from a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nQ: What could trip things up?\n\nA: The threat of higher inflation — and of the Federal Reserve jacking up interest rates quickly in response — is what triggered this most recent sell-off.\n\nThat's why Wednesday's report on the consumer price index is circled on traders' calendars. If inflation proves to be higher than the market expects, it could trigger another sell-off in bonds that carries over into the stock market.\n\nOther highlighted events include Feb. 28, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a report on monetary policy to the House of Representatives, and March 21, when Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference following the Fed's next policy-making meeting.\n\nQ: Is everyone optimistic?\n\nA: No. Some skeptics say they would feel more comfortable if stocks had fallen enough to clearly qualify as cheap.\n\nAnd while most economists are confident the economy will keep growing in 2018, some investors are warning about the years following.\n\nThe risks of a recession in the next 18-24 months are rising, hedge fund titan Ray Dalio wrote in a recent post on LinkedIn, as the Federal Reserve feels more pressure to raise interest rates when wages are rising and a growing economy is getting more stimulus.\n\nWhile most market players are focusing on the strong 2018, we are focusing more on 2019 and 2020.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his entire Cabinet resigned Friday to take political responsibility for a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters. In a nationally televised speech, Rutte said he had informed King Willem-Alexander of his decision and pledged that his government would continue work to compensate affected parents as quickly as possible and to battle the coronavirus.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte rides a bicycle as he leaves a press conference in The Hague on January 15, 2021, following the resignation of his government over a scandal in which thousands of parents were falsely accused of benefit fraud. Photo by REMKO DE WAAL/ANP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWe are of one mind that if the whole system has failed, we all must take responsibility, and that has led to the conclusion that I have just offered the king, the resignation of the entire Cabinet, Rutte said.\n\nThe move was seen as largely symbolic; Rutte's government will remain in office in a caretaker mode until a new coalition is formed after a March 17 election in the Netherlands.\n\nThe resignation brings to an end a decade in office for Rutte, although his party is expected to win the election, putting him first in line to begin talks to form the next government. If he succeeds in forming a new coalition, Rutte would most likely again become prime minister.\n\nThe Netherlands is the third European country thrown into political uncertainty this week in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. In Estonia, the government resigned over a corruption scandal, while Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte's governing coalition is at risk of collapse after a small partner party withdrew its support.\n\nRutte said earlier this week that his government would be able to keep taking tough policy decisions in the battle against the coronavirus even if it were in caretaker mode. The Netherlands is in a tough lockdown until at least Feb. 9, and the government is considering imposing an overnight curfew amid fears about new, more contagious variants of the virus.\n\nTo the Netherlands I say: Our struggle against the coronavirus will continue, Rutte said.\n\nOn Thursday, the leader of the Dutch opposition Labor Party stepped down because he was minister of social affairs in a governing coalition led by Rutte when the country's tax office implemented a tough policy of tracking down fraud with child welfare.\n\nLodewijk Asscher's decision put further pressure on Rutte ahead of Friday's Cabinet meeting. Ministers were to decide on their reaction to a scathing report issued last month, titled Unprecedented Injustice, that said the tax office policies violated fundamental principles of the rule of law. The report also criticized the government for the way it provided information to parliament about the scandal.\n\nMany wrongfully accused parents were plunged into debt when tax officials demanded repayment of payments. The government has in the past apologized for the tax office's methods and in March earmarked 500 million euros ($607 million) to compensate more than 20,000 parents.\n\nOne of those parents waited near parliament as the Cabinet met and said she wanted it to resign.\n\nIt's important for me because it is the government acknowledging, 'We have made a mistake and we are taking responsibility,' because it's quite something what happened to us, Janet Ramesar told The Associated Press.\n\nRutte plans to lead his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy into the March election, and polls suggest it will win the most seats. That would put Rutte, who has been in office for a decade at the head of three different coalitions, first in line to attempt to form the next ruling coalition.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Kajsa Ollongren, who serves as interior minister, said as she entered Friday's meeting that it is very important to be accountable and also to show responsibility in the political sense, and we are going to talk about that in the Council of Ministers today.
Federal Reserve officials expressed growing concerns about the U.S. economy when they met last month, grappling with volatile stock markets, trade tensions and signs of slowing global growth. These threats made the future path of interest rate hikes less clear, they said.\n\nAccording to minutes of the Fed meeting Dec. 18-19, officials believed that with inflation still muted the central bank could afford to be patient about future rate hikes. A few Fed officials argued against hiking rates at the meeting, the account shows, although a rate hike was eventually approved unanimously.\n\nThe minute, which the Fed released on Wednesday, show there was more turmoil behind the scenes than was evident from Chairman Jerome Powell's even-keeled statement on Dec. 19 when he announced the fourth rate hike this year.\n\nWhile the Fed expounded on the strong economy, it trimmed its projection of possible rate hikes in 2019 from three down to two. But many private economists think the central bank may end up raising rates just once this year if the economy slows significantly.\n\nThe central bank's interest-rate hikes are likely on pause for a while and will be highly influenced by the economic data and evolution of key risks, notably those affecting financial markets and global growth, Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Economics, wrote in a note. Fed officials believe we are much closer to the end than the beginning of the tightening cycle.\n\nThe minutes note the contrast between the data on the U.S. economy, which show strong growth, and financial markets' fears of the future. That means Fed policy this year will ultimately take its cue from the economic data, which is still holding up surprisingly well, Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
Tonight on the CBS Evening News, we spoke with the Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams. The nation's top doctor told us the next 15 days are a critical inflection point in slowing the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. We have a choice to make, he said. Are we going to continue to see cases rise precipitously and deaths increase like Italy has or are we going to try to go the way of South Korea and China, where they really leaned into mitigation efforts and everyone pitched in to stop transmission?\n\nHere are our top takeaways from the interview:\n\n1. Children's playdates are not worth the risk\n\nWe wanted to know – based on the new guidelines to limit social contact: Are playdates safe? Dr. Adams advised against it for the time being: It's not worth the risk of our kids being spreaders and potentially taking it to someone else.\n\n2. You can be a transmitter of COVID-19 without showing symptoms\n\nCommon symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but some people don't exhibit symptoms at all. Dr. Adams says that even if you're asymptomatic, you could absolutely still transmit the virus to others. We know that the people who are most at risk are those with underlying medical conditions, especially seniors, people over the age of 60. We need to understand that the folks who are transmitting the virus across the planet and in our country are younger people.\n\n3. The nation's top doctor says he wouldn't fault any mayor or governor for shelter-in-place policies\n\nMore than seven million people in the San Francisco Bay Area have been advised to shelter in place, and on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was considering a similar policy there. Dr. Adams told us, As [Dr. Tony Fauci] says, 'if it seems like an overreaction right now, then you're probably about where you need to be.' Again, it's why the administration put out these guidelines for all of America — not just for certain areas, but for all of America — to look at the ways that they can prevent transmission of disease in their communities. I wouldn't fault any mayor, any governor for what they're considering in their communities. But at the very least, limit social gatherings to less than 10, stay at home if you can from work and avoid non-essential travel.\n\n4. If you're experiencing symptoms, a negative test result shouldn't change the way you behave\n\nAs tests for COVID-19 become more widely available, Dr. Adams cautions that a negative test shouldn't stop someone with symptoms from self-quarantining, because you could test negative, and still have coronavirus. You could still be early and you could still transmit it; so if you have symptoms, you should still isolate.\n\n5. Health care professionals see a decrease in blood donations across the country\n\nDr. Adams told us there has been a decrease in blood donations across the country since the outbreak began. While the CDC has cautioned against non-essential travel, they don't want to discourage people from visiting blood donation sites. We don't want people to not be able to get blood because they're scared of coronavirus.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned incoming Sen. Mitt Romney Wednesday that publicly opposing President Trump would hurt him and Utah. Graham, a critic-turned-ally of the president, responded to the opinion piece by Romney in The Washington Post saying that Mr. Trump has not risen to the mantle of the office.\n\nIf he's going to be the critic from Utah, it's going to hurt him and Utah, Graham said in an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio. Graham said that Mr. Trump is accessible and open to discussing policy. Graham has met with Mr. Trump to try to convince the president not to withdraw troops from Syria, although those attempts have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nHowever, Graham said, Mr. Trump would not be willing to work with Romney if he believes you are out to get him. Mr. Trump mocked Romney in a tweet on Wednesday morning, comparing him to former Sen. Jeff Flake, a frequent critic of the president.\n\nHere we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN! Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nGraham also said that those applauding Romney's opposition to Mr. Trump would turn on him as soon as he began casting conservative votes.\n\nWhat you got to learn from Kavanaugh, it's really not about Trump, it's about us. It's about conservatism, Graham said, referring to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct before his confirmation. Graham unloaded on Democrats during Kavanaugh's hearings, accusing them of cooking up allegations in response to the judge's conservatism.\n\nGraham also urged Romney to remember what they tried to do to you, possibly referring to criticism of Romney after he appeared to be in contention for the secretary of state post before Mr. Trump took office.\n\nRemember what they tried to do to you, Mitt. When they got through with you, you were a bad guy. The truth is you're a good guy, but in their world you will always be a bad guy if you cross them on policy, Graham said.
Ahead of President Obama's last State of the Union address, Republicans are once again blasting what the White House considers a key accomplishment of the president's foreign policy legacy: the Iran nuclear deal. And this time, they're warning that the international agreement could take down the U.S. oil industry.\n\nAs a consequence of President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran, this state sponsor of terrorism will now be able to increase its oil exports at a moment when our moderate Sunni allies, and their partners, feel increasingly threatened by Iranian belligerents, Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, said in a video released Saturday. As a result, Saudi Arabia has opened the spigot to maintain its own level of exports.\n\nThe GOP senator warned that these factors -- compounded with the threats of Russia and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- are actually working to undermine our energy industry.\n\nA huge part of Vladimir Putin's power base on the world stage is the fact that so much of Europe depends on oil and gas from Russia, Hoeven said. And [ISIS] is relying on oil and gas dollars to fund its brutal terrorist activities in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nThe chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Hoeven added that energy security is a vitally important part of national security.\n\nHoeven proposed taking more proactive steps to growing domestic oil production. He pointed to such legislative maneuvers like Congress' recent lifting of the U.S. ban on crude oil exports, which passed after GOP leaders struck a spending deal with Democrats that also extended renewable energy tax breaks.\n\nLow-cost energy makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board in all industry sectors, he said. You do that by building the kind of legal tax and regulatory climate that attracts investment, innovation and jobs. You do that by reforming the tax code to make it simpler, flatter and fairer so that the American people have the motivation to compete and win.\n\nIn his own video, Mr. Obama championed initiatives that have helped prop up another industry tied heavily to U.S. oil production: America's auto manufacturers.\n\nI placed my bet on American manufacturing, Mr. Obama said in the Saturday video. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. We got labor and management to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure.\n\nHe touted the fruits of the auto industry bailout, countering critics who called it a road to socialism and a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nSince our plan went into effect, our automakers have added more than 640,000 new jobs, Mr. Obama said. We've cut the Detroit-area unemployment rate by more than half. The Big Three automakers are raising wages.\n\nToday, the president said, the American auto industry is back.\n\nThe president also previewed his trip to Detroit later this month to visit the city's annual auto show, saying his attendance would allow him to see this progress firsthand.
The Department of Justice has acknowledged problems with several facts in a report last year that was designed to defend a ban on travel from some foreign countries. However, the DOJ said it would not be retracting or correcting the study.\n\nIn January 2018, the DOJ issued a report called Executive Order 13780: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States Initial Section 11 Report. It provided a defense for President Donald Trump's executive order that limited travel to the U.S. from countries deemed connected to terrorism.\n\nThe executive order was challenged in courts and revised several times, but the most recent version was upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2018 and restricts entry into the U.S. from Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.\n\nThe 11-page study, commissioned as part of the executive order, linked immigration and terrorism. Less than a month after its publication, the report was challenged in a petition by Protect Democracy and several research groups, including The Brookings Institution and the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThe report's primary conclusion was that 73 percent of individuals convicted in U.S. courts of international terrorism-related offenses between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2016 were foreign-born. But it failed to note that those convictions weren't necessarily related to events that happened in the United States, said Ben Berwick, a Department of Justice alum and current counsel for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit watchdog group. The figure was actually in reference to the percentage of foreign-born individuals who had been brought to the U.S. to be convicted of terrorism acts internationally.\n\nIt immediately jumped out to me as more of a propaganda piece than a factual report, which is exactly what it turned out to be by their own admission, Berwick said in a telephone interview with CBS News on Friday.\n\nIn another instance, the agency's report claimed that in a six-year window, 70,000 immigrants in the U.S. had been convicted for gender-based violence, like sexual assault and domestic violence. In fact, there had been 70,000 gender-based offenses by immigrants in a 55-year window.\n\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Michael Allen, the author of letter, dismissed the mischaracterizations, claiming they were mere editorials errors but added that the DOJ appreciates being made aware of such errors so that they will not be repeated.\n\nIn their petition, the watchdog and research groups found nine major areas of concern in the DOJ's report, including source transparency issues, misquoted studies and cherry-picked and unrepresentative examples.\n\nThe DOJ says that information in the Report could be criticized.\n\nThis is representative of this administration's sometimes blasé attitude towards the truth, Berwick said. It's clear that this report was issued to advance a particular policy agenda, regardless of what's actually the truth.\n\nIn the petition, filed in February 2018 to the federal agencies that oversee immigration, said the misleading nature and inaccuracies put it at odds with the Information Quality Act, a 2001 measure that holds federal agencies responsible for disseminating accurate, objective information.\n\nIn other words, truthfulness is more than a good idea for government reports. It's required by law.\n\nThe petition was rejected and the groups fought back with an official administrative appeal. There's also a lawsuit pending in Massachusetts against the report by the same watchdogs which had been put on pause while the Department of Justice reviewed the administrative appeal. Now that the agency has rejected the appeal, Protect Democracy hasn't decided yet what its next steps will be, Berwick said.\n\nA call and email to the Department of Justice were not immediately returned. The agency's website said that media requests may not be handled until the government reopens from the partial federal shutdown.
It sure feels like maybe, just maybe, stocks will never go down again as Wall Street enjoys a rip-roaring start to 2018.\n\nThe dynamics are familiar: The U.S. economy is strong and about to enjoy a boost from the implementation of the GOP's new tax cuts, inflation remains tepid, the Federal Reserve's rate hike campaign is proceeding cautiously and corporate earnings growth has been solid.\n\nBut a number of new dynamics loom in 2018. Here are three questions investors need to ponder:\n\nAre we headed for a melt-up?\n\nWith the S&P 500's gain on Monday, stocks have risen 2.8 percent for the new year, risng in every session so far. According to Jeff Hirsch at the Almanac Trader, this performance -- along with the solid run to end 2017 -- suggests 2018 will be great for investors. Over the last 39 years, when stocks performed this well, the rest of the year showed gains 87 percent of the time, with an average rise of 14 percent.\n\nEven long-time market skeptics like GMO's Jeremy Grantham said markets could be headed for a near-term melt-up scenario. In a letter to investors, he wondered if stocks are entering the final, most ebullient phase of this long bull move.\n\nJason Geopfert at SentimenTrader noted that the gains are part of a globally synchronized market displaying extreme momentum. The weekly Relative Strength Index across six major worldwide stock indexes is now at the highest level in history. Such extreme readings have in the past been associated with further gains -- the type of melt-up move Grantham warns of.\n\nWhy a warning? Because such a move means we are probably down to the last few months of the bull market, according to Grantham.\n\nWill the Fed put finally end?\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) analysts noted that in 2017, for the first time, Federal Reserve policymakers stuck to their guns and tightened interest rates in three quarter-point increments -- a much more rapid pace than what bond traders expected at the start of the year.\n\nPreviously, the Fed always lowered its tightening plans to match market expectations in fear of repeating 2013's taper tantrum episode during which long-term interest rates rose rapidly. That has changed now as the Fed's velvet glove treatment has resulted in financial conditions -- when measured broadly -- being easier now than when the central bank's tightening campaign started in 2015.\n\nThis deferral to the market is widely known as the Fed put -- the idea that maintaining market calm overrides monetary policy desires. But it could be ending.\n\nFed officials have penciled in another trio of quarter-point hikes for 2018. But the futures market assigns only 30 percent odds for that outcome. According to traders, the more likely outcome -- at 60 percent odds -- is that the Fed is forced to back down and raises rates no more than twice.\n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs (GS) is far more aggressive, warning clients that it expects four quarter-point rate hikes in 2018 as inflation heats up.\n\nWill the U.S. dollar continue to weaken?\n\nThe good old greenback hasn't been faring so well lately. It has fallen 4 percent from its early November high and is down 12 percent from December 2016. Watch for a possible decline to lows not seen since 2014 as the dollar gets battered by a combination of higher oil prices, rising inflation and a creeping sense the Fed has been too slow in its policy normalization.\n\nAlso factoring in is the excitement in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ripple, which are widely seen as private-market alternatives -- safe havens, even -- from government-backed fiat currencies.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a rapidly weakening dollar would undermine the Goldilocks conditions that have allowed the Fed to take it slow by pushing inflation higher, via everything from higher import prices to a tailwind behind commodity prices like crude oil.
Uber Technnologies has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging the ride-hailing company discriminated against women and minorities.\n\nThe proposed settlement comes as a number of Silicon Valley companies grapple with gender, racial and other diversity issues.\n\nThe complaint, filed on behalf of more than 400 female and minority software engineers, claims that Uber created a hostile working environment and discriminated on the basis of race, gender and nationality.\n\nThis settlement involves claims dating back to July 2013 and, while we are continually improving as a company, we have proactively made a lot of changes since then, an Uber spokesman said in a statement.\n\nOver the past year, Uber has implemented a new compensation policy, revamped its performance review process, issued its first diversity report and taken other steps to make the company more hospitable to employees, the spokesman added.\n\nUber last year fired more than 20 people after an internal investigation into the company's culture following allegations of sexual harassment, bullying an other issues.\n\nIn their suit, former Uber software developers Roxanna Del Toro Lopez and Ana Medina accused the company of paying other women and minority engineers less than their male peers for equal work. They also said Uber promoted them more slowly and provided biased performance evaluations compared with white and Asian male engineers. The two filed suit in San Francisco Superior Court in in October of 2017.\n\nUnder the settlement, Uber has committed to improving its compensation and promotion practices, according to the ruling. That includes implementing a better system for assessing which workers merit promotion, as well as offering mentorship and skill development opportunities to women and people of color.\n\nThe tech industry has faced scrutiny for its labor practices, with a number of companies reacting by taking steps to protect women and minorities. Uber rival Lyft said Tuesday it will implement an annual audit by an independent firm to ensure employees are fairly paid compared with their peers, according to CNET.
In an interview with Intelligence Matters host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, former deputy Secretary of State and deputy National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama Antony Blinken weighs in on the Trump administration's foreign policy decisions in some of the world's top geopolitical hotspots.\n\nBlinken evaluates the opportunities seized, squandered and still ahead in countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, North Korea and China. A former national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, Blinken also discusses what Biden's foreign policy might look like, should he run for president.\n\nFor much more from their conversation, read the interview transcript here and subscribe to Intelligence Matters here.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nThe U.S.-Saudi relationship has been roiled in recent months by the murder, in Turkey, of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by a team of Saudi citizens. After leveling sanctions on 17 Saudis allegedly involved in Khashoggi's killing, President Trump and members of his administration largely stood by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- despite U.S. intelligence indicating the prince had ordered the assassination. In December, a bipartisan majority of senators voted to condemn the crown prince for his actions and to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\n\nI think the administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to use a horrific, terrible event – the murder of this journalist, Khashoggi – to use that as a way to influence Saudi behavior and Saudi policies in a way that better reflects our interests and our values, Blinken said.\n\nHe told Morell that the president and his team may have squandered a moment to issue a check on one of the kingdom's most powerful, but still young and impulsive, leaders. The leverage the administration might have had in bringing an end to the Yemen conflict and to a diplomatic impasse with Qatar also appears to have dissipated, Blinken said.\n\nSaudi Arabia seems to have a blank check, he told Morell. This is not about ending the alliance or the partnership with Saudi Arabia. It is making sure the alliance actually reflects our interests and our values – not just Saudi Arabia's.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nIn late 2018, Mr. Trump issued an order to pull more than 7,000 troops out of Afghanistan, where the U.S. has maintained a military for more than 17 years. Mr. Trump had long campaigned on bringing American soldiers home from what has become the longest war in American history, but his military advisors urged a more gradual timeline – especially as the Taliban are known to have regained strength and territory, and as airstrikes and suicide bombings made 2018 the deadliest recorded year for Afghan civilians.\n\nI actually think President Trump's instincts are probably right on this, Blinken said. It's time. It's time to cut the cord.\n\nHe told Morell that, while he had concerns about wholesale U.S. withdrawal, the international community had, over the years, made material improvements in the lives of Afghans. The bottom line, hard reality is, Blinken said, that we were there because of 9/11 and because of al Qaeda.\n\n[T]hat threat has been, if not eliminated, significantly reduced to the point where I think it can be contained without having 15,000 Americans in Afghanistan, he told Morell.\n\nRussia\n\nPerhaps one of the administration's most visibly bifurcated diplomatic approaches has been toward Russia. The Trump administration has implemented some of the strongest and most sweeping sanctions yet against Russian president Vladimir Putin's government, his acolytes and their businesses, but Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, downplayed his efforts to undermine U.S. elections, and denied links between Trump's campaign and Russian nationals – though dozens of contacts are known to have occurred.\n\nPutin is playing a losing hand brilliantly, Blinken said. Russia, by virtually every metric, is actually in decline. And yet, he succeeded in reasserting Russia on the world stage to some extent to distract from problems at home.\n\nAmong the most effective deterrents to Russian aggression, he argued, has been continued support for NATO and pressure on Russia for its incursions in non-NATO member Ukraine. I think sustaining that is important. And we've sustained it. And the Trump administration, despite what the president says, the administration itself has sustained it.\n\nMore measures, including an effective deterrence policy, are necessary, Blinken said, especially since the influence campaign conducted by Russia in 2016 failed to become a unifying issue for much of the country.\n\nThis should have brought people together because the attack is not on Democrats or on Republicans or anyone else; it's on our democracy, he said. That's the one thing that should unite us. And, unfortunately, that's what we're losing right now.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nLast year began with the president deriding the size of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's nuclear button and ended with a lookahead to a second, in-person summit between the two. Mr. Trump is known to have maintained a cordial, if not warm, personal correspondence with Kim, all while the North Korean leader has offered little evidence of his intention to take steps toward denuclearization. The administration is reportedly scouting potential sites for a new summit between the two leaders in 2019.\n\nI think that there was some merit in President Trump throwing the deck of cards up in the air and seeing what came from it, Blinken said, because the fact of the matter is the policy that successive administrations have pursued over the last decades has not worked.\n\nStill, Blinken said, the lack of progress evident in North Korea's stated intention to eliminate some or all of its nuclear arsenal over the more than 6 months since the leaders' historic first summit may mean the new approach isn't quite working.\n\n[I]n elevating Kim Jong Un, in declaring success and even saying, at one point, that the nuclear problem was resolved, the president gave a green light to over countries – starting with China – to go back to something approaching business as usual, Blinken said. He noted that the maximum pressure campaign, which had been paying dividends, has now been effectively eroded by other countries' non-compliance with sanctions on North Korea.\n\nThe hard reality is it's, if not impossible, highly unlikely that we will achieve, in any near term, the complete denuclearization of North Korea. I just don't see that as realistic in the near term, Blinken said. What I think we can get is an arms control and, over time, disarmament process put in place. But that requires enough pressure, sustained and comprehensive to get North Korea to the table.\n\nI give [Mr. Trump] some points for trying a different playbook, but the way he's played it, I think, is making things worse, not better, Blinken told Morell.\n\n\n\nChina\n\nAn overwhelming number of intelligence, defense and law enforcement officials have said in recent months that China poses the thorniest and most significant long-term strategic challenge to the United States. As the intelligence community and Justice Department have issued warnings about – and, in some cases, indictments of – Chinese efforts to engage in economic espionage and intellectual property theft, the Trump administration has ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods in a protracted trade war whose economic effects have been felt in both countries.\n\nThe president was right to confront the issue of unfair trade practices, Blinken said, the lack of reciprocity in the commercial relationship was totally unsustainable.\n\nBut Mr. Trump was profoundly wrong in the way he has gone about changing Chinese behavior, Blinken added, starting with the huge strategic mistake of leaving the multi-nation, Trans-Pacific Partnership crafted during the Obama administration.\n\n[N]ow, we're stuck in a different dynamic, Blinken said, And that is a veering wildly between confrontation on the one hand, and abdication on the other hand.\n\nAs the U.S. has pulled back from other multilateral engagements, Blinken said, it has created a leadership vacuum that, in some instances, Chinese president Xi Jinping has sought to fill himself – something Blinken called a profound irony.\n\nIn the absence of American leadership, in the absence of an American model, he said, a Chinese model could win by default – not because it's better.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- It was a simple letter, with a simple request.\n\nIs it possible that in 10 years that you could meet us on this bridge?\n\nThe request to meet came from two Chinese parents who had abandoned their second-born child in a Chinese market. They had violated China's one-child policy, and their child -- Kati -- was adopted by Ken and Ruth Pohler.\n\nIt was so heartfelt. And we thought, 'Oh my, these birth parents went through a difficult time, Ken remembered.\n\nKen and Ruth Pohler CBS News\n\nThe Pohlers never forgot that note with Kati's Chinese name. When she turned 10 in 2005, they sent a messenger to the bridge. Kati's birth father was there, and by chance, a Chinese TV crew captured him on tape.\n\nHolding a sign. The name on the sign was the name in the note, said Changfu Chang, a filmmaker.\n\nAs a child, Kati Pohler said she wanted to know where she came from CBS News\n\nHe was so compelled by the story, he made a documentary about it. The story became famous in China, but back in the U.S., the Pohlers remained silent.\n\nWhen I was little, I would ask my mom like, whose tummy did I come from, said Kati Pohler. I realized that I didn't come from her tummy.\n\nBut the Pohlers didn't tell Kati until she was 20.\n\nThey told my brothers about it. So I was the only one left in the dark, she said.\n\nKati Pohler got to meet her birth parents in China at 22 CBS News\n\nShe admits that made her upset, but this summer, Kati finally got a chance to meet her birth parents a week after her 22nd birthday when she traveled to China. It was a reunion made all the more overwhelming by the barriers of both language and culture.\n\nThey are very real to me now, said Kati.
MADISON, Wis. -- A federal investigation into troubling evidence of unexplained injuries to newborn babies in a Wisconsin hospital could lead to termination of its Medicare payments contract. Five newborns UnityPoint Health-Meriter hospital in Madison were found to have injuries ranging from bruising on their arms and legs to a broken arm and even a skull fracture, according to investigators from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The hospital didn't do enough to protect patients and prevent suspected abuse in its Newborn Intensive Care Unit, investigators said.\n\nA document obtained by CBS Madison affiliate WISC-TV shows that investigators from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) concluded patients were in immediate jeopardy last year.\n\nThe immediate jeopardy began on April 12, 2017 when the facility failed to protect and thoroughly investigate the first report of an injury of unknown origin for patient #4, placing all patients in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit at risk for serious harm or injury, CMS said in the document.\n\nInterviews with physicians and nurses in the facility show a timeline that began with concerns on Feb. 2 of unexplained bruising to a baby. Those concerns continued throughout the week with questions about injuries to additional babies. The documents show a child abuse expert wasn't called until Feb. 8, six days after that first report.\n\nMadison police said they were notified of the unexplained injuries on Feb. 9 and began an investigation.\n\nCMS documents show its interviews with nurses and physicians and review of patient files found additional documented concerns about injuries to babies in the NICU going back to April of 2017, with at least one mother taking pictures of unexplained bruises to her child.\n\nInterview with Director of Performance B on February 16, 2018 at 2:12 p.m. stated there was no policy or process that guided the staff or physicians how to report abuse or neglect, CMS said in a statement.\n\nThe hospital suspended one employee Feb. 8 of this year and implemented increased security after sharing the concerns with police. A plan of correction submitted by UnityPoint-Meriter shows a security officer is assigned to the NICU entrance and cameras are now in place in all NICU rooms.\n\nThe Wisconsin State Journal reports the suspended employee is the nurse who cared for the infants involved.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, CMS determined Meriter was out of compliance with a condition that requires it to protect and promote each patient's rights, WISC reports. CMS told the station it had accepted an initial plan of correction from Meriter, but issued the contract termination notice after additional issues surfaced.\n\nDuring the course of the recent survey other levels of non-compliance were discovered, said CMS spokesperson Elizabeth Schinderle. As a result, CMS finalized the full survey report and issued it to the facility yesterday, March 7. They now have the opportunity to submit another plan of correction (POC) which CMS will then review. If that POC is found to be acceptable, the next step in the process would be an unannounced, on-site survey.\n\nBecause of this immediate threat to patient health and safety, the Medicare program will not make payment for patient services on or after May 24.\n\nA spokesperson for Meriter said the hospital was working with authorities in the review of the NICU.\n\nWe have successfully worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to address their most immediate concerns and we continue to work on a longer term corrective action plan for their review, said Jessika Kasten, with UnityPoint Health-Meriter. We have implemented enhanced safety measures, and our commitment to provide safe care to our patients and families has never been stronger.
ALBANY, N.Y.- Parents can legally eavesdrop on young children if they reasonably believe it would be in the child's best interest, the state's highest court ruled Tuesday, establishing an exception to New York law against wiretaps without the consent of at least one person on a call.\n\nThe 4-3 ruling by the Court of Appeals involved a cellphone recording of a man threatening to beat the 5-year-old son of his live-in girlfriend. The boy's father recorded the conversation.\n\nThe father had a good faith, objectively reasonable basis to believe that it was necessary for the welfare of his son to record the violent conversation he found himself listening to, Judge Eugene Fahey wrote for the majority. He cautioned that the ruling shouldn't be interpreted as a way to avoid criminal liability for wiretaps when a parent acts in bad faith.\n\nThe live-in boyfriend, Anthony Badalamenti, was later convicted of child endangerment, assault and weapon possession. His attorney challenged the tape as inadmissible evidence from illegal eavesdropping.\n\nFahey cautioned that courts must consider the age and maturity of the child in considering parental eavesdropping. He didn't specify an age. A key question is whether the child is capable of formulating well-reasoned judgments of his or her own, he wrote.\n\nChief Judge Janet DiFiore and Judges Eugene Pigott Jr. and Michael Garcia agreed with Fahey.\n\nIn a dissent, Judge Leslie Stein wrote that the issue raises many policy concerns that should be left to the Legislature, with implications for divorce and custody disputes, criminal proceedings against the minor or others, juvenile delinquency and any other dispute within families.\n\nEven in this case, the father didn't notify authorities or share the tape until after Badalamenti and the boy's mother were arrested months later when neighbors heard screaming and crying and called police, Stein wrote. The majority's ruling fails to answer whether a parent can eavesdrop over the explicit refusal of an older child who's talking to his or her other parent, she wrote.\n\nJudges Jenny Rivera and Sheila Abdus-Salaam joined Stein's dissent.\n\nCalls to Nassau County prosecutors and Badalamenti's attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nThe New York court said this vicarious consent doctrine was adopted by a federal court in Utah in 1993 and the federal appeals court in Cincinnati in 2008.
The Trump administration introduced this week a sweeping relaxation of environmental laws and fines during the coronavirus pandemic. According to new guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), companies will largely be exempt from consequences for polluting the air or water during the outbreak.\n\nIn a letter to all government and private sector partners on Thursday, the EPA's Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Susan Parker Bodine said that the agency does not expect power plants, factories or other companies to meet environmental standards and reporting of pollution during this time — and it won't pursue penalties if companies break the rules.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, companies are required to report when they release certain levels of pollution into the air or water. Now, the EPA has effectively ceded its federal authority to state offices and said companies will be responsible for monitoring their own air and water pollution during this time.\n\nIn general, the EPA does not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the EPA agrees that COVID-19 was the cause of the noncompliance and the entity provides supporting documentation to the EPA upon request, Bodine wrote.\n\nPolluters will be able to avoid penalties for breaking environmental laws if they claim that the violations were in some way related to the pandemic. The agency asked companies to minimize the effects and duration of any noncompliance and act responsibly during this period.\n\nEPA is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes the challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from COVID-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements, said EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in a press release.\n\nThe guidance applies retroactively beginning March 13 and extends indefinitely.\n\nAn EPA spokesperson said the policy applies to compliance monitoring and reporting and is not a nationwide waiver of environmental rules. The spokesperson added that in other situations, the agency would take the pandemic into account on a case by case basis.\n\nBut critics of the new guidelines argue the relaxed laws will result in more pollution and make it difficult to assess the resulting environmental damage. More air pollution not only leads to a warmer climate, but it can also cause major respiratory issues, among other health problems — potentially putting the communities who live near these facilities at an increased risk for contracting COVID-19.\n\nThis is an open license to pollute. Plain and simple, Gina McCarthy, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council and former EPA Administrator, said in a press release. The administration should be giving its all toward making our country healthier right now. Instead, it is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health. We can all appreciate the need for additional caution and flexibility in a time of crisis, but this brazen directive is an abdication of the EPA's responsibility to protect our health.\n\nSeveral environmental organizations put out statements opposing the new guidelines.\n\nAt a time when communities across the country are desperately trying to clean up polluted waters and one-third of wildlife species are at a heightened risk of extinction, this misguided rule places our drinking water, our wildlife and our nation's way of life further at risk, said Collin O'Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, in a statement.\n\nAs the country focuses on protecting public health and safety from COVID-19, Donald Trump and Andrew Wheeler are exploiting this pandemic to make toxic pollution legal, said Michael Brune, Executive Director of environmental organization the Sierra Club, in a statement. This illegal and reckless action will not go unchecked.\n\nWheeler defended the move on Twitter Friday, saying the EPA is working to protect public health and the environment while providing a small degree of flexibility during these extraordinary times.
As the U.S. government's partial shutdown stretched into its 21st day Friday, federal workers who've been furloughed or forced to work without pay are scrambling to avoid getting dinged by lenders and credit-reporting agencies for skipping loan payments that could damage their credit scores. Missing just one payment on a credit card can knock up to 100 points off a consumer's credit score, and it can take several years to recover, according to experts.\n\nSome lenders, including banks and auto-leasing companies, say they are working to accommodate government employees who are not receiving paychecks, but their concessions vary, and some government workers tell CBS MoneyWatch they are struggling to negotiate deals with their creditors.\n\nThe general flavor of what we have heard is creditors are waiving late fees, offering the opportunity to skip a payment, or offering short-term interest-free loans to federal workers that come with a grace period on repayment, said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Unfortunately, the landscape of concessions is widely varied.\n\nJust ask Jeffery Davis, 35, who has worked since 2009 as an air traffic controller in Malden, Massachusetts. The married father of three leases two cars, an Infiniti and BMW. He said BMW has allowed him to defer payment on his car lease for two months, but he reports his second lessor is less flexible.\n\nDavis said he tried to see if they're willing to delay payments or even take the lease back early -- they could write off how little I have to pay off -- but they said there's nothing they can do right now.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who insists funding be secured to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the government reopens, has said the closure could last months or even a year. With no end in sight, federal employees like Davis are anxious.\n\nWith things the way they are, tensions as high as they are right now, it kind of worries me. Things that Trump has said, this could go on for a year, Davis said.\n\nAnd while many lenders say they're committed to helping customers who have missed payments, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday called on commercial banks to offer furloughed workers interest-free loans that allow them to pay their bills on time. She cited past shutdowns that concluded with workers receiving back pay after the government reopened. Since there is a guarantee that they will be getting paid, I would hope that the commercial banks, the banks in our country, would follow the lead of some of the credit unions by giving interest-free loans right now to these families so that they can pay their bills on time, Pelosi said.\n\nThe existing credit-reporting system puts the onus on lenders to approve repayment plans that help consumers avoid taking hits on their credit reports, according to Eric Ellman, senior vice president for public policy and legal affairs of the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), which represents consumer reporting agencies.\n\nThe CDIA issued a notice to lenders reminding them of a code they can use when reporting consumers in forbearance to the three leading credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Under a forbearance agreement, a lender temporarily suspends owed loan payments. It will hopefully give consumers a break who are affected by the shutdown, Ellman said.\n\nTransUnion said it is helping guide lenders to use the forbearance code that will help give people a break on their credit during this difficult time.\n\nFICO -- the best-known company assessing whether people are creditworthy -- depends on credit-reporting agencies' consumer borrowing and payment histories in calculating individuals' credit scores. But experts say it wouldn't be easy for FICO to overhaul its model for evaluating credit risks in response to the shutdown.\n\nIt's kind of immaterial what FICO is doing -- their [scoring] model has long been built, and it's not systemically possible for them to just 'do something,'  said credit-scoring expert John Ulzheimer, formerly of FICO and Equifax.\n\nA call for comment from FICO owner Fair Isaac Corp. was not returned.\n\nFlorence Weston, who works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and who has been furloughed since Dec. 22, said she is relying on savings to make her monthly car payment and handle other bills. Still, she worries that the ripple effects of the shutdown -- and possibly numerous weeks of no paychecks -- will deplete her funds.\n\nI had to tap into my savings account to pay my mortgage, but I also have my car notes and my mortgage next month. Everything is only two to three weeks away and right now we are not being paid.\n\nOther government workers say their lenders are working with them. Brandon Miller, a Federal Aviation Administration controller in Potomac, Maryland, said the United Services Automobile Association, where he banks, has been completely open to what I have needed, including allowing him to delay payment on his credit card for a full month.\n\nAnd SkyOne Federal Credit Union, which represents air transportation employees, is offering $5,000 loans that are interest-free if they are repaid within 90 days.\n\nWe have had a lot of help that way, he said.\n\n-- With reporting from Irina Ivanova\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story contained a complaint from a furloughed government worker about his lender Mariner Finance. Mariner Finance tells CBS MoneyWatch the company immediately moved to mitigate his loan terms once it learned of his situation. We have long had policies in place to address hardship deferments and those policies do indeed apply to customers impacted by the federal government shutdown, Mariner Finance said in a statement. We know that the government closure is creating difficulty for some of our customers, and we are actively working with our customers to meet their needs with dignity and respect.
