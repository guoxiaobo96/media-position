ed o'keefe: this is biden. and biden said in response to her, what's her name? give me her number. he had an aide get her phone number. the next day he called this woman's mother and they talked for about ten minutes and he asked, so you think i should run? yes, absolutely, you should, and if you do i will volunteer for you. and he asked her all these reasons why. that happens. and they're all doing this. it's got to be tremendous for their ego. but whether or not it actually results in them running and taking the plunge, you know, is another matter because they have to factor in, can i stand up against somebody like elizabeth warren--
ed o'keefe: you know, to your point about campaigning in congress, that panel, discussion you had with those freshmen members, three of those four replaced republicans and will go home in 2020 and run again in districts that favor republican candidates. to-- to watch those kinds of democrats now in congress twist in the wind as candidates go out and talk about a progressive tax rate, medicare for all, agreeing with the president maybe we should withdraw all our forces from syria.
senator lindsey graham: and it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only god knows what they go through to get here. the democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--
i hear vice president biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, buttigieg said thursday at a town hall in decorah. but history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like donald trump, who is new in kind. buttigieg then pivoted to sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who favors medicare for all and free college tuition at public universities.
another officer who opened fire, brett hankison, had already been fired from the force for blindly firing shots into taylor's apartment from outside. he was charged criminally with endangering taylor's neighbors when bullets flew into their unit. no one has been charged in taylor's death. kentucky attorney general daniel cameron said cosgrove and another officer who opened fire, sergeant jon mattingly, were justified in their actions because they were returning the shot fired by walker.
representative max rose: bring some rowboats to the navy? we can put trump's name on it. this is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? let's get back to work. it's why we all ran and i know it's what the republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. and i promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. this is not political suicide.
mark landler: yeah. no, the president said in essence that the soviet union has been right to invade afghanistan. he offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. he said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. and-- and he also attributed the collapse of the soviet union to their misadventures in afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of soviet union. but to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, i think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing american troops from foreign conflicts. i think it's--
margaret brennan: but is the president open--
shannon pettypiece: he-- he did what he said. and they feel like that's a strong hand to run on.
in her letter to cosgrove, gentry wrote the detective failed to follow procedure when he didn't activate his body camera. gentry said cosgrove had attempted to explain his actions during a pre-termination meeting by referencing information about the effects an imminent threat can have on an officer's performance. but she wrote, i cannot justify your conduct or in good conscience recommend anything less than termination.
we will turn now to south carolina republican senator lindsey graham who joins us from clemson. senator graham is someone, as we've been describing, who-- who speaks to the president, often shares his advice. senator, did you speak to the president this weekend about this shutdown?
ed o'keefe: it's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for president and their party. and it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them.
representative colin allred: i think-- i think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. i think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. i think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and i think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.
margaret brennan: --if you think the president--
representative max rose: but here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. it's just different political parties run-- won. if you think about what donald trump ran on, okay? if you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, i know. but he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect medicare and social security, draining the swamp. we ran on many of those same things, the american people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. and now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it.
senator dick durbin: well, i would just say, do you remember the president's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the mexicans. how many times did he say that to the american people? that is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.
senator lindsey graham: if the left is going to--
margaret brennan: so from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like there is any progress. how close are we to ending this shutdown?
bernie sanders' first tv ads to air in super tuesday states are up today in california and texas. in a 30-second ad aired in dallas and los angeles this morning for the first time, sanders talks about the rich getting tax breaks while the middle class continue to struggle. that's what happens when billionaires are able control the political system, sanders says on camera.
dan balz: and-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. so whatever that means. and i think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. it feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. i win, you lose.
margaret brennan: and other potential candidates near their own decisions.
margaret brennan: so, speaker pelosi has called the wall an immorality. she said, no way, no how, is the president going to get money for it. that's a pretty hard line position versus where the president is. do you find any room for compromise in the middle?
margaret brennan: so you would be open--
bustos also said after he dropped out, beto o'rourke reached out to the dccc offering his help if needed. the dccc themselves have reached out to several former presidential candidates, such as senators kamala harris and cory booker and secretary julian castro, about potential involvement in the house election cycle. where ever it makes sense, you bring people in where they're going to resonate well, she said.
margaret brennan: it's a first step.
senator dick durbin: i don't see that. but i will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. the president could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. but he said, no, i'm going to shut down my own government. that's what he's done.
a popular clergyman has announced his bid to run as a democrat in the special election for u.s. senate in georgia. cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson reports that reverend ralphael warnock, the pastor of martin luther king jr.'s ebenezer baptist church, announced his u.s. senate bid thursday in a twitter video. warnock is the first high-profile candidate to enter the race.
senator lindsey graham: yeah i think so.
margaret brennan: --to voting for increased border security beyond the 1.3 billion that all of you signed off on already?
senator dick durbin: they did not cross the border. the solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. and this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.
in a meeting with reporters on thursday, democratic congressional campaign committee chair cheri bustos detailed the party's million-dollar national cable ad buy, which is meant to set a dialogue about healthcare and the senate's inaction on the house's h.r. 3 bill, which aims to lower prescription drug prices.
representative max rose: --that realizes the fact that politics is what matters here, it's the united states military's job to provide that room for diplomacy to take its action.
representative max rose: i'm supporting mikie.
margaret brennan: shannon, i mean, is that the calculus? we didn't really hear answers from either of the senators about what to do about these hundreds of thousands of american workers--
gentry wrote in a dec. 30 letter to mattingly that he had been exonerated after an investigation into whether he violated the department's use of force and de-escalation policies.
mark landler: so did obama. and so do-- as you say many democrats. what i don't think has been tested maybe at least i'd love to see it--
margaret brennan: and all of you are willing to do that?
representative max rose: the room for compromise is talking about how we can deal with the crises that we are currently facing. right now at our ports of entry fentanyl and other very serious drugs is just streaming right in. we don't--
representative max rose: i think that we have serious issues throughout the country. the point here is that what i'm not willing to do is spend billions of dollars on what amounts to a vanity project--a fifth century solution to a twenty-first century problem. what, you want to also bring horses back to the united states cavalry?
thursday democratic presidential candidate and former new york mayor michael bloomberg released his super bowl ad, in a spot that the campaign says highlights the urgent need to prevent gun violence in america, according to cbs news campaign reporter tim perry.
senator dick durbin: no. as a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between vice president pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the president's latest demand might be. but vice president pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. and then within a matter of hours, the president reversed and said, no, it has to be 5.6. that's what we're up against. there doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. if we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the united states overstayed visas.
we'll be right back in a moment.
margaret brennan: we'd like to welcome our reporters' panel now for some political analysis, dan balz is the chief correspondent for the washington post, ed o'keefe is the political correspondent right here at cbs news, shannon pettypiece is a white house reporter for bloomberg news and mark landler covers the white house and foreign policy for-- at the new york times. so, ed, i'll start with you. did you hear any points of agreement or were democrats and republicans just talking past each other on the show?
representative colin allred: well, i certainly like my former boss, julian castro--
senator dick durbin (minority whip/@senatordurbin/d-illinois): well, i can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. this is the first president in history who shut down his own government. unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. as of next friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. this is totally unnecessary. and that's a point we've made over and over to this president, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for america.
senator lindsey graham: i think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. we're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, i don't see anything happening.
margaret brennan: --because that's significant what you said there--
margaret brennan: thank you very much for this conversation. i wish you all luck as lawmakers. welcome to washington.
equality california, the state's largest lgbtq civil rights organization, and its recently-launched nevada partner silver state equality announced thursday they would be backing pete buttigieg after an unanimous vote by the groups' endorsement committee. cbs news campaign reporter alex tin says the former south bend mayor can use all the help he can get as early voting kicks off in california, where buttigieg has failed to crack double digits in recent polls of the super tuesday contest.
margaret brennan: when is that going to be put on the table? that offer.
margaret brennan: well, thank you very much, senator.
representative mikie sherrill (d-new jersey/@repsherrill): well, i don't think it's a waste of time. we voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the senate, within the last month. and so i think what we're asking congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.
in the termination letter, gentry cited cosgrove's statements to internal investigators in which he described seeing a distorted shadowy mass and flashes of big light. gentry said the statements made it clear that cosgrove did not properly identify a threat, as department policy requires, before firing 16 shots.
ed o'keefe: yeah. i mean, senator warren was the first-- second to do it actually, julian castro, the former hud secretary, was the first before christmas, and will make it official next weekend. but where is everybody else? you might ask. and-- and they are still mulling it. i think we have at least seven democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, governor inslee of washington state said this week he's still thinking about it. so you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, i'm still thinking about it. unless you think it's just empty talk, i-- i heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.
meanwhile, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson notes that at a speech in newton, iowa, biden spoke about the importance of 2020 democrats focusing on mr. trump and not swinging at each other. the former vice president said we shouldn't let this democratic race slide into negative attacks. the temptation is too much for some biden added, while highlighting president obama's comments a few months back about 2020 hopefuls avoiding a circular firing squad.
margaret brennan: you're waiting on the mueller report?
senator dick durbin: listen, senator graham and i could not be more different politically. he's a conservative republican from south carolina; i'm a progressive democrat from illinois. but we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. and a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the president on january, the eleventh, 2018, i do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with daca and many other aspects of the reform and the president rejected it. he said, i'll go with my approach. his approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the united states senate. it wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. so we're in a position now where when the president makes these claims and promises a lot of us, i hope i could speak for senator graham, are a little bit skeptical.
margaret brennan: --who are waiting for paychecks.
dan balz: that-- that is such an interesting question because i think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on president trump in 2020, and i think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. we saw in iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for elizabeth warren. i think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. i think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like elizabeth warren or vice president biden, bernie sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. but there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. and my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.
shannon pettypiece: well, yeah. well, i mean, and-- we can talk about this. meanwhile, at the white house, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. i mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the white house is transitioning into 2020 mode. and while you have these democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to iowa, now you have a president trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. it's not the trump tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. they have raised millions and millions of dollars. they have a big data operation. they are out of the gate and running and the democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. so, i mean, that's what they're going to be up against. and they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the president might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. you might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. he was not one of those politicians who came to washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.
margaret brennan: but the people in the room are your colleague senator durbin along with--
margaret brennan: so would you commend the trump administration for this ban on bump stocks that recently happened?
margaret brennan: there has been speculation and-- and our next guest, senator lindsey graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for daca, sort of, a trade here. the president stood in the rose garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the supreme court rules on daca before he comes to any kind of proposal here. do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? and is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?
senator lindsey graham: he's not in the room. neither one of them are in the room.
margaret brennan: --it doesn't have to be concrete.
cbs news campaign reporter jack turman says buttigieg has tried to position himself as the candidate who can offer bold policy proposals while also unifying the country. his attacks on biden and sanders come as recent polls show him lagging behind biden and sanders, albeit narrowly.
the department last week sent pre-termination letters to detective myles cosgrove, who an fbi analysis determined fired the shot that killed taylor, and detective josh jaynes, who applied for the search warrant at taylor's louisville home. in the letter to jaynes obtained by cbs news, interim police chief yvette gentry said jaynes was not truthful when he claimed he received information from a u.s. postal inspector that taylor's ex-boyfriend had been receiving suspicious packages at taylor's home.
margaret brennan: when would we see that put on the table? is that-- that's a bigger immigration overhaul than what we're talking about right now which is simply the wall.
representative colin allred: --who is a friend of mine and a mentor of mine. and-- and we have a lot of political talent in texas, so.
margaret brennan: yeah. it's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out.
margaret brennan: you had senator durbin saying he doesn't see a way to get to five billion. you had senator graham saying no wall, no deal. is there any point of agreement anywhere in here, dan?
margaret brennan: --an indefinite timeline of u.s. troops staying in syria.
margaret brennan: is the president open to--
margaret brennan: and we don't know who the secretary of defense will be, either.
ed o'keefe: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. we got a ways to go. congress doesn't get back till tuesday night, wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. i am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster.
margaret brennan: --along with speaker pelosi. you don't--
the ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive democrat districts. bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. let's just remember the election is nine months off, bustos said. we want to make sure that going into november 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.
mark landler: and that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against president trump's troop pullout. lindsey graham being an obvious example. tom cotton expressed reservations about it as well. so some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. there are some other names that are being bandied about, but i am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and mick mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. i wouldn't be surprised if pat shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.
another topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. the house oversight chairman, elijah cummings, said that's premature. what do you all think? is that too soon?
fischer said shields stepped down from her position in atlanta so the community there could heal, and described her as a leader committed to reform. speaking wednesday, shields said the louisville department is at a crossroads and believes it can become a model for other departments across the country. the department is undergoing a review of all police practices that's expected to be complete by the end of the month, reports cbs station wlky.
senator lindsey graham: dick durbin is a good guy. he's a reasonable guy. but nancy pelosi has made progress. she's gone from not a penny to a dollar. nancy pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. president trump sees it as real. until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. the president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. it will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. and every plan i've supported in the past with dick durbin has had money for physical barriers--
senator dick durbin: well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. but what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. this gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the republican senate leader, mitch mcconnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. he's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the president. he is part of a branch of government and a leader in the senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. as of last night, three republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it.
the shots you fired went in three different directions, indicating you did not verify a threat or have target acquisition, gentry wrote. in other words, the evidence shows that you fired wildly at unidentified subjects or targets located within an apartment.
kevin mccarthy: nancy pelosi, i extend to you this gavel.
our country is at a turning point. hard working people betrayed by trump struggling to survive, the narrator claims. in this moment, we need a fighter. bernie sanders, we know he'll fight for us as president because he always has, the voice concludes. according to kantar/cmag tracking, sanders is on track so far to spend $1.5 million in california and more than $160,000 in texas through february 25th, but more ad buys are likely. on tuesday, the campaign announced it would me making $2.5 million in ad buys in the two states this week. super tuesday is march 3rd.
senator lindsey graham: okay. here's what he's open to. he's open to getting his wall money. we need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. he has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. so how can you say he's not open minded to it. here's what i think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. and i think we can put on the table tps reform. there's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. i'd like to deal with that problem and i would--
margaret brennan: well, there are about eight hundred thousand federal workers who are in this limbo not being sure--
representative max rose: well, i'm from staten island. i have no problem with profanity, okay? well what-- what i have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. i-- i-- i certainly object to it.
margaret brennan: senator graham, thank you for joining us.
mark landler: --apparatus kind of grinds on, the timetable suddenly slow down, it's a lot more complicated. his words meet reality on the ground and i think that's the moment we're at but it must be a very confusing one for our allies and for our adversaries.
margaret brennan: and you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 minutes.
margaret brennan: we'll talk with two veteran deal makers who are trying to break the impasse and reopen the government. the democratic whip, senator dick durbin of illinois and republican senator lindsey graham of south carolina.
ed o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and i think elsewhere as well. look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. we can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. maybe that's the delay. but what are we on, day sixteen now? and-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--
in the aftermath of her son's death, kemp has been an active member of moms demand action. i chose to devote the entire sixty-second ad to gun safety because it matters to communities across the country and it will be a top priority for me as president, bloomberg said in a statement released by the campaign.
margaret brennan: that daca and tps for a wall?
the house democrat campaign arm is confident in using healthcare as their central message for 2020, but didn't specify any immediate plans for any specific ads in some of the most competitive districts they have to defend, reports cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro.
next up on face the nation, we'll have more of our panel of new house members.
margaret brennan: --open the government and then continue talking?
representative mikie sherrill: i think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but i don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in syria we're just pulling out.
buttigieg's campaign has also recently sent out fundraising emails that say nominating sanders would be a risk at a time when democrats are desperate to reclaim the white house from president trump.
elizabeth warren: hello, council bluffs. whoo.
margaret brennan: but you support a drawdown?
margaret brennan: good question. we'll be right back.
margaret brennan: well, he now says--
representative max rose: --to provide the freedom and the space for that political reconciliation to be realized. and i intend on playing a part in trying to contribute to that.
dan balz: that's never the way these kinds of things end. we'll see whether this is a different situation.
margaret brennan: have you seen the more specific financial request that the white house says they were giving to democrats?
anderson cooper (60 minutes): the democratic party has lost so much.
margaret brennan: what about the coast guard? who are not going to get paid.
margaret brennan: it-- it sounds there-- shannon, like, you're going to see some campaigning in the halls of congress--
margaret brennan: that sounds like what the trump administration is suggesting.
margaret brennan: --and a republican president.
senator dick durbin: talk about-- or--
the raid was linked to a drug investigation into the ex-boyfriend, jamarcus glover, who did not live there. kenneth walker, taylor's boyfriend, said police did not announce themselves before they battered in the door and he fired a shot because he feared someone was trying to break in. three officers including cosgrove returned fire, killing taylor. no drugs were found in the home.
representative colin allred: you know, i-- i think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. and there are certainly lessons you can learn, i think, from some of our races. i think there--
i acknowledge that you believe you prepared the search warrant in good faith, gentry wrote. however, you failed to inform the judge you had no contact with the u.s. postal inspector. your sworn information was not only inaccurate, it was not truthful.
margaret brennan: mm-hm. but let's dig into that--
margaret brennan: it's sunday, january 6th. i'm margaret brennan and this is face the nation.
as joe biden goes up on the air in nevada with several new ads in a buy totaling $167,503 this week, per kantar cmag data, the former vice president's campaign is also rolling out several new endorsements in the state, according to cbs news campaign reporter alex tin. among them are two former clark county party chairs, the vice president of the washoe county school district board of trustees, and online betting ceo joe asher, who was listed last year as a top fundraising bundler for biden.
president donald trump: you can call it the schumer or the pelosi or the trump shutdown, doesn't make any difference to me. just words.
alexandria ocasio-cortez (60 minutes): i think so. i think-- i think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised whether it's judgeships with mitch mcconnell, whether it's compromising on climate change i think we've-- there's some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on but am i open to compromise on-- on certain ways to get things done, absolutely. absolutely.
senator dick durbin: well, i can't say that we're close because president's made it clear he doesn't care. he's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. it was stunning to hear a president of the united states say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. but that is his position. think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the treasury department has been shut down, the internal revenue service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.
some in the community took to social media to decry the selection of shields, who stepped down from her position in atlanta after one of her officers fatally shot rayshard brooks, a black man, during a june arrest in a wendy's parking lot. the officer, garrett rolfe, was fired and charged with counts including felony murder.
alexandria ocasio-cortez (60 minutes): yeah, absolutely. absolutely. it's just about what we choose to compromise. my personal opinion. and i know that my district, my community feels this way as well is that we as a party have compromised too much and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. and--
margaret brennan: --is indeed open to a daca for wall trade here because he stood in the rose garden the other day and said no you've got to wait till the court rules and we're some time out from that.
despite setting their own off-year record, the republican campaign arm was outraised by the dccc by more than $40 million in 2019, and vulnerable democratic members raised $92 million in the off year. two such members, joe cunningham of south carolina and anthony brindisi of new york, both released their first 2020 ads this week, one of the first direct responses in these districts to months of ads from outside republican groups about impeachment.
senator lindsey graham: --who accuse them--
margaret brennan: congresswoman, you've also served, as we said in the introduction. what do you think? do you support not just afghanistan, a drawdown but a withdrawal in total?
margaret brennan: new york democrat alexandria ocasio-cortez has made a name for herself taking on republicans in her own party. tonight, she sits down with 60 minutes. here's part of her interview.
representative mikie sherrill: i-- i think so. i'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the fbi finished their investigation. i think we've got to let mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions.
margaret brennan: congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? i mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. are you seeing that in your district?
representative colin allred (d-texas/@repcolinallred): well, let's be very clear. he doesn't want border security. we have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. there is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. a five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. there's a lot of things we can do instead of that.
buttigieg has remained in the top tier of democratic presidential hopefuls in early state polls, although his position may have slipped since the start of the year. the most recent des moines register poll found him to be the first choice of 16% of likely iowa caucus-goers while sanders was the first choice of 20%. the same poll in november found buttigieg leading the democratic field in the state with 25% support.
on this face the nation broadcast moderated by margaret brennan:
ed o'keefe: --who has a name id in the network. can i somehow distinguish myself in the field that will feature numerous women, several different minority candidates, i have to find a way to play in the south, at the same time i have to find a way to play in california, in georgia and all these other places because of early voting. it's going to be a tremendous competition and one that i think a lot of people are surprised hasn't been joined by others yet but i think that's because they realize this-- this is going to be a tremendous exercise for them.
the millennial veteran has acknowledged in recent weeks that he needs to show versus tell that he's the best candidate to face mr. trump with strong showings in iowa and new hampshire, which holds its first-in-the-nation primary on february 11th. he hopes that a solid finish in the first two contests will help him compete in nevada and south carolina, where is currently polling well behind sanders and biden.
margaret brennan: well, and the senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. but it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?
margaret brennan: according to the white house, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among democrats, right? they point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? what-- what is your response to that?
senator lindsey graham: why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? who gives you a dollar for a wall when the democratic party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? we're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. we'll negotiate with dick durbin but i'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the border patrol agents a bunch of nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. these caravans have changed everything. the reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. we've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from central america.
earlier in the day, biden delivered a speech in waukee, iowa where he didn't name a single rival democrat and kept his focus solely on the president. in the home stretch, biden is making a similar pitch to the one he had from the start: the soul of the nation is at risk due to mr. trump's actions and moral turpitude.
margaret brennan: congressman rose, you served in afghanistan as we said in your introduction. both president obama and president trump have wanted to draw down troops--
margaret brennan: you think the ports are a bigger issue than the southern border?
senator lindsey graham: yeah. i really believe that.
margaret brennan: you've worked with the president's son-in-law jared kushner on criminal justice reform.
senator lindsey graham: yeah. but what he's not open to is a lecture by the speaker of the house. i'll give you a dollar. he's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being gestapo agents gassing children. he's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. so if you bring dick durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.
margaret brennan: and it's off to the races as the battle for the 2020 presidential contest begins to take shape. one high-profile democrat jumps in.
margaret brennan: --on friday with the president.
margaret brennan: we're back now with more from our reporters' panel. we saw this week campaign 2020 kick off even though we just started 2019. dan. and elizabeth warren, senator, throwing her hat in the ring. how do you see democrats defining themselves?
senator lindsey graham: i do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. the goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. that ice is not the problem, it's the solution. the goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. it's to implement policies--
democrats are targeting a number of house seats in georgia, as well as the state's two senate seats. georgia has been a republican stronghold for decades, but democrats hope the state's changing demographics could help them win it back this year.
shannon pettypiece: right. at this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. no one is facing any real political pressure. and part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. but for the white house, they see this (indistinct) politically. democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. so that changes at the end of this coming week when friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. there are services. people will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. so then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. but because the sides are so far apart, i don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. so it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.
representative jahana hayes: i think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.
margaret brennan: and that is not a small ask either to get diplomatic talks with the-- with the taliban underway, and the administration is trying to do that--
anderson cooper (60 minutes): you're willing to compromise?
margaret brennan: it's exhausting, but it's beginning.
cosgrove was fired for violating the department's deadly force policy, according to a termination letter obtained by cbs news.
representative max rose: well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. so the key here in afghanistan, because we saw in iraq, the invasion of iraq was absolutely foolish. but then we did a speedy withdrawal, which i believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. we cannot afford to do the same thing in afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--
representative jahana hayes (d-connecticut/@jahanahayesct): well i think-- i apologize i lost my voice yesterday. but i think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. we have to get to work. we cannot keep operating in hard lines. we cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. we have to move. that's why we were elected. that's what we were sent here to do. we have to get back to work.
bustos, a democrat from a district won by mr. trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of democrats she says have compelling arguments. they've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. cindy axne's done 57 town hall meetings, joe cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…lauren underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. when you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. and i think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.
representative max rose: this is a national disgrace.
representative mikie sherrill: i think if we're going to win as democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. the way we took back the majority of the house is through districts like mine. the eleventh district of new jersey, where i ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. these are things that the majority of americans agree on and the democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.
margaret brennan: congressman, this week, not only a new week in congress but also the beginning it seems of the 2020 presidential campaign season-- i know, get ready.
margaret brennan: he is cited as someone open to the deal you described of-- of daca for wall.
dan balz (the washington post/@danbalz): there's not at this point other than that both sides believe in border security.
margaret brennan: --when they're going to get paid. so--
cosgrove's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cbs news.
representative max rose: well, what i just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. i believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. i don't want to see americans put at risk. i've watched loved ones get hurt. i don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. but i just want us to have a long-term strategy--
representative jahana hayes: well, i think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. i think we have to have background checks. we have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street.
representative jahana hayes: the gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.
margaret brennan: so would all of you--yes or no--vote for something that put an offer on the table for democrats, like protections for dreamers or protections for those coming here under extraordinary circumstances like temporary protected status.
we'll be right back with our reporters' panel.
margaret brennan: mark, i mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the president prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. you can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. afghanistan, when the president had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, wall street journal came down pretty hard on him.
mark landler: --with his own president. president trump just a few minutes ago on his way to camp david repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of syria soon. that's a very different message than what john bolton had in israel a few hours earlier. some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the turks would go after our kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, i think a lot of people in the pentagon are skeptical the turks can ever be relied on not to go after the kurds. so i think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. but i have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from president trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. he will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--
good morning and welcome to face the nation. top white house officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. so far their talks have yielded nothing. yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. with no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.

this is no time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before, buttigieg said. the less 2020 resembles 2016 and our party, the better. after his town hall in decorah, buttigieg told reporters he is trying to clarify to caucus-goers what he stands for. we're competing, buttigieg told reporters. it's a respectful but important competition, about what the best approach is going to be. i admire and respect everybody running for president, but we've got to make sure that we win.
we begin today with senate democratic whip dick durbin who is in springfield, illinois. senator durbin is among a group of senators talking to the white house about how to end this shutdown. senator, welcome to face the nation. the president said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. if he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will senate democrats do?
mark landler (the new york times/@marklandler): well, it's-- it is interesting. it's-- it's as though we have come full circle from where we are, where on december 19th when president trump announced this pull out and put a thirty-day deadline on it. i think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the pentagon and i think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in syria. there's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the white house and the pentagon all along. the question i have now is, how in sync is the national security advisor--
margaret brennan: who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?
margaret brennan: we'll continue that conversation in our next half hour. so, stay with us.
representative max rose: i think that there's the potential that it could happen. we've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. there's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? everybody is running on anti-corruption now. but in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. if all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the american people are going to suffer.
senator lindsey graham: they sent staff. they sent staff people to do the negotiation. the vice president's in the room with a bunch of staffers.
with four days to go until monday's iowa caucuses, former south bend mayor pete buttigieg is ramping up his rhetoric and taking direct shots at two of his top rivals for the democratic nomination, former vice president joe biden and vermont senator bernie sanders.
representative colin allred: it's absolutely premature. this is way too early to be talking about this. we need to let the investigation run its course. and i just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.
congresswoman tulsi gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in new hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in february. and while other candidates focus on next week's iowa caucuses, gabbard has all but moved to new hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other democratic candidate across december and january.
margaret brennan: that's it for us today. thank you all for watching. until next week for face the nation, i'm margaret brennan.
both cosgrove and jaynes will have the opportunity to appeal the decision.
washington may have a new congress, but it's stuck in the same shutdown.
louisville police detectives myles cosgrove, left, and joshua jaynes, right, were involved in the fatal shooting of breonna taylor. lmpd
a recent analysis by the new york times reveals just one-fifth of obama-trump voters returned to the democratic party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted republican. roughly half of the new hampshire towns gabbard has visited backed mr. trump in 2016. her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former trump strategist steve bannon and former democratic ohio congressman dennis kucinich. but she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.
margaret brennan: congresswoman, if a compromise is reached in the senate, where you see some kind of increased funding for border security, call it a wall, call it some kind of fence, but something put on the table for democrats. do you see your-- your fellow house members getting on board?
margaret brennan: in the middle of the funding standoff, the one hundred and sixteenth congress gavels in, nancy pelosi reclaims the title of speaker as democrats take control of the house and usher in the most diverse congress in history. a panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the president.
the news of the firings came the same day the fischer announced that erika shields, the former chief of the atlanta police department, has been chosen as the next chief of the louisville metro police department. shields will be the fourth person to lead the department since taylor's death. she will be sworn is as chief on jan. 19.
margaret brennan: is it just a matter of semantics here? border fence, some kind of barrier? i mean is there movement for democrats to support what the president in some way is asking for?
thomas clay, an attorney for jaynes, confirmed the termination but couldn't provide more information. last week, clay disputed the allegations that jaynes lied on the search warrant application.
margaret brennan: do you have anyone in mind from your home state?
the trump campaign released one of two ads set to air during the super bowl on thursday, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. the 30-second ad released thursday morning called stronger, safer, more prosperous highlights the record unemployment numbers the united states has seen during the first three years of the trump administration. according to the campaign, the other 30-second ad will not be released prior to the game.
margaret brennan: what about the tone of this conversation? one of your colleagues, congresswoman from michigan, was speaking to supporters and used a profanity, and said you know, impeachment should be what we're talking about. what do you think of, maybe not the language, but the-- the premise of what's being talked about?
all of you just came to washington at a time when a quarter of this government is shutdown. all of you took a vote to reopen the government but leader mcconnell in the senate has said that is just a waste of time and political posturing. where do we go from here, congresswoman?
calandrian's story is a powerful reminder of the urgency of this issue and the failure of washington to address it. people will be rooting for different teams in the super bowl, but virtually all americans — including people in both parties and a majority of gun owners — support universal background checks and other common sense gun laws.
margaret brennan: if-- if-- you just finished your own campaigns, i know you're sort of, wow.
senator lindsey graham: --not the illegal immigrant. until that changes we'll never get anywhere. there is a deal to be had here--
margaret brennan: we described in your introduction your attempts in the past to broker agreements, you-- you've tried to be a deal maker. you were in the room with the president on friday. did you hear any points of agreement?
margaret brennan: so, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?
senator lindsey graham: --accomplished for us to successfully leave syria. and the president's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. don't let iran get the oil fields, don't let the turks-- turks slaughter the kurds, and don't let isis come back. i think i share the goal of the president to withdraw our forces. let's just do it smartly.
margaret brennan: but the president says he could bypass congress by declaring this national emergency. so what would you do if he-- he went that route?
margaret brennan: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?
senator lindsey graham: yeah. they're being held hostage. they're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. they're being held hostage by people--
senator lindsey graham (r-south carolina/@lindseygrahamsc): yeah. it was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. dick durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. we're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ice, not support ice. we're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. as long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. the president will compromise but he will not capitulate. so that's where we're at.
senator lindsey graham: yeah i think he is open to it.
margaret brennan: --from that war zone. what do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?
i commit to begin my work here with a focus on rebuilding community trust, trust that i believe was already eroding prior to breonna taylor's killing, shields said.
margaret brennan: but passing a bill that re-opens the government comes up against this hard line position the president has taken which is he wants border security, specifically, a border wall, adequately funded. do you see, congressman, room to move beyond that existing level of 1.3 billion dollars, how do you get to the five he wants?
representative max rose: no. it-- it absolutely isn't. but we have been at war in afghanistan now for seventeen years. to put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the united states military who were born after 9/11. and we cannot just have perpetual war. but we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. we need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--
senator lindsey graham: i think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. president obama ended the operations in iraq against sound military advice. the president's getting sound military advice about the status of the kurds--what will happen with iran if we leave too soon. and the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that isis doesn't come back. and i applaud the president for re-evaluating what he's doing. he hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. and president obama never would do that. and you saw what happened when a president shuts people out. this president's not shutting people out. he has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. i share that goal. let's just do it smartly.
margaret brennan: four freshman democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in congress. we spoke with representative jahana hayes, a former national teacher of the year from my home state of connecticut and that state's first african-american woman to serve in congress. congressman max rose, an army captain from new york who earned a bronze star and a purple heart in afghanistan, he then went on to work in the brooklyn district attorney's office. congresswoman mikie sherrill represents new jersey. she flew helicopter missions in the navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. and representative colin allred, who's from texas. he's a former nfl player who later worked for president obama's department of housing and urban development. we started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.
senator lindsey graham: --including walls and fences. except now when trump is president.
representative jahana hayes: it's a first step.
senator lindsey graham: i am here to tell you--
the special election is being held to fill the seat held by former senator johnny isakson, who resigned at the end of last year. governor brian kemp appointed financial executive kelly loeffler to isakson's senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. loeffler will run in the special election in november to carry out the final two years of isakson's term, and she has the support of the national republican senatorial committee and the senate leadership fund. however, congressman doug collins announced his bid for the seat on wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the gop.
margaret brennan: but words so far have produced no solution as a quarter of the u.s. government remains shuttered for the third week. president trump warns it could last months or years and democrats dig in.
[s]he's pulling from trump voters. it could make it even tougher for trump to win, particularly in states like michigan and new hampshire, bannon told cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga.
senator dick durbin: i can just tell you, i don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, i'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.
mark landler: and i think that also explains this decision before christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. i just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out.
representative mikie sherrill: you know what i would add to what max is saying, and what i think is lost a little bit in the discussion of trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. we are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and nato, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. and so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, i think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.
margaret brennan: and all of that requires working with a republican senate--
the louisville metro police department has formally fired two of the officers involved in the march police raid that killed emergency medical worker breonna taylor. louisville mayor greg fischer confirmed the firings wednesday and cbs news obtained copies of the termination letters.
dan balz: well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for president trump the wall has been central to his political message. and i know there are democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. and so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. but with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. i mean, this can't go on indefinitely. president talked about this could go on for months or even years. it's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. but the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? and i think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, i don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.
representative colin allred: well, i think it's important to see what's in the package. and it's- i think it's hard for any of us to say. i think all of us at this table came to congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. we're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. we need some bend from the other side as well.
representative colin allred: well, let me say, i'm from texas. we have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that.
margaret brennan: i want to ask you about syria. i know you watch the region and you had criticized the president's decision to pull out. the national security adviser john bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a u.s. drawdown and it'll be dependent on turkey agreeing not to slaughter our kurdish allies. it sounds like he's describing--
while we did not endorse mayor pete simply because he's gay, the historic nature of his candidacy has already had a transformational impact on the lgbtq community, rick zbur, the groups' executive director, said in a statement, also praising elizabeth warren and tom steyer for their extremely strong platforms.
margaret brennan: and that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the american people. more to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.
margaret brennan: he was on friday. he was--
bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, has used his enormous fortune to self-fund his campaign. despite a late entrance into the race and his decision to skip the first four voting states, including iowa where voting begins monday, bloomberg is on track to spend more than $275 million on television, radio and digital ads by the end of the week.
representative mikie sherrill: you have to have that long-term strategy and that is a piece that's missing.
matt lieberman, the son of former senator joe lieberman, and ed tarver, a former attorney, are also competing for the democratic nomination. nevertheless, warnock's entry could rally democrats ahead of a fight with what may be a divided republican party in the peach state.
margaret brennan: mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the national security advisor in israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the syria policy. the president said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of u.s. troops in syria. what are people of the pentagon actually being told to do?
margaret brennan: what about the rest of you?
margaret brennan: so lots of exploring without declaring, ed?
the 60 second spot, titled george, will air sunday february 2 during super bowl liv. it features the story of calandrian simpson kemp, a mother whose son, george kemp jr., was shot and killed in 2013.
gentry wrote that mattingly, who was shot in the thigh by walker, was able to identify and describe the individual whom he targeted as a threat and against whom he returned fire.
senator dick durbin: --those fences and barriers. well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. and when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? he basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. that is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which democrats certainly want.
senator lindsey graham: --until that changes there's--
senator lindsey graham: --that we don't need a wall.
senator lindsey graham: --democrats have voted for in the past on president trump's watch. we're not going to give in to this radical left ever until we can find a rational way forward. we'll have wall as part of a border security plan. we're going nowhere. wall plus daca plus tps makes sense. but you'll never convince me--
all that, plus, analysis on the week's other news coming up now on face the nation.
senator lindsey graham: --but it will include a wall. and if there is no wall in this deal we'll never have a deal.
i hear senator sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts, buttigieg continued. and it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.
margaret brennan: is that what you think is happening now in the house?
with the iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around des moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold. i think some campaigns have reached out to our team, andrew yang told reporters at an event yesterday, cbs news political correspondent ed o'keefe reported.
margaret brennan: --to that compromise you just floated there?
margaret brennan: i want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. congresswoman, as we said, you're from connecticut. in your home state that was the site of the sandy hook shooting. i know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. what is it that you think can actually get done? what are you going to try to do about gun control?
representative max rose: but if i could just have one important thing. it's obvious that election season's starting again. but what we can't do is campaign in the halls of congress. when it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say oh, i don't want to give this president a win because it might improve his chances in 2020.
representative max rose (d-new york/@ repmaxrose): absolutely. look we all are. we all have federal workers in our district. this is a national disgrace. there's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. but we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic.
margaret brennan: --based on the-- the rundown of candidates.
senator lindsey graham: well, i had lunch with the president last week and i came away a bit encourage. there are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. we want to make sure that when we leave the kurds do not get slaughtered. and i don't trust turkey to take care of the kurds. it'd be like putin trying to police assad. that didn't work well. we need a plan to protect the kurds from turkey and others. we need to make sure isis doesn't come back once they're defeated and iran is not the biggest winner. if you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which i think we can, then count me in. but those three things have to be--
a source close to the yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster that former vice president joe biden's campaign reached out about a deal. the rules of the iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. i frankly think i'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, yang said. in waukee today, biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former iowa governor tom vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to o'keefe.
cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says he goes on to talk about his campaign being funded by the working people and says those are the people he will represent. in another ad aired in dallas and san francisco, a narrator talks about sanders fighting to raise wages and for health care.
senator lindsey graham: yes, he is.
nancy pelosi: we're not a doing a wall. does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?
while maintaining that the current campaign should not focus on re-litigating past issues, buttigieg did reference the ongoing spat between sanders and biden over social security. the vermont senator has accused biden of being open to cutting social security in the past, a charge the former vice president's team disputes.
margaret brennan: we will be back in a moment. don't go away.
margaret brennan: it sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?
margaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. we continue our conversation now with our panel of new house members. earlier this week we asked them about their priorities in washington.
margaret brennan: so you don't want to--
margaret brennan: is this an admission that the president made a mistake?
senator lindsey graham: he's not in the room.
in a termination letter to jaynes, gentry wrote that jaynes did not independently confirm with a u.s. postal inspector that glover had been receiving packages at taylor's home, as he claimed in a search warrant affidavit he filed with a judge.
senator lindsey graham: when you see dick durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. when you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. when you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. when that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal democrats who don't see a border security problem. they see their own government being the problem--
mark landler: --tested more is just how resonant an issue getting out of foreign wars is for president trump's base. we know where his base is on the border wall, we know that's why he's sticking to the wall so hard.
margaret brennan: but the president really seemed to shoot that down in the rose garden the other day.
