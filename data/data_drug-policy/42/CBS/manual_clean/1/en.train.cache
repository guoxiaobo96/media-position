Russia: Trust in Putin, trust in Sputnik
Rep. Elijah Cummings: We probably will end up in the courts. And one of the interesting things about the courts is that our president has been making sure that some of the most conservative judges are being p-- appointed-- to the federal bench. And I think he relies on that, and I think that he assumes that the courts will-- will possibly be, it all depends-- be helpful to him.
MIKE POMPEO: The public document was released yesterday. There are two implementing elements that will be provided. They are secret. They are military implementation documents that are important to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. Every member of Congress will get a chance to see them. They are classified, secret. There aren't any side deals. Remember, the side deals I was complaining about were deals that the American side--
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --whether conservative or progressive, is-- I didn't say that. What I would say--
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on what we haven't mentioned thus far in the show, that the President has made a choice to run the intelligence community. He's going to renominate a congressman, John Ratcliffe. Is he actually going to go through and get nominated and-- and confirmed?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Vice President Joe Biden won South Carolina and won it big.
We don't see any connection here, Peskov told reporters. Putin said months ago that he was planning to get immunized. Sputnik V's developers say more than 1.5 million people in Russia have received the vaccine to date.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,939 as of 1:45 p.m. ET. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost eight points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,084. The Nasdaq composite index slid 18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,888.
Former President Trump's surgeon general, Jerome Adams, has been asked to stay on to advise Mr. Biden's COVID-19 response. Zients said the administration will hold regular press briefings with government doctors including Anthony Fauci.
ALEX AZAR: So, we're very concerned about the intermingling of our supply chain with China, in particular. We-- the FDA has gone out and worked proactively with drug manufacturers and there are twenty drugs for which the entire molecule or a critical element of the molecule is made exclusively in China. And so we're working aggressively with the-- with the manufacturers to determine if there are any shortages. We are aware of one drug which has many, many replacements in terms of that therapeutic class available that may be in shortage for a short period of time. But--

The Speaker said she has told her members to see what opportunity exists and assess what it will accomplish. She also said the House will continue pursuing cases already underway, including the subpoenas they have already issued.
The Ohio Republican touted a bipartisan effort, called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), that he said would make a real difference for families and communities.
According to research published in December by Italy's ANSA news agency, one in five Italian health care workers said they would refuse a vaccine at the time. In some parts of the country that figure was even higher: In the northern Piedmont region, only 10-20% of nursing home workers said they planned to get vaccinated, according to the region's pandemic response unit.
The U.K. regulator appears to be making an assumption based on the available data from the Pfizer-BioNTech Phase 3 human trials.
It's not so much the attorney general's job to decide what laws to enforce, Sessions said. We should do our job and enforce laws effectively as we're able.
MICHAEL MORELL: Will, thank you so much for joining us. It's been a real education on the region, which I think is absolutely necessary at this time.
Manziel was in concussion protocol at the time, and although he was not required to be at the Browns' home finale against Pittsburgh, the team was not sure of his location as reports surfaced he was partying in Las Vegas. He was fined for not reporting to the team's facility on Jan. 3.
MIKE POMPEO: I don't know when. I don't know where. I-- I'm very confident. President Trump wants to make sure that everyone in Afghanistan understands that the United States is committed to making sure that this conversation take place. We have been at this for an awful long time. You recounted the loss of American life. There's a better path forward. The Taliban now know this because of the work that we've done. And President Trump will be actively engaged in helping us get the conditions right and beginning this journey that the first step was taken in Doha yesterday.

Now that Democrats are set to control both the House and Senate, Speaker Pelosi is looking ahead to policy priorities she thinks her party will be able to pass, including lowering the cost of prescription drugs and rebuilding American infrastructure.
I am extremely grateful for the support I have received during this process, and I look forward to rejoining my teammates later this season.
WILL WECHSLER: Thank you so much for having me.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, Margaret, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --back then. So that any kind--
The United States has tried a lot of different approaches to achieving that goal. We've tried invading and occupying countries. We've tried dropping hell fires from the sky to take out high value targets. What we've learned is that the most effective way of combating these kinds of terrorist adversaries is indirectly, is working by, with, and through the local actors who can themselves conduct these kinds of counterterrorism missions. Sometimes these are through military channels. Sometimes through intelligence channels. Sometimes these are through law enforcement channels. Sometimes that effort involves the United States doing nothing more than passing information and allowing our friends and partners to take action. But sometimes it takes more. Sometimes it takes efforts to equip these partners, to train these partners, to advise these partners, to assist them in what they do and sometimes even to accompany them on their missions.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, all I can say is we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. We won the Nevada caucus. We lost last night. We're looking forward to Super Tuesday. I think we got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts, and a number of states around the country.
MICHAEL MORELL: Do you find yourself more and more having to explain why the region is still important?
MIKE POMPEO: It says that we will work with all relevant parties to build on confidence, to create confidence-building measures amongst all of the parties, the Afghan government, non-Taliban, and others in the Afghan. We-- we want this to be an inclusive process.
The other challenges, the need for reform on virtually every aspect of Saudi society. This one, Mohammed bin Salman has recognized in a way that none of his predecessors had. That's a really good thing. It's a really challenging set of problems that they have economically, socially, politically and so forth. When Franklin Roosevelt met with Mohammed bin Salman's grandfather, I think Saudi Arabia had about three million people and now it has roughly ten times that. Saudi Arabia is a rich country, but it's a country that has lots of poor people in it. We've already talked about the challenges of having young men that are aimless. There's a massive need for reform in Saudi Arabia.
Lyon, a retired professor at Mormon-owned Brigham Young University, said he's afraid the church's opposition will have a chilling effect on members of the faith but said he remains hopeful there are enough progressive-leaning Mormons who will see the benefits.

Through her work with SNAP she said she would occasionally hear about abuse or cover-ups by nuns but since the publication of a grand jury report identified hundreds of pedophile priests in Pennsylvania, at least 18 people have contacted her to share stories of abuse by religious sisters.
There are divergent views among experts on the best near-term goals for vaccination programs, including the emphasis that should be put on achieving herd immunity, versus simply giving health care systems room to breathe.
ALEX AZAR: That's not one of the highest priority areas that we're looking at right now, because Mexico only has a couple of cases. Canada's epidemiology is similar to the United States right now. What the President's making clear, though, is we'll always be looking at travel restrictions, border protections. We will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the American people. But we don't forecast doing that anytime soon.
Banks and industrial and materials companies all fell. Citigroup shed 60 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.37 and insurer Prudential lost $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $78.22. Railroad company Union Pacific gave up $2.32, or 2.6 percent, to $87.30 and mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar declined $1.72, or 2.2 percent, to $76.60.

The plan also calls for increasing training for teachers on the subject and culling together expertise from the public and private sectors.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool, or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid I spent time in Israel. I am not in-- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You got seventy percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we-- continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even-handed policy.
But in a new paper published online in the journal BMJ Case Reports, doctors warn that not only do such detox diets not have scientific evidence behind them, they can also be life threatening.
There is an urgency to this issue, he said. Congress must act now to help repair our communities, our families and our country.
Altieri also argues that federal marijuana legalization would help address many of the issues that concern people about marijuana's potential risks.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How long would it take to get U.S. troops out? Because you're saying this is based on conditions. That means the Taliban has to follow through on a few things.
ALEX AZAR: And I-- I appreciate that people are concerned of that, and that-- that is why we're being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be. And that's why we say might be, but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps. Right now it's important for people to understand we're not advising any types of particular measures in the United States like travel restrictions or closures. State or local public health offices, which are the frontlines of response, might make their own decisions to do that. But, at this point, we do not have sufficient spread in the United States that would indicate those measures. But we're not taking any of them off the table. The full range of options will always remain on the table.
We were totally under the impression that he was the assistant coach, said the cheerleader's mother. A Navarro College spokesperson later told CBS DFW McGee was allowed to volunteer with the Navarro Cheer program, adding that once the school learned of the allegation, the college notified him that he could no longer volunteer.

As the opioid epidemic continues to wreak havoc on communities across the country, new data looks at where drug abuse is most pronounced and which geographic areas in the United States are most at risk.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: And that Bloomberg number that you talk about is so critical because if he does do just well enough to pick up delegates, if he picks up delegates in some regions of these states, even if he doesn't win them, then that changes the math for everybody else. Now he is a player. But if he falls just short of it, then all those delegates can go to other top candidates, to a-- to a Biden or to a Sanders and that changes the math going forward for them.
While 10 states and Washington, D.C. have legalized recreational adult use of marijuana, and more than 20 other states allow some medical uses, U.S. attorneys can still prosecute its possession and sale under federal law. Last year, Sessions reversed an Obama-era policy that encouraged federal prosecutors to take a hands-off approach in states where marijuana is legal. This put business owners back at higher risk of coming under federal scrutiny.
Living in fear is … probably the hardest part, he said. Just the images, the memories, you can never shake them.

National regulatory bodies insist corners haven't been cut. They've reviewed and accepted data provided by pharmaceutical companies showing the major vaccines already approved, and those expecting a greenlight within weeks, are between 70% and 95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a marijuana enforcement memo Thursday rescinding the Obama administration's guidance, which enabled states to legalize marijuana without federal intervention. His one-page memo makes it clear that marijuana possession and distribution is against federal law, and it will direct U.S. attorneys to approach these cases as they do all other cases when enforcing them.
Rep. Jim Jordan: My job is getting to the truth. If the president is getting a raw deal I'm going to defend him.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But President Trump said he's going to meet with the Taliban in the near future. When? Where? Is that Camp David?
Manziel, who has had two tumultuous seasons in the NFL, was identified by Forth Worth police after they were called at about 2 a.m. Saturday to investigate a report of a possible assault at an apartment complex. The officers didn't find the person who called, but they spoke to an unidentified 23-year-old woman who said she was involved in a disturbance with her ex-boyfriend earlier that night in Dallas.
Under the National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness, the administration aims to vastly expand testing, reopen the majority of K-8 schools in the next 100 days, and administer 100 million vaccine doses by the end of April. This will be one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever undertaken, Mr. Biden said of the vaccine distribution effort.
Cahill said she believes other nuns had to have known what was going on with her. She's struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, along with alcohol and drug addiction that she said began with her abuse.

That's what this is all about - each of us doing our part to make sure all our young people can compete in a high-tech, global economy, the president said. They're the ones who will make sure America keeps growing, keeps innovating, and keeps leading the world in the years ahead.

The independent Lavada Center's poll, published just after Christmas, found that most of those willing to get the vaccine were supporters of President Vladimir Putin. One of Putin's daughters was said to have received the Sputnik V vaccine before it was even approved, but the 68-year-old president hasn't received a shot yet himself.

For the first two years of the Trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house Democrats. The power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the Republican majority. As ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, Cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like White House security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, and the Justice Department's refusal to defend the Affordable Care Act. All of them were blocked by the Republican chairman.
EDWARD WONG: Right. And I think that they're trying to adjust the language now from what I can tell. But I think that, you know, there's valid criticism of that. And I think if you compare that to the way Beijing reacted, there are some parallels in that communist party officials, Chinese officials really covered up the start of the virus, and there's a lot of information coming out these days that perhaps it started earlier, and that they kept the public from learning about it. We know that one of the key whistleblowers, Dr. Li--
The scenario of the medication exposure varies greatly depending on the age group, Smith said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is significant. And according to the deal that was released, the U.S. will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty-five days. And then if conditions are met, a total withdrawal within fourteen months. But the President said yesterday, if bad things happen, we'll go back in. What's the benchmark there?
Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, I mean, Steve, look, this-- this president's probably been attacked more than any president that-- in my lifetime. And here's what I know.

MARGARET BRENNAN: --who you know well, wasn't very happy with you this week, though, because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this, that you-- you-- you are pretending that the Taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying, you know, the Taliban is still allied with al Qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of Congress--

MARGARET BRENNAN: That was businessman Tom Steyer doing a little pre-primary dance in South Carolina. He did come in third, but he had hoped to do better and he dropped out of the race last night but rest of the candidates have moved on to Super Tuesday, and that's this Tuesday, when fourteen states will hold contests. Among them California and Texas. We have some new CBS News Battleground Tracker numbers for both of them. Out in California Senator Bernie Sanders is up with thirty-one percent support. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren come in behind Sanders with nineteen and eighteen percent, respectively. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has twelve percent, and the rest of the field comes in at under ten percent. Looking to Texas, the race is tighter. Bernie Sanders is in the lead here with thirty percent, but Joe Biden close behind him with twenty-six percent and Elizabeth Warren comes in at seventeen-percent support. Michael Bloomberg is at thirteen percent, and the rest of the field comes in at six percent or less. Joining us once again is CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. We want to bring in CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, this was a big and much-needed win for Joe Biden in South Carolina. What does this mean for him going into Tuesday?

The most dangerous people in any society: When you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. There are very few things that are true for every country in the world. But one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. Testosterone is a hell of a drug. There are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. They are attracted to destructive avenues.

All I can say is at this point we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working-class and middle-class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people--
And we will be right back with another cabinet official, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, so stay with us.
ED O'KEEFE: It could, potentially. Look, and, tonight, he is-- he is doing something that hasn't been done in a while. He is buying three minutes of advertising on NBC and CBS to talk about the coronavirus. And trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager, who could probably help solve this problem, and would have tackled it sooner than the President. He can spend as much as he wants. But if he doesn't hit fifteen percent in these states on Tuesday, it will have been for naught, essentially. Certainly, they believe that they can go on into Florida and Arizona and Illinois next and-- and try to compete in later March contests. But, perhaps, the biggest loser last night in South Carolina was Mike Bloomberg because Joe Biden did so well. They needed Biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative.

Rep. Elijah Cummings: Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Like I tell my-- my constituents, Don't get it twisted. You know, I may-- my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. My mission is clear. And I am prepared and able to do what I have to do. And I will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me God.
EDWARD WONG: Well, I think that everyone agrees that full transparency or a large amount of transparency on this virus is necessary both, you know, to push forward with expertise on addressing the virus, plus, calming public fears over it. I think when an administration or government appears to be nontransparent on it then that creates problems. I think that the Trump administration really grappled with that this past week when you saw President Trump come out and say it was a new hoax by the Democrats or when--
Speaker Pelosi pointed out that, with regards to potentially illegal activity, those who have surrounded the president could also be exposed.

Oxford scientists have said their trial data supports allowing a window of up to 12 weeks between shots, and that their vaccine will provide protection to the full extent possible (up to 74% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection) for that full period.
That is not a knock against legalization if you have concerns about it. Prohibition is defined by the absolute lack of control of marijuana. If you have concerns about its use, particularly with youth and other health concerns, the answer is to regulate it and have those controls — not to leave it in the hands of criminal elements completely unregulated in back alleys and street corners.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a process--
Marino represents a solidly Republican district in central and north Pennsylvania. He was elected to the 10th Congressional District in 2010, which was redistricted this year to the 12th Congressional District drawn by a panel of judges last year.

Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It was a knockout win for former Vice President Joe Biden last night in the South Carolina primary. He got nearly half the vote coming in close to thirty points ahead over his closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here to tell us more. So, Anthony, how did Joe Biden do this?
MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? I mean Americans hear this and they are concerned. There's about a two-percent fatality rate.
The lack of border control provides a gateway -- and a very wide and open gateway -- to allow illegal criminal and aliens to get into the United States, Mr. Trump said, adding that he would keep to the promise he made as a candidate to fix this crisis.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What drug is that?
The facility is expanding amid the partial government shutdown. In its contingent job offer letter, CHS indicates that the shutdown may have affected human resources staffing.

Marino said Thursday he will be stepping down effective Jan. 23 to join the private sector. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has ten days to call a special election after Marino retires. The election must be held within 60 days of Marino's departure.
ALEX AZAR: No we don't. We- we don't-- we do not use-- because it is an unknown, the epidemiological spread of this virus in a highly developed health care system that was on it with-- at the most aggressive containment measures in the history of the United States. It is unknown how that will spread. In terms of testing kits, we've already tested over thirty-six hundred people for the virus. We now have seventy-- the capability in-- out-- in the field to test seventy-five thousand people. And within the next week or two we'll have a radical expansion even beyond that of the testing that's available.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: It's not okay. And, but this is the other piece. I still believe that people-- the average citizen, the guys on my block, they oughta know if the president is making a deal, whether he's making it-- making it in his self-interest or that of the country.
Miami — A federal facility for unaccompanied migrant children in Homestead, Florida, is set to nearly double in size and is rushing to bring on hundreds of new employees.
Do we want to get on with the future? Yes, of course, Speaker Pelosi said. But it doesn't mean that we cannot bring justice to the system as we do so.
Elijah Cummings has been a familiar face on Capitol Hill for a long time, a respected 13-term Maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. And he was handpicked by the Democratic leaders for this job.
Fort Worth police are working with Dallas police to determine if a crime occurred.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has considered declaring a national emergency, which would enable him to build the wall without congressional approval. Mr. Trump said earlier this month that I can do it if I want. So far, he has not. I think we might work a deal, he has said. But Mr. Trump went on to threaten, And if we don't, I may go that route. I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want.

He went on to suggest that it fell to Congress to change the classification of marijuana as an illegal drug if it didn't want DOJ to enforce the law against it.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came out against the proposal this month, saying in a statement drugs designed to ease suffering should be tested and approved by government officials first. The church said it respects the wise counsel of doctors, and commended the Utah Medical Association for opposing it. The association has accused organizers of trying to disguise their intention of simply paving the way for legalizing recreational marijuana.
CBS DFW obtained the police report, which shows a second cheerleader making similar claims. That cheerleader did not want to talk on the record for this story, but attorneys for the first cheerleader believe others will come forward.
The Sisters of Charity removed her from her role as a grade school principal but reports she remains a nun. They're providing her with food and housing while restricting her from outside ministry. In the meantime, Cahill said the settlement she signed wasn't enough to help her deal with a lifetime of trauma. But she hopes that her voice can help prevent this from happening again.
If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks, the FDA warned.
So an exposure to a medication does not necessarily mean there's been a poisoning, said senior researcher Dr. Gary Smith.

To determine which states have the biggest drug problems, WalletHub ranked the states in three overall categories: drug use and addiction; law enforcement; and drug health issues and rehab. These categories included 20 relevant metrics that were weighted and averaged to calculate overall score. Among other data points, the metrics included the share of teenagers who used illicit drugs in the past month, overdose deaths per capita, drug arrests per capita, share of adults who needed but didn't receive treatment for illicit drug use in the past year, and the number of substance abuse treatment facilities per 100,000 people.
For many, the New Year is a time to get back on track with health goals, making it a period ripe for marketers to tout unfounded claims about the benefits of detox diets.
Washington — President Joe Biden signed 10 executive orders at the White House on Thursday as part of his national strategy to combat COVID-19, warning Americans that the pandemic which has already claimed more than 408,000 American lives is certain to get worse.
ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that Bernie Sanders' supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates. That's why his numbers remain so stable. Those folks turn out for him. But Joe Biden still has a challenge in that regard. His supporters are less enthusiastic about him. Can he motivate them to turn out? I think it remains a key question. And, look, to that point, when you look at California, Texas, at these big delegate hauls, the Democrats give out delegates just to top finishers. And so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring.

I think not surprisingly there's a tremendous amount of disappointment, I think to some extent, anger, to some extent, amazement that this could happen so soon after a previous suspension was completed, Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said then. This is the consequence of making bad choices.
And he's also threatening retribution. I am prepared to take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation, he tweeted, along with a reminder that @realDonaldTrump had it right.

Manziel spent more than 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehabilitation facility specializing in alcohol and drug addiction treatment last winter.
WILL WECHSLER: There are lots of reasons why the region is unstable. The most important of which is that the countries themselves are not natural countries in terms of aligning towards ethnic, tribal, religious lines. They have a lot of internal incohesion to them. They are relatively new countries. Many of them have not too distant colonial pasts, where there were lots of dysfunctions that were built into the colonial architecture that was created. The lines were drawn by European powers, and the minority groups were promoted by those colonial powers intentionally. That is still a destabilizing factor. Almost all these countries are fundamentally nondemocratic, which in the short term sometimes might have some advantages when it comes to stability, but over the longer term is inherently unstable.
WILL WECHSLER: The Salafi jihadist terrorist groups are different from other kinds of terrorist groups, are different from other kind of Islamic terrorist groups, are different from other kinds of Sunni Islamic terrorist groups. We find that with terrorist organizations that have this particular kind of ideology, wherever they are able to achieve a degree of physical sanctuary where they believe that they can act with impunity, they have a one hundred percent record of doing external attacks. That's just a sad reality. Our goal should be to deny them that kind of sanctuary.
The new rules come more than a month after a manager at a Philadelphia Starbucks called the police on two young black men, one or both of whom asked to use the washroom but had not purchased anything.
Children who suffer through multiple ear infections are often candidates for ear tube surgery. But a new study finds that the use of one type of ear drops — quinolones — after these surgeries may raise a child's risk for a perforated eardrum.
In 10 years, the church may say something different, Lyon said. This is not an eternal banishment of medical marijuana. My father was a good historian, and he used to say, 'If you don't like something in the church, just wait a while because it will change.'

Epidemiologist Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Washington-based Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), told CBS News that attitudes towards the COVID vaccine will likely change a lot in coming months, based on any side effects and the speed and efficiency of the rollout.
Experts expect the United States' COVID-19 death toll to reach half a million people next month. Mr. Biden promised that his administration's approach, laid out in a 198-page plan, matches the gravity of the moment, calling it a war-time undertaking.
In an interview with Rolling Stone just after he left office, Obama explained the dilemma for the Justice Department in prosecuting the federal ban on pot, which is considered a Schedule 1 drug, one which the FDA says has no medical use and has a high potential for abuse.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go-- I might as well stay home.
MIKE POMPEO: And there-- the document that was made public yesterday is the complete agreement. The implementing elements of that will be available for every member of Congress to see. Know this. I saw what Congresswoman Cheney said, and I have an enormous amount of respect for her. The American people should know Donald Trump is not going to take words on a paper. We are going to see if the Taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they've made. The Bush administration and the Obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the Taliban would break from al Qaeda publicly. We got that. That's important. Now, time will tell if they'll live up to that commitment is our expectation. They have promised us they will do so and we'll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do.
ED O'KEEFE: It was his test that if he could do it there, he could do it anywhere. He couldn't.

The focus is now on getting as many people as possible a first dose of either the Pfizer shot or the other approved for use in the U.K., developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Under government policy, the second doses of both vaccines can be put off for up to 12 weeks.
In June, CBS News reported that because Homestead and the Tornillo facility are on federal land, they are not subject to the stringent child welfare inspections required for all other shelters for unaccompanied children, which are on state land.
CBS News' Julia Kimani Burnham and Alan He contributed to this report.
Sessions' action is a departure from the Obama administration's policy, which issued guidance in 2013 that it would not interfere in state and local initiatives to legalize marijuana, as long as they didn't interfere with federal law enforcement priorities.
The blog says, This incident was a significant, reprehensible event that the entire chapter was aware of and leadership endorsed. This event did not only take place this year, but there is credible information that this event has been going on for years.

The cases will continue to mount, we didn't get into this mess overnight, and it's going to take months for us to turn things around, Mr. Biden said. But let me be equally clear, we will get through this, we will defeat this pandemic, and to a nation waiting for action, let me be the clearest on this point: Help is on the way.
The fear of that man … and what has happened to him has just crushed him on an emotional level that none of us can understand.
Parents can prevent those mishaps, Smith said, by having a system that helps them remember whether their child has taken that day's dose -- using a smartphone app, for instance.

Employees at the Homestead facility must undergo the FBI's fingerprint criminal history check, but the federal government has granted a waiver allowing the facility to bypass Florida's child abuse and neglect background check system, according to HHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Mark Weber. The waiver was granted to Virginia-based CHS because companies that are not regulated by the state's child welfare and foster care authorities are not allowed to access its Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System database.
Steve Kroft: I feel like I would be remiss in this if I didn't point out that truthfulness has not exactly been President Trump's strongest asset.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Barr said he doesn't plan on using federal resources to go after companies if they are complying with state law. That would be a reversal from the approach taken by his predecessor, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who vowed to pursue federal violations more aggressively.
Major league players and teams agreed in November 2005 that a third positive test for PEDs would result in a lifetime ban. No players have been banned for life under the rules, which were put in place under pressure from Congress to toughen their drug program.
Police didn't say if the woman was hurt. An ambulance was called, but she was not taken to a hospital.
Rep. Jim Jordan: Well, look, there's-- there's not much of anything that-- that Mr. Cummings and I agree on, policy-wise. But-- I certainly respect his toughness-- his tenacity. You know, he's demonstrated that he's-- he's a fighter and I kinda-- my background is such that I kind of appreciate that.
The FBI search won't have the same information as the (state child abuse and neglect) database, Schmerling said. This is a facility for unaccompanied children, so you'd want to approach it like foster care, where you try to gather as much information as possible about someone's history.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us.
Mr. Trump's announcement will coincide with women's marches across the country that both protest Trump administration policies and try to draw attention to other policy priorities for women.
Toovey also points out that the notion of drinking excess water as a way to purify and cleanse the body can be dangerous.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: Sure. I expect that. Now, there's one big elephant that's sittin' around here that we don't know-- what it's gonna yield. And that is Mueller's report. I don't know what that report is gonna have in it. One thing I do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it-- if it exonerates the president, fine. But this I do know: I want whatever it is, for the Congress to have it, and I want the public to have it, so that everybody can make a judgment.
Addiction is a chronic medical disorder in which patients lose control over drug use, Levy said. It is a treatable condition.

Steve Kroft: So you like to be among your constituents?
Officials also acknowledge that much of their plan will be impossible if Congress doesn't pass the administration's nearly $2 trillion coronavirus proposal.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: Well, that's a big question. You know, President Trump was getting close to nominating Congressman Ratcliffe back in the summer, and met so much resistance from senior Republicans in Congress who said this man is not qualified. He's only been on the Intelligence Committee for a year, may have inflated his resume, and is much more partisan around the people who've held that job. The President pulled back and didn't do it. The question is now has Ratcliffe changed any minds? There's not a lot of evidence to that, but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the President has installed Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany, in that job, in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the-- the-- how long acting directors can serve. By nominating a new person, even if President Trump doesn't think Ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows Rick Grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time. There's another theory that Rick Grenell is even more unpalatable to people in Congress than Ratcliffe. So Ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative. So there's a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what's real and what isn't.
You can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of President Trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. And there are 17 other investigations underway. Not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new Democratic House of Representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --that will be shared with Congress?

Tieu had been held since 2013, accused of murder and attempted murder. Duong faced attempted murder and assault charges in the shooting of a man on his front porch. Nayeri was arrested in 2014 on charges including kidnapping and torture. Authorities said Nayeri abducted a marijuana dealer, burned him with a blow torch and cut off his penis because Nayeri thought the man had buried money in the desert.
Still, the Florida researchers do focus on a potential problem we should be acutely aware of, and I do agree with the conclusion that one must judiciously employ topical antibiotic therapy for ear infections and ear surgery, Kohan said.

I would prefer to buy the vaccine on the market when it's available, he said, explaining that he lost trust in the government's health care system when he caught the coronavirus last year, but had six tests with different results. It was like a joke, he said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Republican, and about twenty allies--
The big strategic problem with the Trump administration's approach was that internally it never really came to a conclusion about what the purpose of its maximum pressure campaign was. At the outset, there were groups in the Trump administration, some groups that just wanted to increase sanctions in order to make it more difficult for Iran to conduct its malign behaviors. There were other groups in the administration, I include the president of the United States in this group, that wanted to increase sanctions in order to get to a 'better negotiated outcome.' There were other groups that really saw this as an opportunity to promote regime change. Unfortunately, the devil is in the details. The way one goes about constructing a sanctions regime differs depending on which outcome you desire. The way that the sanction regime was constructed appears to be most in line with the people who wanted regime change and not in line with people who wanted to facilitate additional negotiations. What I think we should do now, what I hope an incoming Biden administration does, is opens the door for diplomacy, but use the leverage that the Trump administration gives it with the existing sanctions to try to drive a hard bargain that would bring our partners along with it.
Utah and Oklahoma already are among 16 states that allow for use an oil called cannabidiol, or CBD, a compound from cannabis that doesn't get users high but can treat a range of health concerns.

Washington — The Trump administration announced on Wednesday it will require Brazilian asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for the duration of their U.S. immigration proceedings, subjecting the first non-Spanish speaking population to the controversial Remain in Mexico policy.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It makes for some exciting political watching on Tuesday.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: it's not about miraculous. It's about-- adherence to the Constitution. And the American people and the Congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. Basically what the president has done and the Republicans have done, they've joined hands. And the Republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. Okay. But no documents? I mean, come on.
Steve Kroft: How long have you lived here?
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, at this point, you don't know if this person came into contact with anyone. He just showed up sick at the hospital?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's a historic agreement.
It promises to be a demanding time for a man who spent nearly six months in the hospital over the last year and a half for heart and knee surgery. As he showed us the victory prayer chapel, a church founded by his mother, Congressman Cummings relied on a cane and a walker. He says his chairmanship will be a physical burden on him, but his strong faith and awareness of his mortality will see him through.
ED O'KEEFE: It is not. You have to hit fifteen percent in each congressional district and in the states. And so the numbers to look for are fifteen. So if you look at our California and Texas numbers right now, Mike Bloomberg is in trouble because he is not hitting fifteen percent. This could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can't hit fifteen percent in those two states. But this is why, despite not winning anything so far, Elizabeth Warren is still in this race. Because she sees that she is doing well enough in California and in Texas and in a few of these other states, likely, that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later March and April.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are a Democratic socialist. You have never officially entered the Democratic Party. In fact, you constantly criticize Democratic establishment. So, how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify Democrats and challenge President Trump?
He also said that he would extend protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) for three years, as well as an extension of the legal status of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders. Mr. Trump announced that he planned to hold weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House to discuss immigration reform.
WILL THE HOUSE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP?
The radical left can never control our borders. I will not let it happen. Walls are not immoral, in fact it is the opposite of immoral, Mr. Trump said.
It's not clear whether the recent dip represents any turnaround in the problem, Smith said.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at the growing fears over COVID-19, commonly referred to as the coronavirus. Last week the World Health Organization said the global risk of the virus spreading is now very high. Here in the U.S., there are now seventy-one cases of coronavirus and worldwide the death toll is almost three thousand. There are also concerns about the global economy. Here in the U.S., the stock market took its biggest hit last week since the 2008 financial crisis. We begin today with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Good to have you here.
Dispenza, a former nun from another congregation, remembers what happened when a superior summoned her to her room.
MIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am. This was a historic day. American blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time. We went there after 9/11. No one still feels the anger of that day any more than I do. But it was time. And the Taliban knew it was time. President Trump has allowed us to take the fight to the Taliban these last two years. And we have done so. It's why they, for the first time, have announced that they're prepared to break with their historic ally, al-Qaida, who they've worked with much the det-- detriment of the United States of America. You can see, go read the document, the Taliban have now made the break. They've said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the United States, from Afghanistan. This is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the Trump administration. You can see our work on counterterror, whether it's al-Baghdadi, Qassem al-Rimi--

The new territory now includes a beefed-up White House counsel's office. It has added more than a dozen new lawyers to fight what it anticipates will be a barrage of requests and subpoenas from congress.
Under the Biden administration, vaccine doses will no longer be held back by the government, except for a small strategic reserve. The Trump administration, too, eventually adopted this very policy after the Biden transition team announced it would release all but a few doses.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: --particularly Doctor Fauci. There were questions about whether he was being muzzled. He said he was not, one of the nation's foremost authorities on these things. And I think President Trump understands he doesn't-- he wants the markets to bounce back. The markets want to see that kind of expertise in Trump-- expertise and-- and-- and credibility. And at least yesterday, there was a step in that direction.
The I-Team also reached out to more than 30 current and former Navarro College cheerleaders. Seven supported McGee and said they had never witnessed any inappropriate behavior. Two back up the cheerleader's claims of hazing and sexually inappropriate behavior. The rest did not respond to the I-Team's questions.
After a public backlash that included protests, boycotts and accusations of racism, Starbucks said it would close more than 8,000 stores in the U.S. next Tuesday for racial-bias training for its almost 175,000 employees. Schultz recently told CBS This Morning the manager in Philadelphia, who is no longer employed by Starbucks, was likely acting on her own unconscious bias.
ALEX AZAR (Secretary of Health and Human Services/@SecAzar): Glad to be here. Thank you for having me.
MIKE POMPEO: Yep, they said yesterday, signed a document. The gentleman whom I met with agreed that they would break that relationship and that they would work alongside of us to destroy, deny resources to and to have al Qaeda depart from that place.
More worrisome for health authorities is the number of health care workers voicing reluctance to being vaccinated has also been high. A poll conducted in the first week of December among nursing home workers found that just 19% were keen to be vaccinated, while 76% said they did not want a vaccine.
The shutdown does not appear to be slowing the rate at which new staffers are being hired. An employee of the Homestead facility, who asked not to be identified, told CBS News applicants were being hired on the spot at the job fair — as promised in the company's Facebook flyer. The employee complained that new hires were being brought on for supervisory positions, instead of those with seniority.
Asked about the letter's onboarding claim, an HHS representative referred CBS News to CHS. A spokesperson for CHS' parent corporation, Caliburn International, did not return a request for comment.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Given that it is so fast moving, what are your projections now? How many Americans do you expect to come down with this virus?
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he would bring this legislation to the floor this week. The Senate reconvenes on Tuesday. GOP Sen. Marco Rubio also said that it sounded like a reasonable deal.

In addition, the agency will be reviewing its network of halfway houses, where some 80 percent of federal prisoners who return to U.S. communities live before being fully released, and assessing life skills, education and job training programs to ensure that they're best serving inmates' needs. A pilot program is also being launched at four bureau facilities for children of incarcerated parents as a way to keep families united.
Plus, as the coronavirus crisis prompts questions of whether or not the U.S. is ready to handle a pandemic, the politics of preparedness becomes a big issue.
The brutal truth is, it's going to take months before we can get the majority of Americans vaccinated, Mr. Biden reiterated Thursday. The U.S. was administering nearly 1 million doses a day when Mr. Biden took office, so the country is already roughly on pace for 100 million doses by the end of April. But even hitting that goal means only 50 million people will be vaccinated, since both authorized vaccines require two injections to be effective.
Most cases were accidents, the study authors said. Young children got their hands on pills such as Ritalin or Adderall, for example, or kids were mistakenly given a double-dose of their prescription.
While the dangers of polio have been well known for decades, COVID-19 is a new disease, and the government's weak messaging around the virus have likely made things worse.
The spokesperson said the Working Group concluded that vaccine efficacy will be maintained with dosing intervals longer than 21 days… based on clinical trial data that showed the vaccine was 90.5% effective against preventing COVID-19 after the first dose once the protection that starts at around 12 days kicks in, and there was no evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccine is declining towards the end of the 21-day period following the first dose.
As for the woman in the case study, doctors said she was released from the hospital after treatment and did not appear to suffer lasting neurological damage.
While the criminal case is moving forward, the cheerleader's family is also pursuing a civil lawsuit against McGee and Navarro College. Head coach Monica Aldama is not a defendant, but she is repeatedly named as part of the suit. She declined to be interviewed for this story but sent CBS DFW a statement.
ADHD affects how kids function in school and in everyday life. Stimulants such as amphetamine and methylphenidate are frequently prescribed to help control behavior and improve focus.
This week, top national security agencies confirmed that Russia was likely responsible for a vast hack of U.S. government departments, contradicting Mr. Trump's unsupported claim that China was potentially to blame. Speaker Pelosi said that, rather than asserting authority over Russia, Mr. Trump was instead a handmaiden for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
ALEX AZAR: Well, I understand that. It's a very fast-moving situation. Our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were up late at night, very earl-- early in the morning, working with the Washington state public health office and inaccurately recorded that the individual was a female. That's what the President was briefed on. They've apologized for incorrectly briefing on that. But it's a very fast-moving situation. Obviously, we regret the error.
The police report said the woman was uncooperative with officers, who were unable to locate a crime scene. The woman raised concerns about her ex-boyfriend's well-being. Police tried calling Manziel's cell phone and searching for him before it determined he was safe.
MARGARET BRENNAN: In Washington State, in places that have declared emergencies, even shutting down schools I mean they are projecting numbers themselves.
There won't be a silver bullet that will solve this epidemic, said Courtney R. Yarbrough, an assistant professor at Emory University Rollins School of Public Health.
Merck said the settlement doesn't constitute an admission of any liability or wrongdoing. The company still faces individual securities lawsuits tied to Vioxx.
Hundreds of officers are focusing on neighborhoods where the trio charged with violent crimes could be hiding among friends, family or fellow gang members, particularly Orange County's huge Vietnamese population, authorities said Tuesday, the fourth day of the manhunt.
It is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy at our southern border, Mr. Trump said about his planned deal, said he hoped Democrat lawmakers would provide their enthusiastic support.
MIKE POMPEO: --the work that we did against Qassem Soleimani. This is a President who is committed to defending and protecting the American people. We'll do that every place we battle against terror whether that's Afghanistan or any of the other dozens of places we push back each and every day.
The Lehigh Greek Community blog published by the university says the sorority hosted a December scavenger hunt in which participants were given a list of tasks that involved the use of drugs and alcohol, sexual activity and other activities that violate the Bethlehem school's policy.
A recent book by by Alex Berenson, Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence, highlights some of those risks, including marijuana's links to mental illness, harder drug use, and violence. Berenson argues that legislation and public perception in the U.S. have sped ahead of the science, and that the growth has happened in the face of powerful new evidence that marijuana can be deeply harmful to mental health.
This widespread perception exists and that perception itself is creating a vacuum that other actors are moving into. China is moving in economically, politically, to a degree. But not yet from a geostrategic point of view, China is very actively not trying to take the United States position, and they would much rather free ride off of our security guarantees for as long as as possible. But they're an important actor to note.
The push for legalized marijuana has moved into Utah and Oklahoma, two of the most conservative states in the country, further underscoring how quickly feelings about marijuana are changing in the United States.
The Homestead facility's mid-January expansion was announced by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on December 26, the same day the agency disclosed that a larger temporary facility in Tornillo, Texas, would soon close.
This epidemic does not discriminate, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Saturday. Zip codes don't matter. It's affecting our cities, suburban areas, and rural counties. Young or old, rich, middle class or poor, black, white, Hispanic or Asian. The grip of addiction affects all of us.
The Trump administration has hailed the policy as a successful tool in curbing migration and Wednesday's announcement is likely designed to deter U.S.-bound Brazilian migrants, who typically journey through Central America and Mexico to reach the U.S. southern border.
But what we do know is the president is, once again, in his Putin denial, the Speaker said. What is it that Putin has on him?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that Michael Bloomberg has offered. He said he'd extend it to any party nominee. Do you really want to turn down his bankroll?
MARGARET BRENNAN: What would make the President hit the brakes and stop the withdrawal?
Public health officials here are under unusual pressure to reassure the public that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Japan, according to a recent study in The Lancet medical journal, is among the world's most vaccine-wary nations in general, and consequently has some of the highest rates of vaccine-preventable disease in the world.
Saturday marks the 29th day of the longest government shutdown in history. Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats are currently deadlocked over funding for a border wall. Mr. Trump refuses to sign any government funding bill that does not include money for a wall, and Democrats are refusing to negotiate while the government is shut down. Around 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay since the shutdown began.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: First it was religion, and then it was the education. My father, Steve, had a saying. He said-- he told us, If you miss one day of school, that meant you died the night before. And he meant that. I did not miss one second of school between kindergarten and graduating from high school. Not one second.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --of annex-- she says there are secret annexes to this deal.
The Biden administration is also putting a spotlight on racial and geographic disparities in healthcare. One of the president's executive orders establishes a health equity task force, led by Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, to compile data on the coronavirus' disproportionate impact on minority communities.
In October, police in Avon, Ohio, received an emergency call after Manziel and Colleen Crowley were spotted fighting as they drove together near the quarterback's home on the west side of Cleveland. Manziel was not arrested but the matter prompted an NFL investigation to see if he violated the league's personal conduct policy.
MIKE POMPEO: Oh, I remember it well, yes.
Each state sets its own eligibility requirements for voting. Nearly 6 million Americans are unable to vote because of their criminal backgrounds, though more than 20 states have acted in the last two decades to help people with criminal convictions vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
The sorority was suspended pending an investigation by a disciplinary committee that called the activity reprehensible.
He says he keeps a campaign poster in the front window so people will know where to find him.
The historical European powers with interests in the region are similarly either not capable or not willing largely to play any types of roles with the exception of France. But even France is limited in what it can do and wants to do, mainly to Lebanon and to some degree in North Africa. What's left is a coalition that should have emerged a while ago, but for a number of reasons didn't. But it's finally emerging now between states, Israel and the Gulf, that have largely been interested in their own defense, but not been larger regional players. They are coming together now to position themselves to be able to protect the region against massive encroachment from these non-Arab powers. Quite frankly, that's a good thing because a region that ends up being dominated by Iran or Turkey or Russia is not a region that serves our interests.
ALEX AZAR: And we have offered, even though it is not medically indicated, we have offered to test any HHS employees involved if they would like that extra piece of mind. We want to do that for our employees.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington and this week on FACE THE NATION, the coronavirus has now claimed the life of an American within the U.S. and the number of infected has increased and now includes cases of unknown origin. Meanwhile, the Trump administration scrambles to calm fears of Americans concerned with the spread of coronavirus and its impact on the economy as the stock market has its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Plus, it's a big win for former Vice President Joe Biden in South Carolina. As the candidates head to Super Tuesday, can he stop Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders?
In this episode of Intelligence Matters, Michael Morell speaks with Will Wechsler, the director of Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council, about why the region is still of strategic importance to the U.S. Wechsler discusses the perception in the Middle East that the U.S. is withdrawing, the influx of young men in the region and the potential for more negotiations after the Abraham Accords.
WILL WECHSLER: It's very important right now. I can take one step back. I believe that today and actually for the last 5 or 10 years, there are a lot of different factors that are affecting trends in the region, lots of different micro factors that affect individual countries, lots of local rivalries. But if I was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of American withdrawal.
Germany's leaders and health officials will be hoping she's right, as reluctance, particularly among health workers, can have a serious impact due to their inherent higher risk of contracting the virus.

On Tuesday, Democrats won both Senate seats in Georgia's runoff election, giving them a narrow majority in the next Senate, with the help of potential tie-breaking votes from Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Having also defended their majority in the House of Representatives last November, the Democrats will have control of both chambers of Congress — as well as the presidency — come January 20.
The less stringent stance toward marijuana use, at least off the job, comes as businesses struggle to hire workers. U.S. employers advertising 6.6 million open jobs in March, up 7.8 percent from February and the highest count since the Department of Labor starting compiling the data in December 2000.
In the states that have more recently enacted recreational use statutes, it is still too early tell what will happen with testing patterns, Sample said in emailed statement.

According to Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), Barr's stance is a good sign for advocates but it remains to be seen if his actions will follow through on his pledge.
Irish drugmaker Perrigo is tumbling after cutting its profit forecast. The company said prices for over-the-counter products in Europe are down, and it may take an impairment charge for a business it bought just a year ago.
The rules at Caesars potentially impact tens of thousands of workers, given it employs some 63,000 people in 13 states. About half of Caesars' workforce reside in Nevada, where voters legalized recreational pot use, starting in January 2017.
Steve Kroft: Do you think it's possible the Republicans will try and suppress the report?
But national uptake hasn't been enthusiastic off the starting block: Some 6 million people are eligible for inoculation in the first stage, including the elderly, people with chronic diseases, and medical workers. Registration was opened on December 24, but as of this week, only about 250,000 Jordanians had signed up for a shot.
In response, the White House said: these claims are completely baseless, but we cannot comment further about ongoing litigation.
In the past, we have received negative publicity for this work with (HHS), and it is possible that we may be subject to such negative publicity in the future as well, the company wrote. Allegations of impropriety or reports mischaracterizing our activities or criticism of the missions that we are supporting have the potential to cause us reputational harm.

For many, however, it's looked more like a wait and see approach than a blanket no. In the December poll, 86% of those against the vaccines said they were worried about potential side effects, especially of the vaccines like Pfizer's and Moderna's which have been developed using new technology.

The 4,500-member Utah Medical Association isn't against the idea of legalized medical marijuana but has numerous concerns with an initiative it thinks is too broad and doesn't include necessary regulatory measures, said Michelle McOmber, the group's CEO.
A CBS News series last summer detailed the due process concerns about the policy, which makes it extremely difficult for migrants to secure U.S.-based lawyers generally needed for successful asylum claims. According to data by researchers at Syracuse University, only about 4% of migrants in the program have had lawyers represent them in proceedings in the U.S. — which, for many migrants, now occur inside makeshift tent-like courts in the Rio Grande Valley.
We have tended to use quinolone ear drops fairly liberally after tympanostomy tube surgery, study co-author Dr. Patrick Antonelli, chair of otolaryngology, said in a university news release.
On Thursday, we learned President Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. It marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the Donald Trump Reality Show with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave Democrats control of the House of Representatives. Among the recently empowered is Congressman Elijah Cummings, the new chairman of the House oversight committee. It has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the Trump administration and making Cummings one of the most powerful people in Washington.
We were deeply disappointed to hear that Jenrry has again violated Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program,the Mets said in a statement reported by CBS New York.

Marijuana legalization efforts have faced some pushback from religions before — including in 2016 in Arizona and Nevada from the Mormon church, and the same year from the Catholic Church in Massachusetts. But not to the scale they could face this year in Utah, where Mormons account for about two-third of the population, said Matthew Schweich, executive director of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project.
SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Unlike similar escapes where dangerous inmates fled into rural areas, the three men who broke out of a Southern California lockup escaped into densely populated suburban communities where they have close ties.

The overwhelming majority of the president's opponents are not ready to get vaccinated, noted the Lavada Center.
Caliburn has also repeatedly declined to speak with CBS News about the Homestead facility's rapid expansion. According to HHS, the facility currently employs 1,600 people while holding 1,250 children. It ultimately will fit 2,350 children, and will have to staff up to meet that need. The site is required to have no more than 12 children for every one adult supervisor, 24 hours a day, according to HHS, plus security, medical, case management and operations personnel at all times.
Sheriff's officials put out a call in both English and Vietnamese on Monday for help in finding them. The two may be embedded there, said sheriff's Lt. Dave Sawyer, who is leading the investigation.

Only 10% said they opposed vaccines in general, while 12% of the respondents said they saw no reason to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
If an application is made and denied, Mejia could ask baseball's arbitrator to end the ban, claiming the penalty is without just cause. The arbitrator cannot reduce the ban to less than two years.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael, I mean does the President now have the credibility and-- and the trust of the public at a moment of crisis when you need it most?
Mejia has spent parts of five seasons with the Mets. His breakout campaign came in 2014, when he appeared in 63 games and posted a 3.65 ERA and 28 saves. The Dominican right-hander signed with the organization in 2007.
Dr. Petra Creutz, a pulmonologist in Berlin, told CBS News she believed it was more a matter of uncertainty than rejection.
The third one is Iran. If you're sitting in Riyadh as compared to 20 years ago, you see Iran vastly expanding its placement and access and encircling you. It trying to- whether it's in Iran, Iraq, Syria or in Yemen- trying to build in Yemen the kind of threat against Saudi Arabia from the South that they've been able to build over the decades against Israel from its north. So these are really huge issues. The person that has to deal with them, Mohammed bin Salman, is somebody who was not trained all his life to deal with these problems. Most Americans know the story of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That was a horrible crime. In the old line in War and Peace, 'It was worse than a crime. It was a mistake.' It really set Saudi Arabia back, but it was not isolated. It was the end to a year and a half of poor, rash decision makings by Mohammed bin Salman on a series of of issues. It wasn't like Mohammed bin Salman was inventing problems, but the the way that he chose to deal with these problems made the individual problem worse. One hopes that MBS, if he is able to move from crown prince to King, that he has learned from that experience because we could all be living in a world where he's going to be the king for many decades to come and our interests will remain there for quite a long time.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just had the first American death on U.S. soil out in Washington State. What do we know about how the virus was contracted and how much it has spread?

Crowley had told police that Manziel hit her and pushed her head against a car window. The couple told police they had been drinking alcohol earlier in the day.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: They can't afford health care. They are scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump. And, by the way, almost all of the national polls out there, you know, I've had last seventy polls, sixty-five of them, I think, have us beating Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you called them terrorists in the past. Do you still consider the Taliban terrorists?
WILL WECHSLER: Absolutely. The counterterrorism challenges that we all face are at a low ebb at the moment. But we've seen them be at the low ebb previously and we've seen them get much larger and more powerful and more directly threatening before. There's no reason to expect that can't happen again. We have a real concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons in this region, especially Iranian nuclear weapons.
But now he has stepped onto a much larger stage, under the bright lights of the oversight committee.
The bill targets prevention and education resources and also provides more funding for evidence-based treatment and recovery programs. Among other changes, CARA would expand prescription drug take-back programs and establish monitoring to prevent over-prescriptions of painkillers.
MICHAEL MORELL: Big picture. Why has the Middle East been such a mess for so long?
The announcement is part of a broader movement to undo criminal justice policies that have meted out exceptionally long sentences for drug offenders, caused prison populations to balloon and, advocates say, created unnecessary barriers for ex-convicts looking to rebuild their lives. It amplifies an ongoing Justice Department push to rethink harsh drug sentences and to ensure alternatives to prison for certain nonviolent defendants, an effort known as Smart on Crime.
Employers in Colorado and Washington, the states where recreational use of pot has been legal the longest, have lower rates of including marijuana in drug tests, according to Barry Sample, Quest's senior director, science and technology. Last year, 98.4 percent of all urine drug tests conducted for employers nationwide included marijuana, versus 96.2 percent in Colorado and 97 percent in Washington.

DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: A treatment or a vaccine. But a-- a therapeutic-- a treatment is going to be more likely to be available in the fall. A vaccine is a much longer way off. And we always knew when that once in a generation strain came along, and this might be that strain, that what we were going to have to depend on was our science and something to stop it like a treatment or a vaccine. A treatment, again, we could have by September, October, potentially.
MIKE POMPEO: Look, we can't get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the Taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur, the nature of what's got to take place. We are hopeful that in the coming days, there will be inter-Afghan negotiations that commence as well. That has not happened before. It's going to be rocky and bumpy. No one-- no one is under any false illusion that this won't be a difficult conversation. But that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the Afghan people. And that's the appropriate place for that conversation to take place. We're-- we're prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep America safe. We've asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence, both the Afghan national--
There, they moved aside razor wire and rappelled to the ground using a bed linen.
White House officials couldn't say when the vaccine will be available for the general population — those without underlying health conditions who are under age 65 and not essential workers.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, Margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump.
President Trump gave what he called a major announcement about the southern border and the partial government shutdown on Saturday. In his speech, Mr. Trump cited the humanitarian crisis at the border, where he said young children were being exploited by coyotes and women were being sexual assaulted. He did not distinguish between illegal migration and asylum seekers.
Steve Kroft: What happens if you issue a bunch of subpoenas and the administration doesn't respond? Or invokes executive privilege.
But the pace — and a host of other unique factors — have left many around the globe with concerns about the vaccines' safety and efficacy.
The study couldn't prove cause-and-effect. However, children who received quinolones were 60 percent more likely to suffer eardrum perforations than those who received neomycin ear drops, the findings showed. And the researchers believe that the rate of perforations might rise higher if children are given quinolones together with steroids.

The men were gone for as long as 16 hours before officials noticed they were missing from the common dorm they share with more than 60 other inmates at Orange County Central Jail. An attack on a guard delayed a Friday night head count by hours. The trio sawed through a quarter-inch-thick grill on a dormitory wall, got into plumbing tunnels and then sawed through half-inch-thick steel bars as they made their way behind walls to an unguarded area of a roof atop a five-story building.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The President yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman. It is a man.
The vast majority of people in office jobs, 84%, said they would get a vaccine, but only 70% of people in unskilled/semi-skilled manual occupations or who were unemployed said they would.
The Speaker also said she agrees with Sen. Mitt Romney, who said the cyberattack amounted to an invasion.
ALEX AZAR: That is absolutely not the case. So, first, we take the protection of our employees very seriously. Second, we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate. Third, we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns. We are aggressively looking into any-- if-- to see whether there's validity to the concerns. But what the American people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any HHS employee had contact with the individuals involved. They are not-- nobody is symptomatic. Nobody has a disease. Even if these allegations prove to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this.
But any private assurances Sessions may have given Gardner before his confirmation hearing were not necessarily evident in that testimony. He told senators who asked him about this very issue that one obvious concern is that the United States Congress has made the possession of marijuana in every state and distribution of it, an illegal act.
JOE BIDEN: We are very much alive.
SCOTT PELLEY: He-- he said the-- the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.
The national strategy says the Biden administration aims to stand up a coordinated response while restoring trust, accountability and a sense of common purpose in our response to the pandemic, an unmistakable dig at the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. Jeffrey Zients, the coordinator of the White House's COVID-19 response, told reporters on Wednesday that the situation the Biden team is inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined.
Methods that promise to rid your body of toxins can include anything from an all juice or liquid diet to pumping your body with multiple herbal supplements and even taking laxatives.
Let me start by by asking you to explain why the Middle East is still important to the United States, even though we are now, as a nation, energy independent?
When riots broke out in Baltimore three years ago after the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, who was fatally injured in the back of a police van, Cummings gained national attention walking the troubled neighborhoods trying to keep the peace. He is part of the city's fabric.
A company spokesperson further clarified to CBS News on Monday: The key piece here is that we are asking customers that when using a Starbucks space, we respectfully request they behave in a manner that maintains a warm and welcoming environment by using spaces as intended, being considerate of others, communicating with respect [and] acting responsibly.
Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered a national lockdown early in the pandemic, but quickly abandoned it as the virus spread widely in the country.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We're beating them in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. We can beat Trump.
In Nevada, positive tests for marijuana use increased 43 percent last year in the state, according to data released by Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest drug-testing labs in the country. Overall, 2.6 percent of workers tested by Quest tested positive for marijuana.
I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, Mr. Trump tweeted Friday evening. He had originally said it would be at 3 p.m. but his schedule later noted it would take place an hour later. He is giving the speech after presiding over a naturalization ceremony for immigrants at the White House.
Now, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of Iraq or Afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. But if you compare it more historically, the United States really hasn't withdrawn. We still have a lot of military forces. Our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. But this perception remains. The perception is not without merit. The perception comes from actions that consecutive US presidents have taken. It comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the United States. If you're a country in the region whose security architecture has depended for many decades on the United States, are you going to depend on that in the immediate future? Of course. But looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, these countries are not going to bet the existence of their country on the United States staying the course as it has. They already experienced this. Their fathers, in some cases, experienced this when the British left in the early 70s after promising that they would not leave.
Gannett, the owner of USA Today and other papers, offered to buy Tribune Publishing for $388 million. Tribune owns 11 newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. It said Tribune has refused to start constructive talks.
Mr. Trump then presented what the White House believes could be a deal to end the shutdown, saying he was speaking to break the logjam.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. Well, certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move. We're going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs. Hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day. By the end of the week after that, we'll probably bring on another ten thousand. So we'll have testing capacity of, perhaps, as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks. Once we bring on the academic labs, that was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs--
While garnering attention in recent days, the spokesperson said the policy has actually been in place since the end of 2016. AutoNation, the country's biggest auto dealership chain, also quietly made the move more than two years ago, the company's CEO told Bloomberg in January.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect drug shortages, as some senators have highlighted concerns there could be because of disruption to the supply chain?
Due to the temporary government shutdown, we have limited personnel available to assist with your onboarding, the letter states.
Dr. Nieca Goldberg, cardiologist and director of the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women's Health at NYU Langone Medical Center, notes that while detoxing can be a necessary process for people addicted to drugs and alcohol, the average person does not need to take extreme steps to cleanse so-called toxins out of their system. In fact, the body detoxes naturally.
Steve Kroft: So how are you gonna run this committee?
Alpha Chi Omega can appeal. The national organization conducted an investigation resulting in probation and individual punishments.
U.K.: The roll of race and income
As of Friday, new coach Hue Jackson had not yet been in contact with Manziel. The Browns were disappointed when the second-year quarterback, who was taken with the No. 22 overall pick in the 2013 draft, missed a scheduled medical treatment on the final day of the season.
MICHAEL MORELL: Second issue is extremism, ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and al-Qaida in Syria. What should the U.S. role be here?
More than 57,000 asylum-seekers from Central America, Cuba, Venezuela and other Latin American countries who would otherwise be in the U.S. have been sent to northern Mexico, where they are often stranded in overcrowded shelters and squalid makeshift encampments, including in crime-ridden cities like Ciudad Juárez and Matamoros, located in a region the U.S. government warns American travelers not to visit due to rampant violence.
[I]t is untenable over the long term for the Justice Department or the DEA to be enforcing a patchwork of laws, where something that's legal in one state could get you a 20-year prison sentence in another, Obama told Rolling Stone. There's something to this whole states-being-laboratories-of-democracy and an evolutionary approach. You now have about a fifth of the country where this is legal.
Merck & Co. Inc. removed Vioxx from the market in 2004 after evidence showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Minister of Health Dr. Natheer Obeidat told reporters that he hopes that the nationwide campaign will reach between 20% and 25% of the country's citizens in the coming months.
The liver plays an important role in breaking down toxins in the body and getting rid of them, he told CBS News. There is no way to artificially enhance this, nor should anyone need to.
Facing a dramatic surge in both infections and hospitalizations — fueled, according to U.K. officials, by a more infectious strain of the coronavirus discovered in southeast England — British officials decided last week to change their inoculation strategy.
HPV vaccination rates dropped from 70% to less than 1%. That drop is now blamed for 5,700 needless cervical cancer deaths.
Caesars will continue testing for cannabis use for jobs, such as drivers, where federal rules mandate screening for marijuana. We still test for pot -- and other drugs -- if we believe an employee is high on the job, the spokesman said.
Above all our plan is to restore public trust, Mr. Biden said at the White House, appearing alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who will now play a more public role as the new administration embarks on its pandemic response effort.
In recent years, Starbucks largely left bathroom policies to individual locations.
WILL WECHSLER: Indeed, many of the leaders did not for many decades see their chief objective as improving the well-being of their populations. That's changed in some of the countries and the region. It will have to change if the region is going to become less stable over time. But when you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is as a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. There are very few things that are true for every country in the world. But one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. Testosterone is a hell of a drug. There are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. They are attracted to destructive avenues.
Federal officials also have said that Merck began illegally promoting Vioxx as a rheumatoid arthritis treatment almost immediately after it was approved in 1999. Companies are not allowed to market drugs for conditions that have not been approved by the FDA.
He enrolled at Navarro College in 2015 hoping to win a national cheerleading championship. He and his family met Andre McGee the very first day.
Steve Kroft: And-- and you say the Constitution and the laws say it's not okay?
MARGARET BRENNAN: --when he brings those--
Our national plan launches a full scale war time effort to address the supply shortages by ramping up production and protective equipment, syringes, needles, you name it, Mr. Biden said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So has the administration been slow in its response?
At a job fair in a small Holiday Inn Express conference room in Miami on Thursday, a steady stream of candidates were asked to wait in rows of seats before being directed to laptops where they filled out applications. They sought jobs ranging from case worker to travel chaperone.
Still, the coffee chain is going to run that risk, in light of its new policy of opening its space to all, whether paying customers or not.
ALEX AZAR: So what your viewers need to know is the risk to average Americans remains low. We are working to keep it low. We will see more transmission of cases in the United States. We've got the finest public health system in the world here. This is what we do. We cannot make predictions as to how many cases we'll have but we will have more and we will have more community cases. It's simply just a matter of math.
Quinolones have some advantages over the commonly used alternatives, which themselves are associated with toxic effects on the hearing nerve, said Dr. Michael Grosso. He's head of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.
WILL WECHSLER: Thank you very much for having me.
The report also includes interviews with experts in the fields of medicine, psychology, criminal justice, and public health policy on ways to combat the opioid epidemic -- indicating just how complex the problem is and how difficult any solutions will be.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: Well, I sit here. And the Democrats'll be all over here. And the Republicans will be over there. Our hearings can go anywhere from an hour and a half to 11 or 12 hours.
That's the function of your kidneys, Goldberg told CBS News.
But most experts agree with Dr. Anthony Fauci, who told CBS News in November that the bottom line is simple: We need to get as many people as possible vaccinated.
Unlike other medical marijuana states, Utah's proposal would not allow pot smoking or for residents to grow their own, Schweich said. It would create a state-regulated growing and dispensing operation to allow people with certain medical conditions to get a card and use the drug in edible forms like candy, in topical forms like lotions or balms, as an oil or in electronic cigarettes. Proponents turned in the signatures Monday to get the measure on the ballot in November.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break and continue the conversation on the other side of it. Please stay with us. We hope you will, too.
By Alexandra Odynova - The majority of Russians, 58%, are not ready to get the country's first domestically-made coronavirus vaccine — the only one available in Russia to date — according to the most recent independent survey. Despite the government's insistence that it's safe, many in the country remain wary of the Sputnik V vaccine, which was certified for use in August before Phase-3 human trials even began.
And if parents have any concern their child might be abusing a medication, they should talk to their health care provider, Siu and Smith said.
We have to make sure all our kids are equipped for the jobs of the future - which means not just being able to work with computers, but developing the analytical and coding skills to power our innovation economy, Mr. Obama said. In the new economy, computer science isn't an optional skill - it's a basic skill, right along with the three 'Rs.'
If the two measures pass, Utah and Oklahoma will join 30 other states that have legalized some form of medical marijuana, according to the pro-pot National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws. Nine of those states and Washington, D.C. also have broad legalization where adults 21 and older can use pot for any reason. Michigan could become the 10th state with its ballot initiative this year.
But aside from them, there are three other non-Arab powers that all have historical legacy aspirations in the region and have all been moving very actively, very aggressively into the region. Those are Iran, Turkey, and Russia. All of whom have advanced their position quite significantly and materially in the last number of years. If you look back historically, when any of those actors have tried to move into this region, they've had to confront the historic Arab powers in the region, those powers in Cairo, in Damascus and in Baghdad. The leaders in those cities were the ones that had the ear of the Arab street. They had the armies. They had disproportionate interest, disproportionate power, not only in their countries, but around the region. All of those places are at very weak moments in time right now. Cairo, Damascus, and Baghdad are unfortunately each closer to being a failed state than they are to being regional leaders.
The surgery in question is called tympanostomy. In these surgeries, small tubes are inserted into the eardrums to open up the area behind the eardrum and keep air pressure at a level equal to that of the middle ear. This helps prevent fluid buildup in the middle ear.
According to Dr. Darius Kohan, there were many variables influencing the results — the kids in the study were largely covered by Medicaid, details on the dose and duration of therapy was unavailable, and the study only focused on one form of quinolone ear drops.
And oh, by the way, there's a new N.A.F.T.A. agreement. So it's an amazing record and that's what I know about the two years that we've had Donald Trump as President of the United States.
With kids in the 6- to 10-year age range, Siu said, an adult should always supervise medication use. But parents can start to educate them on label reading and the importance of taking medications only as directed.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: It remains a multicandidate race. There's no question about it. And I think part of that is you look at Bernie Sanders and you look at, despite that enthusiasm that he has, can he grow it? Can he draw people to him? And when we ask folks, most of the people supporting Sanders say they've already liked him. They've liked him for a long time. But far fewer say they've taken-- taken a second or third look at him as he's won these early states. So can he translate any success he's had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty-five, that thirty percent that he's already got? That, I think, remains a key question.
The booming business of legalized marijuana may be seeing a favorable shift from the Trump administration. Attorney General nominee William Barr's testimony this week signaled potential relief for business owners in states that have enacted various laws legalizing cannabis products.
While Barr's stance may seem like a departure from his previous get-tough approach to drug policy, he made it clear during his testimony that he doesn't support federal legalization.
But there is resistance, and Italian officials may be hoping for the kind of growing confidence seen in France and predicted in Germany. Italian health care professionals have shown significant reluctance to get a shot.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So there is no deal to keep a certain U.S. military presence in Afghanistan?
The move now injects uncertainty into the growing industry in the regions of the country that have legalized the drug, CBS News' Jeff Pegues points out. Many are likely to be confused about whether it's okay to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where it's legal, since long-standing federal law prohibits it.
Sessions told reporters Thursday that the Obama guidance in the Cole memo -- written by then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole -- wasn't consistent with federal law.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: We are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. And you've got to understand that. This is serious business.
WILL WECHSLER: We can't write off Saudi Arabia, let's just say that out front. We have interests. There are a number of countries around the world where there are challenges to working with them. Turkey is another one. It'd be a mistake to write off any of these countries. I include Saudi Arabia in that category. However, there are real challenges with with Mohammed bin Salman. If I can take one step back, right now, Saudi Arabia, no matter who's running Saudi Arabia, they really have three existential threats. I don't use the word existential lightly. The first threat is from a transition in leadership that is not yet finished. Saudi Arabia, like it or not, is a monarchy. Anybody who has watched Game of Thrones knows the particular dynamics that come into effect when a transition in the monarchy is not finished. This is a particularly challenging transition as compared to other transitions that have happened in Saudi Arabia, because it's a transition to a new branch of the family. It's a transition to a new generation in the family. It's a transition in the fundamental way of doing business in Saudi Arabia from a very consultative, collaborative model to a more centralized model. That's the first existential challenge. Until that's complete, that will continue.
Altieri agrees that the federal government's official acknowledgment of state legislation should be in the hands of Congress, and he urged lawmakers to embrace what he sees as popular support for legal pot among Americans.
This story was produced by Maria Gavrilovic. Associate producer, Alex Ortiz.
The department has said since 2008 that budget constraints prevented upgrades to the camera systems at the five county jails. The escape was eerily similar to one last year in New York, where two inmates cut through a portion of a wall hidden under a bunk bed and used piping and tunnels inside the facility to get out. But the search for the pair focused on nearby woods instead of a dense urban population.
Sharon Levy, MD, president of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA) and an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, points out that it's important to understand addiction as a medical condition rather than bad behavior -- destigmatizing the problem and making it easier for someone suffering to get help.
History repeated itself in 2013, when anecdotal reports claimed the HPV vaccine was causing serious side effects, including one young woman who said she was left in a wheelchair by it. Researchers in Japan and Europe confirmed the vaccine's safety, but the damage was done.
The demands of chastity and celibacy are unrealistic demands for many of us, Dispenza said.
The doctors concluded that her initial confusion and seizures were caused by a condition called hyponatraemia, which occurs when the level of sodium in the body is abnormally low, typically brought on by drinking too much fluids. However, they were unsure what exactly caused the condition in this patient's case.
However, it still contained the $5.7 billion demand for the wall, which he said would not be a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea, but would instead be steel barriers. He said that a wall would be built along 230 miles of the border.
If case one doesn't work out, we have other options.
Tieu, Duong and Hossein Nayeri, 37, are considered dangerous and all were awaiting trial for separate violent felonies, authorities said. They have now each been charged with the escape.
ED O'KEEFE: This will not be clean. This is going to be a messy contest. It's different than what we've seen before because we have so many candidates. We are down to seven, the magnificent seven, perhaps, who are going into Tuesday. Will the field shrink after Tuesday? Probably. But, again, if you're somebody who can hit viability, fifteen percent in a few of these states, you have no reason to get out yet.
ED O'KEEFE: So there is, essentially, two numbers to look at on Tuesday night. There's the perception number, who wins the state? Who can say that they walked away winning the most states? But the more important number, ultimately, is the nomination number. Who gets closest to getting the one thousand nine hundred ninety or ninety-one delegates you need to get over the threshold and-- and win that nomination.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday, the U.S. signed a deal with the Taliban that may lead to a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Since it began in 2001, the war has claimed the lives of more than two thousand four hundred American troops. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from the signing ceremony in Doha. He got off the plane just a short while ago. And thank you for being here, Mister Secretary.
I'm with my friends during the day. And I'm with this pedophile nun on the evenings and on the weekends, and in the summer, Cahill said.
Grosso had one more caveat for parents.
Millions of people have now had doses of all three of those vaccines, and apart from a small number of severe allergic reactions – mostly among those with a history of severe allergies – and the minor, short-term aches and pains associated with many long-established vaccines, the new drugs appear to be well tolerated.
The cheerleader said he also reported the assault to Navarro College and Monica Aldama. That's when he learned McGee did not work for the school.
By Lucy Craft - Compared to the rush elsewhere to get shots into arms, Japan's tortoise-like approach to vaccination might seem incomprehensible. Japan's first round of vaccinations, using the Pfizer vaccine, is still more than a month away.
The practical impact is to standardize varied state laws about identification.
Calls to poison control centers are often made by worried parents whose kids aren't actually sick, but might have been exposed to a drug.
ALEX AZAR: They might make projections of numbers themselves, but we are not. We'll take aggressive public health measures. It's what we call community mitigation steps. So depending on the nature of the disease and depending on what we learn from these in the field investigations--
This is no reason to panic.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our panel. We brought in two of the big guns from the New York Times today. Edward Wong is a diplomatic correspondent, and Michael Crowley is a White House correspondent covering foreign policy. Good to have you both here.
Chairman Cummings wouldn't disagree that the past two years have been amazing, but in a much different way.
MIKE POMPEO: They have an enormous amount of American blood on their hands.
The boys had to answer to him 24/7, said the cheerleader's mother. He had to have their schedule, so he knew exactly what classes they were in, when.
So, Antonelli said, Physicians are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Until we have other, safer antibiotic ear drops available, clinicians and parents must be cautious when using quinolones or neomycin, and understand the risks associated with both classes of drugs.
The new study builds on prior research suggesting that quinolones may come with risk, he added. Concerns have been raised about potential problems with quinolones, including harmful effects on soft tissues. Last year, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee concluded that the benefits of quinolones in certain instances might not outweigh the risks.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:
WILL WECHSLER: U.S. policies change and presidents change, but our interests remain stable or at least long lasting until there are deep changes. One of those deep changes that has happened is that the United States, thanks to a fracking revolution, has become an exporter of oil instead of an importer of oil. That's a real change and that has important implications. However, that change can be overstated as well.
Steve Kroft: You've known Elijah Cummings for a while. How would you describe your relationship?
WILL WECHSLER: I think the American strategy of dealing with the Iranians has to look really hard and learn the correct lessons from both the Obama administration and the Trump administration. In my view, the Obama administration was absolutely right to consider diplomacy with Iran on its nuclear program. The results of that diplomacy contributed indisputably to positive outcomes on the nuclear file. But there were some weaknesses with that approach. One of the key weaknesses was the division between the United States and its traditional friends and partners in the region, in particular Israel and the Gulf. A sustained approach to diplomacy has to bring those partners along with it rather than being perceived to be cutting them out. The Trump administration took a very different approach to this, a maximum pressure approach to to Iran. They got out of the nuclear deal formally, which I think was was a mistake. I don't think it was a mistake to add sanctions on Iran at all. In fact, the nuclear deal very specifically allowed for such sanctions to be increased on Iran as long as those sanctions weren't on the nuclear file. Unfortunately, Iran has a lot of other malign behavior in the region that merit sanctions. But the Trump administration decided to go a different path.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's the challenge here. You don't. You know there isn't-- the spectrum of disease here is very wide. A lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they shed virus and they're still infective. They can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick. And so, it's probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it. The other thing is that people who get very sick, don't get very sick right away. The time to hospitalization in-- in different studies was nine to twelve days. So they start off with cold-like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill. And it's in that phase that people are spreading it. There was a very interesting analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding--
 … The current conduct history of AXO does not lead the panel to have confidence in the chapter's ability to act and demonstrate care and concern for its members, particularly related to health and safety concerns. This type of behavior is simply unacceptable considering the current climate on college campuses.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are preparing for the worst. We are ready. We are ready.
In a statement, Canó accepted the suspension and said the drug is used to treat various medical conditions in the United States and the Dominican Republic.
It's encouraging but we do need to remain vigilant to keep him to hold his word to the American people, Altieri told CBSN's Reena Ninan. His organization is a non-profit that supports responsible pro-marijuana policy.
The South Asian nation is one of seven countries testing the Chinese vaccine, but a recent poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan showed 37% of Pakistanis wouldn't get a COVID-19 vaccine when it's available.
Catholic bishops from across the U.S. are gathering Wednesday for a weeklong retreat on the clergy sex abuse crisis at a seminary near Chicago. Organizers said the retreat, which was requested by Pope Francis, will focus on prayer and spiritual reflection and not policy-making.
We have an array of issues, of legislation, that have been sitting over on Mitch McConnell's desk that passed in a bipartisan way in the House but that he would not bring up Speaker Pelosi said. So the power of bringing up legislation makes a big difference.
Xerox cut its profit estimate for the year after its first-quarter profit dropped 85 percent. The company's costs went up as it gets ready to split into two businesses, and its revenue fell. The stock shed $1.45, or 13 percent, to $9.72.
According to study co-author Almut Winterstein, Evidence on quinolones' detrimental effects on soft tissues, animal studies, clinical trials and observational studies overwhelmingly point to the possibility that quinolones could contribute to the development of persistent eardrum perforations. Winterstein is chair of the university's department of pharmaceutical outcomes and policy.
Out of nearly 30,000 completed cases in the program, only 187 migrants have been granted asylum or some other form of protection, according to Syracuse's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). Under an expansion of the policy in early January 2020, some asylum-seekers returned by the U.S. to Mexico will have to travel more than 340 miles by car through territory where cartels often vie for control of the drug trade to attend hearings in a U.S. immigration court.
The gathering comes as CBS News has also learned of several cases involving nuns accused of sexual misconduct. The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests – or SNAP – said it doesn't keep count of sexual abuse allegations, but CBS News' Nikki Battiste has spoken with several women who recently reported misconduct, ranging from forceful kissing to molestation, all carried out by nuns.
Elijah Cummings has been in Congress for 23 years but he is not a creature of Washington. When he needs to be there he commutes from his Maryland district, an hour's drive to the north, where he represents 700,000 people and most of the city of Baltimore. He was born here 67 years ago to parents with fourth grade educations who'd been sharecroppers in South Carolina before moving north for a better life. His father worked in a chemical plant, his mother was a domestic. Both were pentecostal ministers.
We contacted the district attorney's office to ask why all of McGee's court hearings had been cancelled. The DA, Lowell Thompson, said they were waiting for McGee to be released from the Freestone County jail on another charge. But when the I-Team called the jail, we were told there was no other charge, and McGee had never been behind bars.
The alleged victim said the pictures don't tell the whole story. In his civil lawsuit against McGee and Navarro College, he said McGee would slap and hit male cheerleaders and make them drop their pants at his command. He claimed McGee had hundreds of nude photographs of the cheerleaders and would force the rookies to drink and/or consume drugs, calling it big girl games.
But even more important is the message that such a program would send to returning citizens: That they are welcome back into society; that their government is invested in their success; and that they can now - quite literally - exchange their old identity as a federal inmate for a fresh start, Lynch said in Philadelphia, where she was joined by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.
Pope Francis was vaccinated this week, and he called on everyone to follow his example. Speaking to Italian TV on Sunday, he called refusal of the vaccines suicidal.
MARGARET BRENNAN: With fourteen states up for grabs in just two days, Biden's victory gives a boost to establishment Democrats hoping to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination.
Perrigo's CEO also left the company to join Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The stock lost $18.71, or 15.4 percent, to $102.64.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're using for planning.
The Justice Department is publishing a manual to provide advice and guidance on re-entry to all U.S. citizens leaving federal correctional facilities.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Now the Trump administration faces a crisis of its own: Calming and reassuring the American public.
Andre McGee attended Navarro College as a student from 1995 until 2000 and participated in the College's cheerleading program. From November 2003 through June 2004, Navarro College employed Mr. McGee as a Resident Advisor (RA). This was the only time Navarro College employed Mr. McGee. Navarro College never employed Mr. McGee in its cheerleading program and never employed Mr. McGee as an Assistant Coach. Mr. McGee was not affiliated with Navarro College in any way at the time of the arrest referenced in your email. The safety and welfare of students is of utmost priority to Navarro College. The College prohibits sexual misconduct, including any acts of a sexual nature against an individual without consent. Navarro College has strong policies and procedures for reporting, investigating, and responding to all allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Navarro College remains committed to the prevention and detection of sexual harassment and abuse. Upon receipt of a report regarding sexual misconduct, Navarro College investigates the matter and acts swiftly to provide an appropriate response.
But it's the nation's deep mistrust of vaccines causing the most concern. For years, Pakistan's efforts to wipe out polio have been thwarted largely due to public fear of foreign vaccines.
The Speaker said she has not received a full briefing on what happened and said the intelligence community may not have the full picture yet.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, two points. I am a member of the Democratic leadership. I have been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress thirty years ago and from-- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats that have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, Margaret, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people who work eleven, twelve bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare.
The best way you can keep your body toxin free is living a healthy lifestyle and getting your nutrients from food, she said.
EDWARD WONG (The New York Times/@ewong): Thanks, Margaret.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that?
Steve Kroft: You've got a lotta power. But you don't have unlimited power. I mean--
Sgt. Steve Enright later identified him as Manziel. Enright told CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca that Manziel had not been arrested. It was unclear if he had yet been questioned.
Ties between Israel and the Gulf: What can be done right now are smaller achievements. What can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some Palestinian misery. I think actually over the long run, the Abraham Accords and growing ties between Israel and the Gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune.
Both the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use and there should be no doubt about their safety. They have been tested on thousands of people and side-effects are negligible, said Dr. V.K. Paul, of the Indian government's coronavirus and vaccines taskforce.
Online, the 40-year-old McGee called himself the assistant cheer coach and #1 recruiter at Navarro College. His Twitter profile proudly proclaimed he was best friends with and right hand to head cheer coach Monica Aldama. In several social media posts, McGee refers to himself as a tough big who is proud of his littles.
MIKE POMPEO: I met with a senior negotiator yesterday, yes.
When asked about Berenson's warnings, Altieri said legalization would give the government greater ability to address these concerns.
WILL WECHSLER: The one piece of advice is to really understand how much the perception of American withdrawal is affecting the region and how much his personal relationships with leaders there will be able to impact their continued thinking on that subject.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders about the race.
With children that age, it's all about safe storage, he stressed. Keep all medication in child-proof containers up, away and out of sight.

I have never and would never tolerate sexual harassment or sexual abuse in the Navarro College cheer program, the statement reads in part. I would not remain silent if I were aware that any sexual misconduct were occurring in the cheer program. In addition, I do not accept or condone unlawful drug and alcohol use by Navarro cheer team members. Andre McGee volunteered as a helper for the cheer team. He was never an assistant coach and never had authority over the team or cheer team members. The cheerleader who has accused Mr. McGee … never made any complaint to me. Once I learned of the allegations against Mr. McGee, I ensured that he had no further contact with the Navarro College cheer team.

Most of the nominees confirmed Wednesday were for executive branch positions. Only a few judicial nominees were confirmed, as Democrats have opposed many of President Trump's nominations to the federal bench.
We want to be very careful about what we bring into our state, McOmber said. This is an addictive drug.
Pelosi said in a statement before the speech that based on reports of the deal, she would not support it, calling it a nonstarter which was unlikely to pass the House.
The move to send Portuguese-speaking migrants to Mexico represents the latest expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program, a policy being challenged in court that has drawn scathing criticism from advocates but which the Trump administration credits for a sharp drop in apprehensions of migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border in the past seven months. Up until now, the U.S. had generally not subjected Brazilians and asylum-seekers from other non-Spanish speaking countries to the MPP program.
However, FBI checks would not surface what state policy refers to as verified maltreatment findings that are not necessarily prosecuted, but are logged in the system because a preponderance of credible evidence exists to support the allegations of abuse, neglect or abandonment.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will.
Researchers found that between 2000 and 2011, there was a 71 percent increase in calls to U.S. poison control centers related to kids' ingestion of drugs prescribed for ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).
In the new study, Antonelli's team tracked data on nearly 100,000 children who underwent ear tube surgery. The researchers then compared post-operative eardrum perforation rates after kids were given either quinolone or neomycin drops.
Steve Kroft: You think he's making money off this job?
MICHAEL MORELL: Let's start with Iran- its nuclear program, its regional ambitions, its malign behavior. How would you think about a strategy of dealing with the Iranians?
Asked why we haven't heard much about abuse by nuns until recently, Dispenza said, A lot has to do with the culture of nuns which are, they are very, very private by nature.
Children who received post-surgical quinolones were 60 percent more likely to suffer eardrum perforations than those who received another type of ear drops, called neomycin, according to researchers from the University of Florida in Gainesville.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll get details and forecasts from you on Super Tuesday ahead, Anthony.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott's interview with Mayor Bloomberg will air tonight on 60 MINUTES.
The letter indicates the offers are dependent on successful drug and background screenings.
Merck said Friday that the case involved people who purchased its securities between 1999 and 2004. The litigation focused on statements Merck made regarding Vioxx's cardiovascular safety.
By Elaine Cobbe - The number of French people who say they're happy to be vaccinated has been on the rise. At the end of December, a poll found that just 40% were willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine. That reflected a drop from polling in November and over the summer.
A survey published by the Pew Research Center in early December showed an increase in overall American confidence in the vaccines, with 60% saying they would get vaccinated.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to work with the Republicans as I have in the past. You know why? Because that's our job. And when it comes to subpoena, I know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. In order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. You gotta have emails. You gotta have information.
One of the subpoenas the House is pursuing involves President Trump's tax returns, which Speaker Pelosi said may reveal the extent of the president's ties with Russia.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --this would be a spoiler in just--

WILL WECHSLER: There is not a very high probability of a solution for the Israeli-Palestinian problem today. The only real solution, the only lasting solution is a two state solution. That's really clear to anybody who's looked at it. Unless you want to imagine solutions that are really horrific. The challenge is that the circumstances are not set at the moment for those kinds of negotiations to continue. I suspect it's going to require generational change. We've had three U.S. presidents in a row, Bill Clinton, Condi Rice under George W. Bush, and John Kerry under Barack Obama, who spent a wildly disproportionate amount of their time trying to get to a holistic solution to this problem. All of which have failed. I don't think a fourth attempt is going to do any better in these circumstances. What can be done right now are smaller achievements. What can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some Palestinian misery. I think over the long run, the Abraham accords and growing ties between Israel and the Gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune.
After researching the herbal remedies that the woman used, the doctors came across another case of a man who had suffered from seizures due to severe hyponatraemia after consuming large amounts of herbal remedies that contained valerian root, along with lemon balm, passion flower, hops and chamomile.
He tweeted that this contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation. With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states.
MIKE POMPEO: Thank you very much, Margaret.
Let me be very clear, things are going to continue to get worse before they get better. The memorial we held two nights ago will not be our last one unfortunately, the president said, referring to a pre-inauguration memorial service he attended at the Lincoln Memorial.
That's really a shame. Because there's a lot of them out there … it's the secret not yet told, Cahill said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How is a mistake like that made? Because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust.
MIKE POMPEO: There are no annexes that the members of Congress won't have a chance to see--
Everybody said, 'Oh you're one of the new cheerleaders. Andre takes great care of you boys,' said the cheerleader's mother. All campus police, the man who was in charge of the dorms, they all knew Andre.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has not yet appeared on a ballot, but that will change Tuesday. He sat down with our Scott Pelley yesterday in an interview for tonight's 60 MINUTES. Here's a preview.
The young appear to be the most reluctant, with more than half of those aged 25-35 consistently saying they don't want a vaccine.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: There are a lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all.
Some Democrats believe Cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. He says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. His staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the White House, and the Trump Organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. The issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various Trump enterprises like his hotel in Washington.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota, and other states around the country.
These results leave ENT [ear, nose and throat] surgeons without an obvious alternative: the risks and benefits of using other antibiotics — or no antibiotic — will need to be considered, possibly on a case-by-case basis, Grosso said.
If I were whoever's investigating, there are some people who would be on a polygraph, I guarantee you, Tamez said. They had to have had some inside help.
A survey by public engagement social media platform Local Circles earlier this month found 69% of Indians said they wouldn't take a coronavirus vaccine, or would at least wait for months before deciding to get one. Only 26% of respondents said they would get a vaccine shot as soon as it becomes available.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (60 MINUTES): I find it incomprehensible that the President would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did last night in South Carolina.
MARGARET BRENNAN: For a closer look at how prepared we are for the coronavirus here in the U.S., we turn to former FDA commissioner and physician Doctor Scott Got-- Gottlieb. Good to have you here.
Rep. Jim Jordan: Taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, the economy growing at an unbelievable rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years. 312,000 jobs added last month alone. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the courts. We're out of the Iran deal. The embassy's in Jerusalem. Hostages are home from North Korea.
An otolaryngologist said the study did have some flaws, as well.
But the questions of how to handle Mr. Trump's involvement in Wednesday's mob do not expire when his term does at noon on January 20. Will the House continue to investigate him after he leaves office?
Despite the praise from the Trump administration, advocates and even some of the asylum officers implementing the program have strongly denounced the Remain in Mexico policy, saying it violates international obligations against returning migrants seeking refuge to dangerous places. The group Human Rights First has denounced hundreds of reported kidnappings and assaults.
According to the report, the 10 states with the biggest drug use problems include:
It is just a few miles from the jail where the trio broke out Friday, and two of the inmates, Jonathan Tieu, 20, Bac Duong, 43, have deep ties to the community, which is among the largest in the U.S.
That means various solutions are in order -- from safer medication storage, to education on the risks of abusing ADHD medication, he added.
MIKE POMPEO: --there have been prisoner releases from both sides before. We have managed to figure our path forward. We'll know who these people are. We are working to build out a set of confidence measures that will do for America what President Trump has committed: reduce our cost in blood and treasure and keep America safe from terrorism. I don't think any American can doubt President Trump's seriousness in that.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --across a spectrum of disease. And the people who are mildly symptomatic shed as much virus as the people who are very sick and that's atypical. Typically, the amount of virus you have and shed to-- in-- in some diseases comports with how much-- how much of virus you have.
In the report, they explain that both patients didn't seem to drink enough excess fluid to bring on hyponatraemia (typically more than 10 liters per day for someone with healthy kidneys). But they hypothesize that the valerian root may have played a role, potentially altering the body's threshold and allowing for hyponatraemia to occur at an earlier stage.
Thorough searches of dorms likely would have discovered tools or damage to the vent grill, he said. It was the first escape in nearly three decades from the California facility, which was built in 1968. It holds 900 men and is in Santa Ana, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the decision the administration made to block the travel, which was controversial at the time, clearly, bought us time. It-- it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country. Virus was probably here at that time, but it slowed additional cases. The question is what do we do with that time? I think there's some things we did that were very smart. We got the country prepared. One of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. I think what-- what we should have done and I don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the CDC. We always rely on a CDC in a public health emergency. But simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. We've done that. You know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. And that is now in place. And those labs are going to be coming online. So we course corrected. I think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? It's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. And we need to do that now in a therapeutic. We-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket. We need to be looking at antibody-based prophylaxis, treatments, vaccines, and all of the above approach.
The issue of felons' rights has attracted growing attention at the state and federal levels in recent years. Last week, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe issued an executive order that would allow more than 200,000 convicted felons to cast ballots in November, calling voting rights the essence of our democracy.
ALEX AZAR: Yes, we are-- we are looking into these allegations. I am personally involved in doing so. First--
We sincerely need input from the community to help us, Sawyer said.
The long-term impact of a criminal record prevents many people from obtaining employment, housing, higher education and credit -- and these barriers affect returning individuals even if they have turned their lives around and are unlikely to reoffend, the department said in a seven-page policy statement titled Roadmap to Re-entry.
The policy includes a stipulation that spaces be used as intended, which could rule out some of the behavior that prompted some Starbucks employees in New York to lock bathroom doors during a short-lived revolt in 2011 as a worker protest against having to clean up after people who left bathrooms a mess.
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and there's no consensus in Congress on a recent proposal to change that.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. Big keys for him. First of all, overwhelming support from black voters. That was key and they make up most of the electorate in South Carolina. That was really helped by an endorsement from Representative Jim Clyburn, the most influential African-American politician in the state, more saying that was important than not. And then, finally, big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat Donald Trump in November. The question now, Margaret, is can Joe Biden parlay that argument into Super Tuesday?
In an email to CBS News, Weber said the FBI fingerprint background checks conducted on employees would show relevant information.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the U.S. that aren't reported?
The Mets and Mejia had just agreed last month to a one-year, $2.47 million contract.
Mary Dispenza is trying to change that.
However, even though this study raises concern about quinolones, neomycin ear drops come with their own hazards, the researchers conceded. Repeat use of neomycin has been linked to hearing loss over time.
Still, they say the two cases highlight the fact that despite marketing suggesting otherwise, all-natural products are not without side effects.
The decision was made to update the dosage interval recommendations for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following a thorough review of the data by the MHRA's COVID-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group, a spokesperson for the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency told CBS News on Tuesday.
Manziel started in six games this season, winning two of them, CBS affiliate WOIO reported. In those six games, Manziel threw for 1,500 yards and seven touchdowns, and adding five interceptions.
In his statement, Canó issued an apology to his family, fans and the Mariners organization.
Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed suggestions of a link between Putin not getting vaccinated and the low public confidence in Sputnik V.
MIKE POMPEO: Don't trust anything. We're going to deliver. It's about actions. The agreements that set out, the conditions that set out the space. But, no, this deal doesn't depend upon trusting anyone. It has a deep, complex, well-thought out, multi-month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable. We'll do that. It's not about trust. It's about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday, which was an important day, but in the days that follow.
These anti-vaxx sentiments have been inflamed by tribal leaders and religious clerics claiming the polio drops are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslims.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Thanks.
By Amjad Tadros - Jordan launched its national vaccination campaign on Wednesday, and it was the first country to specifically include refugees in its COVID-19 inoculation drive.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The NIH director, Anthony Fauci, a doctor, said that from what he's seen, if you get infected, you likely won't get reinfected. But there seems to be so much we don't know. If someone has just sort of mild or moderate symptoms, how do they last? How do you know to go and get tested?
The sheriff's department has been slow to add more rooftop security cameras at the jail despite a grand jury's recommendations for eight years straight, according to a report Monday in the Orange County Register.
They had canon lawyers on retainer just for people like me. Shut her up, pacify her, tell her you love her and you'll pray for her, and send her on her way, Cahill said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And his chief of staff went out and-- and said the media's covering this--
MARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina is the first southern state. Does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like Virginia and-- and North Carolina? Will Joe Biden really challenge you there?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have to have a number you're working with in order to make sure that you have adequate supply, things like testing kits, right? So--
MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. pledged in this agreement, which is public, as you say, that it will help to get up to five thousand Taliban prisoners released. The president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, says no way, no how. He-- nothing like that was agreed to. All of this is supposed to happen in the next ten days. Did the U.S. agree to help release five thousand prisoners?
As previously stated, Andre McGee was not a Navarro College employee. It is the College's understanding that Mr. McGee was allowed to volunteer with the Navarro Cheer program. The College did not compensate Mr. McGee for any time he volunteered. Once Navarro College was made aware of any allegation of misconduct by Mr. McGee, the College notified him that he could no longer volunteer for Navarro Cheer. This matter is the subject of a currently pending lawsuit. Navarro College does not comment on pending litigation. Navarro College denies any and all wrongdoing with respect to the allegations against Mr. McGee. Any further statement by the College will be made by the College's attorneys in the lawsuit.
Motion sensor cameras - available for $55 and often used as baby monitors - can be installed along interior tunnels and pipes to catch inmates, Tamez said.
More importantly, none of the trials carried out on the three vaccines to emerge first, by Pfizer/BioNtech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca, have shown any significant side effects.
A letter released Monday by the Justice Department calls on governors to allow federal inmates who are returning to their communities to exchange their prisoner identification cards for state-issued identification, or to simply accept their prison cards as a primary identity document. Without identity documents, Americans leaving prison face challenges in getting jobs, housing or opening bank accounts, Lynch wrote in the letter.
The deep-rooted mistrust has, for years, seen dozens of people killed in attacks on polio vaccination teams, including an attack this week.
ALEX AZAR: So this individual and we just want to express our sympathy, certainly for his family and for all who are suffering from the coronavirus, this individual was in the hospital out in Calif-- out-- out in Washington. We do not know how he contracted the virus, yet. And so that's why we and the State of Washington are deployed out there to try to trace who he had contact with and how he might have gotten the virus. That's why we call it right now a potential community case, meaning we don't have a discernible connection to any travel to Korea or China or any other impacted area.
The reality is that a very significant proportion of all that energy still comes out of the Middle East. Because of the nature of the sources of energy in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia still is the swing producer and has very disproportionate impact on those global energy prices. We saw that recently when because of a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia, Saudi Arabia decided to push energy prices into negative territory. Something that we have never seen. Thus, demonstrating their clout and their power in the world. These are realities in the world and realities that the United States policies have to take account for.
First Data Corp. gained 29 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $13.29. The electronic commerce and payment services provider reported a larger profit than analysts expected.
Steve Kroft: And you only have two years.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --that aren't reported yet. It's a big country three-- three hundred and forty million people, three hundred and thirty million people, so anyone's individual risk is-- is still very low. But we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. We need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. There was an analysis out today by Trevor Bradford, very good researcher out of the Hutch, looking at the genetic strains in Washington State. And by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. It's an interesting analysis. There probably are more cases. We have community spread now in Washington State, California, perhaps, Illinois, Oregon. So certainly hundreds of cases.
MARGARET BRENNAN: There are cases of the coronavirus in Mexico and in Canada. Yesterday, the President said he is considering and looking at closing the southern border.
MICHAEL MORELL: I should mention that I am on the board of the Atlantic Council, which is where you currently serve. Full transparency here to my listeners. I think that's important. Will, this episode is part of a series of episodes that we're doing between now and the inauguration on the key national security issues that we are facing as a nation and that President-Elect Biden will face. We started the conversation with H.R. McMaster, who gave us an overview of what's going on in the world. We've now done episodes on both China and North Korea. Today with you, we turn to the Middle East.
To increase vaccine availability, the administration plans to erect vaccine centers at stadiums and community centers and mobilize federal personnel to help administer shots. This is a departure from the Trump administration's approach, which sent vaccine doses to states and localities and largely left it to them to figure out distribution.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn confirmed this week that the government was considering extending the length of time between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, citing the example set by the U.K.
WASHINGTON D.C. -- States should make it easier for convicted felons to obtain state-issued identification after they get out of prison, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday in announcing a set of measures aimed at helping smooth the return to society for the hundreds of thousands of inmates released each year.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this now a two-man race?
I think Johnny made progress on the field last year. I think that's undeniable, Haslam said Thursday night. We have a certain expectation for our players and that includes Johnny, and he's got to live up to those expectations.
If he has not learned from that experience that he's had, then we're in for a very bad situation.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you'd suggest that's the conversation the President should have tomorrow with the pharmaceutical companies--
And in some cases, the kids did suffer an overdose, the findings showed.
NAVARRO -- A North Texas college known for its incredible cheer program is being sued by a former cheerleader, CBS DFW reports. The now 20-year-old says he was drugged and sexually assaulted by an assistant coach.
We call on people to come to our centers to take the doses, Wael Hayajneh, a senior Jordanian health official, told reporters. To encourage vaccinations, Jordan's King Abdullah II, along with his 73-year-old uncle Prince Hassan and his eldest son Crown Prince Hussein, were shown on state television getting their first shots this week.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I bring that up first because it gets to some of what we have been talking about today in terms of confidence in professionals versus political choices made for political reasons, and-- and confidence in-- in hard fact and in intelligence. Ed, I know you've been following, as you always do, you lived in China for so long, and you followed the origins of this outbreak of corona, when you heard the administration this week change its language so many times in describing and characterizing response, what did you make of that? And what do you make of what is actually known in terms of what China is sharing with the U.S.?
MICHAEL MORELL: Next is the two-sided coin. That is Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia. One side of the coin being the reformer, the other side of the coin being the autocrat.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: We can look at anything.
So far eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized the drug for recreational use, and it is now helping to fund schools and even law enforcement. California just began selling recreational marijuana in recent days. The new guidance threatens to upend sales by giving federal prosecutors more discretion in how they enforce federal law. According to a senior DOJ official, This is the return of the rule of law, Pegues reports.
Cahill reported her abuse to the sisters of charity of St. Elizabeth in 1994. The congregation paid her a $70,000 out-of-court settlement.
The alleged victim and his family said there was no indication that McGee was only a volunteer.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. And we are continuing our conversation with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is just back in the U.S. after signing a deal with the Taliban in Doha. And-- and-- just that statement alone is kind of amazing. You were the first U.S. cabinet official to ever meet with a member of the Taliban. I think you actually met with one of the founding members of the Taliban who is involved in this.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.
Sister Eileen Shaw, the women Trish Cahill says abused her. CBS News
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I don't have enough details and the-- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the Afghan government. We don't know what's going to happen. One of the difficulties, to be very honest, Margaret, in dealing with Trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in Afghanistan. But it is my view that the United States and I-- I speak of somebody help lead the opposition to getting us into the war in Iraq. It is my view that we got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in America sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care--
Rep. Elijah Cummings: Oh yeah, man--
Rep. Elijah Cummings: A lotta money.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So in France, they shut down the Louvre Museum. They're telling people, don't kiss, don't shake hands. In Japan, they're closing schools for a month. Canada's health minister told his people to start stockpiling food. In the U.S. there are closures, as we just said, in Washington and in Oregon. They've declared a state of emergency out there. And the CDC said this week, disruption to everyday life might be severe.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So Ghani-- what he is saying is wrong?
Rep. Elijah Cummings: Zero. --that's the point. Now, I-- I don't know if any president has ever done this. None. None that has ever said, I'm not givin' you anything. For anything. Nothing.
Navarro County indicted McGee on a charge of sexual assault in March 2017, but for the next ten months the case stalled. That's why the mom says she reached out to the I-Team. It's taken way too long, she said, saying her son feels like he's less important because he's a boy.
She made the same point about younger children -- and said that also applies to any over-the-counter medicine or supplement that could mistakenly get into little hands.
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert told middle school students in January that he thinks medical marijuana will someday be legalized in the state but in March he announced his opposition to the ballot question, which he argues lacks safeguards for the growing and distribution of marijuana.
Although Marino represents a conservative region, the district may be in play for Democrats. Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb was unexpectedly elected in a special election in spring 2018, and retained his seat in November.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you on foreign policy. The President just authorized a deal with the Taliban. What do you think of that? Because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

MIKE POMPEO: Yes. She-- she-- I'm happy to talk with her. There-- there are--
They're hiring so many people with no experience. Some are getting jobs better than me, the employee said.
We'll see, Speaker Pelosi said. It's not a question of let it go. We're not going to let go an insurrection in our country and the attempt of coup d'état so that we cannot validate the election of the next president of the United States.
Still, the company's new policy includes instructions for employees to call 911 if they feel someone is a safety threat, and adds that customers can be banned from Starbucks stores if they're disruptive.
All of these are different fundamentally than direct action, where the United States has to do it on its own and and has to do the finish against these terrorist actors. What I hope is that the United States doesn't look at the world as it is today where al-Qaida and the Islamic State have, thanks to great work that people like you were doing for quite a long period of time, has been diminished. And imagine that current state will be the state in the future. As long as there are underlying Sunni grievances in so many of these places, we will find young men who will be attracted to this Salafi jihadist ideology and we'll need to work with our partners to disrupt their external attacks. At the same time, we need to do the kind of work to prevent the extremism from catching on. Helping our partners change their educational system, provide more economic opportunities. Here, the United States isn't the the largest actor, the most important actor at all. We're not going to be the ones that are going to win the ideological battle for the heart of of Islam. But we can do things to avoid making it more difficult for our partners, and we can assist our partners. That's necessary.
The Justice Department has said that the Kenilworth, New Jersey, company made false statements about the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx to increase sales.

I would have done anything for her. I would have died for her, Cahill said. She gave me everything that was lacking that I didn't even know I was lacking. I was so broken. She filled in all those pieces.

MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, we don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that if it is, we have the medicines and the structure, and the knowledge to deal with it.
ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Well, his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late-deciding voter who is not a fan of Bernie Sanders to side with them instead. Their hope is that by the end of Tuesday, he emerges as the clear alternative to Sanders. It's pretty mathematically impossible, based on what polling is showing us right now, for somebody to surpass Sanders, especially because he is going to have such a big win, it looks like, in places like California. But they are hoping, the Biden team is, that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative.
Frodsham wasn't discouraged by the Mormon church statement, which he notes doesn't go as far in opposition as when the church explicitly asked members to vote against full marijuana legalization in Arizona and Nevada. He said marijuana is a natural plant and that the religion's health code doesn't single out cannabis as being prohibited.
Correspondent Steve Kroft with Cummings at the congressman's home in Baltimore
Rep. Elijah Cummings: Less than that. Actually, less than that. The Congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. And all I'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying.
Pfizer hasn't said that, however. Along with its German partner BioNTech, the American pharmaceutical maker has made it clear that their trial data only shows efficacy for 21 days after a first dose.
Assigning them to a large, busy room likely made it easier for them to avoid detection, said Martin Horn, a professor of corrections at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York.

We're going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the (bathroom) key, said Schultz, discussing rules that took effect during the weekend.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --do you expect this to actually happen?
Having an outlet for (Brazilians) to wait outside the U.S. for their immigration hearings is super-helpful! Ken Cuccinelli, the second-highest ranking official at DHS, wrote on Twitter, thanking the government of Mexico for accepting the change in policy.
The lowest U.S. employment rate in 18 years hasn't done much to lift wages, but the difficulty of finding workers is having one effect: convincing companies to stop testing job candidates for marijuana.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, putting five thousand or up to five thousand fighters back on the field is, obviously-- would have a significant impact on-- on any of the implementation, one would think. So, are-- are--
Pill boxes can be helpful reminders, Siu said. But, she stressed, they can also make it easier for young kids to get their hands on pills.
Steve Kroft: --and the Republicans are going to put a lot of obstacles in your way.

But the events in the 24 hours that followed — an insurrection, instigated by the president, that led to the death of five people — largely overshadowed the news.
NEW YORK -U.S. stocks are skidding Monday as energy stocks take big losses. Companies including Xerox and drugmaker Perrigo are down after reporting disappointing earnings and lowering their expectations for the year. Global stocks also fell.
The vaccine conspiracy theories only got worse after a Pakistani doctor was accused of running a fake vaccination campaign to help the C.I.A. track down Osama bin Laden.
The talk on Capitol Hill currently centers on what action politicians will against President Trump before Inauguration Day. Will the House vote to impeach him? Will the cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment?
Our partners in the region, the Arab countries on the western side of the of the Persian Gulf and Israel, they only one year ago all sent emissaries rushing to Washington because they were terrified that the maximum pressure campaign was driving them in a direction of a regional war with them on the front lines. They want to de-escalate as well. So I hope the goal is de-escalation. I hope the goal is confidence building measures. I'm a little skeptical, quite frankly, about whether or not a new nuclear agreement can be reached. I think that Iran has turned much more hard line. In the interim, windows of opportunity open and close for such things. I hope I'm wrong on that. But I don't see a downside in trying.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we'll-- we'll gear up for that with both of you. Thank you.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb will both be here.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not winner take all.
A recent poll by national broadcaster NHK showed 36% of Japanese wouldn't take a COVID-19 vaccine. That's not remarkably low trust, but public health officials will be incredibly alert to any unvetted reports of side effects sparking another media-fueled panic.
Parents should be cautious about agreeing to 'ear tubes' in the first place, he said. Although they are clearly helpful to many children, parents should do their homework to be sure that their child's ear problems meet the narrow criteria set forth by experts, as many cases of ear fluid go away with 'watchful waiting' alone.
A year after it emerged, COVID-19 has now claimed more than 2 million lives worldwide. Experts have said for much of the last year that the only way to escape the coronavirus' grasp is through widespread vaccination. Weapons to win that war have been and continue to be approved by individual countries' drug regulators in record time.
Suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence, the U.S. agency said in its statement. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19.
SCOTT PELLEY (60 MINUTES): How do you view this emergency?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty-six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge?
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Anthony and Ed, there are a lot of headlines after South Carolina saying this is now a two-person race but there are still a lot of people on the field. So--
Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Canó has been suspended for 80 games for violating Major League Baseball's drug policy. Canó tested positive for Furosemide, a diuretic, in violations with the league's Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, the league said Tuesday.

With the worst COVID-19 epidemic in Europe, and one that is worsening fast, Britain's strategy was clearly born of urgency. It's a bid to provide as many people with some immunity as fast as possible to try and stem the dramatic spread of the virus, and it the U.K. isn't alone in considering the measure.
The report from personal finance website WalletHub ranks the 50 states and the District of Columbia across more than a dozen key metrics, ranging from the rate of opioid prescriptions to arrest and overdose rates and meth-lab incidents per capita.
It's a question of compassion, Schweich said.
Pakistan suffers from extreme poverty, rampant corruption, and has a tiny health budget. It's struggled to contain the virus largely because hospital space is limited and many areas only have rudimentary health care facilities.
In a statement announcing the move, the Department of Homeland Security said the number of Brazilians reaching the U.S.-Mexico border tripled in just the last year. Border Patrol apprehended more than 6,300 Brazilians between September and December 2019, according to Customs and Border Protection statistics that showed people from Brazil made up the fifth largest group of apprehensions in that time span after migrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
Pakistan has officially recorded a total of over 423,000 coronavirus infections and close to 8,500 deaths. But experts say the real toll is likely much higher, because the government is only doing a fraction of the testing it should.
This substance was given to me by a licensed doctor in the Dominican Republic to treat a medical ailment. While I did not realize at the time that I was given a medication that was banned, I obviously now wish that I had been more careful, he said.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel; I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.
The Browns had no immediate comment Saturday.
Steve Kroft: You've asked the White House for a bunch of things. you've asked for documents connected to Jared Kushner's use of private emails. Child separation policy at the border. Have you ever gotten anything?
It was a concern echoed by the employee who spoke with CBS News.

First, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must open the government today. Second, I cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the Senate. Third, I am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues, Durbin said.
Cummings' Republican foil on the committee is Ohio's Jim Jordan, one of the president's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters.
There are also bills the Senate can now pass without needing any Republican votes, through a legislative process known as reconciliation. Budget reconciliation applies to certain tax, spending, and debt legislation and allows the bills to pass in the Senate with a simple majority, which the Democrats will have. Most other legislation requires a majority of 60 Senate votes and provides senators with the ability to use the filibuster to indefinitely prevent a bill's consideration. The Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 through reconciliation.
Starbucks last week apologized after a customer at a store in California found a derogatory term for Mexicans printed on his coffee drink.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, does he have the enthusiasm that you say Sanders' supporters have?
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --and-- and leveraging their capacity. These are the major medical centers. What we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get a therapeutic. We know when this started, but we don't know when this is going to end. And what's going to end it is our technology. Our savior here is going to be our technology. And we need to make a really robust effort to try to develop a therapeutic.
Widespread perception of U.S. withdrawal in the Middle East: If I was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of American withdrawal. Now, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of Iraq or Afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. But if you compare it more historically, the United States really hasn't withdrawn. We still have a lot of military forces. Our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. But this perception remains. The perception is not without merit. The perception comes from actions that consecutive U.S. presidents have taken. It comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the United States.
Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pennsylvania, announced he would step down from Congress at the end of January, ensuring a special election in the swing state in coming months.
He said that U.S. attorneys should understand that the attorney general believes marijuana is against federal law, and should there be prosecutions that need to be brought in order to enforce that law, then they should bring those cases.
States that have already legalized marijuana are likely to protest Sessions' directive. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner said before Sessions' announcement that the attorney general is going back on what he'd told Gardner earlier.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?
Now as chairman of the oversight committee, Cummings no longer has to consult with the Republicans to issue subpoenas, initiate investigations or call hearings, and he has a much bigger budget and staff. So will Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, and Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, but their inquiries will be limited to their specific jurisdictions. Cummings' committee has the authority to investigate anything inside or outside the federal government.
Below is a snapshot of sentiments on vaccination in nine countries from CBS News journalists:
Earlier this week, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam said he thought Manziel's relationship with the team could be saved but his behavior may force the team to release or trade him.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You served in the Trump administration. What do you think the administration is doing now that is right, wrong in its handling of the virus?
MIKE POMPEO: --never got to see. John Kerry never got to see those side deals. This is-- this is not that. This is a fully transparent arrangement. And as for-- and as--
Seeing the first wave of vaccinations — of nursing home residents and medical staff — go off without any serious side effects may have contributed to the rise in confidence in January.

MIKE POMPEO: Who I know well.
The company pleaded guilty several years ago to a misdemeanor count of violating marketing laws and made a $950 million payment. It also settled around 50,000 patient lawsuits in November 2007 for $4.85 billion.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@BernieSanders/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret.
Rep. Elijah Cummings: I don't think the other presidents-- called a lie the truth and the truth a lie. I-- I'm gonna tell you, that's what makes the relationship so difficult. It's hard to trust. You-- you wanna believe that if you make an agreement with someone, and I believed that with the other presidents it was this way, their word was their bond. I don't know how to compare. I-- I-- I don't. And I'm not tryin' to be smart.
By Haley Ott - A December poll by the Royal Society for Public Health showed that overall, 76% of adults in the U.K. would get a coronavirus vaccine if their doctor recommended it, but that willingness varied significantly based on a person's socio-economic status and ethnicity.
Then the Trump administration signs a peace deal with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from that signing ceremony with the Taliban, and we will talk to him.

Beyond the legal matter, Manziel could face discipline from the league. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an email the league is aware and looking into it.
The Justice Department initiative directs federal prisons to prepare an individualized re-entry plan for each inmate that will take into account substance abuse, criminal history and education level.
The report describes the case of a previously fit 47-year-old woman who was hospitalized after following a New Year's detox last year that involved drinking lots of fluids and taking various herbal remedies. She was admitted after a brief period of confusion and repetitive behavior such as grinding her teeth. She then collapsed and suffered a seizure.
The Catholic Church has been plagued with high-profile abuse scandals but pedophile nun is a phrase many people have probably never heard before.
More than 3 million people have had a first dose of either the Oxford or Pfizer vaccines in the U.K.
We have a real concern about Israel. Israel is more secure and more prosperous than it's ever been before. But that doesn't mean that there are no threats to Israel anymore and a lot of which come from Iran and its proxies. We generally, ever since really the Eisenhower administration, have acted as a status quo power, trying to return the region to the status quo when it's been upset in order to build a foundation for general security and general prosperity in the region. Because we believe that overall serves US interests. We have a variety of those interests which aren't going away. Despite the very popular view out in the American public- that's expressed by people on both sides of the aisle in the Congress and almost everyone that was running for president that the United States- that we should do less in that part of the world. That doesn't mean that we should be doing nothing in that part of the world.
MICK MULVANEY: The press was-- was-- was-- was-- was-- was covering their-- their hoax of the day because they thought it would bring down the President.
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin also said in a statement that he would not support the rumored deal before the speech.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's been a rough week of mixed messages and attacks on familiar targets.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Margaret, it is not only-- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a Super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires. What we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working-class people all across this country.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But more testing means more positive results. I mean you're saying, basically, expect the number of those who've been diagnosed with the virus to also increase?
MICHAEL CROWLEY (The New York Times/@michaelcrowley): Thanks, Margaret.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: No, that's a huge problem here, Margaret. Think back to what happened when Hurricane Dorian was hitting the United States last summer President Trump made an inaccurate comment about the hurricane's path and was criticized for it. And then a day or two later, he's holding up a map showing the storm's forecasted path in the Oval Office and it appears to have been doctored with just the kind of sharpie pen that President Trump loves to use to sign documents. It really looks like they were altering information they were giving the public to make the President look good, to cover up for a mistake he had made. And President Trump has repeatedly bungled basic facts, including numbers of victims in the country. Yesterday he got the gender wrong of the person who died in Washington although he may have been briefed inaccurately. I will say, Margaret, that I do think that that briefing yesterday was a step in the right direction. Having all those health experts there--
However, Democrats seem unlikely to take the deal. A senior House Democratic aide told CBS News that Democrats do not truly consider this a compromise, as Mr. Trump still wants full funding for the wall. They also believe that the deal does not offer full protection to Dreamers and is a temporary fix.
We turn now to Senator Bernie Sanders. He is on the campaign trail in Norfolk, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.

By Imtiaz Tyab - Pakistan's government has pinned its hopes of inoculating the nation's 230 million-plus citizens with a coronavirus vaccine created by a Chinese company. Officials say the CanSinoBio vaccine is near the end of Phase-3 human trials in Pakistan and has shown considerable promise.
MIKE POMPEO: We want women to be involved. They-- there will be lots of people say things. There will be lots of noise. Everyone is competing for attention and time in the media. What matters is the actions that we take, the discussions that we had. We have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday. While I was in Doha, Secretary of Defense was in Kabul, along with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. They made a declaration. There was a commitment from the Afghan government, too. We've made a lot of progress. No one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward. We've built an important base where we can begin to bring American soldiers home, reduce the risk of the loss of life of any American in Afghanistan, and, hopefully, set the conditions so the Afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their, now what for them is a forty-year struggle.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Pompeo is here for more on ending America's longest war, and then a look at politics and Super Tuesday.
Those numbers steadily rose until 2011, when about 12,300 calls were made -- up from just over 7,000 in 2000. Then from 2011 to 2014, calls declined slightly -- to fewer than 11,500.
Nathan Frodsham, a 45-year-old married Mormon father of three, is hoping the measure passes so he can get off opioids and back to using the vaporized form of marijuana that he used when he lived in Seattle after his doctor recommended trying for his painful osteoarthritis in his neck.

Hallock said the jail's general policy is to do walk-throughs every hour to check on inmates. More thorough searches are done randomly, he said, declining to give more details.
Caesars Entertainment made headlines this week for its decision to opt out of screening potential hires for pot use, with the casino operator implementing the policy nationwide, a spokesman confirmed, adding: It was one factor disqualifying a lot of good people.
MICHAEL MORELL: Are there other reasons why the Middle East is important? One of our key allies, Israel, sits right in the middle of it. Sources of extremism, refugees. Are there other reasons why we need to pay attention?
Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives, Pelosi said. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.
Bond prices fell slightly. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.90 percent from 1.89 percent. The euro rose to $1.1267 from $1.1245. The dollar fell to 111.11 yen from 111.67 yen.
EDWARD WONG: --tried to warn health care professionals in a private chat group about it. And then he was even taken in by the police because of that and admonished.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has suggested Britain's drug regulator may be gambling with public safety by expanding the time gap between administration of the first and second doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine beyond that proven safe and effective by trial data. The FDA warned in a statement on Monday that there was a potential for harm if people believed they were protected against COVID-19 by a first dose of Pfizer's vaccine for longer than available data demonstrate.
The 26-year-old was the Mets' closer before he was suspended for 80 games last April 11 following a positive test for Stanozolol, a drug popular among bodybuilders. At the time, he said, I can honestly say I have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system.
@BernieSanders HHS Secretary Alex Azar, @SecAzar
What it really does mean is that, in the absolute worst scenarios, nobody can do to us what we did to Japan before World War Two, which is cut off our source of energy in context of a war. If worse comes to worse, we can go to autarchy. We can produce the energy that we need, at least the oil that we need, in the United States. That's a really good thing. But that doesn't mean that the United States is isolated from the world. It doesn't mean that the price of oil and energy and gas in the world doesn't affect the United States. The reality is that price is a global price and that price is not just dependent on US production. US energy producers do not give Americans a discount for being Americans. American consumers do not pay more for gas when it's produced in the United States. This is a global market.

Separately, a Starbucks procedure manual for employees offered detailed instructions on what to do if someone is behaving in a disruptive manner. It said disruptive behaviors include smoking, drug or alcohol use, improper use of restrooms and sleeping.
Delhi-based marketing professional Rupali Dhanda, who has a masters in biochemistry, told CBS News she wasn't ready yet, arguing that there's not enough research yet on the vaccines.
Merck said Friday that it will wind up paying about $680 million for the latest settlement, after accounting for insurance policy funds. The company plans to record a charge for that payment in its fourth quarter report.
WILL WECHSLER: Absolutely. There's a lot of reasons for that and very understandable reasons for that. For the last 20 years, starting with George W. Bush's war in Iraq, the United States really changed its policy that it had been following for roughly five decades before that. Instead of supporting the status quo, it became one of the most important threats to the status quo. On top of that, the failures and mistakes in the implementation of that policy has led a lot of people in the region and a lot of Americans to ask why are we still in this part of the world? Why should we be spending our treasure? Why should we be having our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines die for this part of the world? What's really in it for us? The president of the United States, President Trump, says this repeatedly, even when probably at the high point of his administration, at least in this part of the world, when he was announcing the recent Abraham accords between the United States and the United Arab Emirates, from the Oval Office, he couldn't control himself. He went off script and said, 'I don't know why we have any of our forces there protecting the energy resources anymore.'
Surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve last year found employers relaying experienced or qualified employees, some citing candidates' inability to pass drug tests as among the factors making hiring more difficult.
I think it's a common reaction to be reluctant with new drugs and vaccines. But in a few weeks' time, when more people get vaccinated and more explanatory work is done, the willingness to be vaccinated will eventually grow, she predicted.
There was a marked swerve toward vaccine hesitancy in the early 1990s, when reports linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) — without any definitive data — to cases of aseptic meningitis.
It is particularly important that this group is vaccinated, Bavarian state premier Markus Söder said this week, sparking a debate among politicians after suggesting the consideration of compulsory vaccination for medical staff.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And, apparently, in a partnership still with al Qaeda?
Mr. Biden said he would use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to speed vaccine and PPE production and reduce supply-chain log jams. The national strategy calls for prioritizing supplies that could cause bottlenecks and potentially using the DPA to produce glass vials, stoppers, syringes [and] needles to ensure that drug manufacturers have all the supplies they need to keep packaging vaccine doses as they're produced. Officials said their goal was to shore up stockpiles for the immediate need and any future pandemics.
MARGARET BRENNAN: An inspector general announced this week that they are looking into this complaint by a whistleblower that your agency did not provide adequate training or equipment to those workers who went to receive and welcome back Americans who had been evacuated from Wuhan, China. And those workers were not tested for the virus after they had that contact. Have you personally looked into these allegations?
ALEX AZAR: We have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area. And so we do not know how he contracted the virus. That's really what we do. That's the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we're going to trace the people that he had contact with. We're going to trace the other cases. There is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital. And there are cases in that nursing home. But who spread to whom? We do not know yet.
The study findings are based on calls to U.S. poison control centers between 2000 and 2014. Over the years, Smith's team found an average of 29 calls a day related to kids' exposure to ADHD medications.
But 18 percent of calls were made after a teenager intentionally abused an ADHD medication, or took it in a suspected suicide attempt, according to the new report.
