Anybody who has watched Game of Thrones knows the particular dynamics that come into effect when a transition in the monarchy is not finished. This is a particularly challenging transition as compared to other transitions that have happened in Saudi Arabia, because it's a transition to a new branch of the family.

In my view, the Obama administration was absolutely right to consider diplomacy with Iran on its nuclear program. The results of that diplomacy contributed indisputably to positive outcomes on the nuclear file. But there were some weaknesses with that approach. One of the key weaknesses was the division between the United States and its traditional friends and partners in the region, in particular Israel and the Gulf. A sustained approach to diplomacy has to bring those partners along with it rather than being perceived to be cutting them out. The Trump administration took a very different approach to this, a maximum pressure approach to to Iran. They got out of the nuclear deal formally, which I think was was a mistake. I don't think it was a mistake to add sanctions on Iran at all. In fact, the nuclear deal very specifically allowed for such sanctions to be increased on Iran as long as those sanctions weren't on the nuclear file. Unfortunately, Iran has a lot of other malign behavior in the region that merit sanctions. But the Trump administration decided to go a different path.", "augmented": []}

By nominating a new person, even if President Trump doesn't think Ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows Rick Grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time.

There were other groups in the administration, I include the president of the United States in this group, that wanted to increase sanctions in order to get to a 'better negotiated outcome.' There were other groups that really saw this as an opportunity to promote regime change. Unfortunately, the devil is in the details. The way one goes about constructing a sanctions regime differs depending on which outcome you desire. The way that the sanction regime was constructed appears to be most in line with the people who wanted regime change and not in line with people who wanted to facilitate additional negotiations. What I think we should do now, what I hope an incoming Biden administration does, is opens the door for diplomacy, but use the leverage that the Trump administration gives it with the existing sanctions to try to drive a hard bargain that would bring our partners along with it.", "augmented": []}

We need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. There was an analysis out today by Trevor Bradford, very good researcher out of the Hutch, looking at the genetic strains in Washington State. And by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. It's an interesting analysis. There probably are more cases. We have community spread now in Washington State, California, perhaps, Illinois, Oregon.

I think there's some things we did that were very smart. We got the country prepared. One of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. I think what-- what we should have done and I don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the CDC. We always rely on a CDC in a public health emergency. But simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. We've done that. You know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. And that is now in place. And those labs are going to be coming online. So we course corrected. I think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? It's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. And we need to do that now in a therapeutic. We-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket.

This is the first President in history who shut down his own government. Unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. As of next Friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. This is totally unnecessary.

I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it.

But we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. And a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the President on January, the eleventh, 2018, I do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with DACA and many other aspects of the reform and the President rejected it. He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. So we're in a position now where when the President makes these claims and promises a lot of us, I hope I could speak for Senator Graham, are a little bit skeptical."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: --who are waiting for paychecks."}
{"original": "DAN BALZ: That-- that is such an interesting question because I think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among Democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on President Trump in 2020, and I think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing."}
{"original": "SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, and-- we can talk about this. Meanwhile, at the White House, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. I mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the White House is transitioning into 2020 mode. And while you have these Democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to Iowa, now you have a President Trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. It's not the Trump Tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. They have raised millions and millions of dollars. They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. You might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. He was not one of those politicians who came to Washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop."}

We want to make sure that going into November 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for."}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: And that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against President Trump's troop pullout. Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months."}

He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start.

He's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. It was stunning to hear a President of the United States say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. But that is his position. Think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the Treasury Department has been shut down, the Internal Revenue Service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board."}

They point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety Democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. Their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? What-- what is your response to that?"}

Who gives you a dollar for a wall when the Democratic Party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? We're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. We'll negotiate with Dick Durbin but I'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the Border Patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. These caravans have changed everything. The reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. We've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from Central America."}

Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up.

But then we did a speedy withdrawal, which I believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. We cannot afford to do the same thing in Afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the Taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--"}

Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. He will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--"}

We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist.

Governor Brian Kemp appointed financial executive Kelly Loeffler to Isakson's Senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. Loeffler will run in the special election in November to carry out the final two years of Isakson's term, and she has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund. However, Congressman Doug Collins announced his bid for the seat on Wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the GOP."}

{"original": "SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I can just tell you, I don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, I'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief."}
{"original": "MARK LANDLER: And I think that also explains this decision before Christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. I just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You know what I would add to what Max is saying, and what I think is lost a little bit in the discussion of Trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. We are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and NATO, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. And so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, I think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene."}

{"original": "DAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I think it's important to see what's in the package. And it's- I think it's hard for any of us to say. I think all of us at this table came to Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. We're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. We need some bend from the other side as well."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, let me say, I'm from Texas. We have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. Fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that."}
{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Syria. I know you watch the region and you had criticized the President's decision to pull out. The National Security Adviser John Bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a U.S. drawdown and it'll be dependent on Turkey agreeing not to slaughter our Kurdish allies. It sounds like he's describing--"}

{"original": "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the National Security advisor in Israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the Syria policy. The President said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. Now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of U.S. troops in Syria. What are people of the Pentagon actually being told to do?"}

Well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. And when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? He basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. That is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which Democrats certainly want."}

And it's coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for."}

{"original": "With the Iowa caucuses quickly approaching, rumors are swirling around Des Moines about campaigns making alliances if their candidate doesn't hit the 15% viability threshold.

In your home state that was the site of the Sandy Hook shooting. I know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. What is it that you think can actually get done? What are you going to try to do about gun control?"}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But if I could just have one important thing. It's obvious that election season's starting again. But what we can't do is campaign in the halls of Congress. When it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say Oh, I don't want to give this President a win because it might improve his chances in 2020."}
{"original": "REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE (D-New York/@ RepMaxRose): Absolutely. Look we all are. We all have federal workers in our district. This is a national disgrace. There's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that.

We want to make sure that when we leave the Kurds do not get slaughtered. And I don't trust Turkey to take care of the Kurds. It'd be like Putin trying to police Assad. That didn't work well. We need a plan to protect the Kurds from Turkey and others. We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated and Iran is not the biggest winner. If you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which I think we can, then count me in. But those three things have to be--"}
{"original": "A source close to the Yang campaign with knowledge of the situation tells CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster that former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign reached out about a deal. The rules of the Iowa caucuses require candidates to have 15% support in a room to win delegates, meaning some people have to settle for their second or third choice. Yang said yesterday that he isn't inclined to instruct his supporters where to go if he doesn't enough support in a caucus room. I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they're not naturally inclined to do, Yang said. In Waukee today, Biden ignored questions about whether his campaign is trying to make deals with other campaigns and one of his top surrogates, former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, also sidestepped questions on the issue, according to O'Keefe."}
