senator tim kaine: no, i wasn't, margaret. i-- i was at the classified briefing because i'm both a-- an armed services and foreign relations member. that was not told to us in the classified briefing, nor was there a suggestion that multiple embassies were threatened. and i think that was one of the reasons that the senators in the briefing were so unhappy. we felt that the evidence was far short of imminent threat. we were mad that they were so dismissive of the notion that congress would have anything to do with questions of war and peace. and we also thought that the administration was very cavalier about the iraqi reaction-- the iraqi resolution of parliament that the u.s. should leave. they were sort of like, oh, that's just the way the iraqis talk.

an arrest warrant against the outgoing president of the united states of america, donald trump, has been issued in accordance with the provisions of article 406 of the iraqi penal code, iraq's supreme judicial council confirmed in a statement on thursday, adding that the investigations would continue to identify others who participated in committing this crime, whether they are iraqis or foreigners.
representative adam schiff: he said a couple of things. he said that what he was told by the briefers is that most or all of the members were completely satisfied. that's not correct. i can tell you i wasn't, and there were other members of the gang of eight who were equally unsatisfied with the proof of imminence. in terms of the-- what he has described and others have described as the exquisite nature or sources and methods, we often don't share the most sensitive sources and methods with all of the members, but that's not an excuse for withholding from the members the underlying facts. and so if the intelligence showed that there were four embassies being targeted that should have been shared with the members. it wasn't because i don't believe that is what the intelligence showed.

president donald trump (fox news/friday): i can reveal that i believe it would have been four embassies, but baghdad certainly would have been the lead. but i think it would have been four embassy; could have been military bases; could have been a lot of other things, too. but it was imminent. and then all of a sudden he was gone.

as fewer college-educated young people remain in rural locations, those regions become less attractive to other young grads. employers, for their part, increasingly are focusing on urban locations to recruit these workers. added to the mix is the pressure of the country's growing student loan debt, which places more pressure on grads to seek higher-paying jobs -- which are more plentiful in cities.

based on earned income alone, bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the university of pennsylvania's penn wharton budget model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that bloomberg is proposing). about $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.

senator mike lee: yes, we can, and i believe we will. look, my grievance here is not with the president of the united states. he's exercised his power with great restraint and respect for the constitution. it's not even really as much with the briefers, even though, i didn't love the briefing the other day, as it is with congress. congress is the problem. we have to remember that this isn't just about this president or this war. this is about the future question of what any president can do to get us into any war. over many decades, congresses and white houses of every conceivable partisan combination have put us down this path where it's very easy for members of congress to wash their hands of it--

representative jahana hayes (d-connecticut/@jahanahayesct): well i think-- i apologize i lost my voice yesterday. but i think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. we have to get to work. we cannot keep operating in hard lines. we cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. we have to move. that's why we were elected. that's what we were sent here to do. we have to get back to work.

the united states has been leading a coalition waging airstrikes against isis in iraq and syria for more than a year. the campaign has been key to backing iraqi and kurdish forces that have slowly retaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.
margaret brennan: i-- i want to pick up kind of where we just left off with-- with the two senators. you know you-- you've been touting joe biden's foreign policy experience as a reason voters should consider voting for him. bernie sanders, his opponent, has-- has taken that on as a reason essentially, not to specifically focusing in on biden's vote to help authorize the-- the war in iraq. he called it appalling that after eighteen years, joe biden still refuses to admit he was dead wrong on the iraq war, the worst foreign policy blunder in modern american history. given what you know about the region and how iran was, essentially, empowered by that, why-- why doesn't he just call it a mistake?
mark esper: well, what the president said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. i shared that view. i know other members of national security team shared that view. that's why i deployed thousands of american paratroopers to the middle east to reinforce our embassy in baghdad and other sites throughout the region.

opponents of sopa and pipa object to the bill in part because they argue it would impose a huge, unmanageable burden on internet companies to police their sites for connections to copyright or intellectual property infringers. start ups in particular would not be able to handle the legal costs involved, and it could quash innovation in the internet industry.
in the aftermath of her son's death, kemp has been an active member of moms demand action. i chose to devote the entire sixty-second ad to gun safety because it matters to communities across the country and it will be a top priority for me as president, bloomberg said in a statement released by the campaign.

mark landler: --with his own president. president trump just a few minutes ago on his way to camp david repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of syria soon. that's a very different message than what john bolton had in israel a few hours earlier. some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the turks would go after our kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, i think a lot of people in the pentagon are skeptical the turks can ever be relied on not to go after the kurds. so i think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. but i have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from president trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. he will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--

margaret brennan: --from that war zone. what do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?
senator dick durbin (minority whip/@senatordurbin/d-illinois): well, i can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. this is the first president in history who shut down his own government. unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. as of next friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. this is totally unnecessary. and that's a point we've made over and over to this president, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for america.

senator tim kaine: this is a very serious concern. and the administration was downplaying it in a way that i think was very unrealistic.
representative max rose: well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. so the key here in afghanistan, because we saw in iraq, the invasion of iraq was absolutely foolish. but then we did a speedy withdrawal, which i believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. we cannot afford to do the same thing in afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--

sen. sanders: well, margaret, it is not only- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. we don't have a super pac like joe biden. i don't go to rich people's homes like joe biden. i think joe has contributions for more than $40 billionaires. what we have done is received more campaign contributions from more americans than any candidate in the history of the united states, averaging eighteen dollars and 50 cents. this is a campaign of working people and by working people. and i'm extraordinarily proud of that. but we have enough money now not only to take us through super tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country.

representative mikie sherrill: i think if we're going to win as democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. the way we took back the majority of the house is through districts like mine. the eleventh district of new jersey, where i ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. these are things that the majority of americans agree on and the democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.

senator lindsey graham: when you see dick durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. when you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. when you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. when that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal democrats who don't see a border security problem. they see their own government being the problem--

mark esper: well, i'm talking about, the intelligence stream, the exquisite intelligence. that was told-- that information of that source and method was revealed to the gang of eight. i understand the frustration of the broader members of congress. they are not going to have access to that information. i would support it if we-- if we didn't jeopardize the sources and methods. and i think the president said the same.
anderson cooper (60 minutes): the democratic party has lost so much.
senator mike lee: yes, it should have. it's important to remember that the gang of eight does not equal congress. the house of representatives has four hundred and thirty-five members. the senate has one hundred members. look, i understand secretary esper's point. i understand that not every piece of information can or pragmatically should be shared with all five hundred and thirty-five members of congress, but drive by notification to eight people is not the same as notification to congress. remember, there is an important constitutional reason for this. we have some overlap between-- and some natural tension between the article 2 commander-in-chief power--

dan balz: and-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. so whatever that means. and i think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. it feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. i win, you lose.

(rivals like pete buttigieg, sanders and warren would like to roll back mr. trump's corporate tax cut completely.) that 2017 corporate-rate change saved bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.

good morning and welcome to face the nation. top white house officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. so far their talks have yielded nothing. yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. with no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.

at time point, assuming the economic expansion continues, businesses will be forced to choose between continuing to forgo new hires (and limiting their ability to grow) or getting into a bidding war for the best workers by paying more. the latter would lead to the much-delayed, long-heralded boost to wage inflation -- and would deliver a much-needed salve to middle-class incomes.
representative adam schiff: you know it's certainly something that we are considering. but, look, americans want to see a fair trial in the senate. they want to see a trial that's fair to the president and they want to see a trial that's fair to the american people, that brings all the facts forward. there-- there's little sense in bringing bolton in to the house and not allowing the senators to see his testimony. if they're going to be the triers of fact and they will be they should hear from the witness directly. he has offered to come forward and testify. there is no reason not to have him testify unless you just want to cover up the president's wrongdoing. if mcconnell succeeds in making this trial a trial without witnesses--

senator dick durbin: --those fences and barriers. well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. and when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? he basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. that is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which democrats certainly want.
there's certainly a lot of allegations, but we'll have to wait and see what the mueller investigation comes up with and other investigations looking into it, nadler added.
sec. esper: well, two separate things. you know, first of all, the-- what you're referring to is an investigation being conducted by the doj and the fbi in the wake of that-- that tragic shooting in pensacola some-- few weeks ago. in the wake of that, the department has taken a number of steps to-- to ensure it doesn't happen again. i've signed out directives that address enhanced screening of all of our foreign students that address credentialing going forward, weapons policies, etc. so we're doing everything we can. the investigation is being conducted by doj and fbi. i'm sure they will release something on that in the coming days.

senator dick durbin: well, i can't say that we're close because president's made it clear he doesn't care. he's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. it was stunning to hear a president of the united states say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. but that is his position. think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the treasury department has been shut down, the internal revenue service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.

representative adam schiff: well, that's exactly right. but that-- that means that you need to be very clear about what you're saying the intelligence shows and what it doesn't. if we were to ask the intelligence agencies, will taking soleimani out make us safer or less safe? they would say to us, congressman, that's a policy judgment that the policymakers need to make. what we can tell you is if you take him out, here are the likely repercussions. those repercussions that we were briefed about were far more dangerous to this country than anything that soleimani was plotting, as far as i can tell. and so when you're talking about taking out a top government official of another nation, an act that might bring us into outright warfare--

representative mikie sherrill: you know what i would add to what max is saying, and what i think is lost a little bit in the discussion of trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. we are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and nato, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. and so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, i think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.

and that's why, what i wrote in the washington post, i think we have to really accept some hard truths. i think number one we are leaving. the president has made that clear- we are leaving. and that means our force should be really with one mission: to get out and get out safely. we cannot add additional missions onto our force while they are trying to withdraw under pressure, because withdrawing under pressure from a combat zone is one of the most difficult military maneuvers we can ask our people to do.

brett mcgurk: announcing you're going to withdraw, and without a plan, and believe me there's no plan for what's coming next. right now we do not have a plan. it increases a vulnerability of our force. it increases the environment on the ground in syria. this environment in northeast syria has been fairly permissive and safe. again, i've been there almost 20 times and we have been- been very careful with this. it is increasing the risk to our people on the ground in syria and will open up space for isis. but what's most important is we cannot expect a partner such as turkey to come in and take our place, or another coalition partner to take our place. that is not realistic. and if our forces are under order to withdraw, as at the same time they are trying to find some formula for another coalition partner to come in, that is not workable. that is not a viable plan.

to determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a public charge, caseworkers would also take into account their wealth, age, educational skills, english language proficiency and health. since those expected to be affected by the rule are not eligible for most public benefits because they aren't u.s. citizens or permanent residents, critics of the regulation say it is designed to severely restrict immigration based on those factors.
senator lindsey graham (r-south carolina/@lindseygrahamsc): yeah. it was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. dick durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. we're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ice, not support ice. we're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. as long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. the president will compromise but he will not capitulate. so that's where we're at.

sopa, pipa: what you need to know
mcgurk: well the minute you say- the minute you announce to the world that you're leaving, a vacuum opens up and all the other powers in the region start making different calculations. and we have to work things out in syria with russia, and our presence on the ground matters. and the two to three thousand americans we have on the ground are not just any american soldiers. they are our most elite, most highly trained forces. again i visited them from the beginning of the campaign- i was one of the first civilians on the ground way back in the battle of kobanî. they have done an incredible job. it is those forces that allow the force of the syrian democratic forces with 60,000 syrians that we have helped build and enable, they allow that force to be effective. if you simply pull out american forces without a plan for what comes next, it is going to open up a signif- significant vacuum. i know the vice- vice president said we're gonna look for coalition partners to take our place. as the former leader of the coalition, i just don't think that that is credible. i know what it takes in these coalition capitals for them to put their blood and treasure on the line with us. it takes american leadership and takes american presence. and we've just told the world that we're no longer going to be present. so it'll have a dramatic ramification.

representative max rose: well, what i just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. i believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. i don't want to see americans put at risk. i've watched loved ones get hurt. i don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. but i just want us to have a long-term strategy--

mark esper: well, first of all, it's a terrible tragedy. a hundred and seventy-six people from many nations killed. it's a shame that the first reaction of the iranian government to show their corruption, wanted to say that it was american propaganda, when, clearly, it was just a horrible mistake. to somehow allow iran to play the victim card with the international community is just ridiculous. these tensions started many years ago, twenty years ago, forty years ago, and escalated in the past twelve months, led by the terrorist leader, qasem soleimani, who is escalating attacks against united states forces in the region, in baghdad in particular, which ultimately led to the siege of the united states embassy there.

as the vast majority of smoking initiation occurs during teen years, the tobacco industry has a long history of targeting adolescents, he said. if you want to reach teens in 2018, the place to do it is via social media, especially facebook, because such a high fraction of youth use it on a daily basis. 
marketing is no longer a 'waterfall' type work process, where work is handed from one person to another. modern marketing requires that people on a team be able to iterate programs in real-time based on live feedback. this requires them to collaborate much more closely, he added.

bonds looming: adding to the risks, the rising yield on the 10-year treasury, which is used as a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, is making bonds more appealing than stocks. it has been rising in recent months from a low of 2.04 percent in september. on wednesday it was at 2.89 percent. some of the broader concerns on investors' minds right now are looking across to the bond market and seeing the 10-year treasury starting to approach that 3 percent level, said bill northey, vice president at u.s. bank wealth management.

what did surprise us was the volume and variety of unpaid tobacco promotion we encountered on facebook and the passivity of facebook in sustaining its own policies, he said. while facebook was vigilant in excluding paid tobacco advertisements, which appear to receive special scrutiny, it seems to have no systematic monitoring of tobacco brand sponsored promotion on its pages.

ibm appears to be bucking a trend. on the whole, companies are offering workers greater flexibility in terms of when and where they work, and not just because it helps with their recruiting efforts. studies have shown that employee engagement and productivity often improve as a result.
margaret brennan: so i-- i just want to button up because the defense secretary also said that in that gang of eight briefing, when he said there was sensitive information shared, though, he said he wasn't in the room, that it was the gang of eight's decision not to share the information with the rest of congress. he said he'd be okay with it if sensitive bits were taken out.

in protest of the legislation, major sites like wikipedia and reddit participated in a 24-hour internet blackout on wednesday, while other sites like google took less drastic steps to signify their opposition to the legislation. the protests inspired voters to deluge their congressmen with phone calls and emails in protest of the bills as well, and by wednesday afternoon, several congressmen either came out in opposition to the bills or said congress should take more time to reconsider them. it seemed unlikely pipa would find the 60 votes necessary to pass tuesday's test vote in the senate.

the allegation that any company began testing autonomous vehicle technology in arizona 'in secret' is categorically false, patrick ptak, spokesman for ducey's office, told cbs news.  ... arizona has been very public about the testing and operation of self-driving cars -- it has been anything but a secret. the governor has also demonstrated he will hold companies accountable when necessary, as his letter to uber this week indicates.

representative max rose: i think that there's the potential that it could happen. we've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. there's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? everybody is running on anti-corruption now. but in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. if all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the american people are going to suffer.

not only have many young people in this country faced the harsh reality of returning to school without in-person classes at their colleges and high schools, the job prospects for those seeking employment have been particularly bleak, economists at the left-leaning epi said in a recent report.
how their plans would work: neither joe biden, pete buttigieg nor amy klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. of the three, only klobuchar has said she is open to one. buttigieg called warren's wealth tax extreme.
there are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. billionaires would pay 6%. that should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as bloomberg proposes.
mark lowenthal, who also served as staff director to former republican chairman larry combest, agreed. this array is more likely to lead to effective oversight, he said. while there are agency-specific problems, a lot of issues that you worry about – whether you are managing or overseeing – transcend the intelligence agencies, across the board.
in the interview, king credits himself with president trump's shift to his own hardline views on immigration. donald trump came to iowa as a real nonideological candidate, king said. he recalled telling mr. trump, i market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something. king in the past has shown a model of a 12-foot border wall he had designed on the house floor.

congresswoman tulsi gabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in new hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in february. and while other candidates focus on next week's iowa caucuses, gabbard has all but moved to new hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other democratic candidate across december and january.

john kerry: well, i think i-- i-- in fact, margaret, i think that bernie, regrettably, is distorting joe's record in the following sense. i mean he doesn't have what joe biden has, which is eight years of sitting on the national security council and demonstrating his judgment, whether it was on his leadership, dealing with the migration that was flowing across our border and helping to resolve that with the presidents of those countries or his work pulling troops out of iraq and negotiating that and working as perhaps the lead point man on that effort. i-- i think that-- that i know very well what joe's position was because i answered those questions back in 2002, 2000-- 2003 and '04. and it was very clear that what we were doing was listening to a president who made a pledge that he was going to do diplomacy; that he was going to exhaust diplomacy, build a coalition. and, ultimately, we learned, as joe did and i did, that the intelligence was distorted. so joe spoke out and criticized. joe was against what they were doing. the vote was not a vote, specifically, to go to war. it was a vote for the president to have leverage with respect to getting saddam hussein back to the negotiating table, back to the inspections, excuse me.

representative adam schiff: well, i don't recall, frankly, in that briefing there being a specific discussion about bombing the u.s. embassy in baghdad. the brief was much more along the lines, frankly, of something that secretary pompeo admitted the other day when he said that we don't know precisely where and we don't know precisely when. that was much more the nature of the briefing that we got. in the view of the briefers, there was plotting. there was a-- an effort to escalate being planned, but they didn't have specificity. and so when you hear the president out there on fox, he is fudging the intelligence and when you hear the secretary say, well, that wasn't what the intelligence said, but that's my personal belief, he is fudging. when secretary pompeo was on your show last week and made the claim that the intelligence analysis was that taking soleimani out would improve our security and not-- and leaving them in would make us less safe, that is also fudging. that's not an intelligence conclusion. that is pompeo's personal opinion. intelligence--

senator lindsey graham: well, i had lunch with the president last week and i came away a bit encourage. there are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. we want to make sure that when we leave the kurds do not get slaughtered. and i don't trust turkey to take care of the kurds. it'd be like putin trying to police assad. that didn't work well. we need a plan to protect the kurds from turkey and others. we need to make sure isis doesn't come back once they're defeated and iran is not the biggest winner. if you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which i think we can, then count me in. but those three things have to be--

senator dick durbin: no. as a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between vice president pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the president's latest demand might be. but vice president pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. and then within a matter of hours, the president reversed and said, no, it has to be 5.6. that's what we're up against. there doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. if we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the united states overstayed visas.

the ads will run in 14 cable markets across the country, including in areas that overlap with competitive democrat districts. bustos pointed to good fundraising numbers from 2019 and the length of the election cycle, as to why no district-specific ads are currently being run. let's just remember the election is nine months off, bustos said. we want to make sure that going into november 2020, we've got everything we've got at our disposal when people are paying very close attention and making those decisions of who they're going to vote for.

ed o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and i think elsewhere as well. look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. we can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. maybe that's the delay. but what are we on, day sixteen now? and-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--

margaret brennan: but you said you don't know that it was told to the gang of eight.
mark esper: we do not expect any further attacks. but if you look at what's happening on the ground today, you have just yesterday in tehran and other cities, iranians chanting, death to the ayatollah. we don't-- we don't think america is our enemy. you can see the-- the iranian people are standing up and asserting their rights, their aspirations for a better government, a different-- a different regime.
margaret brennan: yeah. it's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out.
newsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. but no one has yet figured out the future of california energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.

margaret brennan: and that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the american people. more to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.
the new staff additions are intended to enhance the committee's ability to make inroads on unanswered questions in the russia investigation without requiring it to pivot away from the day job of overseeing the intelligence community's 17 organizations, according to committee officials. but the final team will likely bring with it the investigative and prosecutorial specialties schiff has long sought.

senator lindsey graham: he's not in the room. neither one of them are in the room.
senator tim kaine: --that are connected to the perpetrators--
margaret brennan: and i think what you're sketching out here is- to put it plainly- how we withdraw. accept that the president's mind- mind is made up. but one of the issues you have here is that the way the president is doing this puts forces at risk and puts the gains at risk. am i hearing you correctly?
representative jahana hayes: well, i think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. i think we have to have background checks. we have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street.

mark esper: we are safer today than we were just a few weeks ago. why? because we took out the world's foremost terrorist leader, qasem soleimani, who had the blood of hundreds of american dead service members on his hands. secondly, we restored deterrence with iran without any united states casualties. and, third, we reassured our partners-- partners and allies in the region that we will stand up and defend our interests. i think when you look at--
bustos, a democrat from a district won by mr. trump, said any member being targeted by outside ads should run on their records, and listed off a number of democrats she says have compelling arguments. they've got the stories to tell they're getting the job done. cindy axne's done 57 town hall meetings, joe cunningham has closed more than 1,500 cases…lauren underwood working to bring down the cost of insulin, she said. when you see somebody going after you, you can also use that as motivation. and i think they're doing that, but they're doing all the right things.
but non-budget related items are prohibited from reconciliation, which means items like a minimum wage increase could not be included in a reconciliation measure, according to brian gardner, chief washington policy analyst at investment bank stifel nicolaus.
margaret brennan: it is. and iran, an issue you know well, is front and center right now. but, virtually, every single democrat running for office right now is claiming the same or virtually the same iran policy, which is to try to revive the deal that you negotiated. there's-- some would say a shell of it left now. shouldn't voters expect more out of a iran strategy from someone trying to be commander in chief?

margaret brennan: good question. we'll be right back.
senator tim kaine: well, senator lee and i are basically trying to restore this to its constitutional place, so we have-- we have a resolution that would basically say no war against iran unless congress, specifically, votes to authorize it. but we do state, as you point out, the president can defend the nation against an imminent threat, and that is existing law. that's-- the constitutional framers clearly understood that. we're skeptical of the evidence that this president has put on the table about imminent threat. that's why we're challenging the briefers and that's why we're challenging the president. but at the end of the day, i think this is less about the president than it is about congress. congresses of both parties for a very long time--

margaret brennan: i want to ask you about that attempt to breach the perimeter and the embassy. but also, broadly, the threat that the u.s. was tracking that has been described as imminent time and again by the administration. the president said last week that there was an attempt to blow up the u.s. embassy in baghdad. here's, specifically, what he said on fox news.

@johnkerry secretary of defense mark esper @esperdod
shannon pettypiece: right. at this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. no one is facing any real political pressure. and part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. but for the white house, they see this (indistinct) politically. democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. so that changes at the end of this coming week when friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. there are services. people will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. so then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. but because the sides are so far apart, i don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. so it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.

representative mikie sherrill (d-new jersey/@repsherrill): well, i don't think it's a waste of time. we voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the senate, within the last month. and so i think what we're asking congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.
margaret brennan: but that's not a transaction like what he described.
mark esper: and we watched very carefully the debate in congress in mid-january of that year to find out did we have the support of the--

john kerry: well, what i was really saying, i think, first of all, margaret, you are an expert at this. you were there. you know that the president's tweet is a lie. and the president tweeted this morning, because i am coming on the show and he knew you'd ask me the question or he'd push you in a place where you did ask the question. you and the media, i think, need to call a lie a lie. you know--
margaret brennan: what about u.s. embassy, baghdad?
margaret brennan: okay. i want to quickly ask you as well about the presence in iraq. will the u.s. cut off u.s. aid if the iraqi government tries to expel u.s. troops?
the special election is being held to fill the seat held by former senator johnny isakson, who resigned at the end of last year. governor brian kemp appointed financial executive kelly loeffler to isakson's senate seat following his resignation at the end of 2019. loeffler will run in the special election in november to carry out the final two years of isakson's term, and she has the support of the national republican senatorial committee and the senate leadership fund. however, congressman doug collins announced his bid for the seat on wednesday, setting up what could be a bitter primary fight within the gop.

the veteran new york lawmaker said house democrats will use their investigative committee powers over the administration to probe the white house's controversial migrant family separation policy — which it was forced to rescind after a massive public uproar — as well as the appointment of acting attorney general matthew whitaker, who has previously denounced special counsel robert mueller's investigation into russian meddling in u.s. elections and alleged coordination between the trump campaign and moscow.

representative adam schiff: i think that we have escalated enough, and--
mark esper: well, let's take this one step at a time. we're not there yet. what we need to do is sit down, have discussions with iraq. we're doing that now. i want to-- we also intend to do that with our nato partners. i had a good conversation the other day with the nato secretary general, jens stoltenberg. we're going to send a team over to discuss how can nato play a bigger role in the iraq mission? two important missions there. one is to train, advise, and assist the iraqi military. and number two is the enduring defeat of isis. we are committed to both those operations. and i think that we can work out a better way forward.

senator lindsey graham: yeah. but what he's not open to is a lecture by the speaker of the house. i'll give you a dollar. he's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being gestapo agents gassing children. he's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. so if you bring dick durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.

sopa and pipa internet blackout aftermath, staggering numbers
brett mcgurk: well they're not defeated. i've been- i've been part of this campaign for four years across two administrations. we've come a- an extraordinarily long way. and in 2014 this organization controlled territory of eight million syrians and iraqis. it was committing genocide against christians and yazidis and minority groups. it was planning attacks against us in the homeland. it was carrying them out in paris, that killed americans in brussels and paris. we've come a long way. we have taken away a lot of their physical space but we always said and our policy was, until most recently, we had to make sure that we completed the enduring defeat of isis. what that meant was taking away their physical space and retaining a presence so they could not resurge. and what just happened, was that policy was really just reversed overnight. so as a leader of the coalition we've been telling our partners on the ground and around the world, we've built a coalition of 75 countries, that we were prepared to stay in syria for some time. and on instructions from the white house, we were telling them, we'd stay in syria until we completed the enduring defeat of isis, not just the physical territory. we'd stay in syria until the iranians left syria and also until there was a irreversible political progress in geneva to end the ultimate civil war. we had told that to our partners on the ground.

representative jahana hayes: it's a first step.
dan balz: well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for president trump the wall has been central to his political message. and i know there are democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. and so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. but with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. i mean, this can't go on indefinitely. president talked about this could go on for months or even years. it's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. but the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? and i think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, i don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.
margaret brennan: i want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. congresswoman, as we said, you're from connecticut. in your home state that was the site of the sandy hook shooting. i know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. what is it that you think can actually get done? what are you going to try to do about gun control?

several top republicans spoke out to condemn the remark. house minority leader kevin mccarthy said, everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation. steve's language is reckless, wrong, and has no place in our society. the declaration of independence states that 'all men are created equal.' that is a fact. it is self-evident.
margaret brennan: it-- it sounds there-- shannon, like, you're going to see some campaigning in the halls of congress--
his past speeches offer some clue to how he will lead.
a recent analysis by the new york times reveals just one-fifth of obama-trump voters returned to the democratic party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted republican. roughly half of the new hampshire towns gabbard has visited backed mr. trump in 2016. her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former trump strategist steve bannon and former democratic ohio congressman dennis kucinich. but she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.
thousands of migrants left honduras a week ago after word about a new caravan spread on facebook. the orderly lines are a stark contrast to october's caravan, when an influx of migrants overwhelmed the mexican government and created a bottleneck on the same bridge. some jumped to swim to mexico instead, and other migrants tore down a fence to gain entry.

lawson also had been ordered to attend 20 additional hours of training on verbal defense in march.
mark landler: and that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against president trump's troop pullout. lindsey graham being an obvious example. tom cotton expressed reservations about it as well. so some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. there are some other names that are being bandied about, but i am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and mick mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. i wouldn't be surprised if pat shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.
mr. biden has described the $900 billion stimulus bill passed last month as a down payment on a more comprehensive relief package. that could translate into a new package ranging from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, according to heights securities analyst hunter hammond.
