Under the recommendations, students, starting with the class of 2021, who seek leadership positions, captaincies, or fellowships will have to sign a written statement affirming their commitment to nondiscrimination on the basis of characteristics of 'intrinsic identity,' including gender. Students will also have to affirm they do not currently belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization, did not belong to one in the past year, and will not belong to one the year after their tenure in a leadership position or athletic captaincy ends.

Trump's 2020 speech did not echo business' demand for more workers, even though he said in January that companies need more foreign workers.
The question before us is not whether the requirements for dispensing mifepristone impose an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion as a general matter. The question is instead whether the District Court properly ordered the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to lift those established requirements because of the court's own evaluation of the impact of the COVID–19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic. Here as in related contexts concerning government responses to the pandemic, my view is that courts owe significant deference to the politically accountable entities with the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health. South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in denial of application for injunctive relief) (slip op., at 2). In light of those considerations, I do not see a sufficient basis here for the District Court to compel the FDA to alter the regimen for medical abortion.

Twitter's de facto false characterization of Mac Isaac as a hacker destroyed the computer technician's business and professional reputation, Della Rocca held.
Studies show: Black Americans are NOT hurt by illegal immigration.
To put it bluntly, people burying their kids due to knife crime, fearful about violent extremism, plagued by a collapse of civility and antisocial behaviour, marooned in postcodes where the only visible authority is a parking ticket aren't interested in the bruised feelings of some well-heeled permanent secretaries. They want things done. Their preference will be to back a Home Secretary who is on their side and impatient for results. The political rhymes with the personal. And that constituency dwarfs the Whitehall machine.
However, weirdly, American will continue to provide charters for the Cowboys, Panthers, and Eagles.
Ultimately, this campaign is a throwback to the worst of the Obama era – and betrays the hallmarks of one of the Obama era's most notorious and discredited figures, Van Jones, who wrote the book The Green Collar Economy on which the Green New Deal is based.
Although he provided few details, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told his parliament on Monday that Japan's forces acted to defend American military aircraft for the first time during a recent mission. His remarks strongly implied the mission had something to do with North Korea.

I can neither nor deny the numbers that have floated around about what was offered on the first day of the shutdown [before Christmas]. But I can assure you, it came from the President of the United States. And Senator [Chuck] Schumer knows that. They were provided with documentation of that, that day, to Senator [Mike] Leahy's office and to Senator [Richard] Shelby's office … after Christmas that we were informed there would not be a counteroffer.

The Algemeiner reports: The umbrella group that represents leading Jewish organizations in the US issued on Thursday a stinging rebuke to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas for his defiant confirmation that the policy of so-called martyr payments — monthly donations to approximately 35,000 families of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists that are higher than the average wage in the PA — will not be halted.
Clift said, Well, these latest rounds of crackdowns have to do with people coming from Central America last year and the year before. And that's because word went out, chiefly from the smuggling operators, that if you get to this country, you can figure out a way to stay and it's all right. So, a lot of mothers and young children and young teens came, and the administration is trying to send them right back. And it looks heartless, and it doesn't seem like it's in keeping with this president's values, but it is the way the law operates. And I'm not sure, the administration could be shifting its policy on this. I wouldn't say this is the last word.
Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican, acknowledged that because ESAs are taxpayer funds and federal law prohibits the state from asking about a student's immigration status, the funds can be used for illegal aliens.

Johnson told Democracy Now's Amy Goodman the fact that many states have attempted to include elective abortions among other procedures that should be temporarily banned to preserve scarce medical equipment for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients is unconscionable.
Some said the Islamic State's defeat in Marawi was less important than the impressive length of time they were able to hold off Philippine government forces, which inspired more feuding Islamist bands to rally under the ISIS banner. Presumably, the militants were even more impressed by vans and trucks overstuffed with money and jewelry rolling out of Marawi during the occupation.

Corporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.

Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
It is a fundamental right for all women and girls to be allowed access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care, said Ulla Müller, President and CEO of EngenderHealth. The Global Gag Rule effectively strips them of this right to make decisions in their private lives that will empower them to lift themselves out of poverty and enable them to live up to their full potential.

Instead, however, President Obama's eight-page executive action plan on water, released Tuesday, says nothing at all about increasing farmers' access to water. Instead, it calls for data collection, communication by federal agencies, new research, and papers — in other words, more bureaucratic activity, rather than more water storage or water allocations.
Ryan's speakership was built on a lie, a broken promise he made to the American people and to the members of the GOP conference: Specifically, he promised he would not run for Speaker without the official endorsement of the Tuesday Group, the Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus. He succeeded in securing endorsements from the former two, but failed to earn the Freedom Caucus endorsement even though many of its members did vote for him.
The Framework's most unsettling passages concerned the ideological and political threats posed by China's growing influence over the digital realm, reaching far beyond the Indo-Pacific region:

As the case developed last year it was discovered that Ramirez had been arrested by local police only a few weeks before his crime spree but due to changes in immigration policy instituted by the Obama administration, police had to release him instead of remanding him to federal authorities for deportation.
The Kentucky conservative also stated that Romney's sentiment about the president does not represent Utah very well.
There are Uyghurs who are Christians, as well, so you do have intersections in these communities. But you have a different ethnicity in the northwest of the country separate from the Han Chinese, and the government of China seems to be threatened by that, he explained, and they're using some very unique tactics – maybe not unique, but intense tactics – detention, sterilizations, all on the premise that this is a dangerous terrorist group.
In fact, very few of the roughly 3.25 million illegals — perhaps as little as 1.7 percent — hold four-year college degrees. Data provided by the Migration Policy Institute shows that roughly 90 percent work in unskilled jobs and would rely on welfare and aid for most of their lives.

As per from the current policy of the Communist Party of China … the funeral home must give priority to the burning of novel coronavirus patients' bodies; other bodies may not be burned on the same day due to funeral culture, rituals, and other reasons, the article notes.

This incident highlights the need for the League to, at minimum, require head and assistant coaches, as well as franchise scouts, to complete an enhanced training on the League's non-discrimination policy, Schneiderman maintained about the Apple questioning, including sexual orientation non-discrimination, and their responsibilities to abide by and enforce the policy.
It was not clear which suicide bombings Nasrallah was referring to. A 1983 attack on a U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon killed 241 U.S. servicemen. President Ronald Reagan eventually withdrew all American forces from the country. Suicide bombings in Iraq in the 2000s also put pressure on the Americans to withdraw.
And yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married.

He said one of the reasons China is so eager to checkmate Taiwan's attempts to join international bodies is that membership in such organizations is one of the recognized criteria for independent statehood. The more groups Beijing successfully blackballs Taipei from joining, the easier it is for China to deny Taiwan formal recognition as an independent state.

The Guardian cites Taiwanese Defense Minister Feng Shih-kuan as alerting the nation's legislature that his government is seeking to purchase more modern aircraft to replace its currently fleet of F-16s. Feng's request for more modern aircraft was a response to a review of Taiwan's defense capabilities recently released by his ministry and published every four years. The review warned that the Chinese government had significantly expanded its ability to attack Taiwan is necessary. China has invested heavily in military construction in the South China Sea, particularly in regions that are not sovereign Chinese territory but China insists has belonged to them since ancient times.

Other Democrats are calling for an enforcement rollback amid the virus, even though they have also backed many pro-migration bills.
The other thing that [the federal government is] trying to do is to deny certain federal law enforcement grants to sanctuary jurisdictions, whether they're cities, states, counties; they're trying to make these grants off-limits for sanctuaries, which makes sense. Why should a jurisdiction get taxpayer money for law enforcement when they're stiffing one of the biggest law enforcement agencies of the federal government. They shouldn't. There needs to be some consequence for having a sanctuary policy. … Hopefully the federal government will be able to deny them some funding.

In the text released of his final State of the Union address, President Obama cynically attacks Congress for his own inaction against ISIS. Although — whether it's flooding the country with illegals or restricting gun ownership for law-abiding Americans — this lawless president is always eager to usurp the Constitution through illegal executive actions, on the one issue where he does have the constitutional authority (foreign policy) he blames Congress for his dereliction of duty:
Romney described President Donald Trump as a man whose character falls short in Tuesday-published Washington Post opinion editorial: Trump's character falls short. … With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.

The listicle was published by the BBC before poisonous bitter yuca killed dozens of Venezuelans relying on the vegetable to survive. By March 2017, at least 28 had died of consuming bitter yuca, a species of yuca that is inedible and causes a complete deterioration of the digestive system and vital organs. The tragic deaths triggered a wave of helpful life hack-style articles on how to identify bitter yuca. El Nacional suggested biting into a tiny raw piece at marketplaces to ensure it had no raw flavor (edible raw yuca should taste essentially like flour) and not eating yuca that is difficult to peel or takes too long to soften while boiling.
Subsequently, Davis ran for governor, but was never a true contender and ultimately lost her bid by 20 percentage points to current Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R).

Around Urbana-Champaign, the home of the University of Illinois, school district officials say children and adolescents lay shingles, wash dishes and paint off-campus university apartments. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, an indigenous Guatemalan labor leader has heard complaints from adult workers in the fish-packing industry who say they're losing their jobs to 14-year-olds. In Ohio, teenagers work in dangerous chicken plants. ProPublica interviewed 15 teenagers and young adults in Bensenville alone who said they work or have worked as minors inside more than two dozen factories, warehouses and food processing facilities in the Chicago suburbs, usually through temporary staffing agencies, and nearly all in situations where federal and state child labor laws would explicitly prohibit their employment. Though most of the teens interviewed for this story are now 18, they agreed to speak on the condition that they not be fully identified and that their employers not be named because they feared losing their jobs, harming their immigration cases or facing criminal penalties. Some began to work when they were just 13 or 14, packing the candy you find by the supermarket register, cutting the slabs of raw meat that end up in your freezer and baking, in industrial ovens, the pastries you eat with your coffee. Garcia, who is 18 now, was 15 when he got his first job at an automotive parts factory.
Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent — 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.
Cooper asked Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic Socialist, how she would pay for the trillions of dollars in government programs she supports. But instead of laying out a plan for how she would pay for the programs, Ocasio-Cortez deflected Cooper's question.

Firing Cordray will not be as simple. The CFPB is an independent agency, and his term as director expires in 2018. Trump can only dismiss Cordray for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.

Advocacy groups formed by African immigrants also complained about Trump's security policies:
Other publications have shared life hacks that do not necessarily feed any mouths. This week, the aggregation site La Patilla shared an article from October with a hack that allegedly uses toothpaste to reveal whether a woman is pregnant. If the toothpaste creates foam and changes color after being mixed in with a woman's urine, she is pregnant, according to the trick. La Patilla is quick to note, despite the growing popularity of this method, science denies its efficacy. The toothpaste tends not to change color, even if you are pregnant, while the foam appears in most cases due to contact between the acidity of the urine and alkalinity of the toothpaste.
Human Rights Watch's Andrea Prasow praised Omar as a leader on the subject:  With an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that Congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.

The controversy surrounding Hunter Biden's wheeling and dealing in Ukraine is at the center of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Congressional Democrats claim that the president committed a crime when he suggested Ukraine look into how Hunter Biden secured his position with Burisma. Trump's allies have countered that Hunter Biden's role with the company was rife with potential conflicts of interests for his father.

New trade deals with non-EU countries the EU did not previously have deals with may provide more tangible benefits — although the most lucrative, with the United States of America, may already have slipped away, as the Tories have squandered pro-Brexit Donald Trump's entire term.
They should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.

Give the huge influx over the past year, however, the figure of 50,000 will likely raise scepticism over whether the Austrian government can effectively deal with the ongoing migrant crisis.
Our troops in South Korea are vulnerable. They've got thousands of tons of chemical weapons. South Korean civilians are vulnerable. That's why my view has long been that really the only solution to the nuclear problem in North Korea, and, in fact, the North Korean problem generally, is to reunify the peninsula. As long as this regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually come to fruition, with horrible consequences, he warned.

From the vague information that is going around, said Father Cervellera in a Tuesday interview with the Catholic online site Crux, China—as stated by the director of Religious Affairs—simply wants to continue its policy of nominating bishops and the pope would just have the function of blessing what they decide.
The State Department legal office prepared a four-page memo for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning of the dangers of leaking by State Department employees, Rogin wrote. It promptly leaked, to me.
China has repeatedly hidden its intentions, and will continue to do so until it's prepared to launch its attack. China is following exactly the same path that the Nazis followed. Xi Jinping's Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is the same as Hitler's National Socialism. Like the Nazis, the Chinese believe that they're a Master Race that will conquer the world. They'd have to be crazy to believe that they could succeed at that, but the Chinese are crazy.
Therapists in Oxford have set up telephone and Skype services for seniors in need of emotional support and advice.

Last October, Twitter shut down links to the New York Post's story about the Biden family's business dealings in Ukraine, in part citing its policy regarding hacked materials. Given the New York Post's sourcing of Mac Isaac's discoveries on Hunter Biden's laptop for its reports, Twitter's censorship amounted to a framing of Mac Isaac as a hacker.
It's totally partisan, Trump said. I've got to go through a hoax, a phony hoax put out by the Democrats so they can try and win an election.
The New York Times admits a 40-year rise in the number of immigrants living in Orange County, California has transformed the region from a fortress of conservative Republicanism to a Democrat electoral sweep.

That solidarity in the EU is fracturing over the micromanagement of member-states' vaccination regimes may be unsurprising. Leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage predicted that there might not be an EU in a decade, because the bloc is already split culturally east and west, and financially north and south.

The revival of American manufacturing was a cornerstone of Trump's 2016 campaign promise to Make America Great Again. Many economists derided the idea that manufacturing could boom in the U.S., insisting that a combination of automation and globlization meant that factory jobs were gone for good. Some even accused Trump of attempting to con the American people with promises of manufacturing jobs.
These are good jobs making lasting products. About two-thirds of 2018's new manufacturing jobs are in durable goods, which includes machinery, autos, airplanes, and other big-ticket items.
Like most of the Civil Service, Rutnam is an ardent Remainer. Though his job is to implement government policy, Rutnam appeared to spend more of his time trying to frustrate it – especially with regards to the plans for Brexit, which Rutnam claimed, were too ambitious to complete in time for the December deadline.

What's more, by unilaterally refusing to allow valid questions like this one, Roberts is rigging the trial against Trump.
The reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago. [N]umber two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when I'm elected president – if I'm elected president – a codification of Roe v Wade, amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And in fact, I've gotten 100% rating from NARAL as well.

Biden comes to the White House with an undeniable record of supporting the kind of job-killing free trade and globalization of the American economy that Trump has denounced for decades. That record has helped make Biden friendly with multinational corporations, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street — all of which benefit massively from outsourcing manufacturing to foreign countries that tolerate slave labor.
Those who had the coercive power to put Ehrlich's theories into practice bear witness to just how horrifying they were.
Following the phone call between the two leaders, Boris Johnson ordered pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, cinemas, and other public venues to close. The British government has claimed that the phone call with Macron did not influence the decision to enact stricter measures to fight the virus.
The Commission called on the British government to end all goods imported from China found to be using slave labour and to introduce sanctions on businesses found to be involved in the modern slave trade.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, as its name implies, is the military wing of the Iranian theocracy, to guard the 1979 Islamic revolution there, Bolton explained. It reports directly to the supreme leader. Forget President Rouhani or the election coming up later this spring; the real ruler in Iran has always been the supreme leader, since the '79 revolution.
McLane had recently criticized the Eagles front office. According to Philly.com, McLane has occasionally criticized the Eagles in his coverage. Last week, he wrote an article questioning whether executive vice president Howie Roseman had made wise investments in players.

The progressives' Hunger Games also cripple the economies of migrant-sending countries because they are extracting workers, consumers, investments, political pressures, and expectations of growth. The departure of people of working age reduces the labor force and weakens the growth of the home country, and this effect is likely to be strongest for countries facing a brain drain, said a 2017 report by the International Monetary Fund.
The young children then read from the New York Times bestseller, This Book Is Antiracist, only to learn their privilege allows them power over others.

We will not win the presidency by telling people they're wrong for being angry that middle class wages have declined under this president, he said in an interview with Laura Ingraham. We're not going to win the presidency by telling the people that they're wrong when the foreign policy of this country has made America weaker and a joke.
More than that, building the wall makes clear that the United States is a sovereign nation that is willing to do what is necessary to control its own border. Indeed, securing a nation's borders is one of the most fundamental obligations that a government owes to its people. For decades, the federal government has failed miserably in fulfilling that obligation. Now, Americans are making a grassroots effort to solve the problem themselves, while sending a message to Washington. As Kolfage put it, This is giving them an avenue to be heard.
ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — In an exclusive interview hours before President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Breitbart News that the Democrat senator who currently occupies his old seat in the U.S. Senate has revealed himself as part of the radical left with the Trump impeachment push he's helping lead.

These are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.

As an example, the reading states that a white, cisgender man, who is able-bodied, heterosexual, considered handsome and speaks English has more privilege than a Black transgender woman.

Even now, he said, when I go to China and meet an official bishop, they don't want to talk, because they say people from the Patriotic Association are there, so we can't talk, we can't talk. I go to talk to a bishop in Peking, and he says, no, we can't talk, because the place is bugged.
Zakaria noted that, in a recent essay about the collapse of the liberal international order, Karganov said that Hillary Clinton was viewed, particularly negatively as a symbol of liberal interventionism, of neo-conservatism, of a kind of expansionist American foreign policy that tried to maintain America's kind of central status in the world.
Writing at his D.C. Dispatches blog, attorney Jason Poblete has some interesting follow-up questions about this story, chief among them: Was Congress aware of the missing Hellfire? If so, why did they not speak up, at a moment when President Obama was adjusting U.S. policy towards Cuba?
After Louder with Crowder scheduled video promotional tweets of the newly censored video, Crowder's suspension on Twitter was increased to a week:
The debate now appears to be about when, not whether, to re-admit Syria to the Arab League. At a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri said Syria's return to the League is connected to developments on the political track to end the crisis. Some officials in Lebanon insist Syria should be invited to an Arab economic summit the country is hosting next week, although final decision rests with the League.

NAFTA and all kinds of international trade have a lot of benefits in the United States, he noted. We pay a lot less for televisions. We pay a lot less for clothing. But if we're all enjoying that while this big swath of the country are victims of it, that's not the way our country is supposed to work. We're all supposed to be in this together.

Noting the snacks you make sure are on every floor, Talia Jane added, By and large, our floor pummels through those snacks the fastest and has to roam other floors to find something to eat.

If you make a program like this available, undocumented workers in other states might be attracted to California because of this, Bhattacharya, the Stanford physician, reportedly said.
He continued, The problem with using government as a lever, as a tool and taking hostages—not only the 800,000 federal employees but taking all the millions and millions of people who are served by government every day hostage is—that is very, very debilitating to our country — essentially taking our country hostage. So what we're saying is, Mr. President, we need to negotiate. It could be hard; you can veto some of our bills, but don't shut down government in the process. So this is a bigger issue than just the wall or education or the Affordable Care Act, it's an issue of whether or not we're going to use as a continuing policy shutting down the government of the United States and undermining the confidence of our employees, the confidence of people who deal with the government, and the confidence of the international community looking to see whether the United States of America can act in a rational, responsible way.

The coronavirus outbreak in China has highlighted severe and longstanding weaknesses in our medical supply chain. This is more than unfortunate; it's a danger to public health. Our health officials need to know the extent of our reliance on Chinese production so they can take all necessary action to protect Americans. This legislation will give us the information we need to better secure our supply chain and ensure that Americans have uninterrupted access to life-saving drugs and medical devices.
To save themselves universities must overcome their obsession with identity politics. There are too many classes focused on narrow topics: too few on transcendent works of genius. Students complain, I don't see myself in the curriculum. You are not supposed to. The purpose of education is to take you outside yourself into a larger world. Conservative scholars can't do much to turn things around. They have all but disappeared from campus. So it's up to liberal academics to restore sanity. Will they do it? I'm not so sure. Anyone who challenges the identitarians will face a lot of hostility and be told the check their privilege. Who wants that? But there is one hopeful development. The University of Chicago has indicated that it will not be going the way of safe-space, trigger warnings and censorship. Some have suggested that universities need to be clear about their primary mission: They can pursue truth, at the expense of identity validation and emotional comfort–or they can choose comfort, and admit that they sometimes do so at the expense of truth. Either is fine, but at least students will have a choice.
One reason Abe addressed the Diet on this subject is that laws allowing Japanese self-defense forces to protect Americans and other allied forces only went into effect last March. Before that, it was only legal for Japan to defend allies ships, planes, or ground forces if Japan itself was also under attack.
Heritage Foundation Asian Studies Director Walter Lohman began by citing the example of the World Health Assembly, where Taiwan has been denied some role after many years of participation. Taiwan was similarly blocked from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and, perhaps most outrageously, Interpol. In some cases, even limited observer status granted to Taiwan in previous years has been revoked.
Here are nine reasons why President Donald Trump should ignore the claimed January deadline — and the alternative March deadline — to ensure that American voters get what they want from the establishment:

In recent days, the al-Qaeda affiliates conquered the strategic town of Darat Izza, located close to two main highways in Syria used to move fighters and supplies within the country and along the Turkish border.
The focus on the President's emergency powers comes after GOP and Democratic leaders jointly blocked the President's campaign promise to build a border wall. So far, the President has managed to get just $3.2 billion for wall construction, and most of that spending is limited by rules governing the types and location of wall construction.

When reached for comment, a Fox News spokesperson referred Breitbart News to a previous statement.
Though President Trump signed his Buy American, Hire American executive order in early 2017, his Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretaries, General John Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen, have each approved an additional 15,000 foreign workers for business to import in 2017 and 2018.

Tur said, Donald Trump supporters are not a monolith. That's a mistake that everybody makes. No more so than Donald Trump himself who believes his voters need him to fulfill these promises. It's not a promise if Mexico's not paying for it. Donald Trump supporters even said to me when I said, what if he can't build a wall? 'That's fine. I just want him to go in there and get things done.' He's not getting anything done.

And while the Obama administration stung Israel by allowing a U.N. resolution critical of Israel to pass in Obama's final weeks, new U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has pledged not to let that happen again.

As Davidson points out, China has repeatedly lied and hid its true intentions. Originally, the artificial islands were going to be for tourists and scientists, which was a lie. Then the military installations would be purely defensive, which was another lie.

The president's policy differs from that of his predecessor. During former President Barack Obama's tenure in the White House, the number of displaced persons being resettled in the U.S. increased drastically. Between 2008 and 2017, more than 67,000 refugees on average were admitted into the country. The total would have been larger if Republicans had not stymied Obama's efforts to admit 110,000 displaced persons, most notably from Syria, during his final year in office.
The top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy of California, said Americans will look back on this sad saga that tried to remove the president from office with the weakest case.

2. The first victims of the Mexican cartels are the migrants and the countries from which they come. Cartels are brutal. They slaughter innocent civilians. They rape the women and girls they are trafficking to criminals in the U.S. The drugs they sneak into the U.S. kill thousands of Americans each year. And the developing countries that migrants leave behind become poorer. Democrats who, like Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), say [t]here is no national emergency on our southern border, are encouraging the cartels. There is nothing humane about an open border.

North Korea says its rocket launches are satellite missions, but the U.S., South Korea and others say they are a covert test of ballistic missile technology. The U.N. Security Council prohibits North Korea from nuclear and ballistic missile activity. Experts say that ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology.

Republicans control the chamber, 53-47, and are all but certain to acquit Trump. McConnell is hesitant to call new witnesses who would prolong the trial. He prefers to model Trump's trial partly on the process used for then-President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999.

CASTRO: What I believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That's a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know – and many of them have said – in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric, but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer.

Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.

China's development of forward military bases in the South China Sea began in December 2013 when the first dredger arrived at Johnson Reef. Through 2015, China used dredging efforts to build up these reefs and create manmade islands, destroying the reefs in the process. Since then, China has constructed clear military facilities on the islands, with several bases including hangars, barracks, underground fuel and water storage facilities, and bunkers to house offense and defensive kinetic and non-kinetic systems. These actions stand in direct contrast to the assertion that President Xi made in 2015 in the Rose Garden when he commented that Beijing had no intent to militarize the South China Sea. Today these forward operating bases appear complete. The only thing lacking are the deployed forces. Once occupied, China will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania. The PLA will be able to use these bases to challenge U.S. presence in the region, and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants. In short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.

The authors and contributing agencies behind the Framework emphasized that China must not be allowed to believe it has gained air and sea military dominance over first-island-chain nations, prominently including Taiwan but not limited to that particular island. The implicit concern is that China would become more likely to invade Taiwan if it believed it held such a dominant position that it could score a swift victory, and then it might keep going, securing all of its military objectives across the Indo-Pacific.

In 2016, I think the way to understand what happened was, there were really three party primaries, judged Olsen. There was a Democratic primary between Clinton and Sanders. There was a Republican primary between 17 people, and there was a working class primary between Sanders and Trump, and the working class voters who heard both of those people — and in most states could've gone either way because they don't have party registration — overwhelmingly chose Trump, and a lot of the people who chose Sanders did so knowing that they would vote for Trump if their guy lost. There is no appeal to the AOC-type of policy among the actual working class voters.
But whether the New York Times succeeds or fails in its campaign to mainstream leftist antisemitism, shame pro-Israel American Jews, and detach the Jewish community in the U.S. from Israel and the rest of the Jewish world, it is worth taking note of, and condemning, what the newspaper is attempting to do.

You know what it's going to really mean? It means we're going to start doing lumber in our country, it's going to mean that farmers are now going to start selling milk in our country, instead of buying Canadian milk. Trump said.
In point of fact, the purpose of Trump's visit to the shrine, which commemorated the 41st anniversary of John Paul's historic visit to Poland in 1979, was to issue an executive order on advancing international religious freedom, a topic dear to the heart of Pope John Paul II.

The sweeping prohibition applies to association members 24/7, covering all communication, private and professional, written and spoken, online and off. Punishment could top out at a maximum fine of $15,000 and expulsion from the organization.
Over the intervening years camps a cycle has emerged of camps springing up only to be demolished by the authorities. But in the last year, with migration across the continent at an all-time high, the Jungle has grown out of all proportion and is now home to a reported 7,000 migrants – local groups put the figure much higher.
Did she really need to say it was necessary to welcome one million migrants at a time when France, which casts itself as the land of human rights, pledged to take in 30,000? Lagerfeld said. … If this keeps up, I'll abandon German citizenship, he continued.
We need to make it easier in some respects for people to come here legally and work temporarily and then go home, particularly in the agriculture industry, Romney told CNN's Jake Tapper on January 2. In Utah, we rely on a lot of people coming in to harvest crops and so forth, he said, adding, We ought to be guided by what the states need, as opposed to what the federal government imposes on them.
According to DEA's 2015 Threat Assessment, Mexican drug cartels control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United States, particularly in heroin markets. … Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin, and the administration has made it clear that officers are not to deviate from the President's lawless immigration policy.

Kerry repeatedly used the phrase make the right decision as code for Assad stepping down.

During his Senate confirmation hearing in June 2017, he pointed at China when asked what his thoughts were on how the U.S. should move forward in the Asia-Pacific theater.
Ocasio-Cortez rocketed to national prominence after shocking the political world by ousting 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in New York's 14th congressional district primary in June. The 29-year-old has quickly established a name for herself by pushing radical policies, including Medicare for All, the abolishment of ICE, and perhaps most notably, the Green New Deal — a proposed nationwide shift to non-combustible energy sources financed in (very small) part by a proposed 70% tax on top earners. However, her policy prescriptions and support of grassroots efforts to unseat incumbents within her own party have lawmakers in both chambers of Congress grumbling.
More than one million migrants reached Europe in 2015, most of whom were refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

Newly-installed Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) is doubling down on her use of the word motherf**ker to describe President Donald Trump on her first day in office, tweeting Friday morning: I will always speak truth to power.
The Muslim Ban expansion is about one thing: weaponizing anti-Muslim bigotry for political gain. Like the administration's earlier Muslim bans, this expanded ban overwhelmingly targets Muslims and forces tens of thousands Americans to sacrifice their families, their health and their educational and professional opportunities. In fact, over a million Americans were born in Muslim Ban countries and could be affected. It is clear that the president's goal, as always, is to target Muslims, immigrants, black and African countries and other people or color.
Progressives also insist they can select deserving Central American migrants with such care and justice that rejected migrants will somehow give up their illegal efforts to get themselves into U.S. jobs and their children into U.S. schools. For example, Biden's 2020 platform says Trump's policies are actually encouraging people to cross irregularly, rather than applying in a legal, safe, and orderly manner at the ports, and continues:
The underground bishops are the biggest problem in dialogue between China and the Vatican, since the Chinese government does not want to recognize them, because they don't trust them. These people who have been martyred, who have been imprisoned, who have tried to follow the Vatican's indications and not belong to the Patriotic Association in order to be free for the faith are now set aside, he said.
Breitbart News extensively reported the Irish giveaway bill:

Jim Trainor responds, 10-4. Per DJ's voice mail [redacted]. Stand by for the names.
So you could have a runoff between these two candidates, neither of whom obviously represents one of the major standing French political parties of the center-right or the center-left. I think that is the kind of scenario – a proto-Communist, basically, versus Marine Le Pen – where she could win. In any event, no matter who the last two are, I think that things are so volatile in France and across the European Union that while I still think it's unlikely Le Pen would win in the final round, I don't think you can discount that yet, said Bolton.
Update: Rep. King released a statement: I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define.
The statement warned the new House Democrat majority of President Trump's intention to veto the bills, noting that the administration cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation's urgent border security needs.
We are in a global pandemic. The third week of March has seen more job loss than any other in our history and more businesses closed … [the Government should] Automatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020.
What what I'm hoping, what I heard from folks, from the CBP experts that participated in the briefings, has been very positive. They felt they were being asked good questions, informed questions, the right questions [by Biden's appointees]. And what I've been told is that they felt the preview team was actually listening and hearing what we discussed.
Trump signaled that his actions on trade would help restore the states of important industries in the United States, specifically citing his thoughts on dairy and lumber.
The U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia separately warned Americans of the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks.
Forced unification is a folly. #Taiwan is a free & democratic country where #HumanRights are protected. Only its 23 million people can decide their own destiny. The leader of #China must join the rest of the global community & respect this reality, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted on Wednesday.
In March, Sanders' campaign became the first to announce it would provide carbon offsets, donations to environmental groups meant to mitigate the environmental effects of extra emissions. Since then, it had spent about $9,000 on them through September. And during his primary challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders paid around $14,000 for such offsets.
Since the media is currently in very high dudgeon about unsubstantiated allegations, it will doubtless applaud Grassley for his inquiry.
There are Uyghurs who are Christians, as well, so you do have intersections in these communities. But you have a different ethnicity in the northwest of the country separate from the Han Chinese, and the government of China seems to be threatened by that, he explained, and they're using some very unique tactics – maybe not unique, but intense tactics – detention, sterilizations, all on the premise that this is a dangerous terrorist group.
Asked who told her to smuggle the Tunisian into the UK, she replied, I don't even know if I was in that Facebook group. I told my friend (the one I was going to give supplies to) she said there was an emergency. A pregnant Syrian woman. She asked me to help her get to UK. Her [boyfriend] was in UK. She and some others paid for [the lady] to stay in a guest house as she was poorly. She'd hurt her leg whilst trying to board a lorry and was about 8 months pregnant. My friend, let's call her Clare, knew I was going to Calais with supplies. She asked if we would bring the girl home on our return as the person who was supposed to had bottled out. Obviously I was shocked and said it was up to my husband. We did it because she was pregnant.
When people refuse to comply with lawful orders, they tend to get arrested.
Nothing Trump has ever said can be construed as racist, and the Very Fine People Hoax proves Trump's no racist, because if he really was racist, his enemies would not have to manufacture something so desperately fake, so easy to disprove.
U.S.-based companies employ a population of roughly 1.5 million college-graduate visa workers in the United States.
Trump admitted that his tone with China has moderated somewhat, but pointed to his negotiations with them to contain the North Korea threat as the reason.
The goal of this policy was to deliver higher incomes to people who were struggling to make ends meet in the city, Vigdor said. You've got to watch out because at some point you run the risk of harming the people you set out to help.
Supporters of the Cuban regime have long touted its supposedly high standards of health care, citing the fact that the country has the highest relative number of physicians in the entire world as well as the manipulation of health statistics such as infant mortality. However, the poverty inflicted as a result of decades of communist policy has, in reality, led to a decrepit health system with some of the worst health outcomes worldwide.

Parker also emphasized the instrumental role the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has played in jumpstarting this economy, one of the primary policy achievements JCN uses to demonstrate the economic success of the administration.
Shirley said that while Nancy rarely involved herself in policy, she did play a major part with the personnel around America's 40th president. She played a role in the firing of Reagan campaign strategist John Sears in the 1980 presidential election, which in part sparked his sagging GOP primary run.
A West Virginia mother sued her child's school district in 2017 for its 75-year practice of providing Bible classes to students, alleging that her child was being forced to take the classes.

More than anything, people simply wanted the process to be over. May's withdrawal agreement had been excoriated as a con job, but Johnson's passed largely unremarked.
Even as U.S. crude production rose, industry watchers were unconcerned about global oversupply, confident that OPEC—led by global swing producer Saudi Arabia—would take its usual approach and cut production. At the November 2014 OPEC meeting on Thanksgiving Day, however, that confidence evaporated. The cartel announced it would maintain its production levels, sending prices into a tailspin. In June 24, the price of oil was $110 per barrel. By January 2016, the price was just $26.
The white working class, she claimed, have not been able to adapt to modern, multicultural Britain.
The reckless patron Zarif referred to is U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration presented the end of the Qatar feud as a result of American diplomacy.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) suggested during a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday that the latest version of the economic relief package is minimally different from the original measure Democrats rejected and added that he will leave it to others to compare the two and determine whether the last few changes really required or merited three days of delay.
What I want to say today and what I want my countrymen to hear is that as an intellectual I have never wanted anything other than social justice for my country, declared Khieu Samphan at the court last week. I shall shout loudly that I never wanted to agree to any policy that is against the Cambodian people.
It began in our schools on college campuses where our students are taught the absurd notion that free speech is about privilege and power, and not open debate and rational deliberation. For our constituents, taking away means freedom of speech is silent and good ideas are stifled. … The resolution strips all mentioned the words of father, mother, son, daughter, brother, mother in law, daughter in law. I'm a proud father. I'm an extremely proud son. But we're going strike them from the rules. First we take your speech away. Then we take what you can say.
She characterized the speech as a reaffirmation of current policy and noted the lack of any timetable or deadline for reunification. It is just a goal, she told the paper.
There are a lot of advantages out of that, but there is also a big danger, said Jim Hanson, president of the Security Studies Group. Webb's an arrogant bastard. That doesn't always work. [Rex] Tillerson was also an arrogant bastard.
Again, the new rule does allow facilities that receive Title X funding to counsel about abortion, but not refer for abortion. Low-income individuals and the uninsured can still go to the many thousands of federally qualified health centers that provide more expansive services than Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. Additionally, Title X facilities that currently perform abortions and distribute contraception can choose to abide by the new rule and separate their family planning centers from those that perform abortions in order to remain eligible for grants under this program.
The secretary said he made U.S. expectations on human rights clear to the Saudis, including women's rights and accountability for those involved in the October murder of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. He said the Saudi government's assurances that justice will be done in the Khashoggi killing remain constant, asking the press to give the Kingdom time to work through its fact-finding process.

After snubbing the NRA's offer to shoot with suppressors firsthand and learn how they really work, the Washington Post (WaPo) ran an editorial asking Congress to turn a deaf ear to the NRA's claim that suppressors protect hearing.
The Fed's move came after several disappointing data points appeared to indicate that the economy may be softening and hoped for tax cuts may be delayed longer than expected. Job creation in May came in lower than expected, at just 138.000 jobs. Retail sales in May fell 1.6 percent from the prior month, the biggest decline in 16 months. Economists had expected sales to increase in May, following a 0.4 percent increase in April.
We have to proliferate the access to testing and services, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), whose Latino-dominated district includes many suspected victims. If someone is undocumented — or has a green card — and they feel that they're not eligible for any of these kinds of services, that's just going to worsen the situation, that's going to prevent us from really addressing the coronavirus issue in an effective way, he told the the Hill.
We have farmers, ranchers, landowners who want the wall and they are lining up for us to build the wall on their property right now, Kolfage said. And that is what we're doing.
He was, and he carried that out, Brokaw noted:
Terrorism expert Michael Pregent said it is normal for the Islamic State to execute fighters who lose valuable territories. They did the same thing when militants lost Tikrit.
It has been determined that no further action will be taken because U.S. forces acted in self-defense and followed all applicable law and policy, the statement said.
In Nevada, too, the state's Supreme Court ruled against the local chapter of the ACLU, which was challenging the Nevada's new ESA program on the grounds it violated the state constitution's Blaine amendment. And though, as Burke writes, both research and legal precedent … make [ESAs] well-positioned to withstand legal challenges based on Blaine amendments, the amendments continue to serve as an impediment to families accessing school choice programs in an efficient way. In Nevada, for instance, thousands of families are stuck on a waiting list as the legislature figures out a way to fund the ESA program after the state's Supreme Court declared the program (but not its funding mechanism) constitutional.
Over 1.4 million people are believed to have entered Europe from the Middle East and North Africa this year. While many estimates suggest the number is far fewer, these do not include the number of overstayers – those told to leave who don't – and those who remain beneath the radar and do not register, according to EU sources.

CTU organizer Jhoanna Maldonado, however, responded the district is trying to divide and conquer our staffs and that the union is ready to take whatever actions we need to take if there is retaliation against teachers who failed to report to work.
The original Facebook post was started by a woman who told a story of how she was tricked into smuggling an illegal migrant into the UK. In the post she stated: I have fundraised for the guys in Calais. I have given donations, food, clothes, medicines, and money. I even got talked into smuggling a Syrian woman here who was pregnant. Then found out she was Tunisian. Tunisian women have lots of rights based on French law. The girl and her baby are safe in Norwich and that's good. But I was told it would be a £2,000 fine if we got caught.
The decree, which received unanimous approval in the Italian cabinet, combines aspects of migration policy along with other security provisions to tackle far-left occupier activists as well as the Italian mafia.
I would love to do a big immigration bill where we really repair the situation. … Right now we have a problem, we have to take care of this and it's quicker and easier to do this individually. But we would like to see real immigration reform in this country because we need it and it could be a beautiful thing. With all of the companies coming into our country … we have many car companies and other companies that are going in. Best job numbers … We have the best job numbers, we need people, we need great, qualified people. We want them to come in. So I think it's a great time right now, because of this. … Everybody wants to see immigration reform. It's just, it's overdue. It's always been very political. Maybe this [shutdown crisis] will turn out to be a blessing in disguise … We need strong borders and we need immigration reform, beyond that, we need immigration reform.
Do not go to work, school or public areas, it states.
So this all – step back and this all starts with extremism in whatever form you find it. In this case you have Iranian-backed Houthis, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq, Iranian-backed forces in Syria, and in each case the root of the challenge stems from the revolutionary nature of the Islamic regime and their efforts abroad. And so they're focused on doing the things they can do. I talked to – I shared with the crown prince and with the king, if I recall correctly, my conversations to help Iraq as well. We want an Iraq that is independent, sovereign, and how it is we might do that – there are lots of economic things we can do to assist Iraq in getting back on its feet, which will permit them to be more independent and have more control and be more sovereign. I shared with the crown prince my conversations when I traveled to Iraq.
Gym operators reopened their businesses while following antivirus rules because we can't possibly continue to live like this, he said.
She added, To be honest with you, I have given up on American companies. I have given up on being able to be hired by America because I'm American, and Americans don't matter. And I'm sorry I'm going to get a little bit emotional here. … Americans don't matter. I hear politicians, you know, saying, Okay, you know what? We're going to open our borders, and you can have free health…I don't have health insurance. You know, Americans don't matter. All that matters is foreign workers. All that matters is if the foreign individuals…I mean, it's like we don't matter. America doesn't matter.

Stephen Tennes, the owner of Country Mill Farms, has sold his fruit and vegetables at the East Lansing Farmer's Market for the past seven years.

The ads were posted this week and have now been removed, according to Metro.

By contrast, under their own theory of the case, for the House Managers to carry their burden of proving that merely raising the matter was illegitimate, they would have to prove that raising the issue could have no legitimate purpose whatsoever. Their theory is obviously false. And especially on this record, the House Managers cannot possibly carry that burden, because no such definitive proof exists. Nobody, not even House Democrats' own witnesses, could testify that the Bidens' conduct did not at least facially raise an appearance of a conflict of interest. And while House Democrats repeatedly insist that any suggestions that Vice President Biden or his son did anything wrong are debunked conspiracy theories and without merit, they lack any evidence to support those bald assertions, because they have steadfastly cut off any real inquiry into the Bidens' conduct. For example, they have refused to call Hunter Biden to testify. Instead, they have been adamant that Americans must simply accept the diktat that the Bidens' conduct could not possibly have been part of a course of conduct in which the Office of the Vice President was misused to protect the financial interests of a family member.
Many Catholics believe that this would mean handing the Church over to the Chinese government, the priest said. These are understandable and sharable concerns.
But I have also encountered many more people in public service who allege bullying or go off sick with 'stress' at the point where they are facing exposure and accountability for failure to deliver. This can also be the final throw of the dice for the bureaucrat who, having used all his obfuscatory ammunition to no effect, deploys the 'B' word.

Xinhua laid out China's propaganda objectives clearly, sweeping aside the Communist Party's role in concealing the virus, punishing doctors who tried to warn about it, and feeding false information to the World Health Organization (WHO) to claim China was a heroic leader in the global response to the pandemic and behaved as a responsible member of the international community.

Commissioner Richard Ross said Starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing. He said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything, as he said is company policy. He said they then refused to leave. Ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released after the company elected not to prosecute. He said the officers 'did absolutely nothing wrong' and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but 'got the opposite back.' He did not mention the person who said he was meeting with the men. 'As an African American male, I am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,' Ross said. But he added If a business calls and they say that 'Someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business' (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.'

The Texas Privacy Act is a thoughtful solution to a sensitive issue. It preserves an expected level of privacy for our public schools and buildings, Kolkhorst said in a written statement.

Redlining, if you remember, was the term where banks took whole neighborhoods and said, 'People in these neighborhoods are poor, they're not going to be able to pay off their mortgages, tell your salesmen don't go into those areas.' And then Congress got involved — local elected officials, as well — and said, `Oh that's not fair, these people should be able to get credit.' And once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn't as good as you would like.
We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by 'our fathers who framed the Government under which we live;' while you with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new, Lincoln said.

You are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers.

Washington's policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.

Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland:

Healthcare facilities must be immigration enforcement-free zones so that immigration status does not prevent a person from seeking care, said a statement by several hundred medical professionals. The March 2 statement continued:
Kirkpatrick's point was that the U.S. had to be smart about its friends and its enemies. That is, we had to realize that an imperfect friend was a lot better than an implacable enemy. In a word, it's important to realistic, to deal with the world as it is. And it's also important to deal with the fact that not everyone in the world is going to live up to our standards of purity—and yet if they're friendly to us, well, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. As Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of state, Cordell Hull, reportedly once quipped about one pro-America dictator, He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.

Congress created the National Security Council to assist presidents in managing the complexities of this expansion of the federal government. The 1947 law establishing the NSC, which originally consisted of the president, vice president, and the secretaries of state and defense, stated: 'The function of the Council shall be to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security.' The word 'advise' is fundamentally important. While the statutory members of the NSC, in some cases, run departments that execute foreign policy, the NSC staff at the White House was intended to coordinate policy rather than run it. My job as the national security adviser is to distill and present to the president the views and options that come from the various departments and agencies. The NSC then ensures that those agencies actually execute the president's decisions. This is the 'honest broker' model of the national security adviser, best personified by Brent Scowcroft, who held the post during both the Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush administrations. During the Obama administration, the NSC ballooned to well over 200 policy staffers. By comparison, a mere 12 NSC policy staffers helped President John F. Kennedy deal with the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. As President Jimmy Carter handled multiple crises in the late 1970s, the NSC staff totaled just 35 professionals. During the first term of the George W. Bush administration, with two major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underway, the policy staff was about 100 people.
The move further illistrates an apparent attempt by Western technology leaders to bridge the gap between the West with communist authoritarian countries in a bid to find new audiences.

7. Skepticism of experts. Many of the early failures in the fight against the coronavirus happened because the experts were wrong. They told Americans not to wear masks; they botched early coronavirus testing in government labs; and they opposed a travel ban with China.

As the left pushes the Green New Deal, demanding that we trust the economy to climate scientists, Americans will push back.

Other legislators are pushing for an amnesty of at least one million younger 'DACA' illegals. Breitbart News reported January 3:
He defended Haley's speech, however, praising her for putting a very good face on the Republican party after Obama's State of the Union speech.
The Times notes in a piece titled In Orange County, a Republican Fortress Turns Democratic that the rapid demographic changes of the county — which now has a more than 30 percent foreign-born population — has swiftly handed the region over to Democrats.
It goes back to kind of the fatal flaws of Obamacare, and just making it a little better at the margins, which is I think, at best, what you could say Ryan was up to. It was clearly unsatisfactory and was, as I say, doomed to fail, he pronounced.
The staffer, identified as Angel Alicea, is caught on film expressing frustration over the Warren campaign's intense focus on social justice, particularly, stressing the importance of using pronouns to address others, rather than talk more about how the Massachusetts Democrat will create jobs with wages that improve one's standard of living.

Since 2001, U.S. free trade with China has eliminated at least 3.4 million American jobs. In 1985, before China entered the WTO, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $6 billion. In 2019, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled more than $345 billion.
Reacting to a question about German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ms. Le Pen said simply: The German migration policy is crazy.
The ideological caucuses are looking to be a larger source of power in the majority since the groups' central purpose is to develop and debate policy. In the minority, much of the power has been delegated to the Congressional Tri-Caucus — composed of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
The bill is built to compliment the Asylum Abuse Reduction Act. The release noted that Inhofe introduced this complimentary legislation in August 2018 to target immigration loopholes to improve the integrity of the asylum process.
Technically, the House was simply notifying the Senate of its delivery of the articles, with a more formal presentation Thursday. Opening arguments are to begin next Tuesday after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
As an example, the presentation included a short paragraph about transgenderism and nonbinary sexuality, he wrote.
In secret U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, U.S. officials openly discussed Iraqi efforts to reach out to Soleimani to stop rocket attacks on the highly secured Green Zone in Baghdad in 2009. Another cable in 2007 outlines then-Iraqi President Jalal Talabani offering a U.S. official a message from Soleimani acknowledging having hundreds of agents in the country while pledging, I swear on the grave of (the late Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini I haven't authorized a bullet against the U.S.
As the bloc moves to rapidly expand its coordinated defence capabilities, the draft deal also keeps open the possibility that the UK could be bounced into new defence arrangements during the two-year transition, the pro-Brexit group Veterans for Britain (VfB) explained.

CNN's Manu Raju reported that fellow Democrat Rep. Jim Costa of California rejected Tlaib's language, calling it inappropriate.
As Breitbart News also reported in November, the North Thurston Public School district in Washington released a statement in its equity report in which officials were forced to apologize for ejecting Asian-American students from their students of color category because they were performing satisfactorily. The report had grouped white and Asian-American students together.
And then there's Egypt. Its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is strongly pro-American; he's even friendly to Israel. And yet he is being roasted by the Main Stream Media for human rights violations. And liberal groups, too, are joining in the chorus.
A 45-day appeal process is set to ensue.
The company also plans to establish an app development academy in Detroit, Michigan, with Michigan State University. The academy will provide a free 10-to-12-month course and will seek to teach 1,000 students skills in coding, design, and marketing every year.
The irony of discussing disclosures and transparency with the Campaign for Accountability is that this group consistently refuses to name its corporate funders. And those backers won't 'fess up either. The one funder the world does know about is Oracle, which is running a well-documented lobbying campaign against us… Oracle is not alone—you can easily find similar activity by companies and organizations funded by our competitors, like AT&T, the MPAA, ICOMP, FairSearch and dozens more; including hundreds of pieces directly targeting Google. We're proud of our programs and their integrity. The Campaign for Accountability and its funders are, clearly, not proud of theirs.
A noble effort failed, said an Irish-American website that championed the E-3 visas. IrishCentral.com said: We Irish are used to that and we are used to picking ourselves up and trying harder the next time. Despite Cotton … we will not give up. Given all our people gave to America we can never stop trying.
The majority said the U.S. Supreme Court recognized those powers in 2018 when it upheld Trump's ban on travel to the U.S. from a number of predominantly Muslim nations.
That was more than Sanders (at least $377,000) and Warren (at least $190,000) over the same period, though impeachment could change that. Spending data through December 2019 won't be ready until the end of the month. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg mostly flies private to campaign stops.
He is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status … there are about 400,000. They are going to lose their legal status soon. He's willing to extend that. The DACA recipients, they are all tied up in court but I think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable if you could get wall funding.

Hong Kong Watch Founder Benedict Rogers told Breitbart London that the failures of the European Union to meaningfully take on the atrocities of the communist regime will leave a vacancy in leadership that the United Kingdom should take up post-Brexit.
He will be joined in-studio by Breitbart London's Oliver Lane.
We must confront poverty, inequality and racial discrimination at their source, she added. With the right policies at the national and state level and with the engagement of grassroots social movements, Mississippi could become a hub for sustainable development thanks to our abundant resources.
The World Bank said in a report this month that weakening exports from China had compounded the impact of a slowdown in domestic demand. Policy uncertainty and higher tariffs on exports to the US also cast a pall on manufacturing activity and investor sentiment, it added.
Graham's promised support for emergency powers would be valuable because the House and Senate can jointly override any emergency declaration by the president. Graham chairs the Senates judiciary committee.
Supporters of the Cuban regime have long touted its supposedly high standards of health care, citing the fact that the country has the highest relative number of physicians in the entire world as well as the manipulation of health statistics such as infant mortality. However, the poverty inflicted as a result of decades of communist policy has, in reality, led to a decrepit health system with some of the worst health outcomes worldwide.
In 1937 Olden founded the Sterilization League of New Jersey, which later changed its name to the Sterilization League for Human Betterment in 1943. It was again renamed Birthright, Inc. in 1943 with the stated goal of improving the biological stock of the human race. In 1950, Birthright was renamed the Human Betterment Association of America (HBAA) and in 2001, the organization again changed its name, this time to its current title of Engenderhealth.
Imagine — you say, 'I got a good idea, let's gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes to take us to a country that doesn't want us, drop us off in God knows where, we don't [know] anybody, we leave everything that's familiar to us. Let's go, isn't that going to be a great idea?' These are horrible decisions these people are making.
This is such an urgent objective for China that it shuts Taiwan out even when Taiwanese membership would clearly benefit the safety and security of Chinese citizens, as with health, environmental, and law enforcement agencies.
while his peers in the Republican Party tried to strike a balance between good legal immigrants and bad illegal ones, he has always taken a skeptical attitude toward immigrants and immigration, period, believing that the burden of proof ought to be on an immigrant to prove that she deserves to come to or stay in the US, and preferring, always, to keep worthy people out rather than let anyone unworthy in. … As Sessions has put it, more people want to move to the United States than the country could ever possibly accept; the dividing line between whom the country should accept and whom it shouldn't, he believes, should be determined by the American people based on who they feel serves the national interest — defined as assimilating into American culture and helping the fortunes of American workers.
The planned U.S. pullout from Syria is part of Trump's America First policy. He has repeatedly said he was not interested in removing Assad from power or keeping American troops involved in endless wars in the region, most recently describing Syria as sand and death.
Student newspaper the Tab reported Tuesday that at least six universities are involved in efforts funding Irish students to fly back and cast a vote, including Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham, Nottingham, Goldsmiths, and the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.
Twitter's bias against conservatives is well-known. The company frequently bans or locks the accounts of conservative users who have not broken its terms of service, while allowing threats of violence against the President and First Lady to run rampant on the platform.
TREBISHT (ALBANIA) (AFP) – Trebisht in northeastern Albania looks like a ghost village, emptied of its residents by a rush to get Bulgarian passports that open the door to the European Union.
The US Navy has been challenging China in the South China Sea by conducting freedom of navigation air and sea patrols throughout the region, including within 12 miles of China's artificial islands. This has infuriated the Chinese, but US Navy officials argue that to do nothing would be to allow China to prevent any foreign naval vessel from traveling through the South China Sea, which is one of the biggest commercial routes in the world.
In a hushed chamber, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, clad in a traditional black robe, raised his right hand as he was sworn in to preside over the trial. He then administered the oath to senators in turn, to convene the third court of impeachment in American history.
Hinkins's legislation is opposed by the Gun Violence Policy Center of Utah's Gary Sackett, who says, It's common sense that you just don't let people walk around untrained, with weapons that are built only to kill people.
After receiving her grade on the essay, Jeffers said she requested a meeting with Scott to address her decision to police the language of her students.
By contrast, the president said Ossoff and Warnock would serve as agents to implement a Democrat agenda in Washington that includes massively raising taxes, gutting the military — military installations like Fort Benning and Fort Gordon would be on the chopping block — surrendering the American manufacturing industry to China, and opening borders to illegal immigrants, which would make the country one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and overwhelm schools and hospitals.
Both parties in the potential coalition arrangement have agreed to crack down on immigration to Italy, but exactly how and to what extent is believed to be one of the areas still up for agreement.

So it does not matter that Bulgaria is the poorest country in the EU. Seen from Trebisht, it is the gateway to Germany, England or some other promised land.
During his debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Biden answered his rival's challenge regarding his flip-flopping on the issue of support for the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision that is applied to congressional spending bills that prohibits taxpayer funds to be used for abortions.
Making clear the United States' support for Britain, Ambassador Johnson wrote: America shares your optimism and excitement about the many opportunities the future will bring — one of those opportunities very evidently being the hotly-anticipated future free trade agreement between the two nations.
You'll have to ask the president, he said when asked what Trump meant by economic devastation for Turkey. We have applied economic sanctions in many places, I assume he is speaking about those kinds of things. You'll have to ask him.
Israel extended its mandatory quarantine measures — already in place for travellers from Italy and some Asian countries — to cover people from France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.
Olsen assessed left-wing proposals from self-described democratic socialists — including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — as unappealing to working class and blue collar Americans.
The organizer did not say that she would return to her homeland. The organizer is likely Marianne Baesa.
Paul viewed Abrams as an exemplar of the sneering, latte-sipping political class in Washington that Trump was elected to fight, and which shows every intention of fighting dirty in return, as the geysers of leaked information pouring from the new administration attest. (In fact, this very story is the subject of leaks intended to manipulate media coverage, as noted above.)
The current contract with passport manufacturers De La Rue expires with the British government in 2019, with the Home Office now accepting proposals from companies to manage £490 million redesign project. Other priorities for the government's new design will include incorporating new mechanisms to combat identity fraud.

Similarly, Johnson allowed the EU to cut the British territory of Gibraltar out of his deal at the request of Spain, which has resulted in a last-minute side deal which will see Spain and/or an EU agency put in charge of monitoring sea and air travel.

Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said:
The Kochs' push for DACA amnesty this year comes as the billionaires and donor class checked two items off their wish list in the last two years of Trump's presidency: Tax cuts and criminal justice reform.
Carrying a concealed weapon, trespassing, burglary, disturbing the peace, possession and transportation of a controlled substance, impersonation, driving under the influence, driving without a license, driving with a suspended license, resisting arrest, vandalism, criminal threats and illegal entry.
Patrick said he told his wife Brad Pitt or George Clooney would be his recommendations of actors who might portray him in the film.
Sen. Cruz said the WALL Act would stop the flow of illegal immigration with border security. He said the bill would close existing loopholes that provide illegal immigrants with federal benefits and tax credits, without affecting the benefits and tax credits used by Americans.
Despite a 2003 ceasefire, India and Pakistan have repeatedly clashed along the Line of Control (LoC), the border that separates the regions they respectively control in Kashmir.
The Russians do not think much of the so-called Arab Spring, either, complaining that the practice of overthrowing legitimate political regimes is becoming more widespread, provoking domestic instability and conflicts. They blame the rise of the Islamic State, in part, on Western support for rebel forces in Syria.
Omar has telegraphed her practical aims for this particular policy. In the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as Iran and Venezuela. Last April, she accused President Trump of declaring a fake emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allowed him to direct funding towards the construction of physical barriers.
When, in January 2016, I wrote that despite being a lifelong Republican who worked in the previous three GOP administrations, I would never vote for Donald Trump, even though his administration would align much more with my policy views than a Hillary Clinton presidency would, a lot of my Republican friends were befuddled. How could I not vote for a person who checked far more of my policy boxes than his opponent? What I explained then, and what I have said many times since, is that Trump is fundamentally unfit—intellectually, morally, temperamentally, and psychologically—for office. For me, that is the paramount consideration in electing a president, in part because at some point it's reasonable to expect that a president will face an unexpected crisis—and at that point, the president's judgment and discernment, his character and leadership ability, will really matter.
That's another question I'd like to be answered. I get responding to the complaint but they took every step afterward as if the intention was to prosecute to the fullest extent.

California Governor Jerry Brown, who extended Medi-Cal coverage to illegal immigrant children in 2015, has not commented on the pending measures but is required by law to sign or veto bills passed this session by Sept. 30, just five weeks before the midterm elections.
According to the report, President Trump wants plans on his desk before his scheduled summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April. The State Department has been quietly informing China that expanded sanctions against banks that do business with Pyongyang would hit a large number of Chinese financial institutions. Small Chinese banks have been crucial in helping North Korea conduct illicit commerce to evade sanctions.

Breitbart News reported today that police are bracing themselves for a possible protest at Twitter HQ following the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account last week. A San Francisco Police Department spokesman stated that the department is aware of a possible demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street.
However, the matter of which logo a player wears for Hall of Fame enshrinement, is not solely up to the player. The Hall of Fame has final say in order to ensure that the player wears a logo which represents a significant portion of his career.

This unprovoked response to North Korea's flaccid provocation was, in turn, highly provocative to Chris Cillizza of CNN, who suffered a complete meltdown on Wednesday morning:
Even George Soros recognises that Huawei represents a massive security threat and has praised Trump's decision to stand firm against it as the greatest, and perhaps only, foreign policy accomplishment of the Trump administration.
With his second reason, Ashford claimed that even if they don't realize it, these critics are practicing their own form of religion in public:
At that meeting, Trump and Netanyahu voiced confidence they could work out an understanding, while providing few hints how.
All the families in Ramadi were like captives, she said. ISIS tortured men in a way that they cried like women.
The idea draws on universal basic income, championed by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which the government would give all citizens a guaranteed annual income from the government. In a Monday tweet, Yang urged Congress to adopt a form of UBI to help combat the pandemic: What exactly is the political downside of putting money into people's hands? Get your shit together Congress and do the right thing.
A few brave souls resisted the urge to jump on the population explosion bandwagon, urging calm and rationality. One was economist Julian L. Simon, who later noted that whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster.
Explaining his support for the policy, Kjenseth told NRK: [The introduction of a third gender] doesn't mean much for the rest of us, but would greatly benefit those who don't find their gender expressed in the categories of male and female.
Soleimani's luck ran out after being rumored dead several times in his life. Those incidents included a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of Assad. More recently, rumors circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria's Aleppo.
And it is the general public upon whose behalf Congress is supposed to legislate, not the tens of millions who participate in shooting sports. Even a marginal increase in risk to the population cannot be justified, unless the harms to the minority from current policy are very severe and there are no means to reduce them other than the proposed legislation. In fact, the harms to shooters are modest — somewhat elevated risk of non-total hearing loss, essentially — and effective alternatives to silencers are readily available.
The Project Veritas videos, filmed without apparent awareness or consent, show a range of selectively edited insights from inside Twitter, claimed Wired. Many of the employees filmed used sensational language, but they also thought they were talking candidly to strangers at a bar. It's not exactly unusual to embellish your job — and to elide its nuances — to a potential new friend or romantic interest. Apparently, Wired has chosen calling Twitter employees lonely nerds as the best defense available for the social media platform.
The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed a complaint against the state's assault weapons ban on Friday and expressly described similar bans as constitutional.

Bolton is to have dinner Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Sunday evening to discuss the pace of the U.S. drawdown, American troop levels in the region, and the U.S. commitment to push back on Iranian regional expansionism. Bolton was expected to explain that some U.S. troops based in Syria to fight IS will shift to Iraq with the same mission and that the al-Tanf base would remain.
Trump described the election as one of the most important elections in history. It's a biggie, he said, as he pitched Perdue and Loeffler as senators who share Georgia values and lambasted Ossoff and Warnock as fringe extremists.
Biden's advisers have already begun meeting with House Democrats to talk about a legislative pathway for an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. Aside from an amnesty that would burden 18 million jobless Americans with increased foreign competition in the U.S. labor market, Biden is eyeing an end to President Trump's reforms at the U.S.-Mexico border.
It appears that Eliason has decided to take a different approach to politics when compared to some of her colleagues in academia, such as Ole Miss professor James Thomas, who in October 2018 said that simply harassing Republicans in restaurants isn't enough, and that leftists should put their whole damn fingers in senators' meals, because they don't deserve civility.
Trump erupted in anger at acting director of national intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire when he learned of the February 13 session with the House Intelligence Committee, US media reported.
Because of the successful cheap-labor strategy, wages for men have remained flat since 1973, and a large percentage of the nation's annual income has shifted to investors and away from employees.
And the UK is no different. According to official figures from Eurostat, October saw 5,095 migrants and their dependents claim asylum in the UK. That represents the highest figure in a single month since the statistic was first recorded in 2009, up from 2,270 a month at the start of 2015, The Telegraph has reported.
The fast-growing employment of foreign-born workers over American citizens — which was evident in November 2018 as well — is exacerbated by the country's wage-crushing national immigration policy whereby about 1.5 million mostly low-skilled legal and illegal immigrants are added to the U.S. population every year.
Others insist that the policy change would significantly lessen the number of sexual assaults on campus. We believe a unique community of support is created through single-sex communities like fraternities. A community these students know it took decades to establish and could take nearly as long to change, Yale freshman Jojo Attal said.
Lumping the blame for the mass migration at the feet of EU member states is likely to cause consternation – especially from Eurosceptic governments like those in Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia – though those countries – which have been stricter on immigration and related crime, are the ones who have suffered less from migrant crime in the past few weeks.
As the report also mentioned potential Chinese expansion into Pakistan, Hua chided the United States and claimed cooperation with the Pakistani government is not targeted at any third party.

In the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA. This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users. With half a billion active users and accelerating growth, Telegram has become the largest refuge for those seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security. We take this responsibility very seriously. We won't let you down. Those of you who have used Telegram for the last several years know we've been consistent both when it comes to defending private data and to improving our apps. For those of you who just joined and are wondering what Telegram stands for, I'd like to quote my post from 2018: You – our users – have been and will always be our only priority. Unlike other popular apps, Telegram doesn't have shareholders or advertisers to report to.

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly vowed to be the president to finally relocate the embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital. As Pence said Sunday, that unequivocal promise has morphed into Trump now giving serious consideration to moving the American Embassy.
(JNS) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to meet at the White House in late March, a few weeks before the Israeli election, Israel Hayom has learned.

We care about giving children access to the K-12 education of their family's choice, in full compliance with the law, she said. We don't take positions on tangential immigration issues.

To reduce its population, China instituting a draconian one-child policy, which has now left the country (through sex-selective abortions) with a horrific gender imbalance, with yearly births of some 120 boys born for every 100 girls. As a result, 30 million more men than women will reach adulthood and enter China's mating market by 2020.
Crenshaw noted that in Obama's budget increase for the agency, less than 20 percent of the increase was for taxpayer services, cybersecurity, and identity-theft protection.
Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple, said Schumer, When we use phrases like 'undocumented workers,' we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose.
Reuters reviews how the new appraisal, the first major revision in five years, describes the threat posed by the United States:
Built upon an ever-increasing mountain of debt, any significant uptick in rates could bring the whole financial system down. Most existing borrowers, be they individuals or institutions, would likely be unable to handle higher payments if forced to refinance at pre-2008 levels.

Collins said Trump can put in place restrictions beyond those enacted by Congress as long as the rules do not conflict with federal laws.
Discrimination is pernicious, Khurana wrote. Stereotypes and bias take hold, normalizing bias in a community, which should be unacceptable. In this case, the discriminatory membership policies of these organizations have led to the perpetuation of spaces that are rife with power imbalances. The most entrenched of these spaces send an unambiguous message that they are the exclusive preserves of men.
In her piece, Kirkpatrick focused on the foreign-policy failings of President Jimmy Carter, who had so badly mishandled the Cold War against the Soviets. The immediate issue, back then, was that the Carter administration was more critical of non-democratic allies than of actively anti-democratic enemies. Hence the double standard in Kirkpatrick's title; our non-democratic allies were scorned, while our anti-democratic enemies were sometimes even praised. Indeed, the Carterites seemed determined actually to depose pro-American autocratic regimes, thus paving the way for pro-Soviet totalitarian regimes.
Acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to focus on the National Defense Strategy and to keep this effort moving forward. While we're focused on ongoing operations, Acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to remember China, China, China, the official said.

But I have also encountered many more people in public service who allege bullying or go off sick with 'stress' at the point where they are facing exposure and accountability for failure to deliver.

And this time, left wing activists have moved in too, organising demonstrations and inciting the migrants to aggressively resist attempts by the French riot police to contain them.
Fiona earned two college degrees in the early 2000s after she left the real estate industry following the 2007 collapse. Since then, she has worked a series of contract jobs, most recently at a seven-month stint at an insurance company run by an imported workforce of H-1B workers from India. She said her job ended when she was forced out by Indian managers, in part, because of her excellent performance reviews. She is in her 50s, has been unemployed for several months, and fears recruiters will blackball her if she speaks on the record.

The Washington-imposed economic policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
A log of updates to hate speech policy documents show some of the new phrases and sentiments that were defined as hate speech following the Charlottesville protest.

Whenever a large number of foreign migrants travel from one region to another, the reactions of the natives generally range from marginalization to open hostility to violence, sometimes ending in deportation. In Beijing, the migrants are not foreigners. They are ordinary Chinese from farms and rural areas who come to the city to improve themselves, or to earn money to send back to their families.

The Sites Reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the Sacramento River, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. More than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. In addition to reducing flows in the Sacramento River, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western Sacramento Valley. Impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. The Sites Project Authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. But this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …

Sites Reservoir … reduces the flood potential of the Sacramento River … and it allows the entire Central Valley system, all the other major dams in the north — Trinity, Shasta, Oroville, and Folsom — to rebalance … [A]s much as 3 million more acre-feet of water can be stored in Trinity, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom because they don't have to prevent flooding of Sacramento and other downriver communities, rebalancing the system. A similar proposal to raise the height of the Shasta Dam has a similar purpose, as would Temperance Flat on the San Joquin River near Fresno.

After the 2002 to 2007 housing bubble burst, the Federal Reserve responded to what it called the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression by implementing both a zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP) and quantitative easing (QE) to spread cheap money into the financial markets to rescue plunging real estate prices.
Were President Trump to actually send troops to the southern border, it would not be unprecedented. In 2006, President George W. Bush deployed roughly 6,000 troops to the border to support domestic law enforcement activities. And in 2010, President Obama took similar action. Notably, while those actions might have been unpopular, no one seriously questioned whether Presidents Bush and Obama violated the Posse Comitatus Act.
Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, Perez said, as HuffPost reported. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state:

Residents of the town have been evicted, threatened with violence, and it was the site of the arrest of the former head of the French Foreign Legion General Piquemal who participated in a PEGIDA march against the current migrant policy of the French government. Visitors to the Jungle camp, including journalists, are routinely attacked as two Dutch filmmakers recently found out. Even a Shakespeare play, put on for the migrants by left-wing activists, was stopped early due to the activities of knife-wielding migrants.

But what has Barack Obama done for eight years? In the very early years of his administration, he sent Hillary Clinton to push the reset button with the Russian foreign minister, he continued. In the middle of his re-election campaign in 2012 he told the Russian president that he would have more flexibility after the election. When Mitt Romney characterized Russia as our number one geopolitical adversary, Barack Obama mocked him and said that the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back. I'm glad the president has finally realized the threat that Russia poses to the United States and our interests but I wish he had recognized this eight years ago.

The incoming Congress and the executive administration are going to have to make some significant decisions that will also carry significant implications, not just for the veteran community but for the whole country and that's why it's important to look at these opinions, because these are the people who are most deeply affected by these issues and that's a good indicator for policy makers as they make decisions, Anderson said.

The 29-year-old deflected further, saying the government would pay for social programs the same way the government would fund the Space Force — all while refusing to break down how much taxpayer money would go towards each of her policy proposals.
Meanwhile, beyond China's borders, the Belt and Road initiative of the People's Republic, while officially peaceful and cooperative, is, in fact, a key part of that country's bid for global dominion. It was Bloomberg News—not exactly a mouthpiece for hawks—that summed up China's goals in a stark headline late last year: Xi Jinping's Plan to Dominate the World. And oh yes: the Chinese are also busy hacking into America; there's a new report on China's cyber-espionage against the U.S. virtually every day.
Bolsonaro, who defeated the socialist Workers' Party (PT) candidate Fernando Haddad in October's run-off presidential election, ran a campaign vowing to eradicate Marxist thought from the government and from Brazil's schools and spearhead a movement of small-government conservatives in Latin America who opposed the ideologies of the region's dictatorships, Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua.

US Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin is suggesting that it would be valuable if Australia and other nations could join the US in these freedom of navigation patrols. According to Aucoin:
Girls and women are the privileged sex in education. From preschool to graduate school, and across ethnic and class lines, women get better grades, they win most of the honors and prizes, and they're far more likely to go to college. Today women earn a majority of bachelor's degrees and advanced degrees. Latino girls are now slightly more likely to attend college than white boys. When an education policy analyst looked at current trends in higher education he quipped, only half in jest, The last male will graduate from college in 2068. Our schools have offered untold number of admirable and effective programs to strengthen girls in areas where they languished—in sports, math, and science. Where are the programs to help boys in areas where they falter: reading, writing, grades, school engagement and college matriculation? So far Congress, schools of education, school boards and the Department of Education have looked the other way.
Further on in the email exchange, the unidentified FBI official from the Washington field office writes, There is no additional or new info as of this morning when I checked with the DNI scheduler.

It would be very dangerous and unwise to proceed with the Senate Judiciary bill, which would lead to the release of thousands of violent felons, Cotton told Politico on January 25.

The Hill reports pushback against Koskinen's budget request from House Republicans. Subcommittee chair Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) said it was sometimes difficult to take budget requests seriously when the IRS again asks for an unrealistically high amount that doesn't make customer service a priority and fails to adopt some of the good government reforms that we added.
In response, MILO stated, Our ads promoted my smash #1 bestseller DANGEROUS just by stating my name, its title, and a quote from the press. We didn't have anything to say about issues or policy unless you consider my face to be a political statement. So I have a simple question for the D.C. Metro. What advertisement could we have posted that *did not* break those policies?
Here's how poorly these emails were handled. The State Department did not provide information about where they were found, why they were not previously produced, or if additional records are anticipated. Last month, a Justice Department attorney could not tell a federal court judge how and where the FBI discovered the new cache of Clinton emails.
The bill, which provides criminal and civil penalties to public officials who block enforcement of immigration law, passed the legislature in May and went to Abbott's desk for signature. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas immediately after signing the bill into law, Abbott said law enforcement and other officials implementing sanctuary policies that release criminal aliens with immigration detainers will now be subject to the stiffest penalties in America.
Putin crowed that his policies would take care of people and increase human capital as Russia's most important resource in December 2016. He told his parliament he expected human capital to blossom so much that Europe and the United States would lose their ability to prod Russia with sanctions. However, while Russia's birth rate has ticked up a bit lately, it remains well below the level Putin confidently predicted.
There are limits to the extent that above-target inflation can be tolerated, the minutes said. The continuing suitability of the current policy stance depends on the trade-off between above-target inflation and slack in the economy.
Grenell has cheered on the rise of right-wing populists in Europe, including hailing Austria's ultra-conservative chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, as a rock star.
It has been widely reported that Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings for as much as $87,000 a month while his father was vice president and in charge of combating corruption in Ukraine. It has also been widely reported that Burisma was under investigation by the government of Ukraine for corruption, but the case eventually stopped being pursued.
I believe all people should have the opportunity to live out their identity and then have to adapt the laws to reality and not vice versa, he explained.
Kurtz explained the Goldwater bill in an interview with Breitbart News:
Roberts, who has no authority to do so, refused to read the question.
Rogin also cites unnamed State Department bureaucrats who don't feel that they are able to affect policy through the normal channels due to what they see as lack of communication coming from Trump's and Tillerson's people.
The House coronavirus spending bill allows roughly 500,000 college graduate visa-workers from China, India, and elsewhere to stay in their U.S. jobs, regardless of job losses by American graduates in the economic meltdown, according to a lobby group for H-1B workers.
The countries also plan to coordinate their positions in Brussels and lobby the United Nations to give Germany its own seat on the Security Council — France holding one of five permanent positions in the influential group.
What made Washington truly great is that he eschewed great man politics. Though the story of the American Revolution can largely be told through Washington's life, he believed that the ideas and the constitutional government that were produced by it were far larger than himself.
For example, meritocracy, he continued. Everybody loves meritocracy, right? I'm a beneficiary of meritocracy. I got a scholarship to Yale at a time that was a really new thing, that Ivy League schools gave people like me scholarships. But what that created was a generation of much smarter knowledge workers at the same time that the knowledge economy was replacing the factory economy.
600,000 new Gabbers today, said Torba.
The ban occurred shortly after BuzzFeed published a story accusing Zero Hedge of doxing, or revealing the personal identity, of a Chinese scientist accused of playing a role in the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus.
What we're trying to ensure is that all countries, no matter size or strength, can pursue their interests based on the law of the sea and not have that endangered by some of these actions. It's up to those countries, but I think it's in our best interests to make sure that those sea lines remain open, I'll leave it at that.

The Vietnam War really changed when we got rid of deferments for college students because suddenly middle-class and upper-class kids were subject to a draft, he added. The people who run things don't care about the teachers' unions who are protected because they're either politicians in cities where the Democrats dominate and the teachers' unions dominate the primaries on those cities or because they're sending their kids to private schools anyway.
In other remarks published by the Iranian state Mehr News Agency, al-Houthi also implied that the United States and Saudi Arabia were deliberately allowing flights to land in Yemen to spread the disease.

Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk was initially evasive about whether he would step down during a question and answer session during a breakfast event Thursday about Ukraine on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.
The ceremonial pomp and protocol by the lawmakers prosecuting the case against Trump moved the impeachment out of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Democratic-run House to the Republican-majority Senate, where the president's team is mounting a defense aiming for swift acquittal.
We have come through a period of eight years of tension at various levels, but particularly the top level. It's clear that [former president Barack] Obama and Netanyahu didn't get along, didn't like each other. And that attitude was then communicated to the White House staff. You had a lot of backbiting, criticism of Netanyahu — all of that is over. We've returned now to the idea that there should be no daylight in public between the two governments. There will be plenty of disagreements, but those will be discussed in closed rooms and the relations at the top are obviously genuinely good. There is no artifice here about getting along.
Gov. DeSantis, who has prioritized the elderly ahead of many essential workers for getting the vaccine, announced a policy under which the state would provide doses to hospitals that dispense them out the fastest.
Curtis described the value of the project in terms environmentalists might understand: given that the state's climate is changing, and becoming warmer, that means more of California's annual precipitation is falling as rain, rather than snow.
We're going to work purposely diligently and responsibly to roll back Trump's [migration] restrictions starting on day one. We will institute humane and orderly responses. That means rebuilding the [legal] capacity we need to safely and quickly process asylum seekers without creating near term crisis in the midst of this deadly pandemic.
Because a ban on the AR-15 and large capacity magazines is, in its opinion, constitutional, the court ruled that the question of whether a ban exists is one to be decided by legislatures, not judges.

This doesn't mean that dangerous criminals will be walking the streets. Those who threaten Americans' safety can and must continue to be detained. … When an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs in an ICE facility, the detainees won't be the only ones at risk. An outbreak will expose the hundreds of ICE agents and officers, medical personnel, contract workers, and others who work in these facilities to the virus. Once exposed, many of them will unknowingly take the virus home to their family and community.

One of the strongest tendencies of people fleeing warzones, Sir Paul said, is to stick together in homogeneous communities. This makes assimilating them into wider society much harder than for other types of migrant.
Citing the contempt motion filed in an Arkansas court by 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' lawyers on Friday, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette revealed that besides his tax returns, Hunter Biden has also failed to disclose:
The new poll taken days after four were killed by a self-proclaimed member of the Islamic State killed four in southern France found the French public overwhelmingly backing a significant crackdown on radical Islam and deportations that could impact tens of thousands of people.
THE FACTS: Actually, the White House rationale for canceling the trip was contradicted a short time later by Trump, who said he postponed because a CDC employee in Atlanta was thought to have contracted the infectious disease and because of the one person, they didn't want me going. It was not about staying out of the way of CDC employees,

Backed by an array of free-speech advocates, the tech company has argued that expanding the territorial scope of the right to be forgotten would infringe on other countries' sovereignty and encourage dictators and tyrants to assert control over content published beyond their countries' borders. The EU's executive arm also argued in September that the right shouldn't be extended overseas. At issue in the case is the right, established by the court in 2014, for EU residents to demand that search engines remove links containing personal information—such as a home address—from searches for their own names. Under the 2014 ruling, search engines must then balance those requests against the public's right to associate the information in the link with that individual, taking into account, for instance, whether the person is a public figure. Since that decision, Google has removed 1.1 million links from search results in the EU. But it left those links intact for the same searches conducted outside Europe.

I think when you look back at presidential electoral politics, what was extraordinary about Trump's run was that he won Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and no Republican has done that, and that includes Mitt Romney, Paul told Breitbart News.

Due to the disturbing events that transpired yesterday, and given that the election results have now been certified, starting today *any* channels posting new videos with false claims in violation of our policies will now receive a strike. Over the last month, we've removed thousands of videos which spread misinformation claiming widespread voter fraud changed the result of the 2020 election, including several videos President Trump posted to his channel. Like other major policy updates, in our Help Center, we noted that there would be a short grace period after the Dec update & new content that broke our rules would be removed without penalty. The grace period was scheduled to end on Inauguration Day. Channels that receive a strike are temporarily suspended from posting or live streaming. Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube. We apply our policies and penalties consistently, regardless of who uploads it.
As Breitbart News also reported in November, the North Thurston Public School district in Washington released a statement in its equity report in which officials were forced to apologize for ejecting Asian-American students from their students of color category because they were performing satisfactorily.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is under fire from her Democratic colleagues in the Senate over her far-left policies and social media antics, with some calling the self-avowed Democratic-socialist the flavor of the month and her positions crazy.
Struggling Americans are going to go to their mailboxes and find four-figure checks to help with their bills. Why? Because the Senate stepped up. Many American families who poured everything into a restaurant or a shop or a small manufacturer are going to keep making payroll and keep their businesses alive, because this Senate stepped up. Hundreds of thousands of workers in key sectors, who might well have been laid off through no fault of their own, will instead get to keep their job and continue their career, because this Senate stepped up. And for the health care heroes who leave their own sleeping children and drive to the hospital for an all night shift, who spend hour after hour healing the sick, comforting strangers and literally battling this disease, there will be more masks in their supply closets, more funding for their hospitals, and soon more new treatments to administer to their patients, because this senate stepped up.
The United States will continue to aggressively push back against the anti-Israel bias, and advance badly needed reforms of the Council, she added.
7. Skepticism of experts. Many of the early failures in the fight against the coronavirus happened because the experts were wrong. They told Americans not to wear masks; they botched early coronavirus testing in government labs; and they opposed a travel ban with China. Even the lockdowns preferred by experts are now thought to be counter-productive. As the left pushes the Green New Deal, demanding that we trust the economy to climate scientists, Americans will push back.
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in favor of President Donald Trump's order barring entry to legal immigrants until they fund their own health insurance and avoid becoming a public charge' for taxpayers.
Do you think that there are any connections that Trump has with Russia that we should know of? What do you make of those reports? CNN host Fareed Zakaria asked Karaganov.
Carney was speaking after the bank kept interest rates on hold – again as expected. How long they will stay on hold will likely depend on how long rate-setters can overlook rising inflation. Rate-setters have a difficult balancing act – how to set policy to meet a legal mandate to keep inflation at 2 percent against the need to support economic growth.

According to ICE, Aguilar was released because he 'had no significant misdemeanor or felony conviction record,' and as such, '[h]e does not meet ICE enforcement priorities,' they wrote.
A whistleblower in the California construction business most recently revealed how mass immigration and illegal aliens contributed in driving down Americans' wages in the industry, Breitbart News reported:
Under that memorandum, ICE may refuse to take custody of dangerous aliens from state and local law enforcement agencies when such aliens exhibit criminal behavior, but have not been convicted of a felony and most misdemeanors, Goodlatte and Grassley wrote, noting that the mere fact that an alien is illegally present should be enough for ICE to take custody.

They created some proposed fixes to NAFTA, for example, he said. Their premise is that people of good faith on both sides actually can get back to the business of coming up with solutions in this country instead of saying, 'Well, if it's a Republican idea, we hate it because we're Democrats, and if it's a Democrat idea, we hate it because we're Republicans.'
Thus far, the J-1 visa has remained in place, unreformed, though the new year brings a new opportunity for the Trump administration to tackle the small, but essential reform.
The poll also showed there was a plurality of support from veterans, military families, and the general population for a more diplomatic versus a military approach to Iran. That could be good news for the Biden administration, which wants to reduce tensions with Iran.
A leaked report from Frontex, the EU's border agency, warned of mass migration flows to Greece that will be difficult to stop this time around. European leaders like Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have called Turkey's action an attack on Greece and Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited the border with Turkey and said that the bloc would show solidarity with Greece.

I spoke with the ruler in Saudi Arabia, the king, and the crown prince, and the foreign minister, and we spoke about a wide range of issues. And where we're working closely together and being successful we want to redouble our efforts, and where friends think the other one is falling short I was very clear and candid about those things where America is not satisfied, where they're not meeting our expectations. And they – and they appreciate that. By the way, you should know they shared places they think America may not be doing everything. I mean, this is – this is how friends engage. You have conversations where you're not always exactly in the same place, and each tries to ensure that the other understands their position and why it is they're there, and then you do your best to move forward together.
Breitbart News reported in July that Wall Street's Love Affair with Apple May Be Over. With the stock trading within pennies of the all-time-record price of $132.54, it was clear that the upgrade cycle for the newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was only about 20 percent, almost a third lower than previous cycles after two quarters. We added, It would appear that the Apple iOS ecosystem is being challenge.

Saudi Arabia has sentenced a journalist to five years in prison after he insulted the kingdom's rulers on Twitter while supporting the right of women to drive.
The biggest embarrassment was over Obama's handling of the incident… and [the question of] whether or not he would refer to it in his pre-prepared speech. So what we witnessed was not so much the abduction of the sailors but the abduction of the American president himself. His ransom was the missed opportunity to present himself as a strong president enjoying the legitimacy of achieving the nuclear agreement with Iran.

Biden, who has pledged to create an era of bipartisan cooperation, announced the final makeup of his cabinet last week, with high-profile choices to helm the Departments of Commerce and Labor, respectively. For those posts, the president-elect picked two respected elected officials, Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-RI) and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D), from his own party.

The Radio Farda report included a necessary disclaimer that Iran does not officially publish details about its crude oil exports, but since even the countries granted waivers by the United States to purchase Iranian oil have significantly reduced their imports, a decline in export volume can be readily deduced.
If the proposed rule becomes law, survivors will lose access to their education and schools will continue to sweep sexual violence under the rug, End Rape on Campus insists. The new rule will stop survivors from coming forward and make schools more dangerous for all students.
Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, have declined over the past two days thanks in part to the intensifying scandal over user data at Facebook. Alphabet's shares have been under-pressure because investors fear that regulators might clamp down on how tech companies deploy user data in a way that could crimp earnings across the sector.
The decree, which received unanimous approval in the Italian cabinet, combines aspects of migration policy along with other security provisions to tackle far-left occupier activists as well as the Italian mafia.
Prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.
By contrast, the president said Ossoff and Warnock would serve as agents to implement a Democrat agenda in Washington that includes massively raising taxes, gutting the military — military installations like Fort Benning and Fort Gordon would be on the chopping block — surrendering the American manufacturing industry to China, and opening borders to illegal immigrants, which would make the country one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and overwhelm schools and hospitals.
Trump's decision to cancel the meeting came a day after Pompeo told lawmakers the administration was prepared to walk away from anything short of denuclearization.
At a one-hour BBC debate on the future of Britain's membership of the European Union, Farage pointed out Mr Clegg's record on Europe, saying: The whole point of the [EU] constitution, which you supported, was to make the European Union an economic and a military superpower.

Prominent leaders of the Democratic Party once fiercely endorsed border security, and had even voted to secure a border fence along the nation's southern border.
TEL AVIV – The Hamas terror tunnel destroyed by the IDF on Saturday was intended for an attack on the border crossing where the majority of humanitarian aid reaches the Gaza Strip, an IDF spokesperson said.
The security source said: Half the problem is no effective analysis is applied to these things in Brussels as there's no real analytical capability to inform policy decisions. So the dots between Brussels and EU policy on the one hand and security implications, social cohesion etc, particularly in the medium to long term – the second and third order effects you might say – on the other are never joined. That is a serious and systemic problem.
Likewise, Biden hinted at his push to quickly pass an amnesty for the majority of 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. and revoke a number of executive orders issued by Trump to reform the nation's legal immigration system that admits 1.2 million green card holders every year.
Salvini insists the decision had the backing of the government and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
The document added: They received no training to help them make such judgments. Some local authorities were concerned that the Home Office applied its 'benefit of the doubt' policy too readily, and highlighted the risks of wrongly placing an adult with children in their care.
A spokesman for the opposition rebels says that they won't stop fighting unless Russia and Syria completely stop bombing. Well, they said that they're going to continue bombing.
That projection, all other things being equal, would likely prompt the bank to raise interest rates. However, growth, despite the upgrades, is set to remain below the British economy's long-run average and that could keep a lid on such things as wage rises. Even with the improved outlook, the central bank said GDP will still be 1.5 percent lower in two years than was forecast before the referendum.

For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.

Report: China's military buildup neutralizes America's aircraft carriers
The economy would be in an official financial depression if not for the world's central banks conspiring to push rates down—effectively stealing from savers. This policy is no different than cutting off your leg to feed yourself when on the brink of starvation—you may no longer be hungry, but you'll still bleed out. When the Fed drops rates to benefit people purchasing and refinancing homes, for example, savers have to resort to eating into their principal. This one action is likely going to be the cause of the next mounting financial crisis: pension and insurance failures.

Meanwhile, we need to plan to crack down on Tsai's new provocative actions, including imposing military pressure, which is an unbearable option for Taiwan authorities, the newspaper urged.
Trump's United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seems to be planning to implement a modern public charge rule that would protect American taxpayers' dollars from funding the mass importation of welfare-dependent foreign nationals.
But it is backfiring. They started by telling the story of Alexander Downer, an Australian diplomat, as having remembered a bar conversation with George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. But how did the FBI know they should talk to him? That's left out of their narrative. Downer's signature appears on a $25 million contribution to the Clinton Foundation. You don't need much imagination to figure that he was close with Clinton Foundation operatives who relayed information to the State Department, which then called the FBI to complete the loop. This wasn't intelligence. It was likely opposition research from the start.
Apple CEO Tim Cook added that we are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world — and these new projects send a clear signal of Apple's enduring commitment.

Thanks to Europe's open door 'refugee' policy and free movement within Europe, the attackers traveled unhindered, back and forth between Syria and France. Three of the terrorists who attacked had taken the migrant route, explained Ms. Le Pen.
Last October, Twitter shut down links to the New York Post's story about the Biden family's business dealings in Ukraine, in part citing its policy regarding hacked materials. Given the New York Post's sourcing of Mac Isaac's discoveries on Hunter Biden's laptop for its reports, Twitter's censorship amounted to a framing of Mac Isaac as a hacker.

Beijing has approved a measure ordering Muslim communities within its borders to uphold the sinicization of their religion during the next five years, which refers to making Islam more Chinese by instilling Communist Party values, China's state-run Global Times reported this week.
This will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. Biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. Sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. I am no stranger to investment madness – three times I've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.
For those seeking a way out without a passport, Venezuela al Día recommends going to Perú.

Maduradas, another anti-regime site, merely lists the most enjoyable things to do in Venezuela before you leave.
The panel participants worried that China is flexing its muscles in various international organizations at the same moment that American influence is waning, and that Beijing acts aggressively to prosecute agenda items such as isolating Taiwan while Washington is often unclear about what it wants from international bodies. This has allowed China to become the gatekeeper for membership in some important organizations, especially those where each member state is allowed a single vote no matter how large and powerful it is, since China can wrangle supporting votes from a large number of smaller nations in its orbit.
G.G. sued, arguing that Title IX of federal law requires schools to allow everyone to use whichever facilities they identify with. Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary James Ferg-Cadima from Barack Obama's Education Department agreed with her position.
I made a sketch, and we started to make the dress, Lagerfeld told WWD. The German designer said someone from Streep's team called days later and said, Don't continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us.
The new rule, however, does not prohibit doctors in Title X facilities from counseling women about abortion.
And in any case, none of these gotcha moments amount to anything revelatory, they continued. These videos don't prove that Twitter has a partisan bias against its far-right conservative users. (Indeed, they're some of its most prolific users.) They do show, though, that the right-wing backlash against tech giants has reached a new height. With every new policy intended to curb abuse, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms invite rancor. The new rules have been necessary to fight an increasingly toxic atmosphere online. But Project Veritas sees those steps, and the ban of high-profile far-right users—over clear, apolitical terms of service violations—as an attempt not to improve discourse online, but to quash the free exchange of ideas.
Ryan's plummet from the top of the political world into popular obscurity as he leaves government for what he says will be the last time marks one of the most historic collapses of a major figure in the history Republican Party. First elected to represent Wisconsin's first congressional district in 1999, Ryan raced to the top of the GOP conference in the House, quickly becoming a star in grassroots GOP circles and known for the perception that he was somehow a budget whiz.
Brokaw also told Bannon that Nancy Reagan's influence on her husband may have contributed to his administration's foreign policy successes:
Datafolha's poll, the first since both Lula's second conviction and the entry of former president Fernando Collor de Mello into the race, revealed shocking levels of comfort with corruption in government. Lula remains the front-runner in the race, for example, despite 80 percent of respondents saying that they believe Lula was aware of Operation Car Wash while in office. More than half of those polled said they wanted to see Lula in prison.
For a while, it looked as though the Know Nothing, anti-immigrant party was on track to become the second major party in America, in opposition to Democrats. This party, which thrived alongside the organization of various secret societies, was ultimately defeated by the Republicans, who outmaneuvered and subverted them. The Republican Party ultimately prevailed because its leaders stood on principle, regardless of temporary popularity. The Know Nothings disappeared nearly as fast as they shot to power.

His lower migration, higher wages policy is bitterly opposed by investors, nearly every business lobby, most Democrats, and many Republicans. Their opposition killed Trump's 2018 plan to cut legal immigration by roughly 50 percent.

The sanctions would be part of a multi-pronged approach of increased economic and diplomatic pressure – especially on Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with North Korea – plus beefed-up defenses by the United States and its South Korean and Japanese allies, according to the administration official familiar with the deliberations, Reuters adds.
When President Reagan implemented the strategy that won the Cold War, he was opposed by the entire media, as well as foreign policy experts in both parties.
Fourth, Pelosi and Schumer failed to bring out their best argument: the supposed cruelty of the family separation policy. The images of children in cages provoked national outrage last summer, and brought the administration to its lowest point. Somehow they failed to bring out that point, which would at least have provided a contrary image to the victims that Trump described. Perhaps they were afraid it would support his claim of a crisis at the border.

Like other rogue states and human rights abusers around the world, Cuba's state media covered the violence as indicative of the decline of the United States in its entirety. Granma claimed the incident was the gravest in the history of the [Capitol] building, symbol of American power, since the British, on August 24, 1814, burned it down along with the White House and other government institutions.

Although the price crash benefits consumers in the short-term, with average annual household spending on gasoline falling almost 21 percent between 2011 and 2015, the U.S. shale industry has struggled. Since January 2015, more than 220 oil companies have gone bankrupt, taking 150,000 jobs with them and nudging parts of the country that benefited from the oil boom back toward recession.
A better proposal comes from Chinese Cardinal Joseph Zen, who sees firsthand all the problems that the underground Church has, Cervellera said. Zen recommends waiting for a deal where we ask China for more.
Dr Zenz said that between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates fell by 84 per cent in the two largest Uyghur Muslim prefectures, with birth rates continuing to fall. He said that in 2020, one Uyghur region saw an unprecedented near-zero population growth.

Armed with the false 1 in 5 statistic, however, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement its policy.
It was the Fed's third consecutive rate increase, signaling a definitive end to the Fed's nine-year old economic stimulus scheme. The move indicates the Fed's confidence in the stability of the economy, although it does not necessarily indicate that the Fed is attempting to slow economic growth. Monetary policy makers believe that low rates support economic growth by lowering the cost of borrowing for businesses, homebuyers and consumers; raising rates is believed to reduce central bank support for the economy.
Missionary Father Bernardo Cervellera says that the Vatican is yielding way too much in its forthcoming diplomatic deal with the ruling Communist Party in China, which risks being limp.
Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported the spike in Cubans heading for Texas appears to be a direct result of the President's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Castro-lead government in Cuba. Cubans fear the special adjustment in immigration afforded to them under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 may soon come to an end and they would then be treated like any other illegal alien.

After Watts' 2014 revelations, the U.S. Office of the Inspector General issued a scathing report, almost entirely ignored by the media, that found lack of oversight, non-compliance, and a lax review process for the climate recording network led it to conclude program data cannot be consistently relied upon by decision-makers. In a panic, during the investigative process that resulted in the Inspector General's report, NOAA closed approximately 600 of its most problematic weather stations.

President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to undo the Trump policies and revert to Obama's thaw towards Cuba.
From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this split could be significant as the first signs of a new internal rebellion, for which China is overdue. China's history is filled with huge, massive internal rebellions (civil wars), the most recent of which were the White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1805), the Taiping Rebellion (1850-64) and Mao's Communist Revolution (1934-49). The leaders of China's Communist Party (CCP) are well aware of this history, and they are aware that a new internal rebellion is now due, and probably overdue.
The City Council's big selling point to voters for the tax increase was the Oakland City Auditor's Impartial Analysis of Measure HH'that promised soda tax revenues would be managed by a nine-member 'Community Advisory Board comprised of medical, dental and School District parents to determine how and to what extent the City Council should establish and fund programs to prevent or reduce the health consequences of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages in Oakland.
Ryan's speakership was built on a lie, a broken promise he made to the American people and to the members of the GOP conference: Specifically, he promised he would not run for Speaker without the official endorsement of the Tuesday Group, the Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus.

In an email blast, Demand Justice asks supporters for $5 to eventually challenge any proposed barrier in the court system:
To be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a State must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether §20–18–401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go. The statute in ques- tion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Oberge- fell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders. In an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state supreme court agreed. And it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the Constitution. To the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this Court's prec- edents suggest just the opposite conclusion.

Three times Johnson attempted to call a general election so the people could break the impasse — and three times MPs refused to grant one, fearing the verdict of an angry public on their shenanigans. Once, they would not have been able to do so, with the power to call elections being, like the power to prorogue, an executive prerogative — but David Cameron and his Lib Dem cohort Nick Clegg had made early elections conditional on two-thirds of MPs backing one.

It was a simple and relevant question:
In recent years, China-US relations have run into unprecedented difficulties. Fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of US policymakers about China. Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy based on this misperception is simply wrong. What has happened proves that the US attempt to suppress China and start a new Cold War has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. Such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail. China-US relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening. We hope that the next US administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation.
The USCIS regulatory change that has yet to be implemented would narrow the definition of specialty occupations, keeping big business and outsourcing firms from importing cheaper foreign workers for high-paying, white-collar jobs that American citizens could do. Additionally, the change would increase the annual wage requirement for the foreign imports, driving up wages for Americans in the process.
The survey showed only 12 percent viewed Ryan favorably, while a supermajority of 71 percent viewed him unfavorably and 17 percent were unsure.
Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
Encouraged by her lawyers from the ACLU, G.G. demanded the school allow her to use the boys' bathrooms and locker rooms at the same time that biological males are using those facilities.

And by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.

We have vetted $800 million to address enhanced medical support, transportation, and consumable supplies … we believe that increasing that by $631 million over the '19 level would meet the need of providing the kind of non-intrusive technology to allow us to get at — and not just narcotics, but also, most especially, about human trafficking issues at the border.
There will be a thorough, thorough investigation of who is responsible and whether or not their responsibility is criminal, and if that is the [conclusion], the Attorney General will make that judgment, Biden continued.
We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind at Walmart. We serve more than 140 million customers weekly, crossing all demographics, and are focused on meeting their needs while providing the best shopping experience at each store.

The Fed's move came after several disappointing data points appeared to indicate that the economy may be softening and hoped for tax cuts may be delayed longer than expected. Job creation in May came in lower than expected, at just 138.000 jobs. Retail sales in May fell 1.6 percent from the prior month, the biggest decline in 16 months. Economists had expected sales to increase in May, following a 0.4 percent increase in April.

DeLisle observed that China moved swiftly and aggressively to isolate Taiwan as Chinese economic power and diplomatic influence grew over the past few years. Taiwanese resistance has fared best at economic organizations since the island nation punches so far above its weight in such matters.
In Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week that there is evidence that the Chinese virus is a military attack by unspecified enemies, but did not divulge any of the alleged evidence. Iranian military officials similarly claimed that the outbreak was a biological attack, specifically implicating the United States and Zionists for its creation.
He said one of the reasons China is so eager to checkmate Taiwan's attempts to join international bodies is that membership in such organizations is one of the recognized criteria for independent statehood. The more groups Beijing successfully blackballs Taipei from joining, the easier it is for China to deny Taiwan formal recognition as an independent state.
According to the report, President Trump wants plans on his desk before his scheduled summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April. The State Department has been quietly informing China that expanded sanctions against banks that do business with Pyongyang would hit a large number of Chinese financial institutions.

Ryan's highest favorability, 48%, was in the wake of the 2016 election when his Republican Party swept both houses of Congress and the presidency. Ryan announced last April that he would not seek re-election to the House, Gallup wrote of its findings. His latest 34% favorable rating is the lowest of his speakership and below his overall historical average of 39%. It has fallen six percentage points since June 2018, including a 12-point drop among Republicans.

The Republican Party more closely aligns with my beliefs in a less interventionist government. Democratic Party policies can be too costly and restrictive on citizens. Lowering regulations helps protect people's individual rights with private property, business and investments. Increasing taxes and creating or adding to government agencies are not a guaranteed solution to any problem.
Of course, inevitably, Pompeo will be dealing with leaders, and with regimes, that don't meet the standards of our national ideals.
To see how extraordinary it is we're even considering it, ask the question in reverse: would China let a British company build the critical national infrastructure that controls every other system? — Tom Tugendhat (@TomTugendhat) January 27, 2020
I think that's true. She was, she didn't let this on to him, but she was terrified whenever he went out, because she saw just how vulnerable he was, even with all that protection. He was such an important part of her life from a personal point of view. She was very anxious about it. But they got through it. She didn't show that anxiety to the public, and she was greatly relieved when he was able to leave office on his own two feet, as it were. And then, of course, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and wrote that very, very touching letter to the American people, hand written, and then she went on to live with him in that condition. He had to have her at his side, at night, for example, or he would get agitated, and she was there, and never complained. I had quite a strong personal relationship with her by then, and I would not bring that up, and she would not… there was never a hint of a complaint from her about the life she had been reduced to. A lot of her friends were gone by then, so she didn't have a very active social life. She had a harder time getting around. She had friends in New York. She would come here from time to time, but then she lost most of them. She was a very brave woman through it all.

The companies' demand to hire the best foreign graduates is belied by their mass hiring of lower-skill and mid-tier foreign graduates, said the U.S. professional. If the best-ranked foreign graduates are really that good, they can meet the O-1 requirements, he said, adding they are not the best and brightest … [because companies] want the indentured workforce and the cheap labor.

Well, you just look at the numbers. There are 8-9 million people who are on the exchange currently. I'm not sure how they are going to get 14 million people uninsured, if that's what they say, with only eight million people on the exchange. They are individuals, I guess that they assume that are on Medicaid who aren't paying anything in the Medicaid system who are not going to take the Medicaid policy just because the mandate ended or something happened. It's just not believable is what we would suggest. We'll look at the numbers and see.
The Oakland City Council's own December 2014 minimum wage staff report highlighted that that there was no legislative solution to address the annual wage-cost impact from thousands of unionized city recreational aides, senior aides and part-time student trainees jumping in cost by 35 percent from $18,155 to $24,500 per year. The city's SEIU contract also requires equivalent higher contributions for sick leave and pension benefits.
Former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino explained in his videos about various abortion procedures that mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, which the mother's body produces to nourish the pregnancy. When progesterone is blocked, the lining of the mother's uterus deteriorates, and blood and nourishment are cut off to the developing baby, who then dies inside the mother's womb.

Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?

The president on Tuesday will conclude his whirlwind visit to India with a day in the capital, complete with a gala dinner meetings with Modi over stalled trade talks between the two nations.The two nations are closely allied, in part to act as a bulwark against the rising influence of nearby China, but trade tensions between the two countries have escalated since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from India.India responded with higher penalties on agricultural goods and restrictions on U.S. medical devices. The U.S. retaliated by removing India from a decades-old preferential trade program.
Under Article VI of the United States Constitution, all treaties made shall be the supreme Law of the Land. Therefore, ratification of the UNCRC will make the document binding under American law and it would supersede any relevant, existing federal or state laws. This will also ultimately limit United States sovereignty by placing American family law and parental rights under international regulation and scrutiny.

In January 2015, a video circulated depicting an M1 flying the flag of Kataib Hezbollah, which the United States has labeled a terrorist group. A second video from February 2016 showed an M1 flying the flag of Kataib Sayyid Al Shuhada, another militia with ties to Iran. In February 2018, the U.S. military and State Department finally admitted that pro-Iran forces were operating M1s.

We're trying to avoid conflict in the world. We're trying to protect our interest without hostilities. But you have to do that from a position of strength, Bolton explained. You've got to start with political leadership, then you've got to follow it up with some very extensive programs to re-furbish the military. That's going to cost money. Nobody better blink at that.
Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.

Wang claimed China was able to build a strong defense against the virus at our borders without mentioning Beijing's implacable opposition to other nations defending themselves against the virus during the crucial months of spread in the late winter of 2020. Instead, he credited China with helping to erect an international bulwark against the coronavirus and said his government has made more friends in the world during the pandemic it unleashed.
However, most of the Russians quoted in the article said the Flynn resignation was relatively unimportant, and what concerned them was the possibility that Trump would prove to be as erratic as his predecessor. The Russians mostly use erratic as code for linking issues they believe should be completely unrelated, such as their conduct in Syria linked with U.S. arms control negotiations.

Rouhani is trying to reassert control and tamp down public unrest with a new budget that spends more on domestic priorities, but he could easily have done that during the Obama years when lucrative foreign deals and literal pallets of cash were falling into his lap. If Tehran is truly changing and turning its focus inward, it is only because the crushing effect of sanctions forced a major re-evaluation of policy. There is little evidence that any sort of political liberalization flowed from the nuclear deal boom and a great deal of evidence to the contrary.
Datafolha's poll, the first since both Lula's second conviction and the entry of former president Fernando Collor de Mello into the race, revealed shocking levels of comfort with corruption in government.

Serving as chief ideologist, he is believed to have played an integral part in shaping the Maoist regime's radical thinking. Prosecutors say Nuon Chea was one of a small group behind policies that drove city residents into forced labour and starvation in the countryside, and used systematic violence against perceived enemies of the regime. …. During his time in office, Khieu Samphan was the public face of regime and accompanied overseas diplomats on official visits. Like Nuon Chea, he is accused of helping sculpt some of the regime's deadliest policies as one of its top leaders. He publicly endorsed taking measures against the enemies of the revolution in a way that suggests knowledge and support of the policy of executing purported enemy agents, Stephen Heder and Brian Tittemore wrote in their book, Seven Candidates for Prosecution.

If it is an HF [high-frequency or over-the-horizon] radar, then it would enormously boost China's capacity to monitor ships and aircraft in the South China Sea. Cuarteron is the logical place for such an installation because it is the southernmost of China's features in the Spratlys, meaning that it would be the best place if you wanted early warning radar to give notice of ships or planes coming up from the Strait of Malacca and other areas to the south such as Singapore. This would be very important in a Chinese anti-access area denial strategy that sought to reduce the ability of the U.S. to operate freely in the South China Sea, including bringing forces up through the South China Sea in case of any future crisis in Northeast Asia.

This was a colossal failure of the Democratic House, first and foremost, Sessions said. This was nowhere close to an impeachment. I've been saying that for weeks. It's not an offense. It's nowhere close to being an impeachable offense. They should not have done this. They have abused the great impeachment article in the Constitution more than it's ever been abused in its history and they deserve to be criticized for it. It's become more and more clear, I think, to the American people as time went on that this is not—the evidence did not justify removal from office. It's nowhere close to what's required. I'm glad the Republicans said listen and went through a process, but they're correct to bring this to a close. It's just not there. I thought Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz made the case in a compelling fashion.

If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment — or mine — to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.
When Iran's Revolutionary Guards seized two American naval craft in the Gulf on Tuesday evening [January 13, 2016], with ten American sailors on board, it was not the sailors who were the important point, but the fact that the Revolutionary Guards effectively kidnapped U.S. President Barack Obama [himself only] a few hours before he was to deliver his final State of the Union address, towards the end of his second term in office.

The announcement today underscores the need for Congress to significantly reform Section 702. While the NSA's policy change will curb some of the most egregious abuses under the statute, it is at best a partial fix.

The Obama administration is celebrating the exchange as a confirmation of its foreign policy. The Washington Post, overjoyed at the return of its reporter, Jason Rezaian, agrees, saying that the U.S. and Iran had moved into a new era of international relations.

The scorecard for implementing the 2017 strategic framework over the following three years is far from perfect, especially after the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, which China ruthlessly exploited to overturn many of the policy goals outlined in the NSC document. As 2020 drew to a close, China was aggressively using the pandemic and its disruptions to argue for the superiority of its authoritarian system and command economy, the exact opposite of how the framework authors hoped the world's new struggle against authoritarianism would be faring at the end of Trump's term.

These and other, less headline-grabbing downsides of the deal have elicited little objection, however. A tired public do indeed seem to want Brexit to be done, and are willing to accept spin they would never have entertained from Theresa May — or are willing to believe that the humiliating concessions on Northern Ireland, fishing, and so on, are only temporary.
Instead of speaking of a united France as he did last year, Macron attacked his detractors, who have taken to the streets in weekly protests over two months to demand his resignation. While the protests have at times turned violent, the rebels have enjoyed the broad support of the French public — unlike their increasingly unpopular President.
Residents of the town have been evicted, threatened with violence, and it was the site of the arrest of the former head of the French Foreign Legion General Piquemal who participated in a PEGIDA march against the current migrant policy of the French government. Visitors to the Jungle camp, including journalists, are routinely attacked as two Dutch filmmakers recently found out. Even a Shakespeare play, put on for the migrants by left-wing activists, was stopped early due to the activities of knife-wielding migrants.

One student, Yale junior Natalie Schultz-Henry, argued that co-ed fraternities would better teach Yale students how to work with gender diverse peers after college.
You can't overstate how important this this [sic] race is, Hurt said. I understand people who are so profoundly frustrated with the election officials in Georgia and and the whole process. … [Conservatives'] lives don't revolve around politics in Washington. … Their lives revolve around things that all those things are supposed to be in service of, which is their family, their job, their worship, their kids, their neighbors, their AR-15s. That's what what life is actually about [for] these people.
The incoming administration should mobilise partners to fund the UN COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP), designed to coordinate health and economic action in vulnerable countries, the op-ed states. So far, the UN has received only 40% of the US$9.5 billion GHRP goal for 2020.
Pompeo said he discussed Iranian support for extremism with the king and MBS, positioning an independent Iraq as an important check against Iran's regional ambitions:
At the time, President Trump's team claimed that his comment, when the looting starts, the shooting starts, was merely a reflection that violence often follows theft. Twitter said the tweet glorified violence and censored it.
Stoltenberg said: We will try to do whatever we can to find a way to solve this issue because it's one of the issues that has created problems inside the alliance. There's no way to deny that.
We are re-evaluating our political giving policies through the Gridiron PAC, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the AP.
Remittances sent from the United States prop up households, provide stability to national economies, and spur consumption. Migration has provided some ambitious Central Americans with an escape from poverty. But it has also enabled elites, who see no need to slow migration, as it is a status quo which works for them—and they are content to keep it intact. As a Guatemalan think tank analyst said ruefully after President Trump demanded Guatemala sign an asylum cooperation agreement: We continue doing everything except taking responsibility. …We're not the victims and we need to assume our responsibilities because the United States is no longer going to cover the cost of Guatemala's shortcomings.
Part of the reason why Democrats like Jones are going through with this, Sessions said, is because of how effective President Trump has been on his agenda. Sessions, whose interview came before Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night, said the president's speech would be a positive message for America.
Trump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the American worker. The president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. It also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.
On Breitbart News Sunday, host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon interviewed James Rosebush, the Deputy Assistant to President Reagan and Chief of Staff to First Lady Nancy Reagan.

As for the future of Israel, he noted that, in the past decade or so, there's been a total breakdown of the capacity of human beings to live alongside one another. But in the Middle East, it's happened before and it's been put right before, and there have been new moments of hope. So that's our prayer. And that's what we have to take responsibility for leading.
The Americans weren't interested in the Yemeni war in the first place, but since they were so adamant to move ahead with the Iranian nuclear deal they lent their support to the Saudis to minimize Tehran's reach in the region, he said. That policy drove two opponents of Al-Qaeda against each other, which was exploited by the group to assassinate government officials and consolidate its foothold around the capital Aden, as well as key regions like Taaz, Hadramout, and others.
According to NBC News, Pompeo met with the Saudi royals separately, spending 35 minutes with the king and 45 with the crown prince, who is the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia on most policy issues.

Business-first Republican advocates want the president to trade away his Hire American policy to get border wall funding, while pro-American advocates say he can win by trading concessions in healthcare, trade, and infrastructure.
A large group of NeverTrump investors and cheap labor CEO donors are promising to go on strike until House Speaker Paul Ryan schedules passage of a cheap labor amnesty for June 25. The bipartisan group, which is titled the American Business Immigration Council, is led by Mike Fernandez, a healthcare executive in Florida. He wants Ryan to keep the House in session on June 25 so the alliance of 193 Democrats and 25-plus cheap labor Republicans can pass a discharge petition amnesty through the House — despite many polls showing any amnesty is very unpopular among GOP voters.
O'Keefe also accuses the mainstream media of being a bunch of prostitutes.
All told, more than three million people from Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala have moved into the United States, not counting the almost 1 million migrants who were counted crossing in 2019. Only half of the 3.5 million migrants who entered from 2014 to 2019 have been sent home.

The Chronicle claimed migrants have a right to enter American's homeland even if they need Americans to pay for their healthcare, and suggested that President-elect Joe Biden would probably reverse Trump's move:
It is also a system replete with ironies. The state that gave Ronald Reagan to America, and with him a new brand of unapologetic conservatism, is one in which the survival of the population depends on massive investments in infrastructure — albeit paid for, ultimately, by water users themselves.
If your strategy consists of releasing you into the interior of the United States once you've illegally entered and have been apprehended, protecting you from local deportation, and providing substantial rewards such as free health care, you have just created a complete system of incentives. Who wouldn't try to enter with Release, Protect, and Reward being the new open border strategy?

The poll finds a plurality of Democrats, Republicans and Independents likely to vote in the state's March 3, 2020 primary election in agreement that homelessness is the most important issue for Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers to work on in 2020. Twenty-one percent of Democrats and Independents called it the top issue, compared to 29 percent of Republicans. Housing affordability and the environment were the next highest priorities for likely Democratic primary voters, while Republicans were more concerned about immigration and taxes.
State legislators across the country are pondering education savings account measures in the wake of a split decision by the Nevada Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of that state's program, while killing the funding source, Watchdog.org reported in October 2016. Lawmakers in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are considering their own ESA programs.
Also, the federal government rarely enforces routine workplace laws in H-1B workplaces. The government's refusal to enforce the laws means the H-1Bs can be hired, fired, and abused by their bosses, most of whom are Indians who grew up in Indians' own culture. These abuses include workplace intimidation, sexual discrimination, and unpaid overtime hours, Americans tell Breitbart News.
Republicans have all pledged that people with preexisting conditions will have their insurance protected, he said, but for that to happen, we have to hold the Senate. We have to get the House. We have to, obviously, keep the White House.

Australia's ABC notes the cover also contained images of the funerals of 'martyrs' killed in the military clashes with Kurdish rebels in the south-east, which some suggest is a sign of support for attacks against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terror group. The newspaper also uses a favorable photo of Erdogan attending a pro-woman's event, holding hands with an elderly woman.
The plan would cut poorer and working-class Americans completely out of the U.S. labor force by replacing them with foreign workers.
But Sessions isn't using his leadership of the DOJ simply to make the immigration court system more efficient. He's using the full extent of his power as attorney general to reduce the likelihood that a case gets resolved (quickly or otherwise) in an immigrant's favor — removing tools and resources that make courts more efficient but improve immigrants' odds of winning their cases, while pressuring immigration judges to plow through cases at an unheard-of rate. He's removing the safety valves from the pipeline while increasing the pressure.

The letter to the Telegraph could have been lifted directly from the same book.
The federal government should consider prosecuting state and local officials who implement and enforce sanctuary policies violative of federal law, said Vaughan.

Strzok replies to Kortan, I know, I was getting increasingly irritated at Gowdy last night. I don't know the basis for him saying that. We certainly asked her.

Last year, Szijjártó told Breitbart News that Hungary disagrees with the European Union policy of getting rid of national identity and Christian culture.
The [progressives'] goal is increasing the number of people moving here. If that means that it has to be done in a way that is inconvenient and sometimes even cruel for the migrants, that's okay because the objective is increased immigration at essentially any cost — even the cost to the migrants themselves.
Citing the results of a DNA test, the Arkansas judge hearing the paternity and child support case ruled in January that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is the biological and legal father of Roberts' child.
Words just can't express how disappointed I am with this ruling. We are reviewing the Court's opinion to determine any additional steps that need to be taken. We will continue to follow the law as provided to us by the courts in this matter and we will rise to the challenge of keeping Travis County safe, although our ability to overcome fear and foster cooperation within the immigrant community is a greater challenge now.
The Department's regulations recognizing the male/female biological binary [in athletics] carry extra weight and interpretative authority because they were the product of uniquely robust and direct Congressional review, says the January 8 memo, titled Memorandum for Kimberly M. Richey.
No, I don't know how these conversations go, and that is highly offensive, so you should tell us all who it is, Conway shot back.
Turkey insists the PYD and YPG are actively allied with the PKK and are essentially branches of the same Kurdish separatist organization. Turkey's looming strategic nightmare involves Kurds in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey joining together to declare an independent state that would absorb territory from all three nations. Turkey complains that weapons given by Western allies to the YPG to fight ISIS are finding their way across the border into PKK hands.

Angelica Kitchen, long a staple of the East Village, closed their doors after 40 years of operation in response to the increased cost of labor mandated by the new wage policy. I felt like I was being regulated in a way that took certain choices away from me that I felt belonged to me, rightfully, as a business owner, owner Leslie McEachern said. I'm not trying to undercut or underpay anybody, but I also don't know what's coming down the pike.
On either grounds, I think that it would be necessary for the country, not just for the Trump presidency but for the country, to have leaders in both the House and the Senate who want to ensure that the president's projects, the president's agenda, the president's promises to the American people – which I think were momentous, not just for health care reform but in so many other respects, including the return to the prospect of peace through strength, which if course is near and dear to my heart, and I think yours Raheem – is going to be a necessary condition going forward, he argued.
The President had initially exempted the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland from the ban, as neither are in Schengen, but both have since been added to the ban.

Much of the inflow comes from the process known as chain migration, whereby newly arrived naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S., so Trump could drive up wages rather quickly for American workers by ending the category; ending the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which imports about 55,000 random foreign nationals every year; and implementing mandatory nationwide E-Verify to cut down on foreign competition in the U.S. labor market.

Sky News interviewed a 27-year-old who has been living as a man since she was a teenager:
The big reason that the City of Oakland is willing to anger voters is that the union wage and pension costs from the city council's July 2014 passage of a $15 minimum wage are jumping. With the latest spike to $12.86 an hour on January 1, the mayor and her 5 council allies are desperate to find new cash.

Definitely they haven't abandoned their intent to create a caliphate in Southeast Asia, warned Col. Romeo Brawner of Joint Task Force Marawi.

Panelist will argue free speech is the indispensable tool in confronting jihad and Islamic shariah law. Author and historian Lars Hedegaard of Denmark founded the Danish Free Press Society and International Free Press Society, and has been a fierce critic of the encroachment of shariah law on freedom of expression in the West. He has faced persecution by his own government and survived an assassination attempt in 2013. The UK's Paul Weston leads the Liberty GB party, and is a strong voice against creeping sharia in his homeland. In 2014, he was arrested on suspicion of racial harrassment after quoting verbatim a passage about Islam written by Winston Churchill. CSP Executive Vice President Jim Hanson will outline a new initiative against these and related threats, the Counterjihad Campaign.

Senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations Elliott Abrams said on a conference call organized by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA),
Before he [gives up] on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.
It goes without saying that if neighbouring states such as the United Kingdom spend too long continuing to avoid these containment measures, then we would have difficulty accepting British nationals who would move freely in their own country and then come to our country, Philippe said.

Jones on Wednesday, hours before the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote to acquit President Trump on both Articles of Impeachment adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives after a weeks-long Senate trial, revealed that he intends to vote to convict President Trump on both counts. Jones's votes will fail, as the U.S. Senate has well more than enough votes to acquit President Trump, but the fact that he has decided to align himself with the leftists who have taken over the Democrat Party has people like Sessions alarmed on behalf of the state of Alabama.

Amnesty International reported that the kingdom also issued an eight-year travel ban for Alaa Brinji and fined him 50,000 riyals ($13,300).
To counter our reliance on this opaque oil market, we must develop a range of policy responses. First, we must develop more resources here at home. Second, we must modernize our fuel efficiency standards to maximize the benefits from the oil we use. Third, we must encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles running on diverse sources of domestic energy, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen. Finally, we must have an honest assessment of our ability to respond to OPEC's actions to influence oil prices.
While discussing the promise that premiums would go down, Pence referenced a report that revealed premiums have instead skyrocketed under Obamacare — more than doubling for the average American.
The real danger is not so much a schism in the Chinese Church, Cervellera said, since the underground bishops are faithful to Rome and will obey.
Syria's Prime Minister Imad Khamis was also leading a high-level delegation to Iran, which includes the defense and foreign ministers.

The primary responsibility of the federal government is the defense of our nation, which includes strong border security, said Sen. Rounds. The WALL Act pays for the wall by closing existing loopholes that allow illegal immigrants to receive federal benefits and increasing fines for illegal border crossings and visa overstays, he added. By funding the wall through increased fines, we prevent any risk of dipping into Department of Defense (DoD) funding, which is already stretched thin.
Still, these big declines are just minor corrections in the scope of things, Dalio wrote. There is a lot of cash on the side to buy on the break, and what comes next will be most important.

Making the speech in New York City was a risky move for Lincoln, as it was a stronghold of his chief rival for the GOP nomination, William H. Seward. At that point in the race, Lincoln was a heavy underdog to lead the surging and strengthening Republican Party. But his lengthy speech defending the Constitution, the union, and the vision of the Founding Fathers catapulted him to victory in the most contentious election in American history.
Birth rates are only part of the demographic puzzle. Russia suffers from persistent life expectancy problems, particularly among male heavy drinkers, and occasional mortality spikes nobody can figure out. Healthy birth rates can go a long way toward offsetting high mortality rates in a population and, conversely, long life expectancy does not help to sustain a population if the birth rate falls far enough.

On social media, El Nacional shares not only recipes for food and household products, but seeks out individuals who possess basic drugs that families cannot find on the market. A typical El Nacional medical tweet will read like this:
Trump said he had a change of heart after being told by a general that the strikes would cause up to 150 Iranian casualties.
A Senate committee is to decide on lifting his immunity for forcing the charity rescue vessel Open Arms to remain at sea for days off the coast of Lampedusa in August last year.

Herbert Nixon Flores, a 46-year-old illegal alien MS-13 gang member from El Salvador, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Irving, Texas, after he appeared to murder his ex-girlfriend, 35-year-old Karen Ruiz, in front of her three-year-old daughter outside of her babysitter's home.
Trump responded to the riot with a video in which he told the rioters, we love you, you're very special and that he felt their pain. Go home, he added.
The meeting came as anti-Maduro protests raged in Venezuela. Food and medicine are also scarce while inflation is believed to be in the triple digits following four years of recession, fueled by failing socialist economic policies and the decline in global oil prices.
Obama foreign policy has left the United States with little choice but to make dirty deals across the Middle East, supporting many supposedly lesser evils to assemble a coalition capable of fighting the greater evil of ISIS on the ground. The Christians of Iraq, Syria, and Iran are collateral damage this Administration and its supporters would prefer not to discuss, not even when ethnic cleansing comes to the upscale suburbs of Baghdad.
In a stunning appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher in November, Weiss insisted that Jews who support Trump because they like his policies on Israel and the Middle East are betraying the values that have sustained the Jewish people.
Despite Obama having said he would be willing to meet with the NRA in his town hall, Cox dismissed that possibility.
He also referenced the 1.9 million Americans that signed up for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, but have not followed through on paying their premiums. This figure comes from a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report released on Monday, detailing the 10.3 million who have paid their premiums as of March 15, out of the 12.2 million who have signed up.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

They said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it's exactly what they've done, she explained. I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they've hired.
Video emerged recently, which showed two black men getting arrested in a Starbucks. A white patron can be seen, and heard, sarcastically questioning police over why they were taking the men into custody:
No one above an elementary school education can deny that it is mathematically impossible to pay down our current debt bubble with sound currency or without using questionable accounting methods. The world's financial system has crossed the Rubicon in its ability to fix this problem without all future growth and productivity gains being consumed by interest rate expenses.
The former VP's son worked for Burisma between 2014 and 2019 despite the conflict of interest and corruption concerns raised by individuals from inside and outside the Obama administration.

Without that mandate to buy coverage, wouldn't you concede there will be millions of uninsured? a reporter asked.
We have received and maintained too much. Now is the time for legality, security and push-backs, he concluded in remarks reported by ANSA.
Cotton said, It's not enough, and it's certainly too late. Vladimir Putin is KGB. He always has been, he always will be. President Obama has consistently looked the other way from Russia's provocations and aggression. The DNC hack last year was just one minor item in what Russia has done over the last eight years, to include things like invading and occupying Crimea and supporting rebels in Eastern Ukraine as well as threatening NATO air ships — aircraft and ships and so forth.
The Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham, which became state-funded in 2001, was put into special measures last summer after the pro-rape texts were found in the institution's library and a child died from an allergic reaction.
Washington's Top News reports that advertisements for former Breitbart Senior Editor MILO's new book DANGEROUS have been banned from being displayed in Metro subway stations and cars across Washington, DC. Metro reportedly determined that the advertisement – which features an image of MILO with a quote that reads THE KANYE WEST OF JOURNALISM – violated their policies which ban issue-oriented, political, and other advocacy related advertising. The ads were posted this week and have now been removed, according to Metro.
Wang was comparably shameless in praising China for swiftly reporting coronavirus cases to the world — the exact opposite of the Communist Party's deadly campaign of secrecy and its vicious oppression of heroic whistleblowers.
Shirley said that long-time Reagan aide Mike Deaver claimed if it wasn't for Nancy Reagan, Reagan would have never been Governor of California, never would have been president of the United States. She really was his helpmate, his soul mate, his best friend.
The notion that women are somehow unable to obtain contraception with the new rule in place is, however, fake news. Taxpayer funds that would go to abortion facilities that refuse to abide by the new regulations – and some may choose not to – are slated to go to other federally qualified health centers that do not perform abortions and that provide more comprehensive health care. Any individual who would have chosen a Title X abortion facility for regular health care and family planning services can find another center at getyourcare.org.
Barbour said the consequences of Republican losses in both contests could impact the judiciary and policy profoundly.
In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, Bulgarians from 19 localities in Albania asked Sofia to defend their rights in what was then an Italian protectorate, according to the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad.
Brill believes this explains the elite surprise that a supposedly long-settled issue like the North American Free Trade Agreement could return to the forefront.
Breitbart Texas managing director Brandon Darby will discuss Mexican drug cartel violence and recently-discovered mass graves live from the scene.
Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden, Morey told the Florence Morning News. Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.
DeLisle bluntly stated that China is able to keep Taiwan out of some important international bodies simply because citizens of the People's Republic of China happen to occupy the chairman's office at the moment. A paramount example of China commandeering important international organizations by filling the top seat is, unfortunately, Interpol.
McConnell said during his floor speech that he originally emphasized four urgent priorities for Senate legislation to help the nation get through the crisis. Those included direct financial assistance to the American people, aid to small businesses to keep paychecks flowing, and measures to both stabilize key industries to prevent mass layoffs and flood more recourses into the frontline healthcare battle itself.
Honestly, I think almost everyone in the system knows that most of the [migrant] teens are coming to work and send money back home, said Maria Woltjen, executive director and founder of the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, a national organization that advocates for immigrant children in court. They want to help their parents. But whether they stayed in a shelter in Florida or California or Illinois, the teens heard similar warnings from the staff: They had to enroll in school and stay out of trouble. The immigration judges who would decide their cases, they were told, didn't want to hear that they were working. They would ask you: 'Who are you going to live with? Is he going to support you financially?' said one 19-year-old who spent nearly six months at a shelter in New York before a family friend in Bensenville agreed to take him in. And you say yes. 'Are they going to be responsible for you?' And you say yes. 'Are they going to take you to school?' And you say yes.
Yet the question, always, is, Compared to what? That is, what's the plausible alternative to el-Sisi and his heavy-handed ways? It's worth recalling that el-Sisi, while no democrat, is a vast improvement over what came before—namely, the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, the Brotherhood was so scary that back in 2013, when el-Sisi seized power, even the Obama administration praised the move.
In fact, Syria's president Bashar al-Assad responded to Monday's peace announcement by saying that he would respect the truce, except that he reserved the right to attack terrorists:
Stephen Tennes, the owner of Country Mill Farms, has sold his fruit and vegetables at the East Lansing Farmer's Market for the past seven years. After city officials learned of his Christian belief that marriage is the union between one man and one woman, they invoked a non-discrimination policy to exclude him from being able to sell at the farmers' market.
Trump's failure to set curbs on the H-1B program has angered many of the swing-voting university graduates who supported him in 2016. In March 2016, after much zig-zagging, Trump declared:
On November 4, 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act which, according to The Weekly Standard, would enact [350.org founder Bill] McKibben's vision in toto. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced a companion bill in the House a few months later. But soon after, the #NoDAPL protests at Standing Rock—which were supposed to galvanize public support behind the Keep It in the Ground movement and usher in the dawn of the post-fossil fuel era—turned violent. Recognizing that extreme activism was not generating the public support they needed to upend U.S. energy policy, the leaders of the KIITG movement made a deliberate decision to change their tactics. Almost overnight, orchestrated militant actions were replaced with promises of guaranteed green jobs for all. Since then, Sanders and Rep. Huffman have abandoned the Keep It in the Ground campaign entirely and instead now publicly and enthusiastically endorse the Green New Deal.
We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind at Walmart. We serve more than 140 million customers weekly, crossing all demographics, and are focused on meeting their needs while providing the best shopping experience at each store. We're sensitive to this situation and also understand, like other retailers, that some products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics, and other personal care products are subject to additional security. Those determinations are made on a store-by-store basis using data supporting the need for the heightened measures. While we've yet to review a complaint, we take this situation seriously and look forward to addressing it with the court.
Analysts predicted continued oversupply from the astounding surge in U.S. production, reduced demand from the global economic slowdown, anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war, waivers granted to Iran's largest customers, the failure of the OPEC cartel to arrange a production slowdown, and possibly President Donald Trump's lobbying for lower oil prices will keep fuel relatively cheap in 2019.
The final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. DHS previously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on Nov. 2, 2020, and carefully considered the public comments received before deciding to publish the proposed regulations as a final rule.
Quigley said, The fact that Deutsche Bank was the only bank that would do business with the president before he was elected, was also the bank that laundered money for the Russians, the fact that the president slow-rolled out sanctions against the Russians, the fact that he would rather trust a foreign adversary, President Putin, over his entire intelligence community, he fired Sessions and Comey, there are no coincidences. I believe the president of the United States has been compromised. Whether he made all of these extraordinary policy decisions based on bad policy choices, or they were — he was compromised, must be the subject of the investigation.
Within the next few days, you can expect them to say they'll unleash a 'sea of fire' across the Korean Peninsula, he predicted. They've got a whole handbook of these phrases that they use. This is how they talk before – at least we think before – they have the capability to launch ICBMs that can hit the United States.
A Deliveroo spokesman told Sky News on Monday: Our riders are part of their local communities up and down the country and we know they will want to help support people, particularly the most vulnerable.
Congratulations to Qatar for the success of its brave resistance to pressure and extortion. To our other Arab neighbors: Iran is neither an enemy nor threat. Enough scapegoating, especially with your reckless patron on his way out. Time to take our offer for a strong region, tweeted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.
While investigations are underway to determine what went wrong, tenants said repeated complaints were ignored. Survivor Edward Daffarn said the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, or KCTMO, which manages the Grenfell Tower as well as other buildings in the area, is responsible because it ignored numerous warnings.
Tuesday on CNN's Newsroom, political analyst for the network and veteran reporter Carl Bernstein questioned if President Donald Trump was fit to be the President of the United States.

Gov. Cuomo retorted by lambasting the hospitals that have not administered their allotment.
Two are freshmen lawmakers — Crow a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Garcia a former judge in Houston. Demings is the former police chief of Orlando and Jeffries is a lawyer and member of party leadership. Lofgren has the rare credential of having worked on the congressional staff investigation of then-President Richard Nixon's impeachment — he resigned before the full House voted on the charges — and then being an elected lawmaker during Bill Clinton's.
They are now taking down the American flag in the capital and replacing it with a MAGA flag. Shoot. Them. All. — Vincent Frank (@VincentFrankNFL) January 6, 2021
Grayling is a close ally of the Prime Minister, having been the campaign manager for May during her successful campaign to become the leader of the Conservative party.
Strategic competition between the United States and China will persist, owing to the divergent nature and goals of international rules and norms to gain an advantage. China will circumvent international rules and norms to gain an advantage, the 2017 strategy framework warned.
And then there are the YPG Kurds fighting Sunnis north of Aleppo, driving tens of thousands to flee from their homes and head for the border with Turkey. Turkey considers the YPG Kurds, who are allies of al-Assad, to be linked to the PKK Kurds, who are internationally recognized terrorists, and therefore also terrorists. Turkey has been shelling YPG Kurd positions for over a week now, but wasn't a part of Monday's peace agreement announcement. So who's going to be the first to stop fighting: Turkey or the YPG Kurds? The answer is: Neither.
She had a very subtle touch behind the scenes, Brokaw told host Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News, on Monday morning's edition of Breitbart News Daily, heard daily on Sirius-XM's Patriot Channel 125.
There's a lack of diversity among venture capital and banking funders, said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, to Reuters. We looked for where we thought there was opportunity for our resources to do good things.
The statement backs up Trump's speech in the State of the Union speech, where he urged elimination of the visa lottery and chain migration programs, saying:

Trump said Friday he wasn't interested in further escalating the conflict, but warned the regime that his military advisers have already drawn up plans to retaliate should Iran attack.
I expect that barring some kind of surprise, I'll be voting in favor of hearing from witnesses after those opening arguments, Romney told reporters Monday.
The meeting was arranged with the Community of Sant'Egidio, a new mission in the Roman Catholic Church to combat human trafficking, according to the National Catholic Register, which notes that the U.S. embassy in Rome has been working with the Church on this issue.
Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.
And while the world's number two economy had been gradually losing steam over the first three quarters, growth held steady at 6.0 percent in October-December — the same as the previous quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
The first phase of the Fatah [Conquest] Operation has been launched at dawn to liberate Nineveh [province], raising the Iraqi flag in several villages, an Iraqi military statement read.
Their pleas come as rising salaries eat into corporate profits and stock values. In January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that salaries for information workers rose by 5.7 percent from December 2017 to December 2018. That rate was much higher than the 3.2 percent rise for all workers.

Joe Biden's plan to end a series of US cooperative asylum agreements with Central America will spur waves of illegal immigration to the southern border, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Chief Mark Morgan says. https://t.co/H3nPrd3z6P — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 30, 2020
The company argues that the consortium operating the Oresund Bridge, and which is partly owned by the Swedish government, was given special treatment because it was not required to help fund the measures.
Ingram also Tweeted a text message conversation he had about the incident with a friend.
Credentials matter not, but skin tone, womanhood, and claims of marginalized status do, Spector continued. [the program's directors] may believe in merit, but it is a twisted form of it, a pernicious theory that sees race, gender and identity as dictating qualification. In the eyes of genuine, concerned progressives, this is called prejudice. This is what it looks like to systematically devalue minorities, to reduce them to nothing but a plate on the diversity buffet.
With their endless racial, Russia, and Ukraine hoaxes, the fake news media are doing everything in their waning power to make us forget that, but the polls show people are waking up, are looking past these left-wing liars to appreciate the actual job the president has done both at home and abroad.
Little Julia Clerfe is not the only remarkable birth story of New Year's Day 2018. A set of twins was born at the Delano Regional Medical Center, just far enough apart to have their birthdays in different years. The first was a boy born in the last minutes of 2017; his sister would not arrive for another twenty minutes, just after the new year began.
In addition to banning the radical interpretation of Islam, a majority of French surveyed also supported deporting terrorists, too. Le Figaro reports 83 per cent supported deporting foreigners on French soil who have so-called 'S' (security) case files on them held by the security services — the French term demonstrating that an individual is considered a potentially dangerous radical by the French state.
I have to make it very clear the Falun Gong is an evil cult, then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the architect of the Tiananmen Square massacre, said in 2001.
We have no idea about platform manipulation, nor have we ever engaged in anything of the sort. We appealed a violation against 'abuse and harassment' which we assume is related to the Buzzfeed article.
The Tennessee law represents a growing movement by state legislatures to counter these trends in the public institutions over which they have authority. It represents perhaps the broadest combination so far passed into law of the different types of campus free speech protections being supported by advocates nationwide.
Paul was particularly critical of Abrams' devotion to nation-building, slamming the practice as both expensive and ineffective. He was concerned that Abrams would be a poor fit not only for Trump but for Secretary of State Tillerson as well, praising Tillerson for foreign policy realism he found utterly lacking in Abrams.
The SCMP quoted Chinese state media reports that 17 officials from Jinhu County have been put under investigation, sacked, or expelled from the Communist Party over the scandal. At the national level, a new Vaccine Management Law is under consideration that would allow citizens to sue pharmaceutical companies if death or serious illness results from faulty vaccines.
Highlighting earlier pledges from Democrats to impeach Trump as proof, McConnell also said that the December 18 vote was not some neutral judgment that Democrats came to with great reluctance.
Writing at CNN.com, Leon Aron, Director of Russian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, opined, Short of the tiger turning herbivore, Putin is not leaving Syria. To paraphrase Churchill, as far as Syria is concerned, Russia's involvement is not at an end, not even at the beginning of an end. It's just the end of the beginning.
Indian security forces fired tear gas at demonstrators on Thursday as they were protesting against the recent killings of 20 people, including separatist fighters and civilians by government troops in south Kashmir's Shopian district.

According to Reuters, the key figure in the Islamic State's Philippine comeback is an insurgent named Humam Abdul Najib, a.k.a. Abu Dar. Najib was able to slip out of Marawi after it was recaptured by Philippine forces in October with treasure stolen from banks, businesses, and residences in the city. Money was also raised by taking hostages for ransom. Some of the hostages report seeing militants use explosive devices to crack open bank vaults.
Those wages gains, though, risk being depleted this year. Also running the risk of being depleted is history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black Americans.
With compound health crises worldwide, UN humanitarian appeals face record shortfalls, the essay declares. The Biden administration could build on the tradition of US humanitarian leadership by funding at least 40% — the USA's share of high-income country gross national income — of UN and WFP appeals.
Then it is not so strange that it is the party sitting in the government that this anger is directed at, he added.
They are not partisan, but they want the policies in place that will help them succeed and grow their businesses, she added.
We took action last night to stop a war, Trump sad. We did not take action to start a war.

We continue to support all manner of fraternity and sorority life on our campus- whether they are all-male, all-female or co-ed. The criteria for who participates in their processes is up to their national organizations and local chapters, he said.
One reason Abe addressed the Diet on this subject is that laws allowing Japanese self-defense forces to protect Americans and other allied forces only went into effect last March. Before that, it was only legal for Japan to defend allies ships, planes, or ground forces if Japan itself was also under attack.
The tragic fact is that as a credentialed scientist—a biologist lecturing at Stanford University—Ehrlich's proclamation of the end times as well as the means to confront them struck many as the plausible theory of an expert.
Lippincott applauded the 2020 presidential hopefuls in the Senate for being willing to fly privately, if that's what their campaigns need.
So why are conservatives fretting about corporate America cutting off the GOP, a process merely accelerated by last week's (disgraceful) mob assault on the Capitol. Did they think building a working-class party was going to be painless? That they could mouth pro-worker rhetoric while continuing to ignore workers' concerns on issues like immigration and wages? A country-club party with blue-collar décor?
Both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.
A report generated by the State Department on the threat posed by leaks to the media was leaked to Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, according to his commentary published on Friday.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this month that he doesn't want to prejudice intelligence cooperation with the U.S. but also that the British public deserves the best possible technology.

Inhofe said the Wall Act fully funds the wall by assessing penalties on illegal immigration and closing loopholes that allow unauthorized immigrants to receive federal benefits, protecting the integrity of hardworking American citizens' tax dollars. It's that simple.
I think President Trump, he thinks in those terms, because we're business people, said Williams. And this is a business that has 50 small businesses, has 300 million customers, why don't we try to take care of them?
Tlaib also published an op-ed in a Detroit-area newspaper Thursday titled, Now is the time to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump. She declared: There is no requirement whatsoever that a president be charged with or be convicted of a crime before Congress can impeach him.
Sical sees himself as a failure compared to his peers who got through the obstacle course to win jobs in the United States:
O'Brien said President Donald Trump's 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) recognized the most consequential challenge to the interests of the United States, and those of our allies and partners, is the growing rivalry between free and repressive visions of the future.
Netanyahu and Trump may also meet later this month during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
A spokesman for Iran's armed forces, Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, likewise threatened the U.S. by saying Iran and the resistance front will decide the time, place and way revenge will be carried out.
You know, Matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. And Matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, I fed you. When you were naked, I provided you with clothing. When you were an immigrant, I welcomed you. I think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from Donald Trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.
These will be matters for the scientists and the engineers … to find out exactly how the fire started, why it spread so quickly and what could have been done to prevent it, Fitzpatrick told Sky News.
A spokesman said: The United Kingdom has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to those who genuinely need our protection.
The Propel Center will help cultivate leadership and drive innovation in tech and beyond, acting as a springboard for change in communities across America, Ed Farm founder Anthony Oni said in a statement.
But the next wave of blue-collar contestants is rising, partly because they can catch watch a video from January 2020 of Biden welcoming many more migrants: We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people is cannot absorb people who are in desperate need … is absolutely bizarre.
Joe Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than $1 billion in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor's ability to tackle corruption.
On the third Monday of February, Americans celebrate George Washington's Birthday, often inappropriately called Presidents Day. Even more unfortunately, this holiday doesn't even fall on Washington's Birthday due to the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill, which pushed numerous holidays to Monday in order to create more three-day weekends. Washington's real birthday does not occur until February 22.
Trump has yet to sign the executive order.
Health spokesman for Centre, part of the Labour-led coalition which governed Norway until 2013, said her party isn't ready to support the creation of another gender category.
Go bigger: Pass the bill that 54 senators voted for last February, which combined a solution for children brought to the United States illegally (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA) and $25 billion in appropriated funding for border security over 10 years. The bill failed only because of last-minute White House opposition. Go really big: Begin the new Congress by creating a legal immigration system that secures our borders and defines legal status for those already here. In 2013, 68 senators — including all 54 Democrats — voted for such a bill, but the House refused to take it up. That bill included more than $40 billion and many other provisions to secure our borders.
However, the poll also shows lopsided opposition to government shutdowns. Sixty-five percent of voters say Presidents should take all necessary steps to avoid a government shutdown. They should achieve their policy goals another way, while 22 percent said, Presidents should allow a temporary government shutdown if it helps them achieve their policy goals.
Gov. Cuomo retorted by lambasting the hospitals that have not administered their allotment.
The only difference between the U.S.-backed organizations, which, the official claimed, include the Army of Islam, as well as IS and Nusra Front, is that the former are loyal to their backers. They are Salafi jihadist groups, whose vision for Syria is identical to IS and Nusra. They want to turn secular Syria into a Taliban-style Afghanistan.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is lipstick on a pig.
The ruling may well be judicial trolling from an anti-Trump judge, and there's a question mark on whether it would stand on appeal — including eventually a Supreme Court appeal. But the fact remains that a federal judge has said that the First Amendment applies on social media.
Most likely, the Obama administration also declined to admit Iran had violated the Geneva Convention rights of captive U.S. Navy sailors last week for the same reason.
Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
Johnson had delayed his entry into the EU referendum campaign, missed his moment when he unexpectedly won it, and hesitated to move against May when fellow Tory Brexiteers had begged him to move against her — he had even voted for May's turd deal on her third attempt to get it through Parliament, fearing, like many Brexiteers, that if he did not accept her fake Brexit then the Remain establishment in Parliament would ensure there was no Brexit at all.
Trump has ridiculed the impeachment process for months, and he responded to the opening of the trial by once more branding it a hoax.
We have now received 191 pages of emails between former FBI official Strzok and former FBI attorney Page that include an August 26, 2016, email in which Strzok says that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in her interview with the FBI about her email controversy, apologized for the work and effort it caused the bureau and saying she chose to use it out of convenience and that it proved to be anything but.

As an American, a Christian, a Catholic pastor, I pray that our President, other national leaders and all Americans will do all we can to respect the dignity of all God's children and nothing to further divide our nation.

A poll conducted last February covering all 28 EU nations revealed an overwhelming concern over illegal immigration with more than three-quarters of EU citizens saying that Europe's external borders should be better protected.
Italian authorities have managed to detain around 1,500 illegal migrants at the eastern border following the tougher border controls enacted by populist Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini last year.
Compared with these and other Hellfire-related breaches or risks, it seems hard to justify being all that upset about a dummy missile ending up in Cuba, he continues. It's certainly embarrassing, and doubly so because Cuba is refusing to return the thing, but anyone who might credibly buy it from Cuba, and to whom Cuba might credibly sell it, could easily have been a potential Hellfire customer for a long time now through overtures to even less-ethical actors.
In May 2015, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter declared that the United States would not be deterred by China's military activity in the Asia-Pacific region, criticizing Beijing's artificial island construction in the South China Sea. While China is expanding its military capabilities, the United States is downsizing its military force.
When a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples 'the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage' … we reverse the state court's judgment.
Yes, markets are soaring, and the economy isn't bad, but citizens are divided, Bremmer and Kupchan said. Governments aren't doing much governing. And the global order is unraveling.
In May 2017, DeVos addressed AFC's National Policy Summit, asserting that every state should provide choices and embrace equal opportunity in education.

In December 2018, foreign-born workers unemployment rate fell 13 percent compared to the same time the year before. Native-born Americans, meanwhile, fell only 2.6 percent year-to-year.
The Democrats' legal case against the border wall is also limited by the ideological nature of their objection to the wall. The wall is a symbolic rejection of America's welcome for migrants, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told an MSNBC event on January 4, saying it builds walls in people minds about who should come here.
What's always completely absent from this eco-fascist take on the world is any sympathy for — or even understanding of — the human misery caused by the enforced shutdown of an economy.
While both vaccines require two doses, they use different methods. The Oxford jab is based on traditional vaccine methods and the Pfizer/BioNTech injection operating off of a new mRNA technology.
Stephens's colleague, Bari Weiss, makes a similar argument. Together with Stephens, Weiss has watered down her support for Israel since she moved with Stephens to the Times from the Wall Street Journal in 2017.
Neither America nor NATO was listed as a security threat in the 2009 security assessment signed by Putin's predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev. The Financial Times notes that a Russian military strategy guide published only a year ago also stopped short of describing America or NATO as threats or enemies.

The children of migrants are our future workforce, said Marek, as the video shows migrants working in jobs needed by Americans such as cleaning hotel rooms, driving, construction, and laying bricks. The video also shows many jobs where employers prefer to use cheap migrant labor instead of investing in labor-saving machinery. So the video shows migrants cutting weeds with prehistoric tools, milking cows, picking fruit by hand, and delivering food by bicycle.
In one instance, Parker mentioned a small business owner in Pennsylvania who was able to hire 29 people. He also doubled the size of his facility and for the first time ever, offered a 401k to his employees.

We're filing a suit out of desperation because our livelihoods are at risk due to the government's COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] regulations, Ko Jang-soo, the founder of South Korea's national cafe owners association, said on Monday.
But Syria's isolation was never complete. China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa maintained diplomatic ties. In the Arab world, Lebanon, Iraq and Algeria never broke ranks with Syria. Propped up by Russia, China and Iran, Assad never really felt the pinch politically.
It can seem like a mind-boggling reversal for a leader whose military once seemed dangerously close to collapse. But Russia's military intervention, which began in 2015, steadily reversed Assad's losses, allowing his troops, aided by Iranian-backed fighters, to recapture cities like Homs and Aleppo, key to his rule.
Iran, where 92 people have died from the disease, schools have been shut, while major cultural and sporting events have been suspended.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the payment processing service Stripe will no longer process payments for President Trump's campaign website following last week's events at the Capitol. The financial-tech company handles credit card payments for millions of online business and e-commerce platforms. President Trump's campaign used the service for processing donations to the campaign. Stripe is a private company valued at $36 billion founded by brothers Patrick and John Collison, who remain citizens of Ireland.
During this, Britain would remain subject to EU control and EU migration and trade policy in every respect — although it would no longer have a vote in the bloc's decision-making bodies — while a trade agreement would, at last, be negotiated.
Now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop unnecessary travel, the prime minister also said. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can and you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres, and other such social venues.
Immigration [policy] requires making choices, said Miano, and because these progressives don't want to make the choices, they let the coyotes and the desert make the choices for them.
There is no mother that wants to raise her children on the streets of Portland today, and what we're seeing in Democrat-run cities is what could happen coast-to-coast in this country if we let the Democrats run every single branch of Washington, D.C. and make the decisions going forward, Noem outlined. They have not stood by law enforcement officers. They've not enforced the law in this country, and we're seeing that play out in the streets and the violence that is happening back and forth in the last several months. Listen, Kelly and David love our law enforcement. They recognize that we have laws in this country for a reason, and they should be enforced, and when they're broken, there should be consequences. That is an important discussion in Georgia, but also I recognize people understand the Marxism, the communism, you know, the socialism discussion and what their life looks like six months from now if their expenses go up, if they have less money in their pocket because Democrats have raised taxes. We could in a year and a half, two years see $4 to $5 gasoline as a result of Democrat policy.
She told me that 'mankind' does not refer to all people, only males. I refuted, stating that it does refer to all people, [but] she proceeded to tell me that I was wrong; 'mankind' is sexist, and I should make an effort to look beyond my preset positions and ideologies, as is the focus of the class, Jeffers claimed.
We are witnessing something truly extraordinary. In merely 19 days, a GoFundMe campaign to raise private contributions to build sections of the wall along the Mexico border has raised an astonishing $19.0 million. It will soon be the most successful GoFundMe campaign ever—the current record holder is the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund for victims of sexual assault, which raised $22 million in 2018 over a much longer period of time. The campaign to build the wall should blow past that number in a few days.
China's marine corps is a roughly 15,000-strong force that operates under the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's South Sea fleet. Since it began its first drills on land, the branch appears to be settling into a new function.
We've put out what I think is the most comprehensive and toughest bill on campus free speech. What this bill does is ban so-called free speech codes, and free speech zones, as it also discourages administrators from disinviting controversial speakers who have already been invited by students and faculty members. That's what most of the other model bills do. But, what the Goldwater model adds to all that is insistence on punishment for students who shout down visiting speakers, or rip down posters for the talk that a speaker is going to give, or in any way interfere with the free speech rights of others. Right now, that's really the heart and soul of the free speech crisis. Even though I think it's absolutely essential that we ban these free speech zones and these restrictive speech codes, if you were to do all of that today, and still let these shout-downs take place, I think we'd still have a campus free speech crisis.
Speaking after a year which has seen his approval ratings plunge to new and historic lows and even the President placing a helicopter on standby to escape angry protesters, Emmanuel Macron defied expectations on New Year's Eve to deliver a speech that was combative and unapologetic.

Talia Jane acknowledged that the company offers great benefits, but then complained about the $20 copays, saying, I haven't bought groceries since I started this job. Not because I'm lazy, but because I got this ten pound bag of rice before I moved here and my meals at home (including the one I'm having as I write this) consist, by and large, of that. So here I am, 25-years old, balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn't involve crying in the bathtub every week.
PGA presidents Gail Berman and Lucy Fisher also insisted that health concerns necessitate the shutdown of production, adding, Hopefully, we will be back to work soon.

The New York Times and Washington Post produced nonstop denunciations of his dangerous policies. There were propaganda movies like The Day After, terrifying Americans about a Soviet strike on our country. Witless college students demanded cyanide pills be stocked in campus health care clinics, on the grounds that Reagan was going to get us all nuked.
I asked him then, in a widely shared, public letter to cease and desist, he continued. However, he chose not to listen to my request, just as he chooses not to listen to the many American voices who ask him to stop his constant lies, to stop his petty, nasty name calling and bullying, to stop pushing his dangerous, vilifying and hateful rhetoric.
For his part, Sen. Paul who, unlike Roberts, is an elected official, was not amused. He tweeted:
She continued, Rush Limbaugh was not at campaign trail talking to people at Donald Trump rallies. His campaign aides should know this as well because a lot of them were there also. Yes, there was the response. 'Build the wall and Mexico will pay for it. ' But a lot of them were there for the show and entertainment value of those rallies, rather than the point by point that Donald Trump was making for his policy. They understood that he was a showman. They didn't think he was going to go to Washington and continue to be a showman in that vein. They were hoping he would be somebody who would get things done.
Curry told Breitbart News he hopes President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration will use its position to build on the progress that has been made in the Trump era in prioritizing religious freedom in foreign policy.
But some pro-migration activists are using the epidemic to argue for looser enforcement, even at the southern border where almost a million poor migrants arrived during 2019. The Hill quoted one activist who suggested that the U.S. should admit roughly 30,000 migrants who are now waiting in Mexico:
The fast-growing employment of foreign-born workers over American citizens — which was evident in November 2018 as well — is exacerbated by the country's wage-crushing national immigration policy whereby about 1.5 million mostly low-skilled legal and illegal immigrants are added to the U.S. population every year.
According to the news report, when asked if the CPS policy could lead to teacher firings, Jackson replied, It is a progressive discipline policy.
Blaine amendments, borne out of 19th-century anti-Catholic bigotry, have been the constant bane of the modern education-choice movement. The amendments, currently found in the constitutions of 37 states, prohibit public funds from supporting sectarian schools.
Sanders has pledged a $16.3 trillion environmental plan that would declare climate change a national emergency and calls for the U.S. to move to renewable energy across the economy until 2050. Warren wants to spend $3 trillion over 10 years to move the U.S. to 100% clean energy. And both are aggressive supporters of the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan to combat climate change.

Although the price crash benefits consumers in the short-term, with average annual household spending on gasoline falling almost 21 percent between 2011 and 2015, the U.S. shale industry has struggled. Since January 2015, more than 220 oil companies have gone bankrupt, taking 150,000 jobs with them and nudging parts of the country that benefited from the oil boom back toward recession.
Ren Zhiqiang, a retired real-estate tycoon, fell off the radar in March after accusing the Communist Party of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic, The New York Times reported. Beijing later sentenced Ren, 69, to 18 years in prison. The country reportedly arrested other critics of its response to the pandemic, including Xu Zhangrun, a law professor, and Zhang Xuezhong, a human-rights lawyer. Xiao Jianhua, an asset manager, was abducted from a hotel in Hong Kong in January 2017, Reuters reported.

Richard Dawkins has previously expressed his opinion that all religious education of children is a form of child abuse.
Perdue faces off against Ossoff on Tuesday, while Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock, in the Georgia Senate runoffs. These seats will determine control of the U.S. Senate, as Republicans currently have at least 50 seats and Democrats currently have at least 48 seats. If the Democrats take both of these seats, then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate — and Democrats would control the Senate floor and all the committees. The importance of these races is highlighted by the fact that both President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden are heading to Georgia on Monday, the day before the election, to give last-minute boosts to their parties' candidates.
In a blog post, Leslie Miller, Google's director of public policy, addressed the charges put against the company:
Olsen added, Romney was shocked. His pollsters told him he was going to win. They were all prepared to win, but the evidence was there all along that the people who gave Trump the presidency rejected Mitt Romney because he did not share their values.
All you have to do is listen to him.

Bolsonaro has run a campaign largely centered around social conservatism—his campaign slogan includes the phrase God above everyone and he has made opposition to LGBT issues a pillar of his policy—in a nation known as among the world's most socially liberal. Bolsonaro is, however, the only candidate making a significant dent in the polls who has never been accused of corruption.

Conservative Jewish activist Laura Loomer says she didn't know until recently that outside groups and individuals had privately lobbied Twitter executives to remove her from the site in late November. In an email to Ms. Loomer, Twitter said she had violated its hateful conduct policy for a tweet calling Ilhan Omar, the Muslim congresswoman from Minnesota, anti-Jewish and supportive of Shariah law. In an interview, Ms. Loomer says she was referring to a 2012 tweet from Ms. Omar in which the congresswoman wrote, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Among the groups that had complained to Twitter was the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization. The council doesn't often step in to advocate against other users, says Executive Director Zahra Billoo, but did so in the case of Ms. Loomer based on her previous comments about Muslims. In 2017, Ms. Loomer tweeted after a terror attack in New York City, Leave it to Muslims to ruin everything. People can't even enjoy #Halloween without those savages f**king everything up for everyone. Other organizations, including the civil-rights organization Muslim Advocates, voiced similar complaints.
It has also, however, deformed the face of the nation's apolitical media, which are forced to cater to the needs of a population desperately trying to make ends meet. What were once among the most carefree pages of the nation's newspapers—the lifestyle, health, fitness, and women's interest sections—now boast life hacks designed to help families struggling to find basic goods like oil and flour.
Most controversially, Brussels demanded that the EU's control over Britain's fishing waters should continue, as they had long awarded the majority of the fisheries there to European fleets which had come to depend on them.
If Twitter is a public forum where users have First Amendment rights, that could make Twitter bans unconstitutional as well. It might also have knock-on implications for other social media platforms, like Facebook. That would present a huge problem for Jack Dorsey and other Masters of the Universe, who continue to purge conservative users from their platforms.
The word solidarity in the EU has become tainted for Conservatives and populists, owing to it evoking the response of Brussels and Berlin to the 2015 crisis. After German Chancellor Angela Merkel flung open the doors of Europe to unlimited migrants, she then demanded other countries — who had not been party to the decision to suspend asylum rules in the first place — show their 'European solidarity' and take their 'fair share' of migrants. If member states did not, the EU threatened punishment. The ultimatum caused a rift in the EU between Western and Eastern Europe, with countries like Hungary and Poland flatly rejecting asylum seekers.
There's a lot of discrimination, harassment, and sexual assault, student activist Will McGrew said in an interview with a local news outlet. Why is that?
In order to respect the will of the People and to dispel any suspicion, CENCO proposes the following scheme for the integrity of the results which will have to be published: 1 Only take into account the results from manual counting that were published and posted in front of the polling and counting stations; 2 Ensure that the consistency check at the Local Results Compilation Centers (CLCR) is carried out in the presence of observers and witnesses. 3 Publish the results polling station by polling station.
The Democrats' gain of two seats in Georgia leaves the Senate divided 50-50, allowing future Vice President Kamala Harris to break vote ties in favor of Democrats. The Democrats won the two seats after the GOP candidates' turnout fell slightly once President Donald Trump was not on the ballot.

I know there is one piece of legislation that's scheduled for the floor this week that I would urge Speaker Pelosi to pull back on, and that is the No Ban Act. You saw at the very beginning of this, President Trump was able to take quick action when so many cases were coming out of China, and we still don't know enough about the genesis of this disease in China and how it may have started there. Unfortunately, they didn't share enough information with us as quickly, where we could have done more things earlier. But at the same time, the president was able to take quick action to limit the number of people coming in from China that had exposure to coronavirus, but the No Ban Act would make it more difficult for the president to keep Americans safe by addressing needs as we see other countries like Iran — you're seeing a large, potential large outbreak in Iran — Iran is one of those countries that we currently have a travel ban on because they don't allow us to properly vet that terrorists aren't coming into our country.

The issue is vital to his presidency, in part because Americans' wages are reduced by the annual inflow of 1 million legal immigrants alongside the routine inflow of illegals and temporary visa-workers. The huge inflow of legal immigrants also imposes chaotic diversity on the nation's communities, while it shifts wealth to the coastal cities and political power towards the Democrats.

Here's what we think happened. The original video that went out didn't have the word f*ggot soft bleeped. The original video was immediately pulled from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook as the studio team added bleeps for the offensive content. After the bleeps were added into the video, the studio re-uploaded the SXSW undercover video back to YouTube and Facebook.

Federal unemployment data hides a large number of Americans who have fallen out of the economy and are not even looking for jobs, he said. There are 5.5 million folks … who are out of the workforce and are not even counted anymore in that group of people who should be seeking jobs, he said.
The move comes as several corporations have suspended contributions who voted to decertify the elections.

The governor did not mention anything about fines.
Our troops in South Korea are vulnerable. They've got thousands of tons of chemical weapons. South Korean civilians are vulnerable. That's why my view has long been that really the only solution to the nuclear problem in North Korea, and, in fact, the North Korean problem generally, is to reunify the peninsula. As long as this regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually come to fruition, with horrible consequences, he warned.

Eyes will also be on whether Trump weighs on in the protests enveloping India over its Citizenship Amendment Act. It provides a fast track to naturalization for some migrants who entered the country illegally while fleeing religious persecution, but excludes Muslims, raising fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test. Passage has prompted large-scale protests and a violent crackdown.
However, weirdly, American will continue to provide charters for the Cowboys, Panthers, and Eagles.
We don't want to see layoffs, we want to see people who are at home, if they have any reason to be home, supported immediately. This is an emergency measure that only needs to last a few weeks if we all take the prudent steps necessary, he added.
One of the bills, the Congressional Oversight of Sanctions Act, would give Congress power to limit the executive branch's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare national emergencies and place economic sanctions.

Trump complained anew it was all a hoax, even as fresh details emerged about his efforts in Ukraine.
Pollak suggested that Trump's election can also be seen as a revolt against the lavish idealism of the 60s and the enormous government, attended by an equally large managerial class, that resulted from it.
The loss of skilled migrants can compromise the ability of origin countries to develop their own human capital, especially when it involves teachers and health workers, or undermines development prospects as a result of the departure of persons trained in technical, engineering and scientific areas, crucial to domestic technological progress, said a 2011 report by the Organization of American States and the OECD.
The January deadline claim is based on the advocates' claim that agency officials need a few weeks planning time to prepare and launch the amnesty by March 5 when the two-year work-permits invented by President Barack Obama will start expiring at a more rapid pace.

Abrams called for a floor fight at the Republican convention in 2016, to remind Trump how many in the party oppose and even fear his nomination, warned any Republican with future political aspirations to avoid becoming Trump's running mate, called for a purge of Trumpians from the GOP after Hillary Clinton's inevitable 2016 victory, and suggested running a third-party spoiler candidate to ensure a crushing defeat for Trump.
It takes just 51 votes during the impeachment trial to approve rules or call witnesses. Just four GOP senators could form a majority with Democrats to insist on new testimony. It also would take only 51 senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Trump.
However, that agreement would severely undermine U.S. sovereignty, as explained in a legal white paper from Americans United for Life in 2010:
The new policies the Department of Justice announced today will keep our streets safer by ensuring that criminal aliens do not roam freely in our communities, and prevent federal tax dollars from being sent to jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration laws, Culberson said Wednesday in a statement.
The Affordable Care Act took a lot of power away from the states, added Price who said they are continuing to make progress on innovations.
He said it was not surprising that the first mandated 90-day status report on the Iran nuclear deal from the Trump State Department would falsely declare compliance because the State Department is almost genetically incapable of saying foreign governments actually violate their treaties.
With Tony Romo getting his first action of the season for the Cowboys on Sunday against Philadelphia, some kind of controversy would surely emerge from Lincoln Financial Field. However, the dramatics ended up coming from the Philadelphia media and not the Cowboys quarterbacks.

The exercises are the latest in recent years that show the efforts China is making to boost its expeditionary force capabilities, notes the report. In 2014, the marines conducted their first training in the grasslands of the northern landlocked Inner Mongolia region. At the time, the exercise was seen as unusual for the south China-based force more proficient in beach landings.
It's a travesty, a betrayal of the EU's values, and a threat to the security of European member states, the Hong Kong Watch founder concluded.
Some U.S. officials have suggested there is a possible link between the skyrocketing heroin production in Afghanistan and the fatal drug overdose problem in the United States.

In a statement, Gabbard asserted that the NSA has been defying the rights and liberties granted to us under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. She criticized the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — namely Section 702 — for bringing on a massive government-led exploitation of personal privacy. She says that the bill will keep our country from backtracking on this progress by permanently codifying this policy change and banning this privacy-invading collection from taking place again.
The Granma column on Trump's Cuba address last week reserves a particular bitterness towards Haza, however, condemning Trump's decision to showcase his talent. Trump, the column reads, chose to bring to the stage, violin in hand, the son of a Batista henchman from Santiago de Cuba, a murderer who was involved in the death of Frank País.
The hardline daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline, A sky full of sadness, while the Hamshahri daily went with Shame, and the IRAN daily said Unforgivable.
Blain sees the makings of a 'financial crash' driven by the renewables sector, for wind turbines are not the panacea they may look to gullible investors.

The other Democrat-held congressional seat in Orange County, California's 47th District, has a foreign-born population of nearly 30 percent.
From an off-key violin come the notes of the United States anthem. An erratic Donald Trump dusts off the rhetoric of the Cold War, the author writes, describing the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association as the old terrorist guard that killed in the name of the CIA and was left waiting for the American boat that would take them back to Cuba.
The visit also comes at a crucial moment for Modi, a fellow populist, who has provided over a steep economic downtown and unfulfilled campaign promises about job creation. When Trump touches down in Delhi late Monday, he will find a bustling, noisy, colorful capital that also is dotted with half-finished construction projects stalled due to disappearing funding.
Officials said on Friday that 22 new cases had been confirmed in New York state, mostly in a Westchester County cluster north of New York City, bringing the total to 44.

Though Trump in the campaign said he'd renegotiate or dismantle the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel fiercely opposes, as president he's continuing to implement the accord while examining whether it should stand and hitting Iran with other, non-nuclear sanctions. GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, rather than urging that the deal be terminated, told AIPAC that the U.S. must vigorously enforce the deal and tighten the screws on Iranian compliance.
Officials want a challenging test but a scoring system that doesn't knock down the graduation rate—and outrage parents, the Post noted.
Terrorists can't be your partners and allies, Kalin told Trump. Turkey expects the U.S. to honor our strategic partnership and doesn't want it to be shadowed by terrorist propaganda.
Wolfgang Schaeuble said in a speech Thursday that protectionism and nationalism are never the right answers. He noted that countries are more connected and dependent on each other than at any other point in history.
However, if people do not need our protection they are expected to leave the UK and we may remove them if they do not go voluntarily.
It is clear that the Golden Era is over and the UK, and our allies, need to rethink our relations with China's dictatorship.
The mission appears to be going slowly, as the Islamic State left the villages it abandoned full of mines and other traps designed to kill civilians returning to their homes and opposing soldiers. According to the Kurdish outlet Bas News, at least eight villages have been liberated in the greater Mosul, area, however: Motantar, Tel Sha'eer, Karmrdi, Nasr, Khatab, Koudila, Salahiyah, and Nazra.
Daschle called impeachment at a moment that party control of the Senate is so tenuous a mistake, saying it would first galvanize Trump's supporters and then delay work on crucial issues. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has favored proceeding, even with the coming 50-50 split in the chamber. An impeachment mechanism is just not the right course at all if they want to hold the president accountable, Daschle said at a forum Monday with Lott held by the Bipartisan Policy Center.
There was considerable unhappiness among the Japanese public that Abe implemented this policy change, and perhaps more importantly, policy changes that allow Japan to deploy its forces overseas, without amending the national constitution. Abe has long expressed a desire to reform the pacifist constitution but felt the urgency of the North Korean threat called for some changes to be implemented more quickly.
Because the FDA's policy imposes an unnecessary, unjustifiable, irrational, and undue burden on women seeking an abortion during the current pandemic, and because the Government has not demonstrated irreparable harm from the injunction, I dissent.

Last week, the prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, said that the UK was not adopting strong enough measures to contain the spread of the virus and warned that a travel ban would be enacted if the situation in the UK did not change.

Nine out of 10 veterans feel that they want healthcare choice from the VA. That's something that's consistent over the past several years, he said. Add to that the fact that health care was one of the most important issues when polled to this community.
There are widespread suspicions that Kabila is trying to find a way to rig the vote count so that the winner will be his hand-picked successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Many people believe that if Shadary wins, then he will just be a puppet with Kabila as the puppetmaster.
Paul Ginsburg, director of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, told Politico that the proposal would be fiscally very dangerous and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford physician and health economist, suggested to the outlet that such a plan would have to be paid for with tax increases.
The President went to the negotiating table in good faith. He started with a far smaller [wall funding] number than the original $25 billion and was willing to negotiate further. The [Democratic] response was crickets. At this point, Republicans need to stop negotiating with themselves and wait for the Democrats to come to the table with a offer.
More broadly, the vice president praised the vital role small business owners play in the American economy. Every single one of you is a profile in courage. Every single one of you took a risk when you set up shop, he said. When small business is strong, America is strong.

I do think that marriage was a reflection of their times, Brokaw responded, adding:
Current law requires that all firearm transfers be reported to the California Department of Justice via a mail-in form announcing that the gun has changed hands. The Firearms Policy Coalition reports that the form costs $19, and the new bill, Senate Bill 1037, categorizes the failure to file as a continuing offense. The punishment for this offense can range from a misdemeanor to a felony.
To see how extraordinary it is we're even considering it, ask the question in reverse: would China let a British company build the critical national infrastructure that controls every other system? — Tom Tugendhat (@TomTugendhat) January 27, 2020
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has granted two migrant transport NGOs permission to drop migrants off in Italian ports as the country looks at renewing funds for a migrant agency previously defunded by Matteo Salvini.
The border controls have also irked the Danish authorities, who are waiting to see if they will end up with a buildup of migrants stuck at their border.
Huawei has been at the centre of an increasingly tense diplomatic spat between Britain and the communist regime in Beijing after the UK announced that it would be banning all Huawei tech from its telecommunications networks by 2027.
The National Security Council (NSC) is on track to reach its policy staff reduction goal and may cut even more than originally planned, according to the agency's spokesman.
The terrorist who killed four in and around Carcassonne in March, Radouane Lakdim, was a high priority subject of that list and had been on it since 2014 — but still, French police were unable to prevent the attack. Deportations could relieve some pressure from the security services — a former French intelligence official whistleblower this week revealed the state did not have enough agents or resources to watch all of the suspects.
So did another leader of the rebellion: Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) backed off his opposition to Pelosi with that deal:
The Finance Ministry's chief economist Shira Greenberg said so far macroeconomic activity has not been affected by the virus, but the ministry has received reports from companies of potential damage, and in some cases, major companies have already felt significant losses.
Shoot them, said Walter Salcido, host of a sports podcast on Spotify.
The collective commitment to promote and consolidate democracy that we the nations of the Americas have enshrined in core OAS instruments remains a model for other regions in the world, Shannon continued. Today is an opportunity for us to demonstrate this commitment remains alive and well and relevant to the current plight of our Venezuelan neighbors.
In our own little ways—whether as employers, consumers, or homeowners—each of us has long counted on, and effectively encouraged, the development of this extralegal immigration system, Jawetz testified in 2019. At the risk of being provocative, the truth is that our arcane immigration system is so broken that it long ago abandoned the right to expect and deserve compliance and respect.
TEL AVIV – The meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marked a symbolic reset of relations after eight years of tension between the two countries, a top American foreign policy expert said on Friday.
What's at stake here is absolutely critical. We are holding the line here for the country to maintain a balance of power, Perdue said. If you look at what we have to do, it's simply to get our vote out. Five million people voted in November. There were nefarious activities that went on allegedly, and we have done a lot to add to the integrity of that by putting poll watchers in and we've got cameras on these drop boxes, so on and so forth. We're doing everything we can to make sure every vote is counted legally and accurately on Jan. 5. But what we've really got to do, we've only gotten 3 million out to vote so far. That's off from where we were in November — I think some 3.6 million had voted already by this point in November. So we've got a ways to go but we've got to get our vote out. We also know that Republicans win on election day. If there's any Republicans out there, any conservatives out there, any independents or libertarians out there who haven't voted it, they owe it to their children and grandchildren to help us hold the line against this radical socialist agenda. That's what's at stake here, pure and simple. I know that sounds like trite words, but this is not the typical election where you can just correct it in two or four years. If these things get done, we will not be able to help self-correct this.
Bolton said this assessment of Iranian compliance was just patently false.
This problem is more than evident in a recent report from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on global temperature trends. Between them, the two agencies operate the most accurate, comprehensive system of temperature measuring instruments in the world. But rather than cite data from their best sources when NASA and NOAA reported global temperatures on January 15, they chose to use severely compromised data from temperature readings adjusted—in a process called homogenization—they and others gathered from biased monitoring stations.
The SCMP quoted Chinese state media reports that 17 officials from Jinhu County have been put under investigation, sacked, or expelled from the Communist Party over the scandal. At the national level, a new Vaccine Management Law is under consideration that would allow citizens to sue pharmaceutical companies if death or serious illness results from faulty vaccines.
I'll be bluntly honest here. It was foolish of him to do that. It was selfish for him to do that. And it was inconsiderate for him to do that, Tomlin told reporters. Not only is it a violation of our policy, it is a violation of league policy — both of which he knows.

The rosier projections were widely anticipated given the British economy has proven more resilient than many feared following June's Brexit vote. The bank increased its growth forecasts to 2 percent this year, 1.6 percent in 2018 and 1.7 percent in 2019. Those are up from November's predictions of 1.4 percent, 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent.
What may be worse is the Times' campaign to effectively disenfranchise American Jews. The paper undertakes this campaign by using its pages to legitimize antisemitism emanating from the left, delegitimize friends of Jews on the political right, and shame American Jews who stubbornly refuse to abandon Israel, or turn their back on Israel's friends. These American Jews also impertinently notice the galloping Jew hatred on the political left.

Ashford cites several people in the news who have become targets merely because they are Christian. For instance, early in February sports commentator Tony Dungy was attacked by sports writers because he often includes his Christian beliefs in his own sports analysis. Vice President Mike Pence has been slammed for his Christian beliefs throughout his first year in Washington, but especially during this year's Winter Olympics. And former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow has been a target of ridicule since he first appeared in the national sports spotlight.
The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) less charitably speculated the document was published by the permanent strategic policy bureaucracy in Washington to reassure the public that beneath President Donald Trump's unpredictability, conceit and unilateralism, the policy professionals were striving to advance a more serious and coherent agenda.

This regime is not going to change its behavior, he stressed. It has three times in the past 25 years made unequivocal statements it would give up its nuclear weapons program. It has violated them every time, usually before the ink was dry. That's the pattern Iran is watching. They see this: there are no consequences really for North Korea. Even in the Bush administration, the administration lifted sanctions against North Korea that now we're looking at reimposing. If this is the way North Korea behaves before they can hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, imagine how they're going to behave once they're able to.

Two Americans still remain behind in Iran.

O'Keefe says the claim that Iran – which he calls one of the most peaceful nations on the planet – is developing nuclear weapons has no basis in fact and is part of an ongoing charade that is necessary in order to carry out Israeli policy, which is never-ending war, constant tensions, the threat of a third world war.
Friday was Powell's second attempt to reassure markets and businesses that the Fed would not go overboard in its rate hikes. In mid-December, following the Fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time in 2019, Powell sounded somewhat less certain about future rate hikes than he had in an interview in October. That interview with Judy Woodruff is widely seen as sparking the recent stock market volatility.
Bell's attorney, Sean Pena, said in a statement that the allegations against his client are demonstrably false.

Frankly, if companies like Qantas want to give their customers a better a deal, they can scrap all these inclusion units, just scrap them and save the money, because it's just rubbish this idea that we need a corporate thought police, he expressed. I mean really and truly, it is a complete and absolute utter waste of money. Qantas staff are very good people, they are decent, sensitive people, and they don't need this kind of nonsense. It is an insult to them… This is the very weird and strange times in which we live.
If Biden is serious about taking on the power of the fossil fuel lobby, why is he going to a fundraiser hosted by the co-founder of a natural gas company? Sunrise Movement founder and executive director Varshini Prakash asked.

Most users know that Facebook develops and maintains sophisticated internal profiles of users based on the comments they make on social media and the posts that they like within its social network.

Card Charles Maung Bo, Archbishop of Yangon and the country's first cardinal, said, I am completely against any form of sanction or embargo against Myanmar. Experience shows that this type of measures only harms the poorest sections of the population. They will suffer the consequences, certainly not the rich and powerful.
On second thought, maybe the media won't applaud Grassley for digging into this after all. They're currently very eager to promote the idea that the Obama administration was utterly incorruptible and completely above partisan politics. It won't look good at all if the FBI was preparing to hire the creator of the slipshod, frequently ridiculous Trump Dossier until certain media outlets decided to attack Trump by leaking his work.
Demand Justice's formation was encouraged by former Obama White House counselor John Podesta, who served as chairman of Clinton's latest presidential campaign. We have ignored this field of battle for too long, Podesta told the New York Times regarding Demand Justice.

The USDA reports that the eating patterns of one or more house- hold members were disrupted and their food intake reduced at least some time during the year because they couldn't afford enough food. Those households reported cutting back on intake—but also eating unbalanced meals or relying on cheaper food. Wait a minute. Is this really hunger? Who hasn't had an unbalanced meal from time to time, or decided to go with the cheaper option on the menu?
One of the key elements in Boris's vision of a bright, post-Brexit future for Britain outside the European Union is international trade: all those incredible deals Britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by EU regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by President Trump with the U.S.

In fact, he credited al-Qaeda with defeating Qaddafi, who bin Laden described as a truly vile hallucinating individual who troubles us in front of the world. As it turned out, bin Laden was right about post-Qaddafi Libya presenting great opportunities for jihad, thanks to Obama foreign policy, but it would be ISIS that exploited those opportunities, not their progenitors in al-Qaeda.
A shortage of sanitary products, even in foreign currency stores where there is a far greater selection of products, has led to large queues of people outside the shops that offer them. Last month, Minister of Internal Trade Betsy Díaz Velázquez told the official Granma newspaper that shortages would last until at least April due to economic constraints. The shortages are unrelated to hoarding or coronavirus-related spending. Cubans still use ration cards for many basic goods.
The outcome of Secretary of State John Kerry's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a renewed push for a political solution in Syria, with a call to draft a new Syrian Constitution by August.
The Central American deportation numbers show little improvement until 2020, partly because the D.C. establishment strenuously opposed Trump's campaign promise of border security — until Trump threatened trade sanctions with Mexico in 2019. The DHS data shows no confirmed departure for 97.2 percent of the 440,616 Central American family migrants in 2019 — and just 61 percent among the sharply lower 22,056 arrivals in the first three months of fiscal 2020, during October to December 2019.

Images of American presidents being feted on the world stage stand in contrast to those of their rivals in the opposing party slogging through diners in early-voting states and clashing in debate. This trip, in particular, reflects a Trump campaign strategy to showcase him in his presidential role during short, carefully managed trips that provide counter-programming to the Democrats' primary contest and produce the kinds of visuals his campaign can use in future ads. His aides also believe the visit could help the president woo tens of thousands of Indian-American voters before the November election.

Marlow highlighted Bolton's recent New York Post editorial calling for the Trump administration to name and sanction Iranian terrorists and terror-supporting institutions.
We're not at the mercy of what's happening outside our borders. We can't control worsening economic conditions within an entire Western Hemisphere, which we all know drives illegal migration. But we can and should control how we address its impacts at our borders. And that's exactly what we're doing now. By ending catch and release, and by closing loopholes, we've de-incentivized the pull factors and positioned ourselves to be able to effectively address the constant fluctuation in the numbers, regardless of the external factors out of our control. Tools like the CDC public health order, the migrant protection protocols, and yes, the border wall system. If we remove those tools, the current increase in illegal migration we're already experiencing will become our next full-blown illegal immigration crisis. If the Biden team implements the immigration policy that they have campaigned on, that they promised the American people they would do on Day One, they will create an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.
CASTRO: I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. And we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. So no, I don't agree with that. The other thing I'll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually, the exact opposite happened. And so he's failed. He's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And it's just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.

Britain left the European Union in name in January 2020, but remained subject to the EU, its judges, and its migration regime through a so-called transition period. It left in a real sense on at 11 pm on December 31st — according to supporters of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's exit deal, at least. But how did the country get here?

And shortly after this the intern featured in the video, who goes by the online handle SvenComputer, was also suspended from Twitter:
It was Frank who was in front of the [anti-Batista] organization throughout the island, a Miami Herald column on their relationship explained, while Castro ran the incipient guerrilla that, for many months, depended on País for its survival. Had País survived, many Cuban historians have speculated, Fidel Castro – who never won an election in his life – would not have had a clear path to totalitarian rule on the island.
When you turn the economy over to Main Street America and business, the economy grows, but the way we are going now, we can never catch up with the spending… We gotta quit spending. Quit spending, that's what businesses do, that's what families do, and we need to do that in federal government, the congressman said.
That means that if possible you should not go out, even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise and in that case at a safe distance from others, the prime minister said. If that is not possible, Mr Johnson advised that people should do what you can to limit contact when getting them yourself.
It was important for the staff to know not just where she stood on issues, but on personnel as well. I do think that, as a modern First Lady, she had a huge impact on the politics of the White House. I know for a fact that she dialed Ronnie, as she called him, dialed him down on his rhetoric about the Soviet Union because she could see the possibilities of getting something done with Mikhail Gorbachev at that time. And also understood the historic importance of that, if he were the President who could start to unwind the nuclear confrontation.
We will defend the Christian culture and we will not give the country to foreigners, Orban added, and spoke about a proposed constitutional amendment from 2016 to limit mass migration, which failed to pass due to the government not having the required two-thirds majority in parliament at the time.
Global Times' report came as China invited the international community to visit Xinjiang province, believed to house hundreds of re-education camps that the U.S. and United Nations say are used to subject the region's predominantly Muslim Uighur (or Uyghur) population, as well as Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, to communist indoctrination, systemic torture, disappearances, executions, and arbitrary detentions, among other crimes.
Those promises include calling for a vote on the Dream Act to give amnesty to young people brought to the United States illegally by there parents, amending the Voting Rights Act, and other immigration issues.
It's really not difficult to read between the lines here. Rutnam – and his fellow civil servants – tried to frustrate Patel rather than help her. Patel wasn't having this and made her displeasure known. This then enabled the Civil Service to pretend that the issue was Patel's workplace bullying rather than its own institutional sclerosis and incompetence.

On that matter, Obama and Netanyahu struggled to speak with a unified voice. Trump has shown significant flexibility — stunning many last month when he broke with decades of U.S. policy by saying the U.S. could live with a one-state solution, rather than a two-state solution involving Palestinian statehood, if both Israelis and Palestinians agreed.
Fox News quotes Ralph Cossa of the Pacific Forum CSIS joking that North Korea doesn't mind being hated, but they definitely hate to be ignored.

Axios reported Perez said in a previous interview:
Del Bosque told KSFN that President Obama had missed an opportunity to use the recent El Niño rains, which have filled some reservoirs, to address farmers' needs. As you know we've had more rain and snow in the mountains and those were opportunities that have been lost to move water … I have 800 acres, no crops and I've got hundreds of thousands of dollars of plastic in there with the finest irrigation system you can buy, and I have no water to put in there, he said.
Then, the coronavirus arrived. As governors placed their states under lockdown last spring and Americans sheltered in place, emissions started plunging across parts of the economy that had rarely seen sustained drops before. Transportation, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gases, saw a 14.7 percent decline in emissions in 2020 as millions of people stopped driving to work and airlines canceled flights. While travel started picking up again in the latter half of the year as states relaxed their lockdowns, Americans drove 15 percent fewer miles over all last year than they did in 2019 and the demand for jet fuel fell by more than one-third.
I think that is why when the President campaigned about building a wall, it resonated with people, he said.

And this is a regime that Britain is now trusting with its wireless technology?
Research suggests that women are also likely to earn less due to women being more likely to either move or stay in a certain area due to the greater importance the couple places on the husband's job. Sari Kerr, an economist at Wellesley College, argues that because the spouse who earns is likely to do more of the household work, the gender pay gap is self-reinforcing.
This is a basic measure that should have been in place for decades. Anyone who has studied these issues understands that, by bringing in these changes, the government is making history, said the minister.
With one exception, SB 4's provisions do not, on their face, violate the Constitution. For the following reasons, we uphold the statute in its entirety except for the application of the endorsement prohibition, Tex. Gov't Code § 752.053(a)(1), to elected officials.

The speech marked 40 years since a thaw in Sino-Taiwanese relations. After being defeated in a civil war by the communists, nationalists led by General Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan and established a new government in 1949. Taiwan has been self-governing ever since but has never formally declared independence.
This will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. Biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. Sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. I am no stranger to investment madness – three times I've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.
There are widespread suspicions that Kabila is trying to find a way to rig the vote count so that the winner will be his hand-picked successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Many people believe that if Shadary wins, then he will just be a puppet with Kabila as the puppetmaster.
You'll have to ask the president, he said when asked what Trump meant by economic devastation for Turkey. We have applied economic sanctions in many places, I assume he is speaking about those kinds of things. You'll have to ask him.
It is contradictory that Trump wants to raise wages for American and also bring in more workers who will cut salaries, an American technology professional told Breitbart News. It is political suicide … because the tech workers believed [in 2016] he was the only one who stood up for them, said the professional, who fears he will be blackballed by major companies' subcontractors if his identity is revealed.
Gaffney added compliments to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and the House Freedom Caucus for ensuring that it did fail.

If things really are looking up, then Russia is emerging from what Business Insider called a perfect demographic storm that was crippling the nation in 2015. Up to 30 percent of Russian deaths in one study were alcohol-related. Russia has also battled other forms of drug abuse, and a serious HIV/AIDS crisis, contributing to that notoriously high mortality rate for Russian men. It is likely that men embarked upon such tragically short life paths are not settling down to family life and raising children.

Trump's showed his zig-zag policy in the January 4 press conference just after the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that wages rose by 0.4 percent in January, setting the stage for a 4 percent rise in wages throughout 2019. Trump praised the wage growth and the resulting return of sidelined Americans to the job market:

The Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.

We take some solace to report, Immigration Voice has convinced the House to include a provision in the upcoming stimulus bill which says – in light of the indefinite closing of USCIS offices and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, all existing lawful immigration statuses and EADs [Employment Authortization Documents] will be automatically extended for 1 year from the date the legislation is enacted. As per the current language, if you have an H4 EAD, it will be extended for a year. If you have an H-1B about to expire, it will be renewed and you can remain here even if furloughed until the crisis is over. … We need the Senate to agree to add the language into its stimulus in order for the doctors and other critical care workers we have in our community to be able to treat patients and go to work without fear of losing their status if they die. Please call your Senators and make sure they understand the importance of this provision and of the work you do.

It needs to be made clear that to get tested, you don't have to show proof of legal residency, and if you need to be hospitalized, you will be, regardless of legal status, he said.
Prior to the Fed announcement on Wednesday, consumer price data revealed that inflation unexpectedly fell in May. Core CPI, an economic indicator closely watched by the Fed because it excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 1.7 percent year-on-year. That was lower than expected and short of the Fed's announced long-term target.
We haven't heard anything from anyone, replied Della Rocca. I would have thought that there might be a little bit of interest in … the Hunter Biden situation. We haven't heard a thing from anyone in Congress.
As the bloc moves to rapidly expand its coordinated defence capabilities, the draft deal also keeps open the possibility that the UK could be bounced into new defence arrangements during the two-year transition, the pro-Brexit group Veterans for Britain (VfB) explained.
Internalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.
Former British military officers have warned a new draft Brexit deal means control of UK armed forces could be given over to the European Union (EU) after Brexit.

Existing law requires reports of ownership be filed within certain grace periods for firearms brought or imported into the state by a personal firearms importer or licensed collector. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor. Existing law provides that failure to submit these reports within the grace period is not a continuing offense. This bill would provide that those violations committed on or after January 1, 2017, would be a continuing offense. The bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a handgun, punishable by a misdemeanor or a felony.

Hurt remarked, I was talking to a guy from Georgia the other day he was saying, 'I don't care. I just want divided and government. [sic] It's all I want.' Okay, if you want divided government, you have to crawl over broken glass to vote in this election, because that's what this is all about.
CBS has two separate offices located across 57th Street on the West Side of Manhattan, one primarily housing the staff of 60 Minutes.

They'll change the filibuster rule which as you know is very difficult and we'll never be able to get that back and that means they are creating a single-party system. This is what was tried in Cuba and Venezuela and North Korea and Iran and all the places we know it's failed. They want total control. AOC said that 'we want to win these two seats so we don't have to negotiate.' Then, defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, amnesty, higher taxes, socialization of our healthcare, and the Green New Deal. All of this becomes our reality if in fact we don't hold these two seats.

Upon taking office in 2001, Bush tapped Norman Mineta, a former California congressman and Clinton Commerce Department official, for the post of transportation secretary. Mineta would go on to serve in the post until August 2007, becoming the longest-serving secretary of transportation in the department's history. Apart from Mineta, Bush also appointed Democrats to the office of secretary of the army, as well as several prominent ambassadorships.
We all owe Chief Justice John Roberts a big thank you for confirming the name of the phony, Deep State whistleblower who launched this stupid impeachment hoax.
Rather than use the savings gained from the lower rates to pay down the principal on the debt, the opposite has occurred—it has encouraging even more reckless borrowing. The central bankers are playing with fire by allowing this debt to continue to expand. A day of reckoning is on the horizon; one which will likely start in Japan and be followed by Europe. These two economies are in the worst financial shape, hamstrung by falling birth rates and debt loads well above 100% of GDP.
The sentencing of Alaa Brinji to a five-year prison term is utterly shameful. He is the latest victim of Saudi Arabia's ruthless crackdown on peaceful dissent, where the aim appears to be to completely wipe out any and all voices of criticism, declared James Lynch, Deputy Director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Program.
And I don't accept the idea that this has been looked at and there is nothing there. Somebody needs to look at it, and I would prefer it to be outside of politics but somebody will eventually look at it, he added.
The figures were released days after Vice Premier Liu He and Donald Trump signed a much-vaunted phase one pact that marks a truce in their nearly two-year-old trade war.
No one is ever going to celebrate a price increase, Wang said. But I think that with the wage increases, people won't see working in the food industry as a lowest-paying job you take if you can't find work, and start viewing it as a career. It will be good for the industry in the long run.
While investigations are underway to determine what went wrong, tenants said repeated complaints were ignored.

The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.
Now, they say the NSC is reviewing it. They're looking at further sanctions because of Iran's terrorist activity, but there's plenty of evidence out there already publicly that Iran is violating the deal, he contended. It's not just a problem, as Tillerson said later in the day, that ultimately, the deal just delays Iran's nuclear weapon; it doesn't prevent it. It doesn't delay it, either, if they're violating it, which I think they're doing.

I think Trump's response was entirely appropriate, he argued. I think where he has not stepped up to the plate yet, at least his administration hasn't, is the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Despite his very strong view during the campaign that the Obama nuclear deal was a debacle, just yesterday Secretary of State Tillerson signed a letter to Speaker Ryan, in compliance with the congressional reporting requirement, saying Iran was in compliance with the deal.

One of the things that is so beautiful to watch is 3.2 percent wage growth. That hasn't happened in so long for our country. That's an incredible thing. That means people are actually getting more money, taking home more money, and that's something that is really nice to see. A lot of you have been following me when we were on a thing called the campaign — that was an exciting campaign, a great campaign — and I used to talk about wages going down, not going up, but going down for years. Nineteen years. And now they went up 3.2 percent and yet there's no inflation because other things are going down, like the price of your gasoline at the tank. It is low and that doesn't happen by luck. I worked hard on that. That's like a tax cut for people. So a lot of good things are happening. Labor participation rate increased to 63.1 [percent]. That's an incredible number also.

Regarding the impeachment more broadly, Sessions said the partisan push by the U.S. House—it's the first time in the history of the United States that an impeachment has been purely partisan in nature with bipartisan opposition—was a colossal failure. In the House, all Republicans were joined by three Democrats in opposing one Article of Impeachment and by two Democrats in opposing the other. A fourth Democrat voted present on both Articles, refusing to vote for either one. One of the two Democrats who voted against both Articles left the Democrat Party over it, joining the GOP. The Senate process has been similarly marred by Democrat partisanship. What's more, Sessions says, the actual allegations don't pass muster.

In California, for example, tougher border enforcement has raised farm wages to $16 / hour, up perhaps $5 / hour over earlier times.
So yes, el-Sisi is a friend to the U.S., and, under the Trump administration, the U.S. is a friend to him. Again, it's a safe bet that Kirkpatrick, were she still with us, would agree that it's better to have him as a friend than someone else as an enemy.

So to Obama, the Geneva Convention applies to stateless terrorists–who are not parties to the convention, and are not lawful combatants–but not to U.S. sailors captured and detained by Iran at gunpoint in a hostile rescue. There are at least five reasons that the Obama administration is wrong to defend Iran, and wrong about the Convention.

Della Rocca added, John Paul had to shut down his business.

Many of those same lawmakers have also opposed illegal immigration and in-state college tuition for undocumented immigrants, including dreamers — the young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.
Economists remain split as to how inflation will pan out over the coming months, largely because there's uncertainty surrounding the value of the pound. However, if the currency stabilizes then the impact of last year's depreciation will start to drop out of the annual comparison and that could see inflation fall back toward target and help support the economy.
The second was having Pelosi and Schumer appear together. They often repeated the same talking points: for example, they both called the wall ineffective and unnecessary. That was likely by design — prepared by consultants with focus groups, no doubt, believing political messages must be repeated to be remembered. But it sounded inauthentic.
You've got Peter Strzok and Lisa Page talking about taking down the president, having an insurance policy against him succeeding and becoming the president. You've got McCabe, you've got Comey, you've got Clapper — you remember James Clapper, the one who came to the Senate and when asked by Sen. Wyden 'are you storing, are you gathering information from Americans by the millions and storing it on government computers,' James Clapper said 'no.'

Crack the door to admit Elliott Abrams and the neocons will scurry in by the hundreds, warned Paul. Neoconservative interventionists have had us at perpetual war for 25 years. While President Trump has repeatedly stated his belief that the Iraq War was a mistake, the neocons (all of them Never-Trumpers) continue to maintain that the Iraq and Libyan Wars were brilliant ideas. These are the same people who think we must blow up half the Middle East, then rebuild it and police it for decades.

Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.

Low rates of full sex reassignment surgery and the otherwise wide variation of transition-related treatment, with all the challenges that entails for privacy, fairness, and safety, weigh in favor of maintaining a bright line based on biological [male or female] sex — not gender identity … After all, a person's biological sex is generally ascertainable through objective means.

Biden, however, has shown no indication that he values religious freedom on the domestic front.
Let me give you another example: the Veterans Administration, Brill responded. Remember the scandals in 2013 and 14 about the waiting lists? The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has been writing reports — if you can believe it — since the 1980s saying that the Veterans Administration was in shambles, the waiting lists were a huge problem, the computer technology didn't work, and people were covering up how long it was taking for people to get their treatment at VA hospitals. That's since the 1980s.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) during a press conference Friday called for a special counsel-like figure to examine what Hunter and Joe Biden did in Ukraine.

For a candidate to win the Speakership of the House, that person must receive a majority of those present and voting for a person. Members of Congress can vote for formally introduced candidates–for Democrats that will be Pelosi and for Republicans that will be Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the current Majority Leader who will become the House Minority Leader on Thursday when Democrats take over–or they can vote for someone not listed. The candidate can be a member of the House, but does not have to be–the Constitution is very nonspecific on the requirements for candidates for election to be Speaker of the House–though there has never been a Speaker who is not a member of the House.
Once you understand this, the authoritarianism with which so many governments have responded to the Chinese coronavirus makes a lot more sense.

Pompeo concluded by addressing the administration's efforts to secure the freedom of Americans held by Middle Eastern countries, prominently mentioning Iran and former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared there 11 years ago. He included a reference to Egypt's refusal to pay the medical expenses of American tourist April Corley, who was severely injured in 2015 when Egyptian forces mistakenly bombed her tour group. Military aid to Egypt has been delayed over Egypt's actions in the Corley case:
NAFTA and all kinds of international trade have a lot of benefits in the United States, he noted. We pay a lot less for televisions. We pay a lot less for clothing. But if we're all enjoying that while this big swath of the country are victims of it, that's not the way our country is supposed to work. We're all supposed to be in this together.

In October 2020, Biden said he plans to allow U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere to decide whether his administration should keep tariffs on China or not. Lighthizer said this strategy did nothing in the past and called it a waste of time.
Economists will no doubt spend years figuring out exactly what gave rise to the Trump manufacturing boom and why so many forecasts were so far off-base. No doubt trade policy, tax cuts, and regulatory reform all played a role. But a good deal of the manufacturing revival is likely based on something less tangible but no less real: the revival of hope. People who believe we can make America great again are hiring, starting new businesses, and returning to the workforce.

We're hoping that the dialogue [with Biden's appointees] is going to continue. We're hoping that that as this administration has done, that they're actually going to listen to the experts that are on the ground, they're going to listen to facts, they're going to listen to reality. And they're going to make the necessary adjustments that we need to protect our country.

But whether the New York Times succeeds or fails in its campaign to mainstream leftist antisemitism, shame pro-Israel American Jews, and detach the Jewish community in the U.S. from Israel and the rest of the Jewish world, it is worth taking note of, and condemning, what the newspaper is attempting to do.

Despite his conviction—the result of years of investigations in what is now known as Operation Car Wash, Lula remains the frontrunner. Operation Car Wash is a sprawling prosecutorial probe into Petrobras, the state-run oil company, that found politicians from nearly all of Brazil's dozens of political parties participating in a scheme in which politicians would secure overpriced infrastructure contracts to private corporations who would then kick some of the excess profits back to the politicians involved. The plan peaked during Lula's tenure; two courts have found that he personally profited to the tune of millions from the operation.

This column originally appeared on Geert Wilders' official page:
In her 1979 essay, Kirkpatrick never claimed that human rights and democracy were unimportant; she simply argued that the American national interest was more important. Indeed, it's worth noting that in recent decades, some authoritarian allies of the U.S.—including South Korea, Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—have evolved into functioning democracies, and those countries are stronger as a result. So yes, it's possible for our friends to improve and for the Free World to expand; it's just that the process must be handled with the utmost care.

If a state doesn't want to participate, that would be a terrible mistake on their part, she continued. They will be hurting the children and families who can least afford it. If politicians in a state block education choice, it means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids.

Even if it's argued that the ruling is narrow and only meant to apply to public figures (maybe even arguing that it applies only to the U.S. president), that still has implications for Twitter's enforcement policy.

Facebook has announced that it will remove all content that mentions Stop the Steal, a phrase in reference to the 2020 U.S. presidential election that is popular among supporters of President Donald Trump.
Pelosi is also trying to shift the debate away from fences and towards amnesties: We need to have comprehensive immigration reform … Dreamers and their families and the rest, she said January 10. Comprehensive Immigration Reform is what this debate frankly should be about, she said.
The Democrats' problem rhetoric is backed by 19 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of independents, and 52 percent of Democrats.
Despite these declarations against communism, Bolsonaro held a friendly meeting with an envoy sent by the most powerful communist leader in the world, China's Xi Jinping, relaying a message of cooperation to the Communist Party leader. China is Brazil's largest trade partner as a product of a policy of distance from the West under Lula and Rousseff. Candidate Bolsonaro expressed concerns that China is buying Brazil and vowed to cut trade with Beijing down to a manageable level.

Obama foreign policy has left the United States with little choice but to make dirty deals across the Middle East, supporting many supposedly lesser evils to assemble a coalition capable of fighting the greater evil of ISIS on the ground. The Christians of Iraq, Syria, and Iran are collateral damage this Administration and its supporters would prefer not to discuss, not even when ethnic cleansing comes to the upscale suburbs of Baghdad.
But the ability of homeowners to qualify for more expensive homes has driven up the ratio of home prices to median household income. At the end of 2014, home prices had reached an all-time record ratio of 5.3 times the average U.S. household income. Although official 2015 data is not yet available, the ratio appears to have reached another all-time high of 5.5 times household income.
Just this week, Breitbart News reported that the U.S. Education Department was investigating possible discrimination against men at both Yale University and the University of Southern California. Kursat Christoff Pekgoz, a doctoral student at the University of Southern California, argued that certain female-only programs are unlawful because women make up the vast majority of degree earners.

There was a steady decrease in white voters in the seven congressional districts that are in and around Orange County between 1980 and 2017, according to census data. In 1980, whites made up 75 percent of the population in the district where Mr. Cisneros won. By 2017, that number dropped to 30 percent. [Emphasis added] The county's immigrant population grew five times as fast as the general population between 1980 and 2000, and while the pace of immigration has slowed, the Latino and Asian populations continues to increase, driven by the children of immigrant families born in the United States. [Emphasis added] … You went from a solid Republican county to one in which Republicans were just barely the majority, and it fell pretty quickly in the past two years, said Ms. Godwin. You have had continued demographic changes. This is a county that went from majority-white to having a majority that are Latino and Asian-American. So that has gone hand-in-hand — particularly with the rising Asian-American population — to voting more Democratic. [Emphasis added]
Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is promising to nearly double the intake of refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Obama administration.

In response, Coons told Fox, Well, I agree with the advice that Lindsey Graham just gave to President Trump, which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on.
Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said the nominees were personally recommended by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He said:
Such a ruling wouldn't be all bad for public schools, either. More school choice would mean greater competition and motivation for government schools to strive to their greatest potential. All public schools have to worry about is whether the private sector can do things better, and again, their fears are legitimate.
Politico points out that California Democrats are trying to extend the state's Medi-Cal program this legislative session to nearly 1.2 million illegal immigrant adults who would qualify for it, and companion bills in the state Assembly and Senate have already passed their respective health committees with party-line votes.

Seoul coffee shops have been similarly affected by the extended assembly ban in the capital region. A government-mandated Level 2 restriction in the Seoul area from November 23 banned restaurants from offering dine-in services. The order has forced local business owners to try to survive on delivery and takeout orders alone.
Nationwide, roughly 1.5 million U.S. white-collar jobs are being held by foreign temporary workers, ensuring lower salaries for American graduates. This massive white-collar outsourcing industry exists because the federal H-1B, L-1, J-1, TN, OPT, and CPT visa programs allow U.S. companies to import temporary foreign workers and also provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign employees each year.
Members also heard from Tucker Carlson earlier in the day, as well as from Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College, where the event took place. Carlson said he would not run for public office, according to a source in attendance.
Prior to the Fed announcement on Wednesday, consumer price data revealed that inflation unexpectedly fell in May. Core CPI, an economic indicator closely watched by the Fed because it excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 1.7 percent year-on-year. That was lower than expected and short of the Fed's announced long-term target.
AHMEDABAD, INDIA (AP) — Kicking off a whirlwind 36-hour visit to India that emphasizes pageantry over policy, President Donald Trump received a warm welcome Monday on the subcontinent, including a mega-rally, meant to reaffirm ties while providing enviable overseas imagery for a president in a re-election year.

Public figures who identify as 'Catholic' give scandal to the faithful when receiving Communion by creating the impression that the moral laws of the Church are optional, the former archbishop of Philadelphia said. And bishops give similar scandal by not speaking up publicly about the issue and danger of sacrilege.
The governors' real priority, some skeptical observers claimed, was to secure enough water for the California Waterfix — the Twin Tunnels project that will divert water from the Sacramento River under the California Delta to be pumped south.
Then, the coronavirus arrived. As governors placed their states under lockdown last spring and Americans sheltered in place, emissions started plunging across parts of the economy that had rarely seen sustained drops before. Transportation, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gases, saw a 14.7 percent decline in emissions in 2020 as millions of people stopped driving to work and airlines canceled flights. While travel started picking up again in the latter half of the year as states relaxed their lockdowns, Americans drove 15 percent fewer miles over all last year than they did in 2019 and the demand for jet fuel fell by more than one-third.

Herbert Nixon Flores, a 46-year-old illegal alien MS-13 gang member from El Salvador, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Irving, Texas, after he appeared to murder his ex-girlfriend, 35-year-old Karen Ruiz, in front of her three-year-old daughter outside of her babysitter's home.
WASHINGTON, DC — Democrats began trying to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump minutes after his inauguration in 2017 and so far have made a total of seven attempts to remove him from office for things such as being impolite to the mainstream media and professional athletes, the Republican Senate majority leader noted on Tuesday.
Some of the water that will be produced from the project will be dedicated for environmental projects, he said, nothing that some water would help fish, and some would supply existing refuges that support waterfowl species.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also responded positively to the announcement by the court.
On January 8, after Trump's national address, Pelosi downplayed the northward flow of economic migrants. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.
The policy may help employers in lower-cost states, help sidelined American medical graduates get jobs, reduce universities' ability to get foreign students into U.S. jobs, and also exclude all of the lower-skill, lower-wage foreign workers who got H-1Bs in prior years, according to Greg Siskind, a prominent immigration lawyer who opposes the new rule.
Comparing the situation to that of a natural disaster, another group member added: We cannot wait, this is happening now.
The study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the city's wild hike in the wage to $13 last year caused employers to cut hours, layoff workers, and eliminate jobs
The irresponsible and cold-blooded words and actions of some federal politicians stand in sharp contrast with many U.S. states and cities which have expressed sympathy and support for Chinese provinces and cities. American businesses, institutions and people have also donated money and supplies to China. Now Chinese businesses and civil society are supporting the American people's epidemic response. The U.S. politicians should be clearly aware that distracting the world from the shortcomings of their response will lead to nothing but division, domestically and internationally, damage the government's credibility, and make the United States weaker rather than stronger. The only correct way out for the U.S. side is to focus on self-improvement, handle its domestic issues and provide convincing evidence that the spread of the virus can be brought under control as promised.

This is a ridiculous situation, a minor disagreement that the Eagles are making into a huge incident — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017
Initially, local authorities evacuated nearly 200,000 people downstream of the dam. But a herculean effort by engineers managed to save and stabilize the emergency spillway, averting a massive disaster.
Business Insider (BI) on Tuesday quoted other observers who believe Ma is keeping a low profile, perhaps under orders from the CCP, but has not been imprisoned. On the other hand, BI recalled a few other high-profile Chinese who suddenly became low-profile and later turned up in prison cells:
While the number of migrants entering Italy was greatly reduced in the first half of 2019, thanks to the pro-border policies of Salvini, the number of new arrivals has risen since Salvini and his League (Lega) party left the government in September of 2019.
In the Republic of Ireland, Lidl and Tesco store managers are also looking out for their community by offering priority shopping for seniors, over 65s, and carers. All 163 Lidls across Ireland will offer priority shopping for these groups from 9 am to 11 am every day, which will include prioritised queuing and additional assistance for our older customers. All of Tesco's 151 stores will be open an hour early for seniors on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed concern over the situation in Kashmir.
It is naive to believe that China will respect the agreement it has signed. It is naive to ignore the geopolitical implications of doing a deal with China right now. And it is naive to think that the darkening political climate in Beijing will never affect life in Brussels or Berlin, Rachman wrote.
When asked what happened when the three approached the British border, she replied: Nothing happened at [the] border – a common problem with the Eurotunnel crossing, where large queues can force border guards to fast track commuters. The woman is believed to have slept in the boot of the car.
Just as Turkish and U.S. policies are at odds concerning the connection between Syrian Kurds and the Turkish PKK separatists, so the current proposals clash over the difference between Turkey's desire to establish a buffer zone around its border and the U.S. plan for a safe zone around the Kurds.
In late April, Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson referred to telemedicine abortion as the silver lining of the coronavirus pandemic.
For the position of transportation secretary, in particular, Biden has picked Pete Buttigieg, his onetime rival for the 2020 Democrat nomination turned supporter. Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has little prior experience in either infrastructure or transportation matters. In fact, during his tenure as mayor, Buttigieg struggled to come up with proper solution to the persistent pothole problem plaguing his city's streets.
The primary reason for this reevaluation, Lorenzoni explained, was that the PT had ruled the country for 14 years, most of the 21st century. While its two presidents fared poorly after their tenures – Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is serving a 12-year sentence for corruption while president; Dilma Rousseff was impeached out of office and lost a senate bid last year – 14 years is over a decade of low-profile hires throughout the expansive Brazilian federal state infrastructure. Maintaining staff in key positions in agencies like the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of Justice who oppose the reforms Bolsonaro campaigned on could make those reforms impossible.
Those put under house arrest included: eleven senior princes, several current or former ministers, the owners of three major television stations, the head of the most important military branch, and one of the wealthiest men in the world, who has been a major shareholder in Citibank, Twentieth Century Fox, Apple, Twitter, and Lyft.
That projection, all other things being equal, would likely prompt the bank to raise interest rates. However, growth, despite the upgrades, is set to remain below the British economy's long-run average and that could keep a lid on such things as wage rises. Even with the improved outlook, the central bank said GDP will still be 1.5 percent lower in two years than was forecast before the referendum.
One of the most notable areas of interference by the European Union is over the matter of mass migration. After EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos warned against Italy changing its border policy from the last government — which saw the nation acting as one of the main points of ingress for illegal migrants and asylum seekers to the continent — Lega leader Salvini hit back.
The Houthi Shiite movement controls much of Yemen – including the capital, Sana'a – and has been attempting to wrest control from the legitimate government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who enjoys the support of the government of Saudi Arabia. The Shiite government of Iran has lent its support to the Houthis, creating a proxy war situation since the civil war began in 2015 that has led to a dire humanitarian crisis.
Dancers in traditional attire, dancers and drummers lined the red carpet rolled out at the stairs of the presidential aircraft as Trump was poised to receive the raucous reception that has eluded him on many foreign trips, some of which have featured massive protests and icy handshakes from world leaders.In India, he instead received a warm embrace — literally —from the ideologically aligned and hug-loving Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Global Times also demanded Beijing strengthen the right to define the situation of the Taiwan Straits and work to deny Taiwan the right of self-determination. This means that we can ignore some of the messages that they want to highlight, and we can harshly stop the acts that they want to slip through unpunished, it suggested.
The nuclear weapons program in Iran and the ballistic missile programs are under the control of the IRGC, he said. If we name them as a foreign terrorist organization, all kinds of statutory sanctions kick in. I think it will have a dramatic impact on the Iranian regime. Opponents of naming the IRGC as a terrorist organization include many in the administration who don't want to admit Iran is violating the nuclear weapons deal and who are afraid that if we name the IRGC, that Iran will pull out of the deal.
In a recent New York Times op-ed, two Google employees who recently formed the Alphabet Worker's Union outlined their reasons for doing so and their issues with the tech giant.
His comments came after the European Union said two of its employees tested positive for the virus, while Poland, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile all reported their first cases in the past 24 hours.
Leaked documents reveal that the federal government gave nearly 80 million dollars of taxpayer money to overseas abortion provider EngenderHealth over six years ending in 2019.
A study released in March 2020 revealed that forced labor was not limited to Xinjiang. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), the Chinese government incentivized companies throughout the nation to use Uyghur slaves, presumably shipped out of the Xinjiang camps, in forced labor for the manufacturing of products sold by dozens of international companies, including brand names like Nike, BMW, and Nintendo. Subsequent reports have revealed that cotton-picking, an extremely arduous undertaking, has become a preferred industry for the Chinese Communist Party to force Uyghurs into.
If so, it would appear that Cummings has been outfoxed. Heaven knows what arch-retainer Sedwill may have promised in order to keep his job but it looks like he was speaking with forked tongue or, perhaps, that he concocted some kind of devil's pact where he agreed to put his weight behind a frictionless Brexit in return for being granted certain favours in return. If that is indeed the case – though it's pure speculation on my part – then the British people have been very ill-served by this stitch-up.
NEW YORK (AP) — CBS News shut down its New York City headquarters for cleaning and disinfecting on Wednesday after two of its employees tested positive for coronavirus.
Trump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the American worker. The president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. It also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.
FIRE Legislative and Policy Director Joe Cohn told Breitbart News that he was heartened by the bill's passage and that he hoped it would inspire other state legislatures going forward.
The president gravely abused the power of his office, Nadler said. He did all this for his personal political gain.
In the interview, Sommers argued that girls and women are the privileged sex when it comes to educational status.
Those with the most serious medical conditions were told to isolate themselves for 12 weeks. External borders remain open, as do the country's schools.
It means this deep recognition that our sole responsibility is to protect the American people. When we do that, I am very confident we will increase security for people all around the world, we will raise others up as well. But our mission set, everyday, is to say, 'How do we make sure that everything we do secures freedom for America?' and it's gotten us to walk away from a whole bunch of things. We've walked away from the World Health Organization. We walked away from the UN Human Rights Commission. We walked away from some of the central understandings of the World Trade Organization. Each of these things was detrimental to the American people, their prosperity, their security. We were right to do that. It's a sensibility that I think 75 million people still understand and understood in November of this year. They haven't stopped understanding, I promise you that.
The seven-member prosecution team was led by the chairmen of the House impeachment proceedings, Reps. Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee and Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, two of Pelosi's top lieutenants.
The Democrats, the media and most of the Republican Party are as fanatically opposed to Trump's ideas about illegal immigration as they were to Reagan's ideas about winning the Cold War.
They were very, very much aware of the importance of symbolism. I think it was helped shaped a little bit by their years, not just in Hollywood, but eight years as Governor of California, Brokaw added.
The free speech network announced that it would bring ten new servers online to handle the increased traffic volume.
On the other hand, officials in Tehran have probably noticed the United Arab Emirates just reopened its embassy in Damascus and its diplomats are reminding the Syrians about the extensive UAE investments made before the civil war blew up in 2011.

The six month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We hadn't cut the number of drug prosecutors, we didn't cut the number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we've been doing for 25 years. And it's having an impact and I'm afraid it's going to continue.
He also called on citizens to practice social distancing, something he said would naturally go against the nature of the Cuban people.

The union's announcement Thursday was eagerly anticipated: whichever candidate it chose could enjoy a boost at the polls. And with Sanders out of the picture, the other frontrunners could have benefited from a unique opportunity to challenge him.
The Green New Deal is just a warmed-over version of Bernie Sanders's 2015 Keep It in the Ground Act.
Every year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants, consisting of mostly low-skilled foreign nationals who are only entering the country because they have foreign relatives already living in the U.S. In 2016, the illegal and legal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.
We clearly had to threaten him so that he would finally move, a government official told the French newspaper Libération.
The article also shows the sticks that pressure Latin Americans to head north.
However, even the CNN article concedes there is more than thin skin behind the decision. For one thing, Abrams was not merely critical of Trump in a few random comments last year. He penned a May 2016 op-ed for the Weekly Standard entitled, When You Can't Stand Your Candidate, which declared Trump unfit for office, incorrectly predicted he couldn't possibly win, and compared him to George McGovern. (For those who lack 69-year-old Abrams' perspective on political history, that is not a flattering comparison.)
Earlier this month, Breitbart News reported on Perry's research on the University of Michigan's diversity office. As a part of his investigation into the school's female-only programs and initiatives, Perry found that the University of Michigan's diversity office features almost 100 employees and a payroll of $11 million before benefits.
The migration crisis has been a major point of contention between the two neighbours, with Denmark's right-wing government actively discouraging migrants and refugees from settling in the country.
Nearly nine out of 10 people nominated the cost of housing being too high as a reason for not increasing Australia's population, while 84 per cent of people said that cities are too crowded and there is too much traffic, he said in a media statement.
One way that Bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. If elected, Bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former President Barack Obama. A portion of the new refugees will be individuals fleeing the impact of climate change, an idea also favored by Bloomberg's more progressive rivals, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer.
It is also a system replete with ironies. The state that gave Ronald Reagan to America, and with him a new brand of unapologetic conservatism, is one in which the survival of the population depends on massive investments in infrastructure — albeit paid for, ultimately, by water users themselves.
We have increased the size of the teams that review reports [of terrorist activity], reducing our response time significantly. We also look into other accounts similar to those reported and leverage proprietary spam-fighting tools to surface other potentially violating accounts for review by our agents, said the company. We have already seen results, including an increase in account suspensions and this type of activity shifting off of Twitter.
The federal USCIS agency provides some data, including data about the uncapped OPT program, sometimes called the Mini-H-1B.
These stringent calls for tougher border policy appear to have ceased since Donald Trump took office as President of the United States.

The Vice President slammed ABC for its attack on Christianity. During an interview with Axios, the VP said, It's just simply wrong for ABC to have a television program that expresses that kind of religious intolerance. He added that the whole discussion shows how out of touch some in the mainstream media is.

The Falun Dafa Association UK told the Commission that while it is unknown how many Falun Gong practitioners have disappeared in the country, they believe the number is in the tens of thousands. The group said that many of the missing Falun Gong members are believed to have met horrible deaths as a victim of state-run organ harvesting.
The poll is bad news for Democrats, who are increasingly claiming there is no border crisis that President Trump can cite to declare a national emergency and then build a border wall with unspent funds.

Father Cervellera also took issue with the ambiguity surrounding the proposed agreement between the Vatican and the Chinese government, which raises a series of concerns.
The dissent between the U.S.-backed groups and IS and Nusra Front … was about the distribution of resources. And the proof is that on the eve of last month's Geneva talks, Saudi Arabia, backed by America, demanded that the areas controlled by Nusra be included in the ceasefire agreement, which Syria and Russia dismissed out of hand. America was subsequently left with no choice but to declare Nusra, Riyadh's ally, a terrorist organization.

Ole Miss law professor Antonia Eliason is challenging Rep.

While praising Tsai, Pompeo's statement is significantly less than she received when she was first elected – in 2016, the same year as President Donald Trump. Tsai called the president-elect to congratulate him in November of that year and he accepted the call, breaking decades of precedent in Washington to disregard the president of Taiwan and outraging Beijing.
A steady hand is on the steering wheel. We are meeting on a daily basis and there is a very orderly division of the areas of responsibility, management and backing, Netanyahu said.
The California primary will take place on Super Tuesday, March 3, instead of in early June, as in previous years.
China used to publish the number of mass incidents occurring in the country. The number of mass incidents of unrest recorded by the Chinese government grew from 8,700 in 1993 to about 90,000 in 2010, according to several government-backed studies. The government stopped publishing the figures in 2010, but it is reasonable to believe that the number of mass incidents per year is well into the hundreds of thousands. If even just one of these mass incidents occurred in America or Europe, it would be international news, so the fact that hundreds of such mass incidents occur in China EVERY DAY indicates how socially unstable China is.
And the cost of this migrant demographic is staggering.
Buttigieg's, Biden's and Bloomberg's campaigns all say they are also paying for carbon offsets.
In particular, Haley has put focus on the Human Rights Council for its anti-Israel bias and a membership that includes countries such as Venezuela, Cuba and Saudi Arabia. In June she called the Council a haven of dictators.

Steve Warren, the spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State.
A number of tech sites and services have banned President Trump in the wake of the Capitol Hill protests. Breitbart News recently reported that the e-commerce platform Shopify banned TrumpStore.com, a website run by the Trump campaign and Trump Organization. The removal appears to be in response to the events in Washington D.C. this week.
In a speech to the National Foreign Trade Council, Tai hinted at the guiding principles she is set to focus on as the successor to USTR Robert Lighthizer, who has praised the nominee for her involvement in whipping Democrat support for President Trump's United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
It is a sad day for America, Pelosi told reporters. We were given no choice.
Cohn initially entered the Trump administration in opposition to U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, while Kudlow continuously only saw tariffs as a negotiating tactic rather than long-term policy to reshore manufacturing and production back to the U.S., as Lighthizer and Navarro intended.
But tn times of drought, such as the unusually severe drought that gripped the state from 2011 to 2017, storage is the most salient priority. And McClintock believes there is too little of it.
A woman who claims to have smuggled a pregnant migrant into the United Kingdom has spoken exclusively to Breitbart London, recalling how she was duped into believing that the asylum seeker was Syrian when in fact she was Tunisian.
If you don't think it's illegal, you're not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it, added the senator.
Here we are in the tenth year of the war, and America and its allies are still chasing a mirage, lost at sea without a beach, he wrote, evidently about a year before U.S. special forces raided his compound, shot him, and dumped his body at sea, far away from any beaches.
Hawley also said Tuesday that the Donald Trump administration should consider additional travel restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus throughout the United States.
Violent protests on college campuses throughout the country, including Evergreen State College, University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Virginia, have led think tanks that seek to protect the First Amendment rights of all students to provide model bills to state lawmakers.
Scornfully mocking those who suggest waiting for facts, should tell you all you need to know about journalists like Jemele Hill. However, had she waited for the facts, she would have learned some interesting things about the case from Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who is black.
The health secretary confirmed after the press conference that there have been 53 deaths from COVID-19 in the UK.
Trump described the election as one of the most important elections in history. It's a biggie, he said, as he pitched Perdue and Loeffler as senators who share Georgia values and lambasted Ossoff and Warnock as fringe extremists.
The move represents either a complete lack of awareness on the part of the NFL (a definite possibility given their track record) or a really good attempt at humor.
Another report released over the weekend showed that the number of drownings in the Mediterranean Sea had also dropped, despite alarms from migrant transport NGOs that drownings would increase under the new policy. Figures from the UNHCR showed there to have been 2,269 migrants deaths at sea in 2018, down from 3,139 the previous year.
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy will discuss the latest Brussels suicide bombing, the death of Otto Warmbier, and the USS Fitzgerald's collision off Tokyo Bay.

Falun Gong, a spiritual Chinese religious movement in the Buddhist tradition, was outlawed by the CCP in 1999, with the government classifying the religion as an evil cult, prompting decades of persecution from the state.
Democrats are blocking wall spending, but they have other policy goals in trade, infrastructure, healthcare, and the environment, Vaughan said. For example, Democrats want to add more worker protection to the NAFTA 2 treaty, and they want more construction projects in big cities, she said. Trump should offer concessions in those areas, and so force Democrats to deal or reveal the political cost of their obstructionism, she said.
Responding to the British figures, the Home Office explained that Eurostat's figures were higher than its own figures because they included dependants seeking asylum, not just the main applicants.
Amid chaos, these people want to preserve their normal lives as much as possible. So they want to stay as close as possible to people from their homelands in order to maintain a last bit of stability.

On Tuesday's Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, Eberstadt told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that there is a gradual awakening to the reality that the new contours aren't going to make possible this seven percent year-on-year-on-year-on-year-on growth that our CIA and international financial markets and Chinese planners thought was going to be the basis for the Asian Century.
A spokesman said: The United Kingdom has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to those who genuinely need our protection.
In comparison, the ratio was only about five times household income at the 2007 peak, and just 4 times income at the prior housing price peaks of 1987 and 2001, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.
But the Cameron/Osborne era, you might have hoped, was a period of embarrassing, faux-Conservative sclerosis, incompetence and managed decline from which a forward-looking Conservative PM like Boris Johnson would hope to distance himself.
They know they cannot afford to be seen blocking border security. We have to remember that Nancy Pelosi is not in the Speaker's chair now because voters want to abolish ICE or open the border. The Democrats [in November] won because there were a lot of Democratic candidates who won because they said they were just as hawkish on immigration as Republicans.
There are technically two votes for the Speakership. The first is in conference, where members of a party select whom their candidate will be. Democrats already selected Pelosi as their conference's candidate with a late November vote of 203-32 with three blank ballots and one absent member. The second, and more consequential, vote is on the floor of the House of Representatives. The first order of business of a new Congress is for the House to elect a Speaker. So, when the 115th Congress disbands and the 116th Congress is sworn in, before the House can do anything else, the chamber must elect a Speaker.
What people forget is that he did grow up under very difficult circumstances. He went to Eureka College [in Illinois], played football, and almost instantly became a big radio star in the Midwest. He worked for WHO, the big radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, and he recreated the Chicago Cubs baseball games. He got a great interest in horseback riding. So he was a glamorous figure by those standards. And then he went to the West Coast to cover the Cubs in spring training, and somebody said to him, 'You ought to take a crack at Hollywood.' And he became a contract player for Universal Pictures. This was all before he was 30. So he had a rocket ride to some considerable success at that time. That would have been in those moments that would have been the American dream fulfilled.
O'Reilly is one of many verified Twitter users that comment on Trump's tweets, often criticizing the president or pushing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. In another of President Trump's tweets criticizing the mainstream media, United Press International writer Ben Hooper continued to push the conspiracy theory that Russia somehow spread fake news in order to benefit Trump.
He lied to Congress. Nobody chose to impeach him. But he lied to Congress and committed a felony. Is he in jail? No — he's making millions of dollars as a contributor on television now, using and peddling his national security influence for dollars, after having committed a felony in lying to us. These are the people who plotted to bring the president down. These are the people who continue to plot to bring the president down.
In both incidents, users had their names, email addresses, dates of birth, security questions and answers, phone numbers, and hashed passwords stolen by hackers, including the details of over 150,000 government employees.
A group of law enforcement organizations also denounced the policy, saying the move is a strike against public safety.
He pointing to countries who had their own protective import taxes of 70, 80, 90, even 100 percent.
Legal experts say the act gives the president the power to declare a national emergency. But the act does not require presidents to prove a crisis exists to declare an emergency — it's at their sole discretion.
Following both hacking incidents, and the revelation that Yahoo had been secretly scanning user emails for U.S. intelligence agencies, Verizon reportedly sought a significant discount on its purchase of the company, though the exact figure is currently unknown.
The White House can use unspent funds to build a wall if President Donald Trump declares a national emergency and fends off various lawsuits, say lawyers cited in media reports.
The prime minister made those comments while visiting Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.
White House officials are increasingly emphasizing the cartels' role in smuggling labor and drugs into the United States. The cartels are massive criminal enterprises, Homeland defense secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told reporters January 7. They don't just deal with smuggling. They exploit children. They deal with trafficking, they deal with drugs. That emphasis will help officials fend off commonplace Democratic claims that Trump's support for the border wall is merely an expression of racial animus.
A Goldwater-based bill has already become law in North Carolina. Additionally, another has cleared the state House in Wisconsin and has already been adopted by the Board of Regents at the University of Wisconsin.
Well, on Monday John Kerry consulted with the Russians and announced a new peace plan — and it contained exactly the same elements as the old peace plan. What the hell do these people think they're doing?
Something very difficult due to Cubans' nature, but very necessary, is the elimination of effusive greetings, he said. No kisses or hugs and greetings at a prudent distance until the epidemic passes by.
However, again, if Hill had waited for the train of facts, she would know that the men were held until the police were told that Starbucks had no desire to prosecute, and then released.
The Bee added: Health care has become a lesser focus for Democrats, according to the poll.
Utah allows open carry of a handgun without a permit, but a person legally—and openly—carrying a handgun requires a concealed permit if his jacket or sweater hangs down over the gun, thereby hiding it from plain sight.

Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner has admitted that the focus of the British political class on ethnic minorities and women's agendas has seen the white working class — and white working-class boys in particular — falling by the wayside.
The sanctions would be part of a multi-pronged approach of increased economic and diplomatic pressure – especially on Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with North Korea – plus beefed-up defenses by the United States and its South Korean and Japanese allies, according to the administration official familiar with the deliberations, Reuters adds.
Andrzejewski asked, Can public figures, can public governments, violate federal law with no consequences and no penalties?
The Times of Israel reports: A day after officials in Jerusalem said Israel and New Zealand agreed to end their diplomatic spat surrounding Wellington's co-sponsoring of an anti-settlements resolution at the United Nations, the country's leader rejected any suggestion that patching the rift equaled pulling support for the measure.
With cases and deaths rising around the world even as the rate of new infections slows in the virus epicentre China, Germany on Wednesday warned that the outbreak had turned into a global pandemic.
The framework's hopes for bringing Japan and South Korea closer together to counter China have sadly not been realized; as of Wednesday, Japan was thinking about ejecting the South Korean ambassador over the latest developments in the long-running dispute over Japanese compensation for World War Two atrocities. ASEAN signed a gigantic trade pact with China in November, a development China hailed as the end of U.S. hegemony in the West Pacific.
We make everyone from Central America wait in line, while the Cubans walk in even though they are not refugees, Gabriel Lopez, a Mexican-American Navy veteran who is president of the group of veterans who have been protesting the Cubans in Laredo, told reporters. We are saying, don't open the borders to Cubans and give them instant benefits while we have American veterans living on the streets.
The law will take full effect on January 1, 2018.
In December 2018, foreign-born worker employment increased 5 percent compared to the same time last year, adding an additional more than 1,300 workers. Meanwhile, native-born Americans saw an employment increase of only 1.2 percent year-to-year, five times less job growth as their foreign worker competitors.
One of the things our campus free speech bill does, in addition to insisting the colleges adopt good statements defending free speech and explaining the meaning of free speech, we insist there be a section of freshman orientation where the students are taught about these statements, and that they're taught about the policy that disciplines people who shut down speakers. So, there is an educational element in our legislation, but ultimately legislation can never be a complete solution. There has to be a change in which we start to really educate students again in the principles of free speech and what classical liberalism of the kind the Founders practiced are all about. If we don't do that, this generation is going to be lost and the country is going to be lost.
Culture secretary Nicky Morgan has warned that the BBC could go the way of Blockbuster — becoming a total irrelevancy and going bust — unless it evolves.
Polls show that Americans do not want to be hostile to people who wish to live as members of the opposite sex. But the polls also show that the policy changes required by the transgender ideology are deeply unpopular and are increasingly opposed by conservatives and feminists. Breitbart News reported in October 2020:
That foreshadows California's grim fate — if it cannot find solutions now.
A Silicon Valley elementary school recently told third-graders to rank themselves according to their power and privilege, whistleblower documents revealed.
Essentially, what we'd like to see is that they continue what the State Department has done, bringing together – I think it's now 32 countries – through a ministerial on religious freedom to set some standards worldwide, Curry noted, referring to the annual conferences founded by the Trump-era State Department to give foreign ministers a venue to discuss how to bolster religious freedom at home. But I also think you look first to those people we have international relationships with, like India. If China wants to be part of the international community – that is a big question mark – but if they do, we have to have some standards of human rights that are agreed upon.
Please do one thing for your country this week: sign + share this petition with friends, family and colleagues. Let's make MPs notice complex structures made 2017 that bind UK to EU defence decisions.
Salvini insists the decision had the backing of the government and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
In 2019, House Democrats passed a bill that would establish the transgender ideology by giving people the legal right to force other people to treat them as members of the opposite sex. The draft bill is called the Equality Act and will get another vote in 2021.
Unfortunately over the past week we've seen a shift to a more adverse scenario for the global economy, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said.
Mr Keidan said: The Court of Appeal has made it clear the status quo cannot continue. The Government should now recognise the benefits of opening civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples.
However, if he is eventually convicted he would be barred from politics for six to eight years.
What a shame if that were to happen! Bolton added sarcastically.
I was shocked at the number of violent criminals set free by Travis County–and these are just the ones that ICE knows about because they were re-arrested, Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughan told Breitbart Texas at the time. There could be many others who have not yet been found by ICE. It's wrong for Travis County to put the public safety at risk for its narrow political purposes, and wrong to put ICE and other law enforcement officers at risk when they have to take to the streets to catch these people, or when they re-offend.
In my opinion, the company try to stop people from using the company as a tool to emigrate to Western Europe, so if they find out you want to settle down in Western Europe they will tell you to leave, he said.

When you put that over making sure people have decent jobs and healthcare, like, it's a fucking no-brainer why we're going to God damn lose an election, he adds.
Regardless of our nation's polarized views on the policy and politics of abortion, it is clear that our Constitution does not include a right to abort children merely because of disfavored characteristics, the authors conclude.
I understand it, he said of trying to live progressive values at all times, but the reality is, there's a big risk of being perceived as being an ideologue and not a problem-solver.
For example, the rules require the committees to use the plural pronoun themself instead of the singular pronouns, the male himself or the female herself.
YouTube, the Google-owned video platform, said it would escalate efforts to crack down on election misinformation amid an unprecedented campaign of censorship against President Trump from other Silicon Valley companies.
A male student at Dartmouth College is facing a significant backlash to an op-ed he wrote in a student newspaper criticizing a campus program that hires mostly female students.
In other cases, soldiers from EU member state's armies have worn identifying patches with the EU flag, and even blue cravats for ceremonial work.
The official said he believes the radical Sunni organization's recent capture of the town of Ahwar shows that Washington's airborne surgical offensive against its leaders has failed to undermine the terrorist group's military infrastructure and degrade its will to fight.
Because otherwise the deal risks being 'limp,' he said.
The Tuesday tweet from CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang said, This morning a White House official referred to [the] coronavirus as the 'Kung-Flu' to my face. Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back.

According to the Wall Street Journal:
China exports 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of active ingredients used to make drugs in America. America is losing its ability to make pharmaceuticals because of Chinese dumping of low-price products into the global market.
Former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton discussed the threat of expansionist China on Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon, who has personal experience with the region.
We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise, the 17 Democrats wrote in their letter. Therefore, we are committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House floor.
On Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked guest Frank Gaffney about a post he wrote on the Center for Security Policy blog, in which he endorsed a call by Jeanine Pirro of Fox News for House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign following the failure of the House Obamacare replacement bill.
Meanwhile, online vitriol towards Ma has heated up (or been ramped up) dramatically. Usually known as Uncle Horse – as his Chinese surname 'Ma' means horse – he has recently been damned as a money-grabbing 'vampire' who exploits the poor, in state media outlets strongly criticising him, even the People's Daily. For a tycoon acclaimed around the world for his entrepreneurial brilliance, as well as generosity and flamboyant promotional activities, that is an extraordinary turnaround. Jack Ma is now embracing supervision at an undisclosed location, the CCP mouthpiece has reported. […] A statement in the leading state media outlet said there would be no Jack Ma era, and that reflects the current Chinese slogan that China is entering a 'new era.'
The revelation of the database has already sparked criticism from some prominent conservative media figures. Fox News's Brit Hume replied, This will not end well.
Twitter censored the president during the summer for allegedly suggesting that Antifa and Black Lives Matter-aligned rioters could be shot.
Mayorkas has a long record of not enforcing the nation's immigration laws, despite the damage it does to Americans and recent immigrants. President Barack Obama appointed him USCIS director in 2009 and promoted him in 2013 to deputy secretary at DHS, despite no support from GOP Senators.
LISTEN TO SEN. DAVID PERDUE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
This past June, Gregory once again attacked the president, declaring that his visit to the shrine of Saint John Paul II in Washington, DC, was a photo opportunity and a manipulation of a Catholic sanctuary, adding that it violates our religious principles.
You can look at what happens in other countries where programs and policies like, for example, different policies on health care — which you and I probably disagree about — do work, he told Pollak.
In major policy shift, China will demolish thousands of migrant homes in cities
I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree, the archbishop said.
To date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support. And—it is my duty as speaker to say this—nearly 750 bills that the House has passed remain stuck in the United States Senate. But the rest made it into law. We have taken on some of the biggest challenges of our time, and made a great and lasting difference in the trajectory of this country. We began a historic rebuilding of our military and national defense. We enacted new and tough sanctions on some of our biggest foes. We ushered in a new career and technical education system. Record regulatory reform to help small businesses. A long-sought expansion of domestic energy production, to be followed by America's new energy dominance. To stem the tide of opioid addiction, the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. Criminal justice reform to give more people a chance at redemption. A landmark crackdown on human trafficking that is already yielding results and saving lives. A VA with real accountability, and finally, better care for veterans. And, after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years. Think about it. We went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive.
His trade adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of benefiting from a weak euro that boosts its exports. Germany rejects the charge, saying it sells more abroad because its companies make competitive products and that it can't do much to influence the euro's exchange rate since eurozone monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank.
It's not known how soon such studies will answer whether any of the drugs help. And many patients recover without needing any treatment. The biggest concern is how to help the fraction who become severely ill.
The big reason that having children, and even marrying in the first place, hurts women's pay relative to men's is that the division of labor at home is still unequal, even when both spouses work full time. That's especially true for college-educated women in high-earning occupations: Children are particularly damaging to their careers.

Overall, as of 2005, nearly 860,000 refugees have been resettled across America—a large proportion going to areas that have lagged behind the rest of the country in economic growth since the Great Recession. The incoming refugees have stressed the already depleted resources of state and local governments. The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) estimates that it costs taxpayers more than $64,000 over five years to resettle one Syrian refugee. To resettle an entire family, the cost estimate rises to more than $257,000 over five years.
Syria's Prime Minister Imad Khamis was also leading a high-level delegation to Iran, which includes the defense and foreign ministers. Syrian state media described it as an important visit in light of recent events, without elaborating. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country's civil war, and Soleimani had mobilized militias and coordinated military aid.
The mass-circulation Bild newspaper described it as a day of horror for Merkel, as calls multiplied for her to change tack.
Migrants workers are almost always marginalized and work in low-paid jobs. They are subject to various kinds of abuse, including forced overtime and non-payment of salaries. The vast majority of rural migrant workers are still employed in low-paid jobs in manufacturing, construction, and services. According to NBS figures, the employment by sector is as follows:
Of the 206 companies under review, 143 are based in Israel or in the settlements, 22 in the United States, seven in Germany, five in the Netherlands and four in France.
Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, reviewed the case of Interpol in detail. He was outraged by Taiwan's exclusion, pointing out that it defies common sense, might possibly violate Interpol's constitution, and most certainly violates American law.
If these musings had been received for what they actually were—the wacky theories of a crackpot academic—all would have been well. But The Population Bomb sold some 3 million copies and influenced an entire generation.
Georgia's runoff elections for the Peach State's seats in U.S. Senate are all about divided government, declared Charles Hurt, Washington Times opinion editor, Breitbart News columnist, and author of Still Winning: Why America Went All In on Donald Trump-And Why We Must Do It Again, in a Monday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.
By Pelosi's logic, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) could just as easily claim that he is equal to the president in power — and his claim would arguably hold more weight, given the pre-eminence of the Senate.
Lacker, who has been the head of the Richmond Fed for 13 years, stopped short of admitting that he was the source of the information and said that it was not his intention to reveal confidential information in his conversation with the analyst. CNBC's Steve Liesman reported Tuesday afternoon that an attorney for Lacker said that federal authorities have said no charges will be filed against his client.
Although the question left the possibility of Austria falling into line with the EU at a later date should a continent-wide approach to the migrant crisis be agreed on, to the respondents this seemed a remote possibility. Some 83 per cent said they couldn't see any sort of agreement between the EU-28 in the next few weeks.
We've known for a while that this was not the case.
The operation was intended to drive Taliban forces from the area around Kunduz, which they had overrun in October 2015, and partially occupied the year before that. Specifically, two senior Taliban commanders were targeted in village of Buz-e-Kandahari. (They were indeed killed during the raid, along with an estimated 26 Taliban fighters.)
Durov concluded by warning of disinformation spread about Telegram across social media by bots. We have also detected bots which spread inaccurate information about Telegram on social media, he wrote.
Merkel enthusiastically backed Macron a week later, calling for a real, true European army — the prospect of which was often dismissed as a dangerous fantasy by Remain campaigners in the run-up to the British vote to leave the bloc.
Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news.
Two more bills would require the United States to cede authority and sovereignty to global institutions.
This failure has created a festering injustice, and continues to be exploited by Daesh (Islamic State) and its kind, he said. Left unresolved, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will become a religious conflict of a global dimension. And it is only a matter of time before we may be faced by yet another war in Gaza or in South Lebanon.
And as such, the American people see right through–at least all but 12 percent of them per this latest poll from Civiqs. And it's not just that poll that shows Ryan leaves office as damaged goods: Gallup, out with a new survey on Thursday, finds Ryan down at 34 percent–a massive drop-off and the lowest he has ever been in Gallup.

Netanyahu's visit to the United States in March 2015 also took place two weeks before the Israeli election that year.
In the tech business this is sometimes referred to as channel stuffing and can seriously distort the true picture of customer demand. If iPhones go unsold on dealer shelves, they can be returned to Apple for a refund or serve as stranded inventory that clogs up reorders by dealers.
Perhaps most significantly, 88 per cent of French said they supported banning the rapidly expanding, radical Salafist sect of Islam, even though over half of respondents said they acknowledged that implementing the ban in France would be difficult, if not impossible.

Despite corporate claims, the vast majority of these foreign workers are lower-skill graduates performing starter jobs that could help Americans launch their careers. In fact, the huge H-1B and OPT programs have created an army of staffing contractors which is used by many Americans companies to lock many American graduates out of starter jobs in software, science, and engineering.
WOLF BLITZER: It was awkward at the very beginning, Jake. It looked like Nancy Pelosi was ready to shake [President Trump's] hand. He did not respond. In the very end, it looked like she was sort of ripping up the advanced copy of the speech he had presented.
The freshman congressman has also garnered criticism from former Democrat lawmakers — notably ex-Sen. Joe Liberman (I-CT) — who recently said Ocasio-Cortez's call for a 70% marginal tax rate is proof that she does not represent the future of her party.
Trump has declined to hire a permanent replacement for Dan Coats, who stepped down as DNI in August after standing firm on the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in 2016 to back Trump over Hillary Clinton.
Anyone who fails to provide the necessary documents will be turned back, and travel operators who fail to comply risk a fine.
Most American Jews don't think that American Jews should tell Israel how to handle the security and other challenges it faces. And even as anti-Israel groups in the American Jewish community receive adulation and attention disproportionate to their small numbers, they do not seem to have built major inroads into the Jewish community. This explains why their efforts are directed towards weakening existing Jewish institutions rather than building their own. Their constituencies are too small to support them.
Tillerson and his team should do to more to build trust with the State Department workforce and bring them along, rather than worrying about stamping out leaks, Rogin asserts. Most State Department officials would prefer to influence policy through the proper channels, if that is an option.
I will direct the Bureau of Prisons to end the Trump Administration's dangerous policy of imprisoning transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth and ensure that all facilities meet the needs of transgender people, including by providing medically necessary care, like transition-related surgeries, while incarcerated, she added.

Tuesday on CNN's Newsroom, political analyst for the network and veteran reporter Carl Bernstein questioned if President Donald Trump was fit to be the President of the United States.
Nationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
The only interest of these people is to obtain a passport allowing them to move freely in the European area, said Albanian historian Pellumb Xhufi.
His Atlantic op-ed ignores the economic impact of releasing 30,000 migrants into Americans' blue-collar job market, where they can join hundreds of thousands who flooded in during 2019. That huge labor supply reduces blue collar wages and drives up housing costs in blue collar neighborhoods.
Christie said he had been asked to do the response to the State of the Union address in the past, but chose not to.

Both parties in the potential coalition arrangement have agreed to crack down on immigration to Italy, but exactly how and to what extent is believed to be one of the areas still up for agreement.
From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this split could be significant as the first signs of a new internal rebellion, for which China is overdue. China's history is filled with huge, massive internal rebellions (civil wars), the most recent of which were the White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1805), the Taiping Rebellion (1850-64) and Mao's Communist Revolution (1934-49). The leaders of China's Communist Party (CCP) are well aware of this history, and they are aware that a new internal rebellion is now due, and probably overdue.

President Trump has been talking up the amount of money the UAE's allies in Saudi Arabia are prepared to invest in Syrian reconstruction, to the consternation of Saudis who apparently cannot see the bountiful opportunities for lavish profit promised by Syrian officials.

A group of Brussels-based activists, including staff from the European Parliament are hosting a migrant-based talent show this evening for solidarity and humanity.
Most American Jews don't think that American Jews should tell Israel how to handle the security and other challenges it faces. And even as anti-Israel groups in the American Jewish community receive adulation and attention disproportionate to their small numbers, they do not seem to have built major inroads into the Jewish community. This explains why their efforts are directed towards weakening existing Jewish institutions rather than building their own. Their constituencies are too small to support them.
Let's be clear: @BLM_Nashville meetings are safe spaces for black folks and non-black POC. — Joshua (@Crutch4) February 19, 2016
When asked about whether strict enforcement of prioritization was fueling delays, Cuomo did not directly address the question and instead defended his administration's decision on who to prioritize.
The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
The Senate will transform itself into an impeachment court at noon Thursday. The Constitution calls for Chief Justice John Roberts to preside at the trial, administering the oath to senators who will serve as jurors and swear to deliver impartial justice.
Both confirmed that the Great Reset — world domination by a technocratic elite in which ordinary folk will own no property and will be subject to CCP-style social credit controls on their freedoms — is closely allied with the environmental movement's concept of 'sustainability' and living within the planet's means. In this view of the world, humans are considered a verminous plague on the planet rather than, as Christians prefer to see it, God's greatest creation made in His image.
This was done to demonstrate the American ideal and American exceptionalism. The White House would the the shining city on a hill that demonstrated American power to the word and gave the American people pride in their government.
It is in this vote that Pelosi faced the most potential peril before now. After the midterm elections, when it was clear Democrats were taking the majority in the House next year, 17 Democrats banded together to sign a letter pledging to oppose Pelosi, not just in the intra-conference vote but on the floor of the House as well.
As Grassley explains to Comey in his letter, the Washington Post reported last week that the FBI reached an agreement a few weeks before the presidential election to pay Steele for continuing investigations of President Trump:
We promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise, the 17 Democrats wrote in their letter. Therefore, we are committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House floor.
And when he got divorced [from first wife Jane Wyman], it was very hard for him to accept. He kept thinking for awhile that they would get back together again. But Ms. Wyman, whom I didn't know, but I've heard from others who talked to her, just, he was consumed with politics 24-7. He was the head of the Screen Actors Guild for example. He was very liberal, he was very involved in politics, and then he made the transition to becoming the kind of typical conservative of his time. Divorce in those days was almost a lower s scandale. People didn't get divorced. They covered it up. I think he was very conscious of that. He came out of a strong Protestant background in the Midwest. He was part of that culture. His mother was a huge influence on him.

Five Republican Senators reintroduced the WALL Act Tuesday, a bill to fully fund a wall along the U.S. southern border.
Others are sounding the alarm not because of what it implies of those who lost the missile, but how those who found it can use it against the United States. As Mary Anastasia O'Grady at the Wall Street Journal points out, Cuba is just about the only friend the pariah regime in North Korea has: In the past 2½ years Cuba has tried to smuggle weapons to Pyongyang, engaged in high-level meetings with North Korean officials, and secured US military technology. Anybody want to connect the dots?
The 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty included a stealth provision which allowed companies to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates of U.S. universities.

However, rather than denounce the various 'No Whites' internships and training programmes which have been introduced by public broadcasters, police forces, and so on using the so-called 'positive action' clauses in Britain's equality legislation, Ms. Rayner chose to blame white culture.
Between 1995 and 2006, the USDA defined four broad categories of food security: food secure, food insecure without hunger, food insecure with moderate hunger, and food insecure with severe hunger. In 2006, they changed their categories to persons with low food security and those with very low food security. They dropped food insecurity with hunger because not enough respondents reported that they felt hunger at any point during the reporting year. This ought to be a tip-off that something is fishy with government hunger numbers.
They plan to march on the 7th March, and say they are not worried about how many people turn out as they are after action, not publicity. The situation in Calais is known to all, what we want is a strong policy response, they commented.

McConnell said during his floor speech that he originally emphasized four urgent priorities for Senate legislation to help the nation get through the crisis. Those included direct financial assistance to the American people, aid to small businesses to keep paychecks flowing, and measures to both stabilize key industries to prevent mass layoffs and flood more recourses into the frontline healthcare battle itself.
This is our last chance to veto this government policy, which is ruining us, Pitoń has said — and, perhaps slightly cheekily, invited Polish president Andrzej Duda to come down to the Tatra mountains for a skiing trip himself, saying he could become a modern-day Casimir — a legendary Polish ruler remembered as the Restorer for returning from exile to reunite much of his realm a thousand years ago.
This problem is more than evident in a recent report from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on global temperature trends. Between them, the two agencies operate the most accurate, comprehensive system of temperature measuring instruments in the world. But rather than cite data from their best sources when NASA and NOAA reported global temperatures on January 15, they chose to use severely compromised data from temperature readings adjusted—in a process called homogenization—they and others gathered from biased monitoring stations.
It was the Fed's third consecutive rate increase, signaling a definitive end to the Fed's nine-year old economic stimulus scheme. The move indicates the Fed's confidence in the stability of the economy, although it does not necessarily indicate that the Fed is attempting to slow economic growth. Monetary policy makers believe that low rates support economic growth by lowering the cost of borrowing for businesses, homebuyers and consumers; raising rates is believed to reduce central bank support for the economy.
When constitutional crisis emerged, such as in the National Bank debate authorization conflict, Washington did not simply mock the idea of following the founding document as some modern politicians have. Washington consulted the greatest legal minds of his generation and settled on policy he believed was in the scope of the the Constitution's original intention.
Yes on the April Corley case, and with respect to conversations about prisoners, there are few things that occupy more of my mind than getting Americans back from everyplace, and the Iranian regime has been particularly brutal with respect to the unlawful detention of Americans. I mean, Bob Levinson goes back now years. I don't want to say more than to say that we are very focused. We have the whole team, certainly at the State Department but across the entire United States Government, that night and day tirelessly is working to return Americans wherever they're wrongfully detained. And that certainly includes folks that are held inside the Islamic Republic of Iran as well.
Also last year, Pentagon officials conceded some American taxpayer-funded weapons sent to Iraq to combat ISIS likely ended up in enemy hands as a result of the U.S. Army's failure to accurately track and secure the military equipment.
The subject matter should merit our audience's interests, and be worthy of our time, space and resources; we should be in position to discuss the issue with authority and be factually accurate. The topic should be related to a current issue impacting sports, unless otherwise approved by senior editorial management. This condition may vary for content appearing on platforms with broader editorial missions – such as The Undefeated, FiveThirtyEight and espnW. Commentaries on relevant sports-related issues are appropriate, but we should refrain from overt partisanship or endorsement of particular candidates, politicians or political parties. The presentation should be thoughtful and respectful. We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric. Communication with producers and editors must take place prior to commentary on any political or social issues to manage volume and ensure a fair and effective presentation.
Identity politics are disgusting in general, but it's especially sad when a University as reputable as Stanford will openly discriminate against men 'to be more inclusive of women' while simultaneously denying veterans even visible affirmation in their guiding document, Behrendt wrote.
Small businesses are concerned about potential new economic policy in the new administration and the increased spread of COVID-19 that is causing renewed government-mandated business closures across the nation, Dunkelberg said.
An astonishing 10,000 millionaires left France in 2015 thanks to rising social tensions caused by Islamic immigration and terrorism. But while Britain has been warned to expect a similar exodus should racial tensions also rise here, the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union is more likely to keep millionaires within our shores.

We need to make it easier in some respects for people to come here legally and work temporarily and then go home, particularly in the agriculture industry, Romney told CNN's Jake Tapper on January 2. In Utah, we rely on a lot of people coming in to harvest crops and so forth, he said, adding, We ought to be guided by what the states need, as opposed to what the federal government imposes on them.
Iran previously has broken limits of its enrichment, its stockpiles and its centrifuges, as well as restarted enrichment at an underground facility.

The attorney general cited the historical experience of fellow English-speaking countries Australia and Canada, both of which have long had well-developed, strict merit-based immigration criteria, in support of the proposition.

Pelosi has already committed to convene weekly meetings between leadership and the chairs of the Tri-Caucus groups. During her successful campaign to reclaim the speaker's gavel, Pelosi sat down with each of the groups — and made promises to them, the Chronicle reported.
That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function.
Nelson said that the White House didn't invite him to the meeting on purpose. He continued, I'm not unhappy about it. I think it shows the excessive partisanship of, if not the president, at least those around him, which is so silly. I mean, what people want is they want us to come together in bipartisan agreement.
Great news, Americans! You lost your jobs, your businesses collapsed, your children were denied an education, your freedoms were stolen, you were imprisoned in your own home, you were forced to wear a mask, you couldn't travel – but it was all worth it because guess what? In 2020, thanks to Chinese Coronavirus, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions fell by ten whole per cent last year.
What is on their agenda? Well, pack the Supreme Court, Barbour explained. Add three more Supreme Court justices, to make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico states — by a simple majority vote. They want to do that. Their agenda for energy is very plainly stated. They want a carbon-free economy. You know, a carbon-free economy — not gasoline cars, not natural gas cars. They want electricity to be generated in some way, through solar and that sort of stuff. If you look where it is actually happening in the United States — the volume is nowhere near what it takes in this country for energy generation.
Last fall, Hungary hosted its second international conference on aid to persecuted Christians, emphasizing the need to assist the faithful where they are rather than encouraging them to abandon their homelands.

A third case involved those foreigners who wished to be admitted entirely to their fellowship and mode of worship.

It was about a month ago Congress wasn't quite ready to take that first step to repeal and replace that disastrous policy. But the president remains confident that, with your strong support, and maybe you could talk to a member of Congress before you leave town, that we'll get a fresh start on health care in America … I want to promise you. Working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, President Trump is going to make sure that these majorities and this nation's capitol keep our promise to the American people. We're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the ability to purchase health insurance that they want and not what the government dictates and mandates.

Romney described President Donald Trump as a man whose character falls short in Tuesday-published Washington Post opinion editorial: Trump's character falls short. … With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.

But the answer the massive food lobby favors is quite different: more and more money. They lobby for ever-more government spending, and they work feverishly to convince Americans to kick in yet more private donations as well. Lobbying and fundraising is where they spend a sizable chunk of their vast fortune. They also spend some of their lucre on food pantries and food banks, of which there are something like thirty thousand in this country.

The Hunger Games migration is emptying many towns in Central America. On April 21, the Wall Street Journal reported: COLOTENANGO, Guatemala—Gloria Velásquez is used to saying goodbye. Four of her six siblings have migrated to the U.S. and she, too, is thinking about heading north with her 9-year-old daughter. […] Ms. Velásquez said her four siblings in the U.S. are encouraging her to join them. Her daughter Helen Ixchel likes to teach language and mathematics to fellow children. She wants to learn English and become a teacher. I'm a bit scared [about going to the U.S.] after hearing all the news about the suffering of migrants at the border. But it's my daughter's greatest dream, Ms. Velásquez said. Exporting People: How Central America Encourages Mass Migration: The three Northern Triangle nations spend preciously little on the poor and then reap the financial benefits when they flee, said a Bloomberg headline in 2019: Migration is part of the model, said Seynabou Sakho, the World Bank's director for Central America. A country may not have a big deficit, but at the same time, the needs of its people aren't being met.
Speaking before the House of Commons in September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he has a great deal of sympathy with those who are so desperate [to leave France] as to put their children in dinghies or even children's paddling pools and try to cross the Channel.
As disappointing as the Supreme Court's ruling is, there is a clear path to fixing it: electing a new President who will end Donald Trump's ceaseless attempts to gut every aspect of the Affordable Care Act. If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions.

Well it was, in the truest sense of the word, a deeply emotional relationship, but also very pragmatic. I was just saying on the air a few moments ago that I thought their thespian training, their Hollywood background, helped them in politics, because they were conscious of the fact the country wanted something grand in the Presidency, Brokaw said.

Numerous reports have shown data manipulation is not limited to the United States, but is common across the globe. Temperatures recorded at pristine rural monitoring stations in far flung locations such as Australia, Paraguay, and Switzerland have been inexplicably homogenized so that past temperatures are now reported as cooler than were actually recorded, and recent temperatures are now reported as warmer than were recorded, necessarily making the temperature rise at these locations over the past century appear steeper and larger than the unadjusted data indicate.
Twitter has had little issue with censoring conservative voices on its platform, however, as Breitbart Tech has reported:
Firmly in control of British politics, it now seems unbelievable that they changed their minds on giving Johnson his election — possibly their long string of parliamentary victories and the anti-Brexit mood among street activists in multicultural London had persuaded them they were fighting from a position of strength.

Nevertheless, this seems less the result of a harassment campaign than the most obvious result of Alison Rapp being accountable for decisions in her own life, and Nintendo's right to make decisions for their business.
The faithful in the underground Church are freer without the constant control of the Patriotic Association, Cervellera said. One only has to see what is happening in the official Church, which is controlled completely. There are cameras in the parish offices, in the corridors, the police are always there. This is because China greatly fears religions, he said.
Curry also noted that Christians exist all over the country of China.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

On the subject of Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70% marginal tax rate to fund her Green New Deal, Lieberman said a progressive tax system already exists in the U.S. If you… accumulate income in the country the big bump is still in the middle class, he said. So you've got to be careful about raising taxes too high… a 70 percent tax on high-income people is really done for political reasons.
While the school district attempted to justify its actions with its intention to make equity-based decisions, after an apparently significant response from the community's Asian-American families, officials apologized for the negative impact we have caused and removed the equity report from the district's website.

In the meantime, now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on an eight-day trip to the Middle East, visiting our allies in the region, seeking to bolster regional strength against another rival, Iran. Some of those allies—most notably, Saudi Arabia and Egypt—are intensely controversial here at home, and so that's another reason why Kirkpatrick's wisdom is still so relevant, and important.
After the senators' swearing in, the Senate adjourned until 1:00 pm (1800 GMT) on Tuesday, when the prosecution begins laying out its case against the president.
First of all, there have been a lot of attacks on my staff, and as I said when this issue came up earlier, I'm appalled at some of the smearing of some of the professional people that work for the intelligence committee. Now this question refers to allegations in a newspaper article which are circulating smears on my staff and ask me to respond to those smears and I will not dignify those smears on my staff by giving them any credence whatsoever. Nor will I share any information that I believe could or could not lead to the identification of the whistleblower.

The millions of migrants living in Beijing, often for decades, were the laborers who built Beijing into the huge metropolis that it is today. Now their work is done, and they are being left cold, broke and homeless.
The DOJ's Inspector General report on Crossfire Hurricane describes the FBI's use of a national security briefing to the Trump campaign in August 2016 to try to further its investigation by planting an agent in the room:
It is difficult to bring to mind a more divisive policy, or one more deleterious to social cohesion and respect, than one that allows schools to label children at the start of their lives with certain beliefs and then divide them up on that basis, it reads.
The production of documents in this case was to have been concluded with the FBI's recovery of approximately 5,000 of the 33,000 government emails Clinton took and tried to destroy, but, as you see, this case is still in progress.

Della Rocca added, John Paul had to shut down his business. The day the story broke, the day Twitter refused to allow the story to be disseminated, [Mac Isaac] started getting bad Yelp reviews, calls to the shop, death threats, essentially people trying to destroy his business. That's essentially what happened. He had to close up the business. It's no longer active and he is now 46-years-old trying to figure out what the next thing to do is when you've been a Mac specialist for more than 25 years.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The Americans now understand that they will have to cooperate with Russia and the Syrian regime, which they declined to do before, he added. They now realize that they have to be part of the war against terror, rather than aid and abet it, whether directly or indirectly.
The Iranian parliament on Sunday opened with lawmakers in unison chanting: Death to America! Parliament speaker Ali Larijani compared Soleimani's killing to the 1953 CIA-backed coup that cemented the shah's power and to the U.S. Navy's shootdown of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 that killed 290 people. He also described American officials as following the law of the jungle.

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey, Rector pointed out that 62 percent of adults who reported they 'did not eat' for at least one whole day during the last 30 days before the survey because 'there was not enough money for food,' had smoked cigarettes during the month. Lesson: stop smoking, eat, and feed your family. Rector figured that very low food security smokers consumed nineteen packs of cigarettes per month, at an average cost of $112 per month. That's 63 percent of the cost of food for a single adult under the USDA's Thrifty Food Plan.

The Chinese government appears concerned with Taiwan's moves to protect itself from a mainland invasion. State propaganda outlet Global Times published a column Friday warning Taipei to abandon hopes of being recognized as a sovereign nation and instead accept the status China insists it has as a rogue province. No soldiers believe Taiwan forces are capable to defend the island if the People's Liberation Army (PLA) launches a comprehensive offensive against Taiwan, the column reads. As long as the Tsai government accepts of the 1992 Consensus, the island's security will be ensured. The eight-year-tenure of Ma Ying-Jeou is the most secure period Taiwan has enjoyed since entering the 21st century.

China seeks to dominate cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and bio-genetics, and harness them in the service of authoritarianism. Chinese dominance in these technologies would pose profound challenges to free societies. China's proliferation of its digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations will damage U.S. efforts to promote our values and national interests in the Indo-Pacific region and, increasingly, in the Western hemisphere and at home.
Claims that full control will be returned after this period appear to be misleading, as the text of the deal refers to quotas continuing from mid-2026 onwards — or else the EU is entitled to compensation.

Democrat Rep. Joe Neguse, D.-Colo., for example, cited a poem associated with the Statue of Liberty to portray Trump's security upgrade as reckless, cruel and wrong.
Ryan repeatedly, over the course of the Trump administration, has taken shots at the president on stylistic and political matters–on everything from the Charlottesville incident to Trump's push to end birthright citizenship.But Ryan did not just oppose Trump stylistically and politically: On major policy fronts, from healthcare to trade policy to immigration, Ryan was a thorn in Trump's side for the whole first two years of his administration–not to mention the rising deficit, increased federal spending across the board, and massive heaps onto the national debt that happened on Ryan's watch under both Presidents Obama and Trump–all from a supposedly conservative Republican who had for years preached fiscal responsibility but failed to deliver.
As disappointing as the Supreme Court's ruling is, there is a clear path to fixing it: electing a new President who will end Donald Trump's ceaseless attempts to gut every aspect of the Affordable Care Act. If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions.
It goes back to kind of the fatal flaws of Obamacare, and just making it a little better at the margins, which is I think, at best, what you could say Ryan was up to. It was clearly unsatisfactory and was, as I say, doomed to fail, he pronounced.
The irony is that, despite being 94 percent nonwhite, Meyerholz Elementary is one of the most privileged schools in America. The median household income in Cupertino is $172,000, and nearly 80 percent of residents have a bachelor's degree or higher. At the school, where the majority of families are Asian-American, the students have exceptionally high rates of academic achievement and the school consistently ranks in the top 1 percent of all elementary schools statewide. In short, nobody at Meyerholz is oppressed, and the school's high-achieving parents know that teaching intersectionality instead of math is a waste of time—and potentially dangerous.
There is no mother that wants to raise her children on the streets of Portland today, and what we're seeing in Democrat-run cities is what could happen coast-to-coast in this country if we let the Democrats run every single branch of Washington, D.C. and make the decisions going forward, Noem outlined. They have not stood by law enforcement officers. They've not enforced the law in this country, and we're seeing that play out in the streets and the violence that is happening back and forth in the last several months. Listen, Kelly and David love our law enforcement. They recognize that we have laws in this country for a reason, and they should be enforced, and when they're broken, there should be consequences. That is an important discussion in Georgia, but also I recognize people understand the Marxism, the communism, you know, the socialism discussion and what their life looks like six months from now if their expenses go up, if they have less money in their pocket because Democrats have raised taxes. We could in a year and a half, two years see $4 to $5 gasoline as a result of Democrat policy.

Transportation emissions overall make up the largest share of U.S. climate-damaging emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, air travel pumps out about 3% of overall emissions of climate-destroying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Surging growth of air travel in Asia and around the world means those emissions will triple by 2050, the United Nations says, and recent studies say even that figure underestimates the explosive growth of air travel and its emissions.
Furthermore, the second part of the judge's ruling, that public figures have no right to block users on social media in response to their political views, also has implications that range far beyond Trump.
What this new policy will do is encourage companies to only ask for H-1Bs to fill higher salary jobs, not to fill the starter and mid-career jobs needed by Americans, said Kevin Lynn, the director of U.S. Tech Workers. Under her current [lottery] system, we encourage companies to recruit the lower-wage workers, so denying jobs to new U.S. graduates, he said.
Noting the snacks you make sure are on every floor, Talia Jane added, By and large, our floor pummels through those snacks the fastest and has to roam other floors to find something to eat. Is it because we're gluttons? Maybe. If you starve a pack of wolves and toss them a single steak, will they rip each other to shreds fighting over it? Definitely.

The secretary recently said the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) essentially does away with the notion of a Common Core, a statement many grassroots parent activists still battling against the Core in their states have rejected.
The PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, is a violent Kurdish separatist organization in Turkey that the U.S. State Department indeed lists as a foreign terrorist organization. The PYD (Democratic Union Party) is the largest Syrian Kurdish political party, while the YPG (People's Protection Units) is effectively its armed wing. The YPG militia was one of the most effective battlefield allies of the United States in the war against the Islamic State.
Planned Parenthood is dusting off an already debunked statistic to urge opposition to the Trump administration's proposed campus sex misconduct rule that emphasizes both the seriousness of sexual assault and due process for those accused of misconduct.
Even putting aside the risk of acquiring Covid on set – a risk that we have done a great deal to mitigate through our safety protocols – on-set production always poses some risk of injury, whether because of a stunt gone wrong, an equipment failure, or a garden-variety fall. Right now, with few, if any, hospital beds available, it is hard to understand how a worker injured on set is supposed to seek treatment. I would like to thank the JPC and the PGA for their efforts to reinforce safety measures for all, and we acknowledge and appreciate the major studios and other producers who have proactively stepped up and postponed their production during this emergency.
Six-nation negotiations on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for aid fell apart in early 2009.
They're very good at stopping any illegal alien prototypes. … I don't know why we need prototypes, except that it's all just a fakeout and the whole thing about building a wall is just 'I'm going to get four years saying I'm going to build the wall and inspecting prototypes, but I'll never actually build the wall.' … No, it's a ridiculous waste of time. [Emphasis added]
According to Nigel Farage the inclusion of Mr. Galloway was a way to reach certain parts of the British public that no UKIPer, Tory, or even Kate Hoey-esque Labourite can reach that might not make everyone on stage or in the audience comfortable but is nevertheless one way for the Leave campaign to reach certain people especially since the long-standing anti-EU Jeremy Corbyn has been stifled by his union paymasters.
The administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the Nation's borders and get the federal government back to work for the American people as soon as possible, the statement concluded.

The stupidity, as Dominic Lawson reports here in the Daily Mail, can be traced back to the era when those two globalist chumps Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne were running the show. Both were determined to prove how modern and forward looking they were by forging a relationship with the world's most dynamic new power China.

Professor Victoria Tin-bor Hui, an associate professor in political science at the University of Notre Dame, said that the arrest of the founder of the Democratic Party, Martin Lee, alongside 14 other in April of last year should send the unmistakable signal that Beijing is reaching the end goal of its version of 'one country, two systems' — capitalism without freedom — on Hong Kong.

Cuban officials will suspend tourism to the island from Tuesday, while citizens who return from abroad will be required to enter a two-week quarantine. The lockdown is scheduled to last 30 days but could be extended longer, and will undoubtedly inflict major damage on the country's already struggling economy.
And then there are the YPG Kurds fighting Sunnis north of Aleppo, driving tens of thousands to flee from their homes and head for the border with Turkey. Turkey considers the YPG Kurds, who are allies of al-Assad, to be linked to the PKK Kurds, who are internationally recognized terrorists, and therefore also terrorists. Turkey has been shelling YPG Kurd positions for over a week now, but wasn't a part of Monday's peace agreement announcement. So who's going to be the first to stop fighting: Turkey or the YPG Kurds? The answer is: Neither.
President-elect Joe Biden is laying the groundwork for an amnesty for 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the United States, meeting with open borders lobbying groups and sanctuary city politicians to discuss a legislative strategy.
Trump has made 3-5 concessions in the border wall fight. But estb. media hides Democrats' refusal to offer anything in exchange. So Trump sees an incentive to escalate via a national emergency to get a wall. IOW, media's tilt skews DC political incentives https://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019

With about a third of abortions now induced by drugs like RU-486, 56 percent of Millennials surveyed opposed selling the abortion drugs online or dropping the requirement for a physical exam due to the potential risks to women.
We've done studies and we've seen studies and if you do away with the inheritance tax you can add hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and the reason being is because some people are saving money each month to pass to their kids or maybe they have an insurance policy they make a premium on. If you do away with the inheritance tax they don't need to save the cash, they don't need to make the insurance premium, they can build their home, they can give to their church, they can build their business and pass net worth onto the next generation. And isn't that what we should do in America instead of passing cold cash down or insurance policy? Let's pass net worth on.
For whatever faults you want to find about the [Trump], or you don't like his style about things, he's the only guy that that points out problems, and then Republicans come along and say, 'Oh, okay, yeah, this is a problem,' and then they start to address it, Hurt remarked. I really do mean that. I get why people don't like his style, and I get that there are good Republicans, good conservatives, who don't like him, but this is what it's all about.
Both registered and unregistered Protestant churches have been individually and collectively penalised for peaceful religious activities, the CSW said.

No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The move came after concerted pressure from the Trump administration, which warned that intelligence sharing could be compromised with countries that continued to use Huawei tech, which the U.S. claimed has the ability to create back doors for the CCP to use for espionage purposes.

But the militants who did escape received a literal fiery welcome when they arrived in Mosul.
China has repeatedly hidden its intentions, and will continue to do so until it's prepared to launch its attack. China is following exactly the same path that the Nazis followed. Xi Jinping's Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is the same as Hitler's National Socialism. Like the Nazis, the Chinese believe that they're a Master Race that will conquer the world. They'd have to be crazy to believe that they could succeed at that, but the Chinese are crazy.

Qureshi went on to warn that ad hoc policy-making from local teams at NHS trusts will only lead to inconsistency and inefficiency that could lead to large numbers of avoidable deaths.
Make no mistake, Sessions continued, federal prisons are not filled with low-level, non-violent drug possessors. According to the bureau of justice statistics … 99.7 percent of drug offenders in federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug-trafficking offenses, not drug possession.
Food insecurity is a question of money. Folks spend unwisely, run out of money by the end of the month, and end up skipping a meal, eating less, or being worried about food. The vast majority of food insecurity— even very high food insecurity—could be alleviated by simple changes in behavior.
President Donald Trump responded to the remarks on Twitter, lauding it as a great inauguration speech.
Cotton also aided President Donald Trump by preventing Congress from putting a Hire Irish bill on his desk just two years after Trump promised a Hire American policy in his administration:

After the Iraq-Iran war, Soleimani largely disappeared from public view for several years, something analysts attribute to his wartime disagreements with Hashemi Rafsanjani, who would serve as Iran's president from 1989 to 1997. But after Rafsanjani, Soleimani became head of the Quds force. He also grew so close to Khamenei that the Supreme Leader officiated the wedding of the general's daughter.

Trump signaled that his actions on trade would help restore the states of important industries in the United States, specifically citing his thoughts on dairy and lumber.
We have been firm in safeguarding our national interests. We have responded resolutely and rationally to unjustified moves by the United States. We have handled issues relating to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet with justified, strong and proportionate countermeasures and won one fierce battle after another in international organizations, vigorously safeguarding China's sovereignty, dignity and development interests, Wang said, delivering a jaw-dropping defense of China's authoritarian atrocities.
Several large companies pulled their advertising from Google and its sites, including YouTube, last month, citing their adverts appearing on extremist and offensive content.
LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England revised up its economic growth forecasts for the British economy for the coming three years, crediting much of the improvement to the government's decision to ease up on austerity in the wake of the country's vote to leave the European Union.
The Trump administration prioritized foreign policy initiatives that made it more difficult for the Cuban communist regime to oppress its people, in contrast with the appeasement strategy of predecessor Barack Obama. Among the policies implemented against the Castro regime were the conclusion of people to people tours to Cuba – an exception to the embargo under Obama – and the outlawing of American cruises to Cuba. While tourism to Cuba is technically not legal under the longstanding embargo, Obama legalized tourism via cruise ships, netting the Castro regime millions of dollars.
The Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.

Perry's efforts were highlighted in a recent report by the Washington Examiner.
Having tried to get back to subject of the referendum Mr. Galloway was again challenged to defend his appearance by Ms. Coburn. He refused to indulge the question, declaring:
While Brussels and the bloc's liberal-progressive members have pushed for an EU-wide asylum policy — which seeks to dole out arrivals to member states and fails to increase security — Hungary has said the superstate should instead take her lead and fortify Europe's external borders as well as focusing on supporting refugees in their own countries and regions.
But the leader of the group immediately began shouting over the staffer's voice, prompting a well-trained call-and-reply refrain from the group:
It would put anybody out of business. I mean, this — they could destroy anybody. If they did this to any app, any company, it would completely destroy them. And we're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble, because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us, because, if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't.
Halfway down Grassley's list of questions comes what could be the most devastating of his inquiries, considering President Trump's accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped his 2016 presidential campaign:
The surprise fall, the first since last October, was largely due to falling gas prices at the pump as lower wholesale crude prices were passed on to drivers. Despite the fall, living standards in Britain are still falling as price increases outpace wage rises.

The statement reiterated President Trump's request for at least $5 billion for border security and asserted that the Democrats' proposal does not come close to providing these necessary investments and authorities.
As part of an executive order issued by Trump, the president had ordered the Census Bureau to tally the number of illegal aliens in each state. The total would allow congressional apportionment, where the number of U.S. House seats are allocated, to be based on the citizen and legal immigrant population to prevent states like California, with large illegal populations, from inflating their congressional power.

Our source concluded: The final point is that I suspect nobody will admit Brussels policy is inherently linked to what happened in Cologne – they will not welcome such a link – and the attitude will therefore be that such matters are for member states.
Possibly this is good news for Johnson, who, as a reward for this nonsense, may now get more nookie from his eco-activist girlfriend Carrie Symonds (aka Princess Nut Nut). But it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.
The Democrats' decision to rebut the president's Oval Office address was a catastrophic mistake. Perhaps they made it after the networks perseverated about whether to carry the president's address at all.
He added, And then, over the last, very soon to be eight years, of this administration, we had quite a bit of an inconsistent policy. And what we've been left with is that old status quo is totally destroyed. All of the demons are out, and it's represented by ISIS, which is this kind of primordial ooze, that had always been there, and has been unleashed.

Repealing the inheritance death tax is one of eight points in Williams' own Jumpstart America tax plan. While he said it is not a make-or-break, he brought up when the U.S. House had passed legislation to repeal the death tax, but it stalled in the U.S. Senate. Having experience with the tax himself, he said, an asset doesn't mean you have cash and people have already paid taxes on this.
Cohn initially entered the Trump administration in opposition to U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, while Kudlow continuously only saw tariffs as a negotiating tactic rather than long-term policy to reshore manufacturing and production back to the U.S., as Lighthizer and Navarro intended.
The contradiction between migration and development is not a problem for progressives, said Kirkorian. Ideological libertarians and leftists look at it this way: That any way of getting here, under any circumstances, is better [for migrants] than staying where they are, he said. The development damage done to the home countries is waved away as brain gain or circulation or something like that, he added.
Small businesses are concerned about potential new economic policy in the new administration and the increased spread of COVID-19 that is causing renewed government-mandated business closures across the nation, Dunkelberg said.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.

In no way would a fourth-hand report from a Maltese professor justify wholesale targeting of four or five members of the Trump campaign. It took Christopher Steele, with his funding concealed through false campaign filings, to be incredibly successful at creating a vast echo chamber around his unverified, fanciful dossier, bouncing it back and forth between the press and the FBI so it appeared that there were multiple sources all coming to the same conclusion.

China will soon release an outline on the sinicization of Islam, with Islamic communities urged to uphold the sinicization of their religion by improving their political stance and following the Party's leadership. Representatives from local Islamic associations from eight provinces and regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hunan, Yunnan and Qinghai provinces, discussed a five-year (2018-22) outline on the sinicization of Islam at a seminar in Beijing on Saturday. They agreed that the outline is the basic policy for Islamic sinicization for the next five years, according to a statement published on the China Islamic Association's website.

Companies also crimp and slow technological domestic competition by hiring visa workers instead of American graduates. In the early 2000s, the federal government broke up an illegal no-poaching cartel by tech companies who were trying to prevent their American workers from changing jobs and so sharing their expertise with rival companies. This strategy is legal if the workforce consists of H-1B workers who cannot change jobs without their managers' permission.
Soleimani's killing escalated the crisis between Tehran and Washington after months of trading attacks and threats that have put the wider Middle East on edge. The conflict is rooted in Trump pulling out of Iran's atomic accord and imposing crippling sanctions.
The cases, dating back to 2012, began when a Brooklyn teen only known as G.E. was arrested for getting into a fight with two girls.
I think that [Trump was] moving back to the George W. Bush approach. And what was the Bush approach? Basically it was, don't change the footprint [and] don't expand the settlements geographically. Population growth, that's different. Build up and in. In built-up areas, if you want to build a new house, a new apartment, that doesn't affect the Palestinians or the chances of peace really. So the Google Earth map, if you put it that way, of the settlements doesn't change.

Pompeo's remarks came after he attended Bolsonaro's inauguration alongside other foreign leaders including Israeli and Hungarian Prime Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu and Viktor Orban and Bolivian strongman Evo Morales. In his inaugural address, Bolsonaro promised to liberate Brazil from socialist ideology, while shifting his focus to the promotion of conservative values.
It's risky because it puts in the hands of the government the possibility to choose all the bishops it wants depending on the criteria it has always had, he said, that is, choosing the most malleable, controllable ones and making them into an instrument of their politics instead of working for the evangelization of China.
The CCP, of course, is eager to suppress all discussion of where the virus originated or China's role in making it into a global pandemic, so Chinese media leaped at the opportunity to recycle American media attacks against President Donald Trump and his administration for refusing to stop talking about it.
The first of these attacks appears to have occurred on Saturday, as government forces clashed with small squads of the ISIS-allied Maute terrorist group. The Philippine military expressed concern that ISIS terrorists have become adept at surviving in the wilds of the restless island of Mindanao and have forged connections with the impoverished local population.

The bill, which provides criminal and civil penalties to public officials who block enforcement of immigration law, passed the legislature in May and went to Abbott's desk for signature. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas immediately after signing the bill into law, Abbott said law enforcement and other officials implementing sanctuary policies that release criminal aliens with immigration detainers will now be subject to the stiffest penalties in America.
On Sunday, Trump also suggested that a DACA deal could be folded into a border wall deal:
GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have described March as a deadline, even though hundreds of thousand of work-permits will remain valid after that date. For example, only half of the roughly 650,000 work permits will expire by November 2018, says a business group.
Another issue central to the conflict — settlements — remains a work in progress for Israel and Trump. The president's softer campaign tone about Israel's construction of Jewish homes in east Jerusalem and the West Bank has been replaced by Trump's suggesting in his first White House meeting with Netanyahu to hold back on settlements for a bit.
After bin Salman ousted then-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and started to consolidate his power last year, Trump's PDB reportedly contained information on Saudi Arabia's evolving political situation, including a handful of names of royal family members opposed to the crown prince's power grab. Bin Salman arrived in Washington on Wednesday and he and his advisers dined with Kushner.
Those statistics are cited at the conclusion of an article about how New York high school students are passing tests, not because of increased knowledge but because the bar has been repeatedly set lower to get desired results.
The growth in the groups' membership — in the last Congress, the Tri-Caucus had roughly 90 core House members — reflects the diverse lineup of Democrats who won election in the November midterms. It also signals that their influence will be wide-ranging. Among the Tri-Caucus members will be eight committee chairs, leading panels ranging from environmental issues to homeland security to small business. They will have representatives in the No. 3, 4 and 5 spots in Democratic leadership. Lobbying firms in Washington are hiring staff with connections to the Tri-Caucus, a signal of their importance. More than 100 of 235 Democratic members in the new House, many from California, belong to one of the three affinity groups known collectively as the Tri-Caucus. It will arguably be the most powerful voting bloc for the Democratic majority.

3. Work from home. Though many people resented the economic shutdowns, which meant devastation for many businesses, others were able to adapt to working from home. New technologies, such as Zoom, and more flexible work routines allowed employees to become more productive while achieving a better work-life balance. The changes have helped drive a boom in suburban housing, and may help women in particular, who have often been forced to choose between work and family life.

… each [asylum] case should be reviewed fairly and in full accordance with the law. Migrants who qualify for an asylum claim will be admitted to the country through an orderly process and connected with resources that will help them care for themselves. Migrants who do not qualify will have the opportunity to make their claim before an immigration judge, but if they are unable to satisfy the court, the government will help facilitate their successful reintegration into their home countries.
The rosier projections were widely anticipated given the British economy has proven more resilient than many feared following June's Brexit vote. The bank increased its growth forecasts to 2 percent this year, 1.6 percent in 2018 and 1.7 percent in 2019. Those are up from November's predictions of 1.4 percent, 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent.
Democrats are also using the epidemic to target the White House's public charge rule. Democrats already oppose the rule because it is designed to exclude legal migrants who cannot provide for their own health care.

The president ought to be able to keep potential terrorists from coming into our country, but now with this outbreak of coronavirus, the president also needs to have all the tools available to limit, people coming in from countries with a high propensity of coronavirus. You wouldn't want legislation that would make it more difficult. Hopefully, that bill gets pulled this week, but in the meantime, we need to continue to do all that we can to ensure that the administration has the tools they need, and we're working together to inform the public, of the various precautions that they can take as we're trying to find a vaccine.
The shadowy general who was in command of Iran's proxy forces was responsible, according to the Pentagon, for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq during the height of the war there.

It's time to talk. All of us have a story about GUPD. All of us know someone who has been targeted. Let's do something about it. Come this Tuesday for community and discussion.

Representatives Tulsi Gabbard (D-HA) and Scott Perry (R-PA) have presented a bill which seeks to permanently codify protections on Americans' privacy. It has been introduced to the House to cement a policy change announced by the NSA in April, ending surveillance of e-mail based on keywords related to foreign targets of spying, unless they were specifically to or from concerned parties. This catch-all form of spying is known as about surveillance, and both Gabbard and Perry want to ensure it doesn't make a comeback.

The water burst out through the spillway in a constant gush, a mad torrent of white, unstoppable and ferocious. It swept down the smooth concrete — then pounded into the new cracks in the failed spillway, sending a spray hundreds of feet into the air and carving a new chasm in the hillside.
It absolutely came from Wuhan, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, confirmed last week. There's no doubt about that.
The support for Webb may come as somewhat of a surprise, since he is a Democrat and has been largely out of the headlines since the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, when he launched a bid for president.
In 1981, Simon published The Ultimate Resource, underscoring man's ability to adapt to new circumstances and overcome obstacles through ingenuity and creativity. It is the human mind, rather than coal, trees, or iron, that is the ultimate resource—one that suffers no risk of depletion.
And then there are the sugary soft drinks that make you fat and also cost a lot. Very low food security adults drink an average of two sodas per day. Presumably they buy them at $1.00 or $1.25 per can out of vending machines. This can run north of $70 per month.
To counter our reliance on this opaque oil market, we must develop a range of policy responses. First, we must develop more resources here at home. Second, we must modernize our fuel efficiency standards to maximize the benefits from the oil we use. Third, we must encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles running on diverse sources of domestic energy, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen. Finally, we must have an honest assessment of our ability to respond to OPEC's actions to influence oil prices.
The AOC approach is a non-starter with most of the working class, said Olsen. They don't want a big government, heavy, high-tax, high-benefit state. What they want is what they had. They want their jobs back, and they want to stop being subjected to what they consider to be unfair competition. There's nothing that AOC or her allies would do about that sort of competition [for jobs], particularly from people who come here — whether legally or illegally — and who compete with these people for the jobs.
Some residents suggested that Grenfell Tower's policies were to blame for the disaster.
Shopify said in a statement: Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence. Based on recent events, we have determined that the actions by President Donald J.

To promote its policy, the Obama-era education department engaged the media and allies such as Planned Parenthood with the statistic, and even the former president himself repeated it in his speeches.
But Trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if Britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the Huawei deal.
Specifically, the letter asks whether the training violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, national origin, and religion.
While the government's strategy is explicitly gender-based, stating that it sets out to combat violence against women, studies carried out both in the wider West and in Sweden show that women are more likely to initiate domestic violence.
The wording of the judge's ruling is unambiguous on this point, stating the viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is prescribed by the First Amendment.
DHS [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] will not tolerate forced labor of any kind in U.S. supply chains, acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said in a statement Wednesday.

The hospitals are doing the administration, and that was purposeful, Cuomo told reporters. This is a management issue of the hospitals. They have to move the vaccine, and they have to move the vaccine faster.
It doesn't make sense to have officials with antagonistic ideological orientations [working for us], Lorenzoni asserted. It is not reasonable to have socialists, communists, any of that stuff here.
Kolfage said the dream team that's been assembled is working with people on the border to achieve border security that the federal government has failed to put in place.
The bill would also prevent workers from being paid during the termination process.
And if we have any barriers to that, it's not that it's bad for them — it might be bad for them — but it's also bad for the entire public, said Jayapal, a former Indian migrant who argues that the nation needs a large inflow of immigrants to perform manual farm labor. Jayapal's Seattle district has had a rash of coronavirus cases, partly because the district is home to many Chinese visa workers and legal immigrants.
The nominee to become the next United States Trade Representative (USTR), Katherine Tai, says U.S. trade policy must benefit regular Americans and is vowing a worker-centered trade policy.
His reticence to play ball with the Euro club of leaders in Brussels while working out ad hoc solutions with neighbours may prove unpopular in Brussels. As Breitbart London reported, Swedish leader Stephen Löfven slammed European countries not accepting migrant quotas as beneath contempt.
In my day, I must have had three or four courses where we read On Liberty, by John Stuart Mill, which taught the basics of free speech and why we need it. It was very common to read John Stuart Mill and other defenses of free speech in the tradition of classical liberalism – such as what the Founders practiced. This is not taught today. Instead, people teach about so-called white privilege and other ideas that, in an indirect way, are ultimately derived from Marxism or what you might call neo-Marxism, where the basic idea is that individual rights are just an illusion, and you really have just a bunch of powerful classes. Instead of an economic class nowadays they talk about it as an ethnic or a gender class. And those powerful classes dominate and they create ideas like free speech that pretend to be neutral and fair to every individual, but they really aren't. They're just disguising the power of the class. That ideology comes from Marx, but it's been spread out and used in this new frame with ethnicity and gender. So, this is the ideology that dominates the ethos of the studies programs.
Ukraine's prime minister says he is not planning to go anywhere, trying to tamp down rumors that he or his government might soon resign.
He's referring to a report coauthored by Johns Hopkins Centers for Health Security. Hopkins experts on Monday said the U.S. got a grade that overall was highest by a few points among a variety of high-income countries that are all at about the same level of preparedness.

The Commissioner's Office will have no further comment on this matter until a final disposition is announced.
Polls show that Americans do not want to be hostile to people who wish to live as members of the opposite sex. But the polls also show that the policy changes required by the transgender ideology are deeply unpopular and are increasingly opposed by conservatives and feminists. Breitbart News reported in October 2020:
The Democrats, the media and most of the Republican Party are as fanatically opposed to Trump's ideas about illegal immigration as they were to Reagan's ideas about winning the Cold War.

That extra wave of migrants further cuts Americans' wages and drives up their rents while forcing more chaotic diversity into American society — but it also boosts Wall Street investors by cutting labor costs and by spiking sales to welfare-aided consumers.
Like other states, Indiana lawmakers wished to curtail the use of prenatal technologies to screen unborn children, which are used to target those with disabilities for termination in a modern-day form of eugenics, the authors observed.
That's another question I'd like to be answered. I get responding to the complaint but they took every step afterward as if the intention was to prosecute to the fullest extent. The fact that this even crossed a prosecutor's desk is mind blowing. https://t.co/Bbyan5RJIJ — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) April 15, 2018
Maybe Obama's magic wand comment was not so far off. But he should have called it a MAGA Wand.
Australia, Japan, and South Korea were described as the backbone of effective opposition to Chinese ambitions in the Pacific, provided their capabilities and will could be strengthened sufficiently, while closer U.S. relations with other regional powers like the Philippines and Thailand were recommended to strengthen their role in upholding a rules-based international order.

So to Obama, the Geneva Convention applies to stateless terrorists–who are not parties to the convention, and are not lawful combatants–but not to U.S. sailors captured and detained by Iran at gunpoint in a hostile rescue. There are at least five reasons that the Obama administration is wrong to defend Iran, and wrong about the Convention.
American global health policies have languished under President Trump, the op-ed asserts.
Last month, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, himself an international outcast, flew to Damascus on a Russian jet, becoming the first Arab leader to visit Syria since 2011. The visit was largely seen as a precursor for similar steps by other Arab leaders.
Rouhani is trying to reassert control and tamp down public unrest with a new budget that spends more on domestic priorities, but he could easily have done that during the Obama years when lucrative foreign deals and literal pallets of cash were falling into his lap. If Tehran is truly changing and turning its focus inward, it is only because the crushing effect of sanctions forced a major re-evaluation of policy. There is little evidence that any sort of political liberalization flowed from the nuclear deal boom and a great deal of evidence to the contrary.
That 44.5 million includes roughly 22 million naturalized citizens, 11 million other residents – including more than 1.5 million foreign temporary visa-workers – plus at least 11 million illegal aliens.

Based on oil minister's reports, Iran's oil sales have been continuing just as it was expected, but there are some minor issues that are solvable and will be solved soon, he claimed. No one looking at the actual data could possibly believe that, but Iranians will be required to believe it so their leaders can claim victory over the American quest to reduce its oil exports to zero.
The party has less choice than ever for its succession, it noted.
This is something I worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come. It is one of those elusive generational reforms. It is why we do this.

And in any case, none of these gotcha moments amount to anything revelatory, they continued. These videos don't prove that Twitter has a partisan bias against its far-right conservative users. (Indeed, they're some of its most prolific users.) They do show, though, that the right-wing backlash against tech giants has reached a new height. With every new policy intended to curb abuse, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms invite rancor. The new rules have been necessary to fight an increasingly toxic atmosphere online. But Project Veritas sees those steps, and the ban of high-profile far-right users—over clear, apolitical terms of service violations—as an attempt not to improve discourse online, but to quash the free exchange of ideas.
China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to build a more modern military force. Reuters points out, the global profile of China's armed forces is on the rise.
That was Jeane Kirkpatrick's message in 1979, and it's a relevant message, still, in 2019. Of course, we can't hear from her directly anymore, but her wisdom is readily available. And that's good, because we need her clear thinking today as much as ever.
Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, will share the latest developments in the story of an illegal alien appointed to state office in California; Kate Steinle's illegal alien killer's lawsuit against the federal government; and the Oakland mayor's warning to businesses with illegal alien employees before the recent ICE raids in California.

No layoffs… this week! joked Mayer, in response to questions raised by concerned employees.
Trump's political campaign dismissed the House effort as just a failed attempt to politically damage President Trump leading up to his reelection.
The nuclear agreement is aimed at convincing Iran to stop developing atomic weapons in exchange for economic incentives. It's been on life support since President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the United States out in 2018, triggering sanctions that have hurt Iran's moribund economy. Since then, Tehran has gradually rolled back its commitment to the deal.
Investors have been focused on the question of inflation in recent weeks. Many believe that higher inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace, which could slow the economy.
Rehabilitation by Arab states is inevitable, said Faysal Itani, a resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.
As Iraqi forces moved in during December, the Islamic State grew paranoid and used the civilians as human shields. One man said the militants forced people to remain in their houses and could only leave with permission.
The war for Yemen's future is no longer between Saudi and Iranian loyalists, but between Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The United States must push for a Saudi-Houthi pact immediately, so they can collaborate to fend off the jihadists. The recent bombings in Ivory Coast, and IS's storming of areas in Libya, prove that Washington has yet to grasp the threat posed by IS and Al-Qaeda, or at least adopt a consistent strategy to fight them.
Aside from the inconvenience the checks are expected to cause — especially for the roughly 8,600 daily commuters between Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmo — the new measures have annoyed Danish travel operators for financial reasons.
The U.N. Human Rights Council is supposed to be about human rights, not Israeli wrongs, so to create a report just about Israel seems to go against its own mission, he said.
In February, Djibouti seized control of the terminal, and abruptly terminated the contract without notice. Next, Djibouti signed a contract with Singapore-based Pacific International Lines (PIL), a company that works with China Merchants Port Holdings, to operate the terminal. So it appears that China is poised to take control of the entire Djibouti seaport.

Laycock writes, Hey guys. Sorry to bother at this hour. Are either of you aware of a cyber brief to the D and HPSCI [House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence] Tuesday that I believe is related to the project? Just got a call from a buddy who is tdy to cyber as SC and was privy to this presentation where he noticed a few CD centric things that CD may have an interest in taking a look at and scrubbing.

The numbers of Cubans crossing into Texas is rising on a daily basis, according to the New York Times' Julia Preston. The hundreds of Cuban refugees seem to get little, if any, screening.

The baffling mystery is how Ehrlich—despite his utterly failed forecasts—can continue to be hailed today as a serious scientist with something important to say to the world.
Honcharuk had initially dodged a question about whether he would resign, speaking only more broadly about his government's plans.
As for the future of Israel, he noted that, in the past decade or so, there's been a total breakdown of the capacity of human beings to live alongside one another. But in the Middle East, it's happened before and it's been put right before, and there have been new moments of hope. So that's our prayer. And that's what we have to take responsibility for leading.

Williams was asked if passing tax reform would take away some of the uncertainty in not knowing what tax changes may come. He responded, We need some certainty, but it's got to be the right kind of certainty. He said you can't cut people's taxes in one place and raise it in another, or take away the way they've accounted for their business for 40-50 years.

I would say this. Many of our Republicans don't fully grasp that, Sessions said. They don't fully understand the opportunity we have right now. This is a major historical redirection of American policy from the left to mainstream American values—that's the choice we'll face in this next election.
The foreign-born workforce — those who are employed and looking for work — also had sharply higher gains than native-born Americans. Last month, the number of foreign-born workers in the labor force increased 4.5 percent. At the same time, native-born Americans in the labor force increased only 1 percent.
His pompous resignation letter gives a pretty good idea of the kind of man Rutnam is:

Soleimani's killing escalated the crisis between Tehran and Washington after months of trading attacks and threats that have put the wider Middle East on edge. The conflict is rooted in Trump pulling out of Iran's atomic accord and imposing crippling sanctions.
These statistics are another nail in the Government's commitment to reduce migration to the tens of thousands, he said.
The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and temporarily closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters had recently staged two days of violent protests in which they breached the compound. Britain and France have warned their citizens to avoid or strictly limit travel in Iraq, as London said it would begin escorting ships through the Strait of Hormuz. Oman, long an interlocutor between Iran and the West, urged Tehran and Washington on Sunday to pursue dialogue.
FRANKFURT (Reuters) – China is set to report its weakest full-year growth figure in 25 years on Tuesday on the back of slowing output and sagging investments, troubling news that will likely dominate discussion at the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada policy meetings.
A spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded on Monday by warning Trump, It is a fatal mistake to equate Syrian Kurds with the PKK, which is on the U.S. terrorist list, and its Syria branch PYD/YPG.
BBC a 'Secular Church' That 'Preaches' on Climate Change, Against Brexit: Guest Editor https://t.co/DM3VdFl8ld — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2019
We have come through a period of eight years of tension at various levels, but particularly the top level. It's clear that [former president Barack] Obama and Netanyahu didn't get along, didn't like each other. And that attitude was then communicated to the White House staff. You had a lot of backbiting, criticism of Netanyahu — all of that is over. We've returned now to the idea that there should be no daylight in public between the two governments. There will be plenty of disagreements, but those will be discussed in closed rooms and the relations at the top are obviously genuinely good. There is no artifice here about getting along.
Despite four years of the establishment media spreading lies about Trump being a racist, satisfaction with race relations jumped 14 points, from 22 percent to 36 percent. What's more, on the position of blacks and other racial minorities, satisfaction rose nine points, from 37 to 46 percent.
These are the kind of people who, we've been assured by insiders, are going to be swept away by the new broom of Boris's chief advisor Dominic Cumming, in a bid to make Britain more democratically accountable and less in thrall to a shadowy administrative state.
Park claimed that only 0.64 percent of last year's coronavirus infections in Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province were traced to indoor gyms, according to Yonhap.
Apparently not, for the current rumours are that rather than nix this disastrous deal made by his discredited predecessors, Boris is instead minded to go ahead with it.
The deep state is in a deep state of desperation. With little time left before the Justice Department inspector general's report becomes public, and with special counsel Robert Mueller having failed to bring down Donald Trump after a year of trying, they know a reckoning is coming.
Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, will discuss former FBI Director James Comey's upcoming testimony before Congress and discuss the NSA leaker Reality Winner.
In the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA. This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users. With half a billion active users and accelerating growth, Telegram has become the largest refuge for those seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security. We take this responsibility very seriously. We won't let you down. Those of you who have used Telegram for the last several years know we've been consistent both when it comes to defending private data and to improving our apps. For those of you who just joined and are wondering what Telegram stands for, I'd like to quote my post from 2018: You – our users – have been and will always be our only priority. Unlike other popular apps, Telegram doesn't have shareholders or advertisers to report to.
As Breitbart News reported in October, Biden was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina due to his ardent support for abortion on demand.
In the United States, where the death toll rose to 11 on Wednesday, lawmakers in Congress reached a deal to provide more than $8 billion to fight the outbreak.
The issue of migration has returned to the political foreground in Italy with the ongoing saga of the two vessels operated by the NGOs Sea Watch and Sea Eye. The story has highlighted tensions in relations with the EU and other international organizations such as the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
According to a recent release from the United States Department of Justice, Bustos-Bustos and Juanchi-Salgado pled guilty in January for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine.
Regarding taxpayer funding for abortion, 45 percent of Millennials polled opposed it, with 33 percent supporting it, and 22 percent undecided.
David Azerrad of the Heritage Foundation justly called the holiday insipid, and lamented the fact that a celebration of Washington was lumped in with a menagerie of other second-rate presidents. Washington, the 'indispensable man' of the revolution who was rightly extolled for being 'first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,' has now been lumped together with the likes of James Buchanan, Jimmy Carter, Franklin Pierce and John Tyler, he said.
Crowder's Twitter account is still reportedly limited, as is Jared Monroe's and Sven Computer's.
Speaking Thursday at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he believes the S-400 missiles don't pose a threat to NATO, of which Turkey is a member.
Mayer's reign as CEO of Yahoo has often been controversial, with the CEO facing a lawsuit last year that claimed she purposely purged male employees, and with several employees of Tumblr, the popular micro-blogging platform owned by Yahoo, also claiming that Mayer and her management were responsible for the decline of the social network.
GOP Reps. are still pushing Rep. Yoder's middle-class outsourcing bill to put 600K Indian visa-workers & families on fast-track to US jobs/voting. It would help CEOs import more Indians for US college-grad jobs – w/o any benefit for US workers or even GOP. https://t.co/LD8q3SjYRg — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 3, 2018
Like Jeb Bush, Skandera is a proponent of the Common Core standards. She is head of the governing board of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), one of the two federally funded test consortia that developed assessments aligned with Common Core.
Germany has become increasingly tied with the communist regime, with China becoming the country's largest trading partner in 2018, with some €200 billion in trade. Merkel has argued that closer ties with China are the only way for the world to solve pressing issues, such as supposedly man-made climate change.
Kerry repeatedly used the phrase make the right decision as code for Assad stepping down. Russia will have to speak for itself about what it is going to choose to do in order to help Mr. Assad make the right decisions, but we agreed today that we will accelerate the effort to try to move the political process forward, he said at one point during the press conference.
The current rule is that the President can keep out anyone he thinks necessary but needs Congress's permission to let people in. This would be the other way around — the President would be barred from keeping people out [by the amnesty] and be empowered to let in anyone he felt like [via the TPS rule].
And the anti-hunger lobby is only one part of the vast complex of charitable professionals and federal bureaucrats making a comfortable living off poverty in America.
Society said 'enough' to socialist and communist ideas which, in the past 30 years, brought us to the chaos were are living today, Lorenzoni told reporters, explaining that this mandate made it necessary to remove Marxists from top positions in the government according to the Spanish news agency EFE. To accomplish this, the Bolsonaro administration will begin a review of some of the highest-ranking officials.
On the February 17 Breitbart News Daily show, broadcast on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM EST weekdays, host and Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon will interview a number of guests, including Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos and legal expert Ken Klukowski.
On Friday, Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono expressed understanding of the U.S. decision to cancel the meeting, saying, It is meaningless to hold a summit if it does not bring about progress, according to Kyodo News.
The Senate voted 152-76 in favour of removing the legal protection that had shielded the chief of the anti-immigrant League party, giving magistrates the go-ahead to charge him with abuse of power and illegal detention.
The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks. The most significant reductions last year were around transportation, which remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, said Kate Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group, a research and consulting firm. But as vaccines become more prevalent, and depending on how quickly people feel comfortable enough to drive and fly again, we'd expect emissions to rebound unless there are major policy changes put in place.
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was also traveling to Iran, with plans to visit Saudi Arabia the following day.
The Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.
The leader of the Soros-funded United We Dream group loudly explained her demand for amnesty — including amnesty for illegals who dropped out of taxpayer-funded American high-schools — while she was surrounded by roughly 20 supporters, many with video cameras:
Marion Maréchal-Le Pen's comments on the November 13 [attacks] are stupid, immediately tweeted Paris's Socialist Mayor, Anne Hidalgo.
There are some voices in the Democratic Party that freely admit how dangerously secular the Party has grown, he added. Their effort to bring sanity to their Party is commendable. But it is quite clear that they have failed.
A significant majority of Italians (64 percent) are favourable to the Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini's decision to close the country's ports. Of these, 80 percent want the government to stand by its absolute ban on new migrant landings even in the case of the vessels Sea Watch and Sea Eye, while the other 20 percent think an exception should be made for these 49 migrants.
The announcement came after an emergency meeting of the G7 via videoconference to discuss the global responses to COVID-19 which was announced on Friday. The emergency meeting — comprised of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan with the EU as an 'eighth' member — came after U.S. President Donald Trump had banned entry to foreign travellers from the Schengen Zone.
TRUMP, on developing tests for coronavirus in patients: The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. — Wednesday at the White House.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The president visited your home state of Texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?
Look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in, and I do think you have to control your borders, said Clinton, referring to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, We need to secure our borders, I'm for it, I voted for it, I believe in it.
There is some evidence that the increasing use of visa workers is reducing U.S. technological capability, even as Chinese companies take the lead from investor-driven U.S. companies.
Twitter also specifically opposed the blocking of social media and messaging apps.

But we need to get it right, said Rep. Williams. He again mentioned the border tax among other items that he said, is not something I can support, but I can support supporting small business, giving an opportunity to cash flow with the understanding that government would do their thing. He said he wants to see government get smaller and curb spending.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency confirmed to Breitbart News on Sunday that Perez Arriaga, the main suspect in the killing, was never properly turned over to federal immigration authorities despite his two previous arrests for drunk driving.
Five asylum seekers have taken their lives in Sweden, three of them in the last two weeks alone. The migrants have two things in common, all were young Afghan asylum seekers, and they were all scheduled to be deported. The problem is especially prevalent among young asylum seekers who even encourage others to kill themselves online Deutschlandfunk reports.
One of the claimed concessions made before the signing of the agreement from China was to work towards implementing International Labour Organization conventions which prohibit the use of slave labour and set out rights for labour unions.
Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of Yemen's Shiite Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee, asserted on Monday that the Chinese coronavirus is created by the U.S.
Retired Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin will discuss Gen. James Mattis' confirmation hearing and David Shulkin's nomination for VA Secretary.
A broader piece of model legislation, promulgated by the free-market think tank the Goldwater Institute, incorporates the reasoning of the same University of Chicago Stone Report used in the Tennessee law passed Tuesday to demand a policy of commitment to viewpoint neutral free speech protection by university administrations. This model Campus Free Speech Ac would demand university administrators punish students who disrupt invited speakers and other students exercising their constitutional right to free speech. Most controversially, it would require university administrators to suspend for a year any student twice found to have done so.

China always maintains vigilance and effective monitoring of the relevant country's military activities in the South China Sea, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. China's military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability.
We're going to reduce the time from what is now, what has been [in prior amnesty legislation] 13 years to eight years, Harris told Univision, a Spanish-language TV station January 12. She continued:

The Global Times also demanded Beijing strengthen the right to define the situation of the Taiwan Straits and work to deny Taiwan the right of self-determination. This means that we can ignore some of the messages that they want to highlight, and we can harshly stop the acts that they want to slip through unpunished, it suggested.
Payment of the BBC's TV tax is policed by enforcement officers, who employ detection vans which can detect the use of TV receiving equipment at specifically targeted addresses within minutes. If you notify TV Licencing that you no longer need a licence, the body may send enforcement officers to your home to confirm whether you still need to pay the tax.
We have been getting less and less water in the form of snowpack, which means less storage — we get more rain, so we can't store it. Sites, she said, provides another place to put that water.
Some conservative critics of the state's sanctuary policy interpreted Brown and Becerra's new guidance as a concession to the federal government.
Employers are increasingly adopting so-called implicit bias training, which targets employees by race or gender. Not only are the tests associated with unconscious bias well short of meeting scientific standards, but because they purport to aid employers in targeting employees primarily based on their race or ethnicity and/or their gender they potentially allow employees to be assessed, disciplined or promoted on the basis of race or gender activity which Title VII specifically bars. Whether based on good intentions or not, an employer's plan to hire, promote or advance employees who are minority and/or female using implicit bias as a motive disadvantages non-minority and male employees.
It would also require the schools to follow federal and state laws on religious neutrality, meaning that they must accommodate students' diverse religious views.
The Times published a list of suggestions for Beijing moving forward to help contain growing international awareness of the Communist Party's belligerence towards Taipei in light of Tsai's commanding victory. Among the suggestions was a call to encourage Tsai to ease her cross-Straits policies and not to further antagonize the Chinese mainland [the land legally within Chinese borders that does not include Beijing's illegally claimed territories].
Louisiana Republican Scalise called the No Ban Act bad policy that would not only make it more difficult to vet potentially dangerous entries but harm efforts to contain the global coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to reporters, he said:
North Korea has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage, long-range rocket. After several failures, it put its first satellite into space with a long-range rocket launched in December 2012.
That means today, while the Democrats have been blocking this bill, 1,073 additional people died, Cruz said. In the United States, as of this morning, there were 471 deaths reported due to coronavirus. As of right now, it's 573.
The revelation of the database has already sparked criticism from some prominent conservative media figures. Fox News's Brit Hume replied, This will not end well.
They don't depend on the public education system. They don't depend on mass transit. They don't care if civil servants are unresponsive and aren't doing their jobs because they don't depend on the government, he said, citing the example of elite New Yorkers who suddenly became deeply concerned about the poor state of jury facilities after generous exemptions from jury duty were eliminated in the 1990s.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that police are bracing themselves for a possible protest at Twitter HQ following the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account last week. A San Francisco Police Department spokesman stated that the department is aware of a possible demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street.
TEL AVIV – The meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marked a symbolic reset of relations after eight years of tension between the two countries, a top American foreign policy expert said on Friday.
The site's immigration writer, Dara Lind, described Sessions as the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies, who:
Ocasio-Cortez is a looker and I hazard a guess has had the privilege of turning men into gibbering idiots for most of her adult life. I have little doubt she has been trotting out utter nonsense and yet can make it look convincing and credible because she has hardly ever been challenged on it. This is what happens when beautiful women grow up in Leftist circles and are rarely called out for mixing up a billion with a trillion. This builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then suddenly when she enters Congress and her policies are examined by people on the Right, she thinks this is down to sexism. No. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.
The May 2016 policy presented the opportunity for our group to critically think and converse about our place on Harvard's campus and collectively determine our path forward, Menon added. The formation of The Fleur is the culmination of numerous discussions spanning the last two or so years within Harvard's Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma and with the administration. [Administrators] have helped shape the path we as a group have chosen to pursue.
Attacking the character of Yellow Vest protestors — who he did not call by name — and calling them un-French liars, Macron said in the televised address from his Paris palace that they are: the megaphones of a hate-filled crowd attacking elected representatives, the forces of law and order, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals.
Remember when Hillary Clinton repeatedly stated that the 55,000 pages she turned over to the State Department in December 2014 included all of her work-related emails?
Shasta Dam was built under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War Two, reaching 602 feet, though it was designed to be even bigger. (An even bigger dam was envisioned for the Klamath River, but was canceled in the 1970s; today dams along the Klamath are set to be torn down.)
Since then, Wall Street analysts have been asking themselves when the next hike is coming and how many hikes there will be before the world gets back to a normal monetary policy (whatever that means).
Fishing, in those communities, might be very important, but the truth is that the financial services industry is 11 per cent of the economy, she said to the former UKIP leader.
In 1981 the Australian population was around 14.9 million people. By June 2018 it had reached 25.0 million, with the last five million of that growth occurring since December 2004.
The interstate highway system is a good example of something good getting done in Washington, Brill proposed. You get a train in the United States versus a train in Europe, and there's a reason for the difference. The difference is that we haven't raised the gasoline tax since President Reagan raised it. The gasoline tax has actually gone down because it's 18 cents a gallon, and it was 18 cents a gallon when cars were getting six or seven miles to the gallon. It's now 18 cents a gallon when cars are getting three or four times that much.
Phil Lieberman, CEO of the US security company Lieberman Software, stated, Most of the serious intrusions are from dumb mistakes made by companies that are easily remediated by a consistent approach to managing access, security and looking for significant anomalies. Countermeasures are simple and effective such as air gaps, rate limiting, IP reputation, and improving identity management. He continued, Other simple ideas like compartmentalisation, security classification of assets and access, and the management of privileged identities and access provide large ROI and reduction of losses.
For several weeks he's played down the consequences of the public health emergency even as his agencies scramble to manage it. Now he's suggesting that a robust jobs report might be explained in part by the prospect that Americans are hunkering down and focusing more of their spending in their own country. There's no evidence that the virus has juiced jobs.
Indeed, when Kirkpatrick's article appeared, the Carter administration was meekly watching as a string of allied governments were being overthrown, including those of Somalia, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and Iran.
Contrary to speculation that the national security bureaucracy declassified this document decades ahead of schedule because it wanted to assert its primacy over Trump's chaotic foreign policy, the framework is broadly consistent with Trump's policy goals regarding China and the Indo-Pacific region.
This should be seen as China crossing an important threshold. Missile platforms present a clear offensive threat. [The missile deployment] is a pretty clear threat to the other claimants and furthers China's goal of establishing complete control over the water and airspace of the South China Sea.
Sessions has generally preferred a logical, categorical approach: The problem with unauthorized immigration is that it is illegal, and that illegality itself causes real pain to American citizens. Because Sessions doesn't rely on bad unauthorized immigrants to make his point, he doesn't open the door for sympathy toward good ones.
Britain left the European Union in name in January 2020, but remained subject to the EU, its judges, and its migration regime through a so-called transition period. It left in a real sense on at 11 pm on December 31st — according to supporters of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's exit deal, at least. But how did the country get here?
China's state-run Global Times analyzed Wang's interview as a strong signal to other countries, especially the new US administration, that China's foreign policy has always been continuous and stable as China always hopes to return to a mutually beneficial and win-win track.
It was a change of tune for Powell. Less than a month ago, Powell appeared to brush off the downturn in stocks as a little volatility.
The companies' demand to hire the best foreign graduates is belied by their mass hiring of lower-skill and mid-tier foreign graduates, said the U.S. professional. If the best-ranked foreign graduates are really that good, they can meet the O-1 requirements, he said, adding they are not the best and brightest … [because companies] want the indentured workforce and the cheap labor.
This isn't just about illegal immigration, and it isn't just about stopping dangerous gang members from coming into our country. It's also about stopping the flow of drugs coming across our border, killing Americans in communities across the country, said Sen. Cassidy. It's time we uphold our responsibility to secure the border and protect Americans. It's a national security priority, it's a health priority, it should be an American priority.
Indeed, the Telegraph reports that the Cabinet did not agree to an indefinite 'transition', during which Britain would effectively remain inside the European Union but lose it's voting powers in the European Parliament and Council.
But Andrzejewski admits the legality of sanctuary cities is an open question the courts will likely settle. The sanctuary city experiment, he said, is the supreme test of the rule of law.
Many of those same lawmakers have also opposed illegal immigration and in-state college tuition for undocumented immigrants, including dreamers — the young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.
Also slated for discussion is Hollywood's treatment of conservatives, the box office revenue implosion, the #MeToo campaign, and the broader impact of popular culture on politics.
In an effort to rein in its members, The Guardian reports that the head of the EU's powerful executive arm, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen — who is German — is contacting the EU-27's health ministers to ensure that they will continue to follow the bloc's orders.
Alyssa Milano, the actress who's become a major online presence on issues of women's rights as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday to Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz, telling him the candidate needed to change. More calls came in, more tough conversations.
But Syria's isolation was never complete. China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa maintained diplomatic ties. In the Arab world, Lebanon, Iraq and Algeria never broke ranks with Syria. Propped up by Russia, China and Iran, Assad never really felt the pinch politically.
The problem is defined in an April 19, 2019 addition under Attorney General Sessions. USCIS issued a Policy Alert which includes: 'An applicant who is involved in certain marijuana related activist s may lack GMC (Good Moral Character) if found to have violated federal law, even if such activity is unlawful under applicable state or foreign laws,' he wrote.
The highest profile signer of the letter was former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), who had even publicly floated potentially running against Pelosi. But, within a week of Fudge's opposition to Pelosi becoming public and an interview she gave considering a Speakership bid herself, Fudge completely reversed course and actually endorsed Pelosi for Speaker.
Also notable was Pence's lavish praise for now-official White House adviser Ivanka Trump. He called the First Daughter a Great Leader and a Champion for Small Business, comparing her upbringing in the Trump Organization to his own experience working as an attendant in his father's Indiana gas station.
DeLisle suggested Taiwan can play the values card by arguing that it plays by the rules of global agencies much better than China does, and if all else fails, Taipei can get some diplomatic mileage out of simply acting like a full member of international regimes, even when Beijing blocks formal membership.
I think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.
As I wrote last week, there is no question there's a growing optimism in the country, an increase in overall satisfaction, a growing belief we are on the right track. Like I said, I've been following these numbers for going on a decade now, and on the right track/wrong track question, this country has been upside down by 20,30, and even 40 point margins going back to 2006, the last two years of the George W. Bush administration — and except for a few momentary blips, straight through the Obama administration.
Public support in the licence fee is already eroded, however, with a YouGov poll from December showing that half of Britons want the TV tax scrapped and the BBC to earn its own money, rather than simply be entitled to it.
This president can talk about background checks all day long. But that's nothing more than a distraction away from the fact that he can't keep us safe and he supported every gun control proposal that's ever been made, he added. He doesn't support the individual right to own a firearm. That's been the position of his Supreme Court nominees. That's been the position of his administration. So what are we going to talk about, basketball? I'm not really interested in going over and talking to the president who doesn't have a basic level of respect or understanding of the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners in this country.
She said that 15 of her extended family members were interned in the camps for these reasons, including both of her parents, for not cooperating with the Communist Party of China and for performing pilgrimage, being religious, being rich, and having more children.
Citing sources and recent activity in the region, the Epoch Times reported last week that Chinese officials are drastically intensifying efforts to conceal evidence of hundreds of tortuous re-education centers for Muslims in Xinjiang in advance of potential inspections.
Since Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, its citizens have been able to work and reside wherever they want within the bloc, with all the restrictions lifted in 2014.
But the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting 1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.
The rule was applauded by Daniel Costa, at the left-wing Economic Policy Institute.
The cheap-labor policy has also reduced investment and job creation in many interior states because the coastal cities have a surplus of imported labor. For example, almost 27 percent of zip codes in Missouri had fewer jobs or businesses in 2015 than in 2000, according to a new report by the Economic Innovation Group. In Kansas, almost 29 percent of zip codes had fewer jobs and businesses in 2015 compared to 2000, which was a two-decade period of massive cheap-labor immigration.
In other words, al-Assad has no intention at all of respecting the truce, since he considers all Sunnis to be terrorists, including women and children.
While Yemen has no documented Chinese coronavirus patients, it has endured an extensive famine as a product of the civil war between the government and the Houthis, one exacerbated by Houthi jihadists blocking aid into the country. The result has been the creation of a country in which the vast majority of people are reliant on humanitarian aid to live, but tons of food rot in ports because the Houthis block aid workers from distributing it.
Clift said, Well, these latest rounds of crackdowns have to do with people coming from Central America last year and the year before. And that's because word went out, chiefly from the smuggling operators, that if you get to this country, you can figure out a way to stay and it's all right. So, a lot of mothers and young children and young teens came, and the administration is trying to send them right back. And it looks heartless, and it doesn't seem like it's in keeping with this president's values, but it is the way the law operates. And I'm not sure, the administration could be shifting its policy on this. I wouldn't say this is the last word.
Bannon and Rosebush discussed how Nancy Reagan really understood political and social issues but often avoided becoming directly involved with policy because she thought it was improper.
This marks the first time Iran honored a single man with a multi-city ceremony. Not even Khomeini received such a processional with his death in 1989. Soleimani on Monday will lie in state at Tehran's famed Musalla mosque as the revolutionary leader did before him.
Writing at CNN.com, Leon Aron, Director of Russian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, opined, Short of the tiger turning herbivore, Putin is not leaving Syria. To paraphrase Churchill, as far as Syria is concerned, Russia's involvement is not at an end, not even at the beginning of an end. It's just the end of the beginning.
The investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict, and in accordance with all applicable regulations and policy, the military said in a statement quoted by Reuters.
The president-elect says he plans to introduce an immigration bill immediately. It's not clear if that will be a larger reform package or a more narrow bill targeted at Dreamers — undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age, according to our transition reporting team. [Emphasis added] Biden's immigration policy advisers also met with Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.) about a week ago to discuss legislation, a source with knowledge tells Laura Barron-Lopez. [Emphasis added]
In 2016 testimony to the Senate, Howard University professor Ron Hira testified that:
He suggested to pass tax reform and let Main Street America run with it, while the government finds other revenue sources, cuts the size of government, just like every home does, just like every business does when they have a shortage.
Loomer at one point rhetorically asked: Why is it that I get banned as a Jewish conservative but Louis Farrakhan is still on Twitter? Loomer was referring to Farrakhan's comments about Jewish people in a video he posted to Twitter where he refers to them as termites stating: To the members of the Jewish community that don't like me, thank you very much for putting my name all over the planet … I'm not mad at you, 'cause you're so stupid.
The president also met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week, expressing hope that Brasilia-Washington ties would thrive during his presidency. He told reporters that he would discuss the implementation of a U.S. military base in Brazil with American officials in the future, given growing military operations by Russia in neighboring Venezuela.

Implementing the change would be a promise kept to the laid off, replaced, and forgotten American workers who rallied with Trump against all odds in the 2016 presidential election.
Citing state media, Reuters reports that it will be the longest range maneuvers ever conducted by the force.
However, Parker says — despite his rhetoric — he is the perfect example to demonstrate the success of capitalism.
To others, especially advocates of industry and agriculture, the Oroville near-disaster was proof the state government had neglected California's infrastructure needs in favor of redistribution, water conservation mandates, or flashy pet projects.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the e-commerce platform Shopify has banned TrumpStore.com, a website run by the Trump campaign and Trump Organization. The removal appears to be in response to the events in Washington D.C. this week.
Relatively unknown in Iran until the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Soleimani's popularity and mystique grew out American officials calling for his killing. By the time it came a decade and a half later, Soleimani had become Iran's most recognizable battlefield commander, ignoring calls to enter politics but becoming as powerful, if not more, than its civilian leadership.
Harris's statement was vague, but her comment about automatic green cards for TPS migrants suggests Biden may push for a law that allows every group of TPS migrants to get citizenship, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

The 1.5 million foreign workers are heavily used by major technology companies and many software companies, banks, insurance companies, universities, consulting companies, accountancy, and engineering firms. The employers are concentrated in California, Texas, and New York, but are also used through the country. For example, many visa workers are being used by banks and insurance companies in Connecticut and North Carolina, even as middle-aged U.S. workers are being fired.
One day earlier, Rio Grande City agents teamed up with officers from the Roma Police Department to raid a fifth stash house in two days. Inside the house, agents found eight illegal immigrants and took them into custody.
Former Navy Secretary and former Asst Sec Def @JimWebbUSA would be someone to consider seriously for SecDef. His foreign policy views line up better with @realdonaldtrump and are not Bush 3.0. — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) December 21, 2018
The fighter jet purchases are part of a greater proposed defense spending increase in the year's budget. The South China Morning Post reports that Taiwan is looking to increase its defense spending from two to three percent of its GDP in 2018, a high not seen since 1999. This would mean spending up to $11.4 billion on defense. Tsai's predecessor, the Kuomintang Party's Ma Jing-yeou, took a conciliatory approach to relations with Beijing.
In addition to the economic devastation an open borders policy that Ossoff champions — which he laid out at a LatinX for Ossoff event last week — would create, Perdue said the public safety concerns with the leftist vision of defunding police combined with sanctuary cities is a recipe for disaster for Georgians who should want checks and balances in the U.S. Senate rather than a blank check to the open borders lobbyists.
1 in 5 women experience sexual assault or attempted assault while in college, Planned Parenthood tweeted Sunday. Students are raising their voices in opposition to this rule. They won't stand for this threat to their health, safety, and education, and they won't be fighting alone.
According to the Washington Examiner, WaPo admitted editing out the line when asked. WaPo's editors said, We reserve the right to edit letters. As part of our normal process, we share edited letters with letter-writers at least twice in the process (including a final edited version). The problem here is that WaPo did not edit out a superfluous line that ought not to have been there in the first place. Rather, they took out the line that pulled the covers back on the fact that they had rejected the opportunity to go the NRA event and learn how suppressors actually work. And then, after rejecting that opportunity, had railed against pending suppressor regulation and the NRA.
For context, Karaganov was one of a number of Russian sources quoted by the New York Times in a February 14 piece that labored mightily to portray the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as a buzzkill for Russian euphoria over Trump's election victory.
The stark reality of an ageing society, Sturgeon argued, means she has a duty to make the case for free movement no matter how difficult that is sometimes perceived to be.
As Bill McGurn argues in the Wall Street Journal Monday, in his day, Dr. Ehrlich's assertion about the limited 'carrying capacity' of the Earth was settled science. Never mind that it is rooted in an absurdity: that when a calf is born a country's wealth rises, but when a baby is born it goes down.
The European Parliament passed a motion in December calling for access to the camps in Xinjiang, sanctions, and saying that no investment treaty should be struck which didn't include China ratifying human rights conventions, especially the convention on forced labour, and then the European Commission rams through this deal within days despite the European Parliament's wishes.
What is left is a de facto obstacle course migration system for blue-collar migrants — a chaotic Hunger Games trail of loans, coyotes, cartels, rape, deserts, weather, border laws, barriers, rescuers, transport, judges, and cheap-labor employers.
In 2018 the company shut down the account of social media Gab after the corporate media reported that a gunman who killed 11 people in an attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue had posted anti-Semitic content to the platform.
The Chinese government typically responds to American exercises in the region rapidly. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the sovereign territories of Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the waters off the coast of Indonesia.
We're gonna pass the largest tax cut in American history. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, Pence boasted, We're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the kind of world class health care they deserve.
The empty vessel of the old Whig Party had collapsed after the Compromise of 1850—which was in large part a concession to pro-slavery forces of the slave states widely praised at the time. As the nation began to unravel, new political factions and coalitions emerged.
This, Heymann goes on to say, will lead to massive political resistance because prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.
The deal is, first of all, typically lopsided. In exchange for five Americans–who were likely innocent of much of all charges–Iran will secure the release of seven guilty Iranians, plus charges dropped against 14 others who violated international sanctions and whom the U.S. wanted extradited. Two Americans still remain behind in Iran.
Though not in the 302, at the end of the interview she apologized for the work and effort it created for the FBI. She said words to the effect of, I'm sorry this has caused so much work and expenditure of resources by the FBI. I chose to use my own server out of convenience; it proved to be anything but.
Graham's remarks come a day after House impeachment managers during the Senate impeachment trial brought up the Bidens, arguing that they did nothing wrong and that President Trump's call for Ukraine to look into what they did was an abuse of power.
The child laborers can bypass part of the obstacle course because of a law passed unanimously in 2008. The law allowed the inflow of at least 315,000 Central American children and youths since 2013, who have reduced pressure on employers to offer higher wages or buy labor-saving machinery:
The draft agreement, announced this week by Brexit minister David Davis and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, says the UK shall continue to contribute to the financing of many defence and foreign policy structures until the end of 2020.
Biden's latest views appear to have been influenced by the abortion lobby, rather than the Catholic church.
In an August 25, 2016, email thread with the subject line Found him, which was initiated by an unidentified Chicago FBI field office agent and sent to agents in New York, Cleveland and Washington field offices as well as someone in the counterintelligence division, the Chicago agent writes: Address is [redacted]. Photo attached.
Trump's plentiful and sometimes inaccurate comments on the outbreak this past week prompted the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., to suggest that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stand back and let the experts do the talking. Trump paid that advice no heed.

Instead, however, President Obama's eight-page executive action plan on water, released Tuesday, says nothing at all about increasing farmers' access to water. Instead, it calls for data collection, communication by federal agencies, new research, and papers — in other words, more bureaucratic activity, rather than more water storage or water allocations.
Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

Omar has telegraphed her practical aims for this particular policy. In the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as Iran and Venezuela. Last April, she accused President Trump of declaring a fake emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allowed him to direct funding towards the construction of physical barriers.
Project 21 has been a leader in the black conservative movement for 25 years.
This is not the first time that the leftist media has tried to spin virtue out of the coronavirus crisis. In March last year, you'll remember, the MSM was in ecstasies over the fact that — thanks to the total destruction of its tourist economy — Venice now had cleaner canals.
The Chinese Communist Party is using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to crack down on Christians, even arresting some for attending online services via Zoom, David Curry, the CEO of the Christian charity Open Doors, told Breitbart News in an interview on Wednesday.
The Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the progress of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers free preventive care including contraception by repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.
Scuffles erupted between protesters and police as parents demanded accountability for the scandal and hard information about which children were injected with expired doses.
The British government's Green Book for coronavirus vaccinations states that every effort should be made to ensure patients receive the same vaccine for the second dose. It does go on to note that: For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule.
There needs to be some consequence for having a sanctuary policy, said Jessica Vaughan, advising the federal government to withhold certain funding from sanctuary city jurisdictions that shield criminal illegal aliens from justice. Sanctuary policies, she added, are killing Americans.
On Monday, Project 21 co-chairman Horace Cooper signed and sent letters to John M. Gore, acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, and acting chairman Victoria Lipnic at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Also, the California-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the release of a migrant on March 23 because of the claimed threat posed by the coronavirus. The published order allows judges in the circuit's lower courts to order the release of other migrants.
The interstate highway system is a good example of something good getting done in Washington, Brill proposed. You get a train in the United States versus a train in Europe, and there's a reason for the difference. The difference is that we haven't raised the gasoline tax since President Reagan raised it. The gasoline tax has actually gone down because it's 18 cents a gallon, and it was 18 cents a gallon when cars were getting six or seven miles to the gallon. It's now 18 cents a gallon when cars are getting three or four times that much.

The video included the Senator's arguments surrounding the impeachment trial, meaning that YouTube is now censoring the congressional and historical record of impeachment.
What Twitter did went beyond censorship, Della Rocca stated. They decided to label what happened. They decided to say that 'This is dissemination of hacked materials. So we're not going to let you push it through. We're not going to let you spread this information.'

However, most of the workers from the American contractor left Iraq in late December 2017.
An Al Qaeda-linked jihadist group Hay'at Tahir al-Sham (HTS) is gaining swaths of territory in the northern province of Idlib, usurping control from Turkish-backed groups connected to the National Liberation Front (NLF). The goals of the group, otherwise known as the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, are centered on dominating as much territory as possible ahead of planned talks between Russia and Turkey, to bring a final end to the almost eight-year Syrian civil war. Based on a previous agreement, Turkey was supposed to have reigned in the extremist outfit – now raising concerns it may not have the capacity to do so.
Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
It is important that we know where these applications are coming from, and that the Government develops a coherent, defensible and transparent policy in processing asylum requests.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the payment processing service Stripe will no longer process payments for President Trump's campaign website following last week's events at the Capitol. The financial-tech company handles credit card payments for millions of online business and e-commerce platforms. President Trump's campaign used the service for processing donations to the campaign. Stripe is a private company valued at $36 billion founded by brothers Patrick and John Collison, who remain citizens of Ireland.

President Trump had said: The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots… As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.
Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.
This simply kicks the crisis can down the road, Morgan said. Without significant and permanent walk back of their open-borders strategies, without actively listening and continuing to work based on truth in reality, the only result will be a continuing and steady increase in the numbers.
The goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.
After snubbing the NRA's offer to shoot with suppressors firsthand and learn how they really work, the Washington Post (WaPo) ran an editorial asking Congress to turn a deaf ear to the NRA's claim that suppressors protect hearing.
But that is a fight about allocation. McClintock focused on storage, noting that the cheapest and best way to solve the state's water problems — measured in cost per acre-foot — is to build more reservoirs rather than letting much of the state's rainfall run out to sea. McClintock reminded me that it has been 40 years since California's last dam, the New Melones Dam, was completed in 1978.
Biden's shift radically leftward reflects that of his party.
And the pig is the Green New Deal itself which isn't remotely new, or particularly green, and which is far too expensive and damaging to merit the flattering term 'deal'.
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, the same dean who pushed dropping the term master in favor of faculty dean, instructed the Honor Council to help carry out enforcement of the penalty against students participating in both single-sex social groups and leadership positions on campus. In January, after faculty criticism of the policy, Khurana created a task force to address the criticisms and reconsider the policy.
He added, I don't want to overreact. I think this is a moment hopefully in time with the outcry around the election results.
Cavusoglu stated on Sunday that Turkey is offended by Trump administration officials, such as National Security Adviser John Bolton, and foreign governments, such as Israel, telling the Turks they cannot push as far into Syria as they deem necessary for their own security interests.
The Times' influence operation against American Jews and American Jewish supporters of Israel is being carried out – conveniently enough — by its Jewish columnists. These writers run the gamut from far-leftists to neo-liberal former conservatives in the Never Trump camp.
Kabila has shut down the internet all week, supposedly to prevent the incitement of riots. Kabila has made it illegal for any organization to announce election results before CENI does. It is believed that these laws were specifically targeted against the Catholic Church, which had sent more than 40,000 observers to polling stations across the country.
I think you'll find a vast majority [of GOP senators] will have wished he hadn't said it, Paul added.
Graham is a consistent advocate for greater immigration of foreign workers and consumers. In 2012, for example, he pushed Sen. Chuck Schumer to jointly launch the Gang of Eight amnesty and cheap labor campaign. He told reporters on January 21:
The 24-story public housing complex is owned by the local government council in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea and was completed in the 1970s. It is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, which spent 10 million pounds ($12.8 million) refurbishing the building over the last two years.
For most of the past decade, Merkel enjoyed stellar popularity ratings as she pushed middle-ground policies which helped her party capture voters from the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). But critics say it has left her conservatives' right flank exposed.

Biden was silent on many critical details. For example, he did not say how migrants would be judged as welcome for life in the United States — even though at least 150 million people want that prize. He was silent about how rejected migrants would be deterred from entering the obstacle course, and how they would be sent home — even though 11 million resident illegals are already refusing to leave the United States.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued new guidance to state and local law enforcement agencies on Wednesday allowing them to release some information about illegal aliens in custody — even if that helped federal immigration agents.
Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who will serve as lead prosecutor for the trial, read the charges accusing Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors.
For example, GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander, who voted for the Gang of Eight Amnesty in 2013, used a January 3 article in the Washington Post to urge Trump to endorse a huge amnesty that would drive down wages before the election:
Schumer, who also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act, elaborated on his pro-border security stance a few years later in a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center, in which the senator told his audience that referring to illegal aliens as undocumented is unacceptable.
The new language is included in the new rules for the congressional committee in 2021 and 2022. The Democrats drafted the rules and pushed them through Congress on Monday, via a 217 to 206 party-line vote.

Daschle called impeachment at a moment that party control of the Senate is so tenuous a mistake, saying it would first galvanize Trump's supporters and then delay work on crucial issues. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has favored proceeding, even with the coming 50-50 split in the chamber. An impeachment mechanism is just not the right course at all if they want to hold the president accountable, Daschle said at a forum Monday with Lott held by the Bipartisan Policy Center.

He said Bulgarian MEPs have successfully lobbied the European Parliament to take a stand on the issue. If Macedonia were an EU member, things would have worked another way, of course, Bechev told AFP.
Bromund found it absurd that Taiwan was blocked from Interpol membership while the Palestinian Authority was accepted. For that matter, he argued that China is not truly fit for Interpol membership because it engages in a number of clearly unacceptable activities, such as using politicized corruption investigations to get rid of officials who fall out of favor and threatening the Chinese families of individuals abroad to secure their compliance.
The post-2013 arrival of 1.9 million Central American migrants was prompted, in part, by claims from coyotes and cartels that Obama's deputies were allowing migrants into the United States. Obama's deputies, including DHS chief Jeh Johnson, publicly denied the claims even as they allowed the migrants free passage. There is no free pass, Johnson said in June 2014. There are no permisos for children, for your children, who come to the United States.

If so, it would appear that Cummings has been outfoxed.

The Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.

Tur said Trump's sentences are stronger than they are. … And this is exactly the way he operated in the campaign, and what was so — brilliant is the wrong word, but what was so brilliant about it was that anybody who watched him could take whatever they wanted to take from that. So, if you were a Donald Trump supporter because you believed he's going to bring back jobs, the offensive things he said, you put to the side, you didn't worry about. If you were a Donald Trump supporter because you liked the offensive things he said, you were a white nationalist, maybe, you took his subtle queues and his lack of severe condemnations as a cue that, you know, he is accepting of my point of view, and he's going to champion what I want. And you're seeing that with foreign policy.

Even as U.S. crude production rose, industry watchers were unconcerned about global oversupply, confident that OPEC—led by global swing producer Saudi Arabia—would take its usual approach and cut production. At the November 2014 OPEC meeting on Thanksgiving Day, however, that confidence evaporated. The cartel announced it would maintain its production levels, sending prices into a tailspin. In June 24, the price of oil was $110 per barrel. By January 2016, the price was just $26.
In other words, al-Assad has no intention at all of respecting the truce, since he considers all Sunnis to be terrorists, including women and children.

The Fed also announced detailed plans for how it will unwind the large balance sheet it built up by buying bonds during the financial crisis and in the years that followed. Questions over how and when the Fed would shrink its balance sheet have been foremost in the minds of investors and monetary policy mavens for some time. The Fed said it would reduce its holdings later this year by not reinvesting some of the funds received when bonds it holds mature. Currently, the Fed reinvests all of the proceeds from maturing bonds.
Jeh C. Johnson, who served in the Obama administration as secretary of homeland security and general counsel of the Defense Department, said the laws Trump could invoke with his national emergency declaration are designed to authorize military construction projects during wartime. He said using them for a border wall could curtail presidential powers in the years to come as lawmakers react to Trump and work to constrain him. The danger of using an authority like this and stretching it beyond its intended use is that Congress could then take it away, and it could not be used in situations where it's really needed, Johnson said. Robert F. Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama, said Trump would be poorly positioned to defend such an action in federal courts, in part because his statements about the wall have been contradictory and have contained provable falsehoods.
Powell also said that the Fed could be flexible on its balance sheet reduction, the unwind of the enormous pile of bonds that it accumulated through its quantitative easing program. Last month, he had desribed the balance sheet reduction as being on auto pilot.

In it, Stephens insisted that all of Trump's pro-Israel policies are basically meaningless. Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem; scrapping the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran; reinstating crippling economic sanctions on the Iranian regime; defunding the Palestinian Authority and UN agencies devoted to the perpetuation of Palestinian suffering and hatred for Israel — these are all meaningless gestures, by Stephens's telling.

The scorecard for implementing the 2017 strategic framework over the following three years is far from perfect, especially after the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, which China ruthlessly exploited to overturn many of the policy goals outlined in the NSC document. As 2020 drew to a close, China was aggressively using the pandemic and its disruptions to argue for the superiority of its authoritarian system and command economy, the exact opposite of how the framework authors hoped the world's new struggle against authoritarianism would be faring at the end of Trump's term.
Possibly this is good news for Johnson, who, as a reward for this nonsense, may now get more nookie from his eco-activist girlfriend Carrie Symonds (aka Princess Nut Nut). But it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.

In other words, Aquinas taught that total integration of immigrants into the life, language, customs and culture (including worship, in this case) was necessary for full citizenship.
If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, this is the opportunity to create it in this country. I mean, look at Bernie Sanders himself. He wrote a book. He made a million dollars because he wrote a book, she told Breitbart News. He created a product, consumers wanted to buy it, and they did. And he had success out of it. He is the American dream story because of entrepreneurism. Because of our capitalistic system, he has been successful. He's the perfect example, actually.
In a tight labor market, they still have market power [to demand higher wages]; With a globalized labor market, American workers lose that market power, he added.

One of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

In response to the report, the last Governor of Hong Kong and a former Chairman of the Conservative Party, Lord Patten of Barnes, said it demonstrated a terrifying view of the cruelty of Xi Jinping's brutal regime.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
The claim rings a bit hollow, considering the repeated public teaser images of herself that she posted to social media.

A sampling of the past week's rhetoric on the virus and other matters and how it compares with the facts:
It says Russia has managed to heighten its role in solving global problems and international conflicts. That heightened role has caused a reaction by the West, it says. The strengthening of Russia happens against the background of new threats to the national security, which has complex and interrelated nature, the document says. Conducting an independent policy, both international and domestic has caused counteraction from the USA and its allies, which are striving to retain their dominance in global affairs. That in turn is likely to lead to political, economical, military and informational pressure on Russia, the document says.
Under the recommendations, students, starting with the class of 2021, who seek leadership positions, captaincies, or fellowships will have to sign a written statement affirming their commitment to nondiscrimination on the basis of characteristics of 'intrinsic identity,' including gender.

While Poland moved quickly to ban travel from coronavirus hotspots in the early stages of the pandemic and was an early adopter of masking rules, its lockdowns have not been as stringent as in some countries, and the national-conservative government has announced 1 billion złoty (£196 million) in state assistance for highlanders impacted by closures — but Pitoń has dismissed the funding as scraps and akin to bribing the public with their own money.

The law also demands campuses use the actual legal definition of student-on-student harassment handed down by the Supreme Court, behavior so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims' educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities.

The consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. Across the ocean, the South African city of Cape Town, Africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. Its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. As a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.

It was about a month ago Congress wasn't quite ready to take that first step to repeal and replace that disastrous policy. But the president remains confident that, with your strong support, and maybe you could talk to a member of Congress before you leave town, that we'll get a fresh start on health care in America … I want to promise you. Working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, President Trump is going to make sure that these majorities and this nation's capitol keep our promise to the American people. We're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the ability to purchase health insurance that they want and not what the government dictates and mandates.
It's going up too fast, said Jeremy Merrin, the owner of a chain of Cuban restaurants. Merrin said minimum wage increases forced him to close two of his New York City locations and raise prices at his others. We can't catch our breath, he added.

In a September 8, 2016, email from New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt to Kortan, Schmidt gives the DOJ an early heads up on something we're planning on reporting today, which was about Clinton's email server technician, Paul Combetta, deleting Hillary's subpoenaed emails, and saying The fact that Combetta was given immunity takes much of the air out of the idea that DOJ needs to investigate the deletions.
To date, the height of the Times' onslaught against Jews – Israeli and American – who think that actual pro-Israel policies are more meaningful than abstract concepts, and believe that it is antisemitic to argue that Jews are uniquely unworthy of self-determination — came last week. On January 4, the Times' deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman published an essay titled, American Jews and Israeli Jews are headed for a messy breakup.
Despite the president repeatedly harping on voter fraud throughout the evening and alleging the November 3 general election was rigged, he warned that Republicans must still participate in Tuesday's election to retain the Senate majority. You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can't steal it or cheat it away, Trump said.
The coronavirus outbreak in China has highlighted severe and longstanding weaknesses in our medical supply chain. This is more than unfortunate; it's a danger to public health. Our health officials need to know the extent of our reliance on Chinese production so they can take all necessary action to protect Americans. This legislation will give us the information we need to better secure our supply chain and ensure that Americans have uninterrupted access to life-saving drugs and medical devices.
NASA and NOAA announced that 2019 was the second warmest year since modern record keeping began in 1880, helping to make the 2010s the warmest decade on record.
It means this deep recognition that our sole responsibility is to protect the American people. When we do that, I am very confident we will increase security for people all around the world, we will raise others up as well. But our mission set, everyday, is to say, 'How do we make sure that everything we do secures freedom for America?' and it's gotten us to walk away from a whole bunch of things. We've walked away from the World Health Organization. We walked away from the UN Human Rights Commission. We walked away from some of the central understandings of the World Trade Organization. Each of these things was detrimental to the American people, their prosperity, their security. We were right to do that. It's a sensibility that I think 75 million people still understand and understood in November of this year. They haven't stopped understanding, I promise you that.
Mattis had strongly held beliefs about maintaining and respecting allies, which he cited in his resignation letter to Trump.

The January deadline claim is based on the advocates' claim that agency officials need a few weeks planning time to prepare and launch the amnesty by March 5 when the two-year work-permits invented by President Barack Obama will start expiring at a more rapid pace.
Government sources say Mr Johnson has 'buckled' under pressure from Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill to let Huawei help to build the system. They claim that Sir Mark, the powerful head of the Civil Service, has 'manipulated' Mr Johnson into agreeing the deal by presenting it as a 'fait accompli' – and by 'nobbling' the British security services into dropping their objections. A source said: 'There is a massive row brewing over all this. 'Sedwill is telling people not to 'worry their little heads about it', and manipulating Boris into appeasement by saying that as the deal was already given the green light by Theresa May, to cancel it would require him to actively reverse the decision of a predecessor.' Sir Mark has told the Prime Minister that a ban on Huawei equipment would delay the widespread introduction of 5G for at least two years after the 2025 deadline in the Tory manifesto – and would also delay the availability of super-fast broadband.
We are proud that NARAL's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. We know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways. Both candidates need to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to Roe v. Wade and safeguarding abortion access. When Joe Biden fell short of that commitment, supporting the discriminatory Hyde Amendment, we pushed him along with our partners committed to reproductive justice. We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.

Indeed, the Roosevelt administration made some notably hard-nosed choices about working with sons-of-bitches—and worse. For instance, during World War Two, FDR made the wise decision to actively aid the Soviet Union in its fight against Nazi Germany. Roosevelt's logic was as simple as it was impeccable: The Soviets were bad, but the Nazis were much worse. After all, it was Hitler who declared war on the U.S.
Indeed, when Kirkpatrick's article appeared, the Carter administration was meekly watching as a string of allied governments were being overthrown, including those of Somalia, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and Iran.

Johnson claimed that all institutions will be expected to have an explicit statement expressing their commitment to free speech principles. They are crucial in demonstrating to students that free speech should be at the heart of a higher education community, Johnson finished.
Her story sheds light on the relative ease with which people smuggle migrants into the UK, along with the attitude of the activists who may have been involved in pressuring her into committing a crime.
Migration, in many ways, underpins Central American economies and provides an escape valve for these countries, said the 2020 report by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which added:
The reform does not cover the 2021 award of 85,000 new visas because it was processed so late in President Donald Trump's administration.
The California Department of Water Resources notes: On average, California receives about 200 million acre-feet of water per year in the form of rain and snow. (It adds that the state rarely experiences an average year.) The state's reservoirs can capture about 42 million acre-feet of that — roughly one-fifth. The rest seeps into underground aquifers, or flows out to the sea.
The remittances [from migrants] are not sufficient for compensating the negative impacts that emigration has on human development in the societies of origin, for example, the loss of the most entrepreneurial individuals, said a 2012 report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

He also agreed with Mansour's point that much of the vast sum appropriated by the government for infrastructure, notably including President Barack Obama's massive 2009 stimulus bill, simply disappears into the bureaucracy with little tangible benefit for the American people.
Internalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.
The USCIS rule provides that legal immigrants would be less likely to secure permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.
Additionally, Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who has been serving since August as the special representative for Syrian engagement and was named last week as the American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, is to travel to Syria this week in an effort to reassure the U.S.'s Kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned, Bolton said.

The point is, Iran's behavior has not changed at all, despite what the Obama administration said all through the negotiations: if we can just solve this nuclear program, they'll start behaving like a civilized nation.

Federal law permits schools to provide separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers 'on the basis of sex,' as long as the school provides comparable facilities for 'each sex,' the memo says. Therefore, we believe the plain ordinary public meaning of the controlling statutory and regulatory text requires a recipient providing 'separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex' to regulate access based on biological sex,' says the memo.

The Justice Department says it is taking measures to ensure that jurisdictions receiving federal grant money are in compliance with federal law, and that includes sanctuary cities.
Biden is expected to use his regulatory powers in government agencies to enforce that view. For example, he has said that men should be allowed to stay in women-only prisons if they claim to have a female gender identity.
Mr. Buffett will on occasion utilize Berkshire personnel and/or have Berkshire pay for minor items such as postage or phone calls that are personal.

That extra wave of migrants further cuts Americans' wages and drives up their rents while forcing more chaotic diversity into American society — but it also boosts Wall Street investors by cutting labor costs and by spiking sales to welfare-aided consumers.
Even progress in media technology totally changed things, he continued. In the 1940s and 50s and 60s, the invention of radio and television actually brought the country together. The whole country listened to FDR's fireside chats or listened to Edward R. Murrow reporting about World War 2. We watched the moon landing together. We watched the Kennedy assassination and the funeral together. We did everything together and we saw the same events.

The Epoch Times, a Chinese-American anti-communist newspaper, sent journalists to speak with the heads of several funeral homes and crematoriums in Hubei province – whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicenter of the current novel coronavirus outbreak. The newspaper found that adding up the total number of people cremated per day in several funeral homes yielded a significantly larger number than the official number of deaths tallied since the outbreak began in December.
Joe Biden's would-be immigration chief says a 'comprehensive' immig. deal would raise wages.

As per from the current policy of the Communist Party of China … the funeral home must give priority to the burning of novel coronavirus patients' bodies; other bodies may not be burned on the same day due to funeral culture, rituals, and other reasons, the article notes. Based on this, it can be inferred that the 116 dead [at You Hu's crematorium] basically all died of novel coronavirus pneumonia, or at least suspected of having died of it.
Calais is currently a hotbed of violence and controversy all focused on the migrant camp called the Jungle.
In 1981 the Australian population was around 14.9 million people. By June 2018 it had reached 25.0 million, with the last five million of that growth occurring since December 2004.
In any event, the war is, at least notionally, over. But it was in the end marked by an exhausted, distracted, and locked down public not with a bang, but a whimper.
Kirkpatrick thus put her finger on a central and enduring aspect of liberalism: namely, the instinct to focus intensely on the small flaws of friends, while being blind to the larger flaws of foes. She derided this liberal impulse as a formula for self-abasement and apology. And we might add that this mindset never seems to change—hence, decades later, Barack Obama's notorious apology tours.
If you look at the majority of new Democrats in the house, they tend to be, I say, center-left, if they are not left-left, the Democrat-turned-Independent continued. And that is because they had to be center-left to win some of those competitive swing districts that they took from Republicans. So that's the hope.
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price and Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office and Management and Budget, disagree with the Congressional Budget Office's assessment on the cost and other impacts of the GOP's American Health Care Act, which concludes that as many as 24 million would be uninsured by 2026 under the new law.
Update — Qantas contacted Breitbart News with the following statement:
Musse Hossein is an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who tries to help his fellow countrymen. He said of the underage migrants he has met, they feel lonely, have mental problems, and when their asylum petition is rejected, the situation is, of course, serious.

Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan in the 1980s returned to the motherland with an addiction rate than also approached 20 percent. This heroin bomb then does collateral damage back home. The returning soldiers brought home a heroin problem to Russian cities that grew exponentially during the past two decades, the Daily Beast noted.
In Nevada, too, the state's Supreme Court ruled against the local chapter of the ACLU, which was challenging the Nevada's new ESA program on the grounds it violated the state constitution's Blaine amendment. And though, as Burke writes, both research and legal precedent … make [ESAs] well-positioned to withstand legal challenges based on Blaine amendments, the amendments continue to serve as an impediment to families accessing school choice programs in an efficient way. In Nevada, for instance, thousands of families are stuck on a waiting list as the legislature figures out a way to fund the ESA program after the state's Supreme Court declared the program (but not its funding mechanism) constitutional.
Several core maths exams appear to have been shifted to earlier dates than last year, meaning candidates will have fewer days to revise. The new measures are likely to be in place for at least five years, until Ramadan no longer clashes with the exam season.

Speaking a week after the UK left the EU's institutions, Mr Farage said of the division: Just look at what's happening in Brussels: you've got the Poles and the Hungarians, vetoing the budget. You've got a eurozone, which is driving the south into deeper and deeper poverty.
The New York Times article is a case in point. What is striking — and indeed horrifying to anyone who doesn't share the author's eco-loon mindset — is the degree to which the piece appears to see economic shutdowns as a net positive for the planet.
One former engineer claimed there is no way to protect private user information should it fall into the wrong hands, while a senior engineer called the company creepy Big Brother and said it disturbs him.

But Trump must make a public concession before Democrats will negotiate, said Coons:
China will soon release an outline on the sinicization of Islam, with Islamic communities urged to uphold the sinicization of their religion by improving their political stance and following the Party's leadership. Representatives from local Islamic associations from eight provinces and regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hunan, Yunnan and Qinghai provinces, discussed a five-year (2018-22) outline on the sinicization of Islam at a seminar in Beijing on Saturday. They agreed that the outline is the basic policy for Islamic sinicization for the next five years, according to a statement published on the China Islamic Association's website.

The killing of Soleimani, regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran, came as Trump has sought to apply increased pressure on Iran through economic sanctions to abandon its nuclear weapons program, while Iran has countered with provocative attacks on U.S. military and oil facilities in region.
I am deeply concerned about the idea that total segregation of children within a mixed school is acceptable, she told the paper.
For those who cannot find any starch or flour for their baked goods, another newspaper, El Diario de Caracas, published a recipe for bread without flour. If you did not have time to go to the bakery, if yesterday's bread wasn't enough for today, or if you just prefer home cooking, this alternative can save your morning coffee or breakfast, the recipe suggests. The recipe uses powdered milk and baking powder as a substitute for flour.
With all respect, I certainly hope she's not the future and I don't believe she is, Lieberman, who retired in 2013 after serving nearly 25 years in the Senate, told the Fox Business Network last Thursday.
First, the Times whitewashes Israel's enemies.
It's time to talk. All of us have a story about GUPD. All of us know someone who has been targeted. Let's do something about it. Come this Tuesday for community and discussion. This space will center the voices and experiences of students of color, allies for the safety of students of color, allies are not welcome to attend this preliminary dialogue.
The Associated Press notes that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani criticized the Taliban for using civilians as shields shortly after the raid in November.
He also said Trump is frustrated that the media have not been interested in looking into whether the Bidens did something wrong in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, Iran announced its plans to enrich uranium to 20 percent at its underground Fordo site, a move Israel has warned proves the Islamic Republic is seeking nuclear weapons.
In addition, ICE's only response to this terrible crime is to pledge that it will review Pedraza for possible enforcement action, the lawmakers wrote. Such a response is wholly unacceptable. ICE completely failed its most basic duty to protect the public – and more specifically, Stacey Aguilar – by releasing this criminal alien from custody and thereby enabling him to allegedly commit this heinous crime.
The CNN sources were bitingly critical of Trump for deciding not to nominate Abrams. This is a loss for the State Department and the country and, for that matter, for the President, said one, while another maintained Abrams was bumped off the list because of Donald Trump's thin skin and nothing else.

McConnell said, noting the creation of the bipartisan working groups that worked literally around the clock to make the bill even stronger:
North Korean rocket and nuclear tests are seen as crucial steps toward the North's ultimate goal of a nuclear armed long-range missile arsenal. North Korea under leader Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse Kim's government.
According to leaked internal documents obtained by Motherboard, the 2017 Charlottesville protests were a moment of intense introspective for Facebook, which scrambled to redefine what they consider hate speech and to educate content moderators about American white nationalists. One training document obtained shortly after the protests reads: Recent incidents in the United States (i.e. Charlottesville) have shown that there is potentially confusion about our hate org policies and the specific hate orgs in specific markets.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source told Breitbart London this afternoon that the EU has no real analytical ability to help it inform policy decisions, therefore when an incident like this happens, there is no one to help guide the process. Instead, while Brussels is happy to dictate an open borders policy, and a policy of mandatory migrant quotas – it simply will not and cannot deal with the fall out.
Here, for example, is the BBC version (But CNBC and ABC and CNN and the rest were all similarly delighted)
But despite this success in decimating America's domestic oil industry, OPEC has not finished yet. Spurred on by domestic issues such as social spending, OPEC is shifting strategy and creating more volatility by bringing in Russia and others to collaborate on production as a supercartel. The group's unprecedented influence stems from its control of 90 percent of global reserves, but these entities do not act in the free-market, profit maximizing manner of American producers. They serve instead as government proxies, generating revenues to support regimes that do not share U.S. strategic priorities.
But if President Donald Trump used his emergency powers to not renew the work visas, he would open up several hundred thousand good jobs for the American college graduates who are likely to vote in 2020.

The Chairmen's expressed anger comes in the wake of two separate incidents in which ICE either released or refused to detain deportable aliens charged with drunk driving crimes that injured and killed bystanders and one incident in which ICE released an illegal immigrant convicted of drunk driving who went on to allegedly commit murder.
Vox notes that Sessions avoids sentimental arguments about individual migrants' tragic circumstances and often admirable character. Those personalized, sentimental arguments are exploited by the establishment media and activists who can always find striving illegals or pitiable women, and sad children to serve as a sympathetic face for progressives' nation-changing ambitions and CEO's cheap-labor goals. Instead, Sessions uses the law — not emotion — to deliver gains for Americans:
YouTube has also deleted the video of Sven Computer attending the South by Southwest conference.
BRUSSELS (AP) — Britain, France and Germany have launched action under the Iran nuclear agreement paving the way for possible sanctions in response to Tehran's attempts to roll back parts of the deal, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday.

Strzok's immediate reply is redacted. Strzok ends up asking for the article to be sent to him.
Louder with Crowder notes that Twitter failed to act on multiple reports sent by the conservative comedian after online trolls began posting edited photos of Crowder and misattributing quotes to him in an effort to paint him as racist or alt-right.
They thought that the war would be easy and that they would accomplish their objectives in a few days or a few weeks, and they did not prepare for it financially, and there is no popular support that would enable it to carry on a war for a decade or more. The sons of Islam have opposed them and stood between them and their plans and objectives, bin Laden continued.
rather than going after a chemistry professor who has been in this country for many years and has contributed greatly to his community and sending him back to his native land at time when he was on his way to pick up his child from school, that the first priority—not the only priority— [of immigration enforcement] should be to go after people who have committed felonies, serious misdemeanors, multiple less serious misdemeanors, are a threat to public health or safety. Wouldn't most Americans agree that that is where our resources should be targeted?

They were also heartened by the possibility of a re-introduction of the 2 year working visas for citizens from Canada, Australia and New Zealand if Britain did strike on her own, as well as the possibility of the USA being added to the visa list.
The group's primary strategy is to shift the public debate away from visa-workers and legal immigration by pushing the media to provide sympathetic coverage to illegal workers, 'DACA' illegals, Central American migrants, New York illegals, and poor criminals.
2. Abraham Accords. Foreign policy experts laughed at Trump when he said he would bring peace to the Middle East, and outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told the world in 2016 that there would never be separate peace agreements between Israel and the Arab world without the Palestinians. Yet in September, Trump brokered peace and normalization agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Deals with Sudan and Morocco followed, with more deals to come.
The appeals court said the Trump administration had presented evidence that legal immigrants are only one-third as likely as U.S. citizens to have health insurance, and that uninsured residents cost taxpayers and health care providers more than $35 billion a year, the Chronicle reported.

Nine of the 10 index components declined and only one—the gauge of current inventory—improved. Owners expecting better business conditions over the next six months dropped sharply, falling 24 points to a net negative 16 percent.
Even though Biden had previous administration's as a guide, the president-elect chose to depart from that bipartisan tradition when deciding on his cabinet appointees. While Biden has picked respected and well accredited nominees for the four most senior cabinet positions—including former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for treasury secretary and Judge Merrick Garland as attorney general—the rest of his choices are better known for political, rather than administrative accomplishments.
O'Brien told Fox Business Network last week that the size of the NSC will go somewhere in the 115 to 120 area by the end of the week.
For example, DHS data posted December 31 shows that 80,711 Central American family migrants arrived at the border in 2016. By March 2020, just 3,578 (3.3 percent) had been sent home, 3,520 (4.1 percent) were allowed to stay, and 45,768 were still being processed.

The pound fell sharply after the inflation data as traders priced in a lower interest rate profile. By late afternoon London time, the pound was 0.2 percent lower at $1.3027. Though that may not seem much, the currency had earlier risen to $1.3126, its highest level since last September, as traders bet that the inflation data would be higher than anticipated and potentially force the hand of the bank to raise interest rates soon.

Trump's decision to cancel the meeting came a day after Pompeo told lawmakers the administration was prepared to walk away from anything short of denuclearization.
In the past 9 months, Iran's trade balance has been positive due to the $750m non-oil exports, indicating that the activities of the economic executives and the private and public sectors have been successful, Rouhani told his cabinet, delicately understating what happened in the last two of those months.
The New York Stock Exchange has withdrawn plans to delist shares of three Chinese state-owned phone carriers. The shares were to be removed under an order from President Donald Trump, a move Beijing had warned might lead to retaliation.

And then there are the sugary soft drinks that make you fat and also cost a lot. Very low food security adults drink an average of two sodas per day. Presumably they buy them at $1.00 or $1.25 per can out of vending machines. This can run north of $70 per month.
The New York Times judges that the shape of any political transition to end the war remained vague after Kerry's marathon talks with Putin.
The state's capital city of Sacramento, which sits at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers, was inundated during the Great Flood of 1862, which turned enormous regions of the state into inland seas for months, Scientific American recalled.

I have supported many Republicans in elections, Jennifer Pritzker, a billionaire member of the wealthy Pritzker family who is living as a woman, wrote in the Washington Post. Pritzker added:
Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.
In his 44-page apostolic exhortation bearing the Latin title Gaudete et Exsultate (Rejoice and Be Glad), the pope said that Christians have no right to treat the plight of migrants as a minor moral issue because Jesus commanded his followers to welcome the stranger.

[B]y its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.

The Kerem Shalom crossing is used to transport more than five million tons of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said. The tunnel, which was completely destroyed in an air strike, also passed below strategic assets including major gas pipelines and a military installation.
These and other, less headline-grabbing downsides of the deal have elicited little objection, however. A tired public do indeed seem to want Brexit to be done, and are willing to accept spin they would never have entertained from Theresa May — or are willing to believe that the humiliating concessions on Northern Ireland, fishing, and so on, are only temporary.
The Fed scaled back its forecast for how interest rates will rise in 2016, citing the potential impacts from a weaker global growth and potential financial market turmoil on the U.S. economy.
Responding to the British figures, the Home Office explained that Eurostat's figures were higher than its own figures because they included dependants seeking asylum, not just the main applicants.
In another section, the arrival of the British in Australia was reportedly described as an invasion.
The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.
So just what was it in Kirkpatrick's article that made it, and her, so influential? And why is it worth remembering four decades later?
This is wrong on so many levels, I can hardly wrap my head around it…
Sandweg framed his catch and release policy as a health and crime issue, saying:
Some analysts believe, contrary to Ilan Berman's gloomy forecast, that Russia's birth rates have rebounded well enough to defuse the demographic crisis. A Reuters piece in March argued that Russia's private health care industry is booming due to rising fertility rates, driven by the desire of new parents to obtain better maternity care than the state provides.

2) We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage Again, this is a fake claim. According to a NASA study in 2015, the land ice is actually growing in Antarctica: A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses And the science is not even that controversial. Put simply, the warming of the climate since the Ice Age has led to increased snowfall over the Antarctic.

Obama's predicament is not manifested only in his kidnapping, but [also] in that he wants to take a neutral stand vis-à-vis the recent Iranian hostility against Saudi Arabia and the entire region. But he himself became a victim of Iran when [Iran] kidnapped him [just] before his final State of the Union address, and wrecked his opportunity to present himself as an accomplished hero when [his accomplishments] are in fact not yet completed.

If you look at the majority of new Democrats in the house, they tend to be, I say, center-left, if they are not left-left, the Democrat-turned-Independent continued. And that is because they had to be center-left to win some of those competitive swing districts that they took from Republicans. So that's the hope.

He added, I don't think a president should cut short his trip, because it is sort of handing over a victory to the terrorists. Moreover, the trip to Argentina is important. … But he should never have been on the trip in the first place, and he needs to make a speech, about world terrorism, and what he's going to do.
The dire situation the country faces has led many to find a way to leave the country. Venezuelan media have tips for that, too, particularly given that Venezuela ran out of paper and ink to print passports in October (suspiciously, whistleblowers contend that Venezuela had enough ink and paper to print thousands of passports for terror-tied Middle Eastern nationals out of its regional embassies for years).

As a tool of terror, the drug would work best in a closed space, said Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher at Rand Corp. who served as acting undersecretary in the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate in the Obama administration. Open-air release probably wouldn't be as effective, as the drug could become too diluted, he said. If ground-up fentanyl is placed on everyday objects, people could easily put their fingers in their mouths or rub their eyes and have a deadly reaction, Bloom said.
So you already have an economy running on a huge debt bubble, with hundreds of thousands of mass incidents per year, and with millions of marginalized migrants scheduled to lose their homes and their jobs, when the country is well into a generational Crisis era. China's next, massive, historic internal rebellion is overdue, and this new policy could end up being one of the triggers.

NASA and NOAA jointly or separately operate the U.S. Climate Reference Network, the gold standard of surface temperature data, global satellites, and weather balloons. The temperature data recorded by these three independent, unbiased temperature-measuring networks show minimal warming over the past 40 years.

Relatively unknown in Iran until the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Soleimani's popularity and mystique grew out American officials calling for his killing. By the time it came a decade and a half later, Soleimani had become Iran's most recognizable battlefield commander, ignoring calls to enter politics but becoming as powerful, if not more, than its civilian leadership.

Federal officials should quietly ignore migrants' illegal status as they try to detect, isolate, and treat all of the Americans who are infected by the epidemic, he said. The government should make clear that they are not going to be checking legal status when they're trying to protect public health, and it seems perfectly reasonable to say that use of public benefits [by would-be migrants], in this case, will not be factored into public charge rules.
We live in trying times. Times of fear, of suppression, of hate. We don't need more, or better leaders. We need someone willing to fight. We need to stop asking them to give us our rights. They won't support us, they won't compromise. We need to stop expecting that our systems will somehow fix themselves. We need to actually take the reigns of power from them. We need to challenge them at every level. We need to fix this. We don't need them anymore. We can do better. You're damn right we got this.

Mr. Biden himself, in a recent set of questions said he is not going to do what he promised on Day One because he knew that it would create a crisis.

The next blow came from columnist Bret Stephens. Stephens has a record of pro-Israel positions stemming back from his tenure as Jerusalem Post editor from 2002-2004.

We certainly talked about our effort to counter Iranian malign influence, but we spoke about all the issues in the region, ranging from the continued efforts of Hezbollah; we talked about the fact that the – the work that was done in Sweden on Yemen was good, but we need both sides to honor those commitments.

The NYT is brutally direct about the significance of Kerry's mission to Moscow, noting that Russia has clearly been successful in using Syria as leverage to force an end to the American policy of trying to isolate Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine.

The Times' willingness to disseminate pro-Hezbollah propaganda may have represented a new low in its advocacy for terror groups.

The second was having Pelosi and Schumer appear together. They often repeated the same talking points: for example, they both called the wall ineffective and unnecessary.

Van Jones was one of the early proponents of the Green New Deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems. An Amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of FDR's original New Deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. This also happens to be exactly what Ocasio-Cortez promises in her version of the Green New Deal. Wiki said, The book is a detailed proposal for a 'Green New Deal.' In 2009, Jones resigned from the White House under a cloud for supporting the view that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the Green New Deal failed to get traction.
Trump's aggressive approach with Iran is remarkable considering his oft-repeated desire to avoid expensive military entanglements.

Kurtz tells Breitbart News that simply characterizing college students who claim they need to be in safe zones, as snowflakes minimizes the real issues at stake:
The broadcaster said that stopping the criminalisation of paying the licence could cost them £200 million a year. However, the government says that doing so would free up Britain's criminal courts and protect vulnerable, poorer members of society.

Starting in 1995, the USDA has conducted a regular survey of food security that measures food choices, intakes, shortages, and budgetary constraints. The 1995 report ties the lack of food security to lack of funds—an important fact to remember, in light of how the food insecure spend their money.

Looking at a real world example, one might wonder what might necessitate a company like Apple to borrow money. The most profitable publically traded company in the whole world, with a pristine balance sheet and billions in cash holdings, is borrowing money and buying back stock. This is NOT a recommendation on the purchase of Apple stock, but instead an observation about that nature of what low-interest rates do to pervert the capitalist system. Historically, firms once borrowed to invest in new equipment and R&D. Today, they are engaging in a buyback orgy that is significantly larger than equity purchases by institutions and retail investors.
People in Sudan and Tanzania are also being largely barred from the diversity lottery visa program until their governments tighten identification procedures.

The security source said: Half the problem is no effective analysis is applied to these things in Brussels as there's no real analytical capability to inform policy decisions. So the dots between Brussels and EU policy on the one hand and security implications, social cohesion etc, particularly in the medium to long term – the second and third order effects you might say – on the other are never joined. That is a serious and systemic problem.

From a layman's perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist – well, 'Obamacare Lite' it's been called – approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for, Gaffney said. I think that's what Donald Trump set out to do. That's what he promised the voters. It's what I think you could get a majority of the Congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you're not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support.

Plenty of people on 'my side' [of the labor and migration debate] lament the fact that the lack of adequate pathways to channel immigration through the system rather than around it has predictably led to immigration outside the law, Jawetz told Breitbart News December 29.

The Guardian notes that China is proposing a seven percent increase in its defense spending to $151 billion.
The only way we're going to get to four percent growth and to lower unemployment is to allow people to hire people and… hire people when they make money, so you know you gotta begin by cutting the rates, said Williams. He pointed out the use of the term revenue neutral as one that isn't used in the private sector.
People are suspicious. Ronald Reagan is held up as a hero in Texas — except for the Simpson–Mazzoli [1986 amnesty] bill … where President Reagan was promised 'Give us the amnesty today and you'll get your border security tomorrow. There is a fear that Congress will promise [security] and not deliver — people need to see something tangible. That is what the wall is to them.
The foreign minister said Turkey has proposed a buffer zone along the Turkey-Syria border that seems compatible with Trump's demand for a safe zone around the Kurds, presuming the Kurds agree to fall back outside the buffer zone.

Blumenthal said, As important as the change, Ari, is the way it was made, lack of explanation, an indication of continuing churn and chaos and deep division in this White House, and the lack of any clear direction from the president on policy. You're absolutely right, John Bolton is known as a hardliner, clearly different than others in the administration now on the Iran agreement, for example, and it points to danger signals.
Iranian officials quickly vowed to take revenge amid months of tensions between Iran and the U.S. following Trump pulling out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. While Soleimani was the Guard's most prominent general, many others in its ranks have experience in waging the asymmetrical, proxy attacks for which Iran has become known.

Parler has also been removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Parler's Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff told Fox & Friends Weekend:
Yet in the midst of this cascade of geopolitical dominoes, the Carter administration—its diplomacy led by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, the pluperfect guilt-ridden liberal—was not only unconcerned but, sometimes, actually pleased. That's because the Carter administration, having come in preaching about human rights, was determined to hold friends to a far higher standard than enemies. As Kirkpatrick wrote of the administration, It actively collaborated in the replacement of moderate autocrats friendly to American interests with less friendly autocrats of extremist persuasion.

One commenter on Talia Jane's post wrote bluntly, I'm going to be brutally honest. You do in fact, like many others have pointed out, sound like a stereotypical, entitled, and whiny millennial. The reason why you were/are in the predicament you are now is because you put yourself there. You made poor financial decisions because you wanted to live in a fancy apartment that you could not afford.
Ultimately, this campaign is a throwback to the worst of the Obama era – and betrays the hallmarks of one of the Obama era's most notorious and discredited figures, Van Jones, who wrote the book The Green Collar Economy on which the Green New Deal is based.

Well, the large pharmacies in Virginia banded together and lobbied and got the state to pass a law saying you can't advertise the price of drugs, he related. Ralph Nader brought a case saying, well, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. In this case, the listeners were consumers of drugs who would benefit from that speech, so why are you stopping it just because the speaker is a corporation, i.e. a drug store?
Consumer price inflation is expected to reach 2.8 percent early next year due to the pound's sharp decline since the referendum, the bank said in its quarterly economic projections. The lower pound, while helping exporters, makes imports, such as oil and raw materials, more expensive.
The peace plan made absolutely no sense whatsoever for reasons I gave at the time — Russia and Syria will continue bombing what they claim are terrorist groups, which are pretty much all Sunnis in Syria, and the plan would not apply to the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh) and the al-Qaeda linked Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Nusra Front). And sure enough, the cessation of hostilities collapsed in less than a week. In fact, the peace plan actually worsened the hostilities, since it provided cover for substantially increased bombing and fighting from all groups.
Ian Wybron, head of social policy at Demos, told The Sun that those who felt more British had been excluded from opportunities to understand other cultures.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta ruled that Uzuegbunam was moot, but Chike appealed to the high court, contending that nominal charges are important to pursuing civil rights claims and that changing policy can still result in denying one's constitutional rights.
We pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations, she added. And so for me, what's unrealistic is — is what we're living in right now.
Trump created a horrifying ecosystem of violence and exploitation, says Biden's 2020 platform:
4. Teachers' unions exposed. If it was once possible to see public school teachers' unions as benign, the school shutdowns of 2020 revealed that many of them exist solely to promote the interests of their members, and the political fortunes of the Democratic Party, rather than to improve education for American children. In many cities, schools remained closed despite scientific evidence they could be reopened safely. Their political clout may have suffered permanent damage as a result.
Pompeo's remarks came after he attended Bolsonaro's inauguration alongside other foreign leaders including Israeli and Hungarian Prime Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu and Viktor Orban and Bolivian strongman Evo Morales. In his inaugural address, Bolsonaro promised to liberate Brazil from socialist ideology, while shifting his focus to the promotion of conservative values.
This Saturday, February 27, was the 156th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union Address, which was delivered at Cooper Union, in New York City. It was the speech that launched Lincoln to the White House in the election of 1860; it was the speech that paved the path for a newly-formed Republican Party to take the White House for the first time, buoyed by its identification with the boldest and most unmistakeable principles.
Chike and a second student sued Georgia Gwinnett College under the First Amendment seeking an end to the policy as well as nominal damages (Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski). Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), they challenged the college's policies as unconstitutional while the school argued that Chike's speech deserved no constitutional protection. It later changed its policy but claimed it should be exempt from any penalty for violating Chike's free speech rights.

The IDF said that Hamas was sabotaging the humanitarian efforts that Israel is making for the citizens of Gaza and added that the Hamas terror organization repeatedly chooses to harm the welfare of Gaza residents.
Iran's best hope for weathering sanctions might lie with India, which is generally supportive of U.S. policy but has not disguised its hunger for more Iranian oil. India's finance ministry kicked off the new year by announcing a massive retroactive tax break for crude oil imports from Iran. The move was a major step toward creating a durable financial infrastructure for working around U.S. sanctions to keep Iranian oil flowing into India, and will give Iran a trove of Indian currency to spend on imports and investment.
I have supported many Republicans in elections, Jennifer Pritzker, a billionaire member of the wealthy Pritzker family who is living as a woman, wrote in the Washington Post. Pritzker added:
Mainstream activists are cheering a justice department memo that says the Supreme Court's pro-transgender decision in 2020 does not apply to single-sex sports, education practices, and sexual privacy.
Apparently not, for the current rumours are that rather than nix this disastrous deal made by his discredited predecessors, Boris is instead minded to go ahead with it.
[We are] talking about the Trump administration's policies and how they have really helped not only small business, but all Americans, ordinary Americans, do well in the last three years, she said. And you know, we see that in the results with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, and we want to spread that message that capitalism and the free market is what creates this kind of environment where people have the opportunity to pursue their American dream.
Though U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has funded and served organizations that promote Common Core – including Jeb Bush's Foundation for Excellence in Education – since her nomination, she has denied she supports the controversial standards.
The new policy has drawn the concern of others, nevertheless, since it allows any individual to file a complaint against a real estate agent, and could be used to censor debate and opinions on race, such as opposition to Black Lives Matter, and gender, such as criticism of men claiming to be transgender and pushing to compete against women in sports.

Weisman did three things in his book. He used the presence of antisemitism on the right as a means to castigate the entire Republican party and conservative movement as antisemitic. He ignored and dismissed antisemitism on the Left. And finally, Weisman attacked Judaism, Jews who observe Judaism, and Jews who support Israel.
The culprit is adults' bad choices. Cigarette smoking is a major cause of very low food security, Rector told Congress. He is not a no-smoking scold; he is concerned about the cost of the habit. Very low food security adults are much more likely to smoke than are food-secure adults, and money that is spent on cigarettes cannot be spent on food.

Online payment processing service Stripe has reportedly cut all ties with President Trump's campaign and shut down the campaign's payment processing services. This prevents the Trump campaign from accepting donations by credit card.
The progressives' Hunger Games also cripple the economies of migrant-sending countries because they are extracting workers, consumers, investments, political pressures, and expectations of growth. The departure of people of working age reduces the labor force and weakens the growth of the home country, and this effect is likely to be strongest for countries facing a brain drain, said a 2017 report by the International Monetary Fund.
The announcement came in a Friday evening letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi:

Romney's backing of the measure comes after Harvard Professor Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under President Barack Obama, proposed the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Congress should pass a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria, wrote Furman. The law should also specify that the payments would continue in 2021 and beyond if the unemployment rate rises to 5.5% and remains there or higher. Hopefully this will not happen, but if it does, the money will be needed, he added.

For decades, policymakers have debated whether to build new reservoirs. One project, the Auburn Dam, was authorized by Congress in 1965 for flood control, but later abandoned over structural and environmental concerns. Numerous other proposals have been studied for decades, with little progress at the state or federal level — though local authorities have built their own projects, such as the Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the East San Francisco Bay, one of the few projects environmentalists have not opposed (though many have since opposed its expansion.)

Girls and women are the privileged sex in education. From preschool to graduate school, and across ethnic and class lines, women get better grades, they win most of the honors and prizes, and they're far more likely to go to college. Today women earn a majority of bachelor's degrees and advanced degrees. Latino girls are now slightly more likely to attend college than white boys. When an education policy analyst looked at current trends in higher education he quipped, only half in jest, The last male will graduate from college in 2068. Our schools have offered untold number of admirable and effective programs to strengthen girls in areas where they languished—in sports, math, and science. Where are the programs to help boys in areas where they falter: reading, writing, grades, school engagement and college matriculation? So far Congress, schools of education, school boards and the Department of Education have looked the other way.
We have to maintain a balance of power in Washington to avoid this left-wing agenda that the Democrats are trying to perpetrate.

And whatever marginally positive effect these policies may have had on Israel's international position pales in comparison to the damage Trump has allegedlycaused Israel through his failure to support what Stephens refers to as the liberal international order against totalitarian states, and his preference for a purely transactional foreign policy based on the needs of the moment or the whims of the president.

FDA guidance drafted during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of so-called laboratory-developed tests, a market traditionally not overseen by the agency.

Sunder Katwala, British Future's director, said: Most people now know that being in the [European Union] with free movement means high immigration.

New York Times best-selling author and populist conservative columnist Ann Coulter says President Trump's border wall prototypes sitting in the San Diego, California, desert are a ridiculous waste of time.
Last year, the Fed undertook a review of its strategies for achieving its goals and its conduct of monetary policy. The review followed several years of inflation coming in below the Fed's target and a series of rate hikes and a drawdown of bond purchases that now look ill-advised. Following the review, the Fed changed its approach so that it would let inflation run higher than the two percent target for some time so that the long term average would be at the target.
U.S. President Donald Trump's National Security Strategy (NSS) deemed Latin American drug cartels who smuggle heroin and Chinese traffickers of the synthetic opioid fentanyl a top homeland security threat to the United States for killing tens of thousands of Americans each year.
Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Worse, the H-1B system allows U.S. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing U.S. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.

As a result of the backlash, the editorial team at the Dartmouth distanced themselves from Spector's column, claiming that it does not represent the team's views. Guest columns, and any column published in The Dartmouth not under the authorship of 'The Dartmouth Editorial Board,' do not represent the views of the newspaper or the editors who worked to bring it to publication, they wrote.
Facebook was forced by the EU regulators to admit that they are tracking people on other websites. If a Facebook user researches a new television on an external website or inside of a mobile app, his or her profile is tagged for advertisers to know that a user on another site has indicated an interest in televisions and in electronics. Facebook then sells the data to advertisers pitching electronic devices that want to reach a Facebook user.
Krauthammer said, I thought the whole story of this presidency, and its foreign policy, was seen in the split screen. On one side, you had the video footage of the attack in Belgium. This is the real world, and on the other side was Obama, in the fantasy world he inhabits, where Cuba is of some geopolitical significance, in his mind, but none in the real world. If Cuba disappeared tomorrow, in a volcanic eruption…nobody would notice, geopolitically. But Obama had to go, because this is legacy. This is settling the Cold War arguments, of the academic left, of Obama's Columbia University days, the people who worship the Cuban Revolution, the Sandinistas. Obama had his picture taken in front of a relief of Che Guevara, which sort of stated his worldview of his adolescent days, and now he does it as president. And the one hand, is the real threat to the world…this is hair-raising stuff, that the Belgians are completely outmanned. The Europeans have no way of tracking, and that we are completely in the blind. We don't know what we don't know. That's the real world. Obama calls it the JV team. He pretends it's contained and controlled, it is not. Instead, he does this sort of ideological holiday trip in Cuba, while the world burns.
He added that the order's chances at the Supreme Court isn't a slam dunk, and could end up a 4-4 where the 9th Circuit's ruling is upheld.
It will make a formal announcement during a January 12 rally in Iowa City, Iowa, alongside the socialist senator:

Other data released Friday showed while industrial production and retail sales slowed over the year, both indicators outperformed in December, with the NBS pointing to a particularly strong showing in consumer spending.
Those wages gains, though, risk being depleted this year. Also running the risk of being depleted is history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black Americans.
The testimonies of the victims are terrible. Women and girls were attacked, robbed and subjected to disgusting and extremely traumatizing behavior. A victim said: They surrounded us and began to grope us. Their hands were everywhere. I had fingers in every bodily orifice.
The Senate Sergeant of Arms Michael Stenger issued a warning as proceedings got underway.
He also pointed out that before Angela Merkel wanted to be a saint, she had previously stated that multiculturalism in Germany had failed.
The progressive push to bend Americans' attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of gender identity has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules which help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.
There's so much that's not being communicated inside the building and it's a huge problem that effects everybody, one career State Department official said, according to Rogin. Posts are calling us and asking us, 'What are we supposed to say?' We don't know what to tell them.
This is clearly not an escalation, this is clearly an act of self-defense, Carafano said. The president has also never said we're walking away from the Middle East. What he says he wants is a sustainable security architecture in place which means we're going to protect our interest and we're going to expect others to do more to protect theirs.
TRUMP: We're going to have Americans staying home instead of going and spending the money in other countries. And maybe that's one of the reasons the job numbers are so good. — remarks to the press Friday.
After Breitbart News uploaded the video to its official channel, YouTube promptly locked the video in private mode, meaning that only a maximum of 50 viewers invited to see the video may watch it. It is therefore inaccessible to the general public.
When hit by an unknown coronavirus, China took immediate actions to carry out epidemiological investigation, identify the pathogen and publicize key information including the genome sequencing of the virus. All this sounded alarm bells across the world, he said.
Ning Jizhe, commissioner of the NBS, said momentum remained generally stable through the year and said the same could be expected in 2020.
For a while, it looked as though the Know Nothing, anti-immigrant party was on track to become the second major party in America, in opposition to Democrats. This party, which thrived alongside the organization of various secret societies, was ultimately defeated by the Republicans, who outmaneuvered and subverted them. The Republican Party ultimately prevailed because its leaders stood on principle, regardless of temporary popularity. The Know Nothings disappeared nearly as fast as they shot to power.
I pointed this out in June last year in a piece titled Britain Unleashes a Green New Deal to Kill What's Left of the Economy.

For players not already in the drug-testing program, it means that the once-per-year substance-abuse test can happen at any point between now and early August. Which means that, if/when a player not in the drug-testing program passes the annual substance-abuse test, he can use recreational drugs like marijuana without consequence until next year. As long as, of course, he isn't arrested for marijuana possession in a state where it's illegal or a bag of weed doesn't fall out of his coat pocket while visiting the league office. Given the amount of time necessary for marijuana metabolites to exit the system (it can take as long as 30 days) it may be too late to stop smoking yesterday. For those who stopped in time to produce a clean sample, they'll be hoping to get their number pulled sooner than later, so that they can resume doing what is now legal in nine states for recreational purposes and 29 states for medicinal purposes.
Additionally, Rufo noted the children received another related essay assignment of at least one full page of writing describing their powerful and privileged identities.
Arguing that the camps are vocational and educational centers aimed at combatting terrorism and religious extremism, China has repeatedly denied that Beijing is mistreating the detainees at the facilities, also known as mind transformation centers and concentration camps.
We have to protect all of our people, and it works all the way through the system, the senator vowed. One of the things we have to think about as a nation—we have to stop putting trans women who are incarcerated into prisons with men where they are at risk. It is our responsibility.
For example, he continued, individuals responsible for the deadly wait list in Arizona where I'm from: it took seven hundred days to fire these individuals, and most of that time, they were on paid leave sitting at home.

In Friday's Renewed Motion for Contempt and for Order to Show Cause, Roberts' attorney, Clint Lancaster, said [Hunter] has continued to flaunt the orders of this Court by failing to answer discovery, comply with court orders, and provide his financial information. Circuit Judge Don McSpadden, who was initially assigned the case, made clear more than three months ago that Hunter could not withhold certain records.
Granma did not elaborate on the comparison, and the similarities are not immediately clear, as there is no indication that Trump was personally in danger at any point on Wednesday. The assassination of Lincoln in 1865 followed the U.S. Civil War, the most violent period moment in American history not involving foreign powers.
Again, the new rule does allow facilities that receive Title X funding to counsel about abortion, but not refer for abortion. Low-income individuals and the uninsured can still go to the many thousands of federally qualified health centers that provide more expansive services than Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. Additionally, Title X facilities that currently perform abortions and distribute contraception can choose to abide by the new rule and separate their family planning centers from those that perform abortions in order to remain eligible for grants under this program.
Unions are particularly influential in the Democratic Party's caucuses in Nevada, and the competition among candidates for union endorsements — and among unions for their respective candidates — can be fierce.
We need more legal immigration. … I don't want green cards just for computer engineers. If you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, I want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, I want them to have a chance to get a green card. I just don't want to be a country in the future of just computer engineers or high-tech people.
Global Times noted that China approved a draft of the mandate in December 2017.
The memo is a response to Judge Neil Gorsuch's June 2020 vote in the June 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County court decision.

Prompted by reports from Chinese news media of a need to salvage masculinity in schools, officials are seeing a stepped-up debate about gender equality and social identity just as government leaders are seeking a labor market that first rewards achievement and ability over fairness.
Another proposal is to build the Sites Reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of Maxwell, just over an hour north of Sacramento. As noted earlier, the Sites Reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. Proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.
The priest said that the Chinese government fears the Catholic Church more than any other religion, and thus is anxious to procure greater control over it.

A month after the election, Sanders hosted the National Town Hall on Climate Change Solutions—featuring Bill McKibben, activist Van Jones, and Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—to introduce the Green New Deal to the world. While this event looked like a gathering of disparate groups throwing their support behind this new movement, it was actually a gathering of compatriots working together to promote their common agenda. Specifically:
This is patently, painfully untrue, and in any event, it is not ISIS cleansing Christian communities from Baghdad: it is Shiite militias linked to Iran, which the Obama Administration just handed billions of dollars to finance its operations across the Middle East. Those militias are also America's nominal allies against the Islamic State, and will be crucial to the upcoming battle for Mosul, even though militia leaders make little pretense of being happy to fight alongside the American troops they were murdering just a few years ago.
Less than 48 hours later, Trump ordered the strike that took out Soleimani.
In an email dated August 30, 2011, Clinton forwards to Sullivan, her top foreign policy advisor, an intelligence memo on Libya that was sent to her earlier by Blumenthal with the subject line, H: Very good intel re: inside NTC.

Other stats from the survey do seem alarming at first. One in thirty adults in the United States is said to have experienced very low food security. One in thirty-five was hungry for at least one day because there was not enough money for food in the household. One adult in a hundred did not eat for a whole day because of a lack of money for food. But keep that lack of money for food in the back of your mind—more on it later.

The underground bishops are the biggest problem in dialogue between China and the Vatican, since the Chinese government does not want to recognize them, because they don't trust them.

Chinese intellectuals have petitioned the government to halt the evictions, calling them a violation of human rights. Even some state media have criticized the campaign. According to Yi Fuxian, a China population expert, the government has called migrants a low-end population – basically implying that they are inferior quality human beings.

A study released in March 2020 revealed that forced labor was not limited to Xinjiang. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), the Chinese government incentivized companies throughout the nation to use Uyghur slaves, presumably shipped out of the Xinjiang camps, in forced labor for the manufacturing of products sold by dozens of international companies, including brand names like Nike, BMW, and Nintendo. Subsequent reports have revealed that cotton-picking, an extremely arduous undertaking, has become a preferred industry for the Chinese Communist Party to force Uyghurs into.

The 2008 crash was caused by government organizations like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac doling out mortgages to people of every color who could not afford them.

The subject matter should merit our audience's interests, and be worthy of our time, space and resources; we should be in position to discuss the issue with authority and be factually accurate. The topic should be related to a current issue impacting sports, unless otherwise approved by senior editorial management. This condition may vary for content appearing on platforms with broader editorial missions – such as The Undefeated, FiveThirtyEight and espnW. Commentaries on relevant sports-related issues are appropriate, but we should refrain from overt partisanship or endorsement of particular candidates, politicians or political parties.

Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin's successor, who is now himself being investigated for public corruption, dropped the investigation into Burisma.

He not only wants to give them amnesty, but he said he wants illegals to be able to vote, Perdue told Breitbart News. He doesn't see anything wrong with undocumented people in this country voting and having access to benefits. He has said he will give a blanket amnesty. So, what does that say to the millions of people who have come to our country and gone through our immigration protocol properly and done it the right way and earned their citizenship? I know hundreds of people who just here in Georgia did that and they're outraged by his position because it totally denigrates what they did. The second thing is it's a threat to the American worker right now. We've got a situation where we've got to grow our economy and we've got to get over Covid [Chinese coronavirus], and a blanket amnesty just opens the door.
Crack the door to admit Elliott Abrams and the neocons will scurry in by the hundreds, warned Paul. Neoconservative interventionists have had us at perpetual war for 25 years. While President Trump has repeatedly stated his belief that the Iraq War was a mistake, the neocons (all of them Never-Trumpers) continue to maintain that the Iraq and Libyan Wars were brilliant ideas. These are the same people who think we must blow up half the Middle East, then rebuild it and police it for decades.

Iranian officials quickly vowed to take revenge amid months of tensions between Iran and the U.S. following Trump pulling out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.

The Chinese government has accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and has warned that Trump's order would hurt U.S. and other investors worldwide.
It's a dangerous thing because Congress can change immigration law anyway but that has to be done through a process of debate and deliberation and people have to vote on it, and those people are accountable to voters [every two years]. The President, of course, is accountable to voters but this would make any political control over immigration much more difficult … A president would be tempted to use it for whatever purpose they want at the time. It could be to serve business interests. It could be to serve foreign policy interests, to promote the political objectives of the President.
However, some who know Webb are skeptical he would be a good fit. While he would have the experience for the job, they say he also has an independent streak.
Is the contrary argument that Trump would be somehow giving Kim Jong-un the green light to nuke half of Asia by refusing to respond at length to every missile launch, no matter how half-hearted the provocation? As the Fox News report points out, many analysts believe North Korea is preparing for another nuclear weapons test, possibly during Xi's visit to Washington. Perhaps saving the strong words for that will better convey the seriousness of the new administration's approach.

Around Urbana-Champaign, the home of the University of Illinois, school district officials say children and adolescents lay shingles, wash dishes and paint off-campus university apartments. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, an indigenous Guatemalan labor leader has heard complaints from adult workers in the fish-packing industry who say they're losing their jobs to 14-year-olds. In Ohio, teenagers work in dangerous chicken plants. ProPublica interviewed 15 teenagers and young adults in Bensenville alone who said they work or have worked as minors inside more than two dozen factories, warehouses and food processing facilities in the Chicago suburbs, usually through temporary staffing agencies, and nearly all in situations where federal and state child labor laws would explicitly prohibit their employment. Though most of the teens interviewed for this story are now 18, they agreed to speak on the condition that they not be fully identified and that their employers not be named because they feared losing their jobs, harming their immigration cases or facing criminal penalties. Some began to work when they were just 13 or 14, packing the candy you find by the supermarket register, cutting the slabs of raw meat that end up in your freezer and baking, in industrial ovens, the pastries you eat with your coffee. Garcia, who is 18 now, was 15 when he got his first job at an automotive parts factory.

Jeh Johnson.
Under the Green New Deal, Congress must develop a plan for the transition of the United States economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. And to accomplish that, the U.S. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. Some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the U.S. economy to suit their Utopian and unrealistic world view. With hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the Green New Deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. And neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the US a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.

Credentials matter not, but skin tone, womanhood, and claims of marginalized status do, Spector continued. [the program's directors] may believe in merit, but it is a twisted form of it, a pernicious theory that sees race, gender and identity as dictating qualification. In the eyes of genuine, concerned progressives, this is called prejudice. This is what it looks like to systematically devalue minorities, to reduce them to nothing but a plate on the diversity buffet.

Crucially, the Sites Reservoir appears to have some startup funding. As much as half of the money will come from a special water bond passed by voters in Proposition 1 of 2014, which set aside $2.7 billion (of $7.5 billion) for water storage projects. The rest of the project would theoretically be funded by long-term contracts for water not reserved for public use.

They tell women that it'll be simple, natural, safe, and private process. They'll recover in a day, maybe two. What they don't tell them is that they might deliver a tiny, perfectly-formed child.

Or the weeks to months of recovery time, usually managed alone.
While Yemen has no documented Chinese coronavirus patients, it has endured an extensive famine as a product of the civil war between the government and the Houthis, one exacerbated by Houthi jihadists blocking aid into the country. The result has been the creation of a country in which the vast majority of people are reliant on humanitarian aid to live, but tons of food rot in ports because the Houthis block aid workers from distributing it.

The advancing state of European Union militarism is surprising, perhaps, given the strong terms in which the claims that plans were on the table were dismissed, or simply laughed off, by pro-Brussels EU loyalists in the pre-Brexit vote era. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, one of the chief cheerleaders for the EU in Britain — and now a top Facebook executive after the unceremonious end of his political career — infamously belittled Nigel Farage on stage during a debate in 2014, accusing him of holding a dangerous fantasy when the Brexit leader cited a future EU army.

What will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point.

Pompeo said his current trip to the Middle East has included similar conversations with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates about doing everything possible to help Iraq build out its sovereignty and get on its feet after the war against the Islamic State.

He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transfer of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States, the article continues.

Since the arrival of the China-origin COVID-19 to Europe, British shoppers, fearing shortages, closures, and quarantines, have been stockpiling on essentials across the country. Supermarkets are working with suppliers and delivery services to increase production and delivery to respond to the demand, but shelves normally holding pasta, rice, UHT milk, or toilet paper are often empty by the middle of the day.
During the war, the Republican Party was a bulwark against the Confederacy of slave states, which could no longer tolerate a president who stood against slavery on principle. It is clear that the unrelenting, principled, stand Lincoln made at Cooper Union animated and fueled the unionists to victory.
On the other hand, geopolitics, defence and population pressures overseas are less likely to factor into someone's decision than they might have in the past.
The GOP held control in the House for eight long years, first with former Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) as Pelosi's immediate successor as Speaker and then, after Boehner lost an internal Republican Party rebellion of his own with soon-to-be-former Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), as Speaker.
The jefes that run big crews, the labor brokers who violate every principle and law, yeah, they're making a lot of money. But if you take the typical worker out there walking on that truss, that are working as independent contractors, they're living in poverty, most of them. They don't have workman's comp, and if they get hurt most of them are going to just suck it up. If they get hurt, they're going to go to the ER [hospital emergency room]. And if they go to the ER, it's expensive and we have to pay for it.
The Democrats' legal case against the border wall is also limited by the ideological nature of their objection to the wall. The wall is a symbolic rejection of America's welcome for migrants, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told an MSNBC event on January 4, saying it builds walls in people minds about who should come here.

For instance, there's Saudi Arabia, which has admitted its culpability in the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. Khashoggi's death was an outrage, but still, we must ask ourselves: Should the terrible fate of one person, who was not even a U.S. citizen, be used as a reason to overturn a seven-decade-long friendship with the Saudis?
France has enacted some of the strictest lockdown measures in Europe, barring people from leaving their homes for fifteen days. Those who do venture outside are required to carry a government form to justify their reason for being outside or face getting fined up to €135 euros.
Sounds impressive. Except, as Paul Homewood notes, the idea that Duffy is a dispassionate observer is risible. Woods Hole Research Center is a green think tank, not a reputable scientific research establishment. And Duffy is more of a policy wonk than a practicing scientist.

For example, the rules require the committees to use the plural pronoun themself instead of the singular pronouns, the male himself or the female herself.
It was not clear which suicide bombings Nasrallah was referring to. A 1983 attack on a U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon killed 241 U.S. servicemen. President Ronald Reagan eventually withdrew all American forces from the country. Suicide bombings in Iraq in the 2000s also put pressure on the Americans to withdraw.
Hayden said it would be probably a low-probability shot if North Korea actually launched a nuclear missile at Seattle, but stressed there was an inexorability about their developing the capability.
The poor figures bolster arguments for more Chinese monetary policy easing on top of the six interest rates cuts seen since November 2014 and suggest that more currency depreciation is coming to prop up corporate profitability, bad news for advanced economies.

University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) law professor Eugene Volokh told Murawski the significance of the policy is that it is institutionalizing loss of jobs over political expression and enforcing that standard through quasi-legal tribunals.
What the media and critics haven't done, and won't do, Ashford added, is to point out that their attacks on Pence are part of a larger and very disturbing trend in American life – an ugly form of prejudice called Christian shaming.
Project Veritas' latest video is part of its ongoing #Expose2020 series. The journalism outfit recently released footage of several field organizers for Sen.

Lincoln unhesitatingly defended these ideas at Cooper Union as he brilliantly and eloquently positioning himself as the leader of their movement. He answered the critics who claimed that his supporters were too radical and should cave to the slave power of the Southern states. Lincoln claimed that far from radical, a defense of the country's founding principles was a conservative position.
And the cost of this migrant demographic is staggering.
Talia Jane acknowledged that the company offers great benefits, but then complained about the $20 copays, saying, I haven't bought groceries since I started this job. Not because I'm lazy, but because I got this ten pound bag of rice before I moved here and my meals at home (including the one I'm having as I write this) consist, by and large, of that. So here I am, 25-years old, balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn't involve crying in the bathtub every week.

He garnered national attention with rebukes of then-President Barack Obama over healthcare, and in 2012 GOP presidential nominee former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney selected him as his running mate. After losing the presidential race in 2012 when Obama and Vice President Joe Biden won re-election, Romney has since left Massachusetts, relocating to Utah, where he ran for the U.S. Senate and won. Romney was sworn into his Senate seat, once held by former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), as Ryan vacated the Speakership of the House for the last time on Thursday.

The State Department previously claimed it had produced all responsive Clinton emails, including emails recovered by the FBI that Hillary Clinton tried to destroy or withhold. The State Department initially claimed all responsive emails had been produced in 2018, but then found more emails, which were produced, for the first time, early last year. Then in November 2019, the State Department first disclosed to the court that the FBI had found this latest batch of emails.

TEL AVIV – A piece in the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsa opined that the detention of 10 American sailors just hours before President Obama's final State of the Union address effectively kidnapped the foolish U.S. president himself by casting a shadow over his authority.
PGA presidents Gail Berman and Lucy Fisher also insisted that health concerns necessitate the shutdown of production, adding, Hopefully, we will be back to work soon. And Stacy Marcus, chief negotiator for the Joint Policy Committee, exclaimed that the risk is simply too great… to performers, crew, and industry personnel to continue production.

· We never issued a booklet to staff to tell them how to/how not to speak to customers on board. · We DID put some collateral on our corporate intranet about inclusive language in the workplace as part of a focus on inclusion during the month of March. · These were not rules or a change of policy or procedures. It was simply some material to start an internal discussion about how language choice can impact how inclusive (or not) a workplace is. The material was developed by the Diversity Council of Australia and their content is used by a lot of workplaces, but it is certainly not designed to be customer-facing. · Unfortunately, this has been misreported by a couple of outlets and since picked up by other media including the Evening Standard. We're providing this same advice to those other outlets.
In addition to meeting with victims, Ivanka Trump is expected to discuss ways the United States and the Church can collaborate on this issue.

Although its ambitions to use Marawi as the capital of a new caliphate were thwarted, ISIS has grown strong enough to battle Philippine troops again over the weekend.
We cannot and will not allow voices like Tucker Carlson to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts from the likes of Moveon.org, Media Matters and Sleeping Giants. Attempts were made last month to bully and terrorize Tucker and his family at their home. He is now once again being threatened via Twitter by far left activist groups with deeply political motives. While we do not advocate boycotts, these same groups never target other broadcasters and operate under a grossly hypocritical double standard given their intolerance to all opposing points of view.
We cannot turn back the clock and reverse globalization… but we can shape it, he told a forum hosted by the Institute of International Finance.
If the proposed rule becomes law, survivors will lose access to their education and schools will continue to sweep sexual violence under the rug, End Rape on Campus insists. The new rule will stop survivors from coming forward and make schools more dangerous for all students.
In December, Mayorkas claimed legalized immigration raises Americans' wages, despite the recognized evidence that migration shifts wages from American workers to migrants, employers, and investors.
350.org is so invested in the Green New Deal that it is quietly transforming its college divestment campaign, the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, into the Sunrise Movement, which serves as shock-troop protesters for the Green New Deal. For example, as college divestment campaigns close up shop, they encourage their followers to check out Sunrise Movement! In addition, two co-founders of the Sunrise Movement, Sara Blazevic and Varshini Prakash, left the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network to create the Sunrise Movement. Sunrise activists have protested on Capitol Hill and, encouraged by Ocasio-Cortez, have engaged in sit-ins in congressional offices, including three in the offices of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), to push House Democrats to create a special committee next year focused entirely on climate change initiatives.
It gives you an idea, doesn't it, as to why there is such a growing divide between the mostly liberals pushing the climate change doom narrative and the mostly conservatives who think it's a hoax?
MBS then took al-Thani on a tour of historic sites in Al-Ula, the city where the GCC summit was held.

But the private planes present unique issues for Warren and Sanders. As the leading progressive voices in a crowded Democratic primary, they often criticize rivals they deem insufficiently loyal to those values. The sudden use of private travel is an example of how ideological rigidity can sometimes collide with White House aspirations.

Pelosi served as Speaker from January 2007 until the beginning of January 2011, for two Congresses when Democrats held the majority at the end of the George W. Bush administration and beginning of the Barack Obama administration, but she has been stuck in the minority since Republicans took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections.
Officers were overtaxed and struggled to respond to what the report calls chaos. Security forces were unable to get all of the incidents, assaults, crimes, etc. under control. There were simply too many happening at the same time, the report states.
I received 127 corpses yesterday [February 3], and burned 116. Among them, 8 were confirmed [coronavirus cases] on the death certificate and 48 were suspected, a funeral home director in Hubei using the pseudonym You Hu told the newspaper. I am about to collapse, we are under great pressure now.
In his January 8 address to the nation, Trump described his decision to drop his proposed concrete wall as a concession to Democrats. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall, he said.
He said condemned the morality behind this invitation as she has virtually asked people to swim to Europe.

One city that is particularly hard-hit is the capital Vienna, which coincidentally also experienced the highest population growth last year.
1. Delays help Trump pressure Democrats to accept his popular pro-American policies. Many Democrats don't believe Trump will allow the DACA work-permits to continue expiring in March, so feel little pressure to trade their policy priorities for continuing work-permits. So if Trump declines to negotiate a deal until after the expirations accelerate in March, Democrats will recognize that Trump is playing hardball. They [now] think they have the upper hand, they don't really believe he will pull the trigger and let [DACA] expire, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. It is important to not just wait until March but to wait until [more illegals] lose their work permits to ensure the Democrats come back to the table and stop saying 'My way or the high way.' 2. Delays help Democrats make mistakes. In December, Trump called the Democrats' bluff when they suggested they would shut down the government spending unless the GOP gave them an amnesty. That was a bluff in December, and it will be a bluff in January or March or November 2018 because polls show that Americans strongly oppose any government shutdown to help illegals. But Democratic leaders are under pressure from angry illegals — many of whom believed the Democrats' shutdown-or-amnesty threats — and that grassroots pressure may cause the Democrats leaders to make concessions or make further mistakes, such as blocking the next budget deal which is due by January 19.

The fact of the matter is, we're working on the regulations right now, Price said.
The implication that China is also not properly documenting cause of death on people's birth certificates is also not new. Shortly after China revealed the outbreak to the world on January 20, Radio Free Asia (RFA) highlighted the strange death of Xu Dapeng, the founder of the oldest environmentalist group in the country. Xu and his wife lived in Wuhan and both died of pneumonia in January. Neither they nor anyone who was exposed to them were tested for the novel coronavirus, and their cause of death was simply declared pneumonia.

I don't care whether it's Republican or Democrat. We cannot allow the intelligence community, secret courts like the FISA court, to go after political campaigns, said Sen. Paul, in the speech.
Here are seven things Trump must say.
We think over half of the undocumented are uninsured, said Ken Janda, an adjunct professor of healthcare management at Rice University. That's a challenge because if they don't have the cash to pay, those costs are shared by the rest of the community. Either tax dollars pay for them, or … those costs have to be pulled out of insurance premiums and insurance dollars from other sources.
A Texas middle school teacher is fighting to keep her job after word spread that she was an adult film actress in at least 16 productions more than a decade ago.
The Fed is universally expected to raise its interest rate target by a quarter of a percentage point, so the actual policy announcement will likely be a non-event. Instead, everyone will focus on what the Fed says about the economy, inflation, and the expected path of interest rates.

His voters support the lower-migration policy because it raises wages by reducing the inflow of government-supplied immigrant workers. Rising wages are good for national politics if you're a politician, for sure, Tom Donohue, the long-standing chief of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in early January. He added:
Do not go to work, school or public areas, it states.
No one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut, Ocasio-Cortez said.

Due to the disturbing events that transpired yesterday, and given that the election results have now been certified, starting today *any* channels posting new videos with false claims in violation of our policies will now receive a strike. Over the last month, we've removed thousands of videos which spread misinformation claiming widespread voter fraud changed the result of the 2020 election, including several videos President Trump posted to his channel. Like other major policy updates, in our Help Center, we noted that there would be a short grace period after the Dec update & new content that broke our rules would be removed without penalty. The grace period was scheduled to end on Inauguration Day. Channels that receive a strike are temporarily suspended from posting or live streaming. Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube. We apply our policies and penalties consistently, regardless of who uploads it.

Let's be clear what this is really about, Cox said. This president is trying to create an illusion that he's doing something to keep people safe. He needs to do that because the truth is his policies have failed miserably. We saw that materialize itself in San Bernardino when we had a terrorist attack. This president didn't use it as an opportunity to unite this country. He didn't use it as an opportunity to lay out a plan to defeat terrorism. He used it as an opportunity to impose more gun control on law-abiding Americans.
Perry also notably highlighted a new Stanford policy that bans men from the gym at times during the week. In February, Stanford announced Women's Only Training hours would be offered to help female students feel more comfortable and safe at the gym.
Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, Perez said, as HuffPost reported. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state:
I've long argued that we would become the biggest party sooner or later. Throughout the years we have consistently talked about gang crime, escalating insecurity, migration policy that has not worked and integration policy that has made the situation worse, Åkesson said.
In a Q&A session hosted by Princeton University, where Powell got his undergraduate degree, Powell responded to a question about whether he would support a rate increase if the unemployment rate fell below levels that economists once considered a warning sign for an overheating economy.
First, Pelosi does not lead the legislative branch. She leads only one chamber of that branch — and the House is generally considered the lower chamber relative to the Senate. Moreover, she only leads at the pleasure of her party, and is only one among equals. The Constitution mentions the Speaker but does not give the office special powers.
The social media firm has been under pressure by the Obama administration and groups that track jihadi activity online to take more action to counter violent extremism on the Internet, including ISIS propaganda.
There are technically two votes for the Speakership. The first is in conference, where members of a party select whom their candidate will be. Democrats already selected Pelosi as their conference's candidate with a late November vote of 203-32 with three blank ballots and one absent member. The second, and more consequential, vote is on the floor of the House of Representatives. The first order of business of a new Congress is for the House to elect a Speaker. So, when the 115th Congress disbands and the 116th Congress is sworn in, before the House can do anything else, the chamber must elect a Speaker.
Many GOP and Democratic politicians will likely dislike any emergency declaration because Trump would redirect funding from their districts to the border wall in Texas and California. But it is not clear that majorities in the House and Senate could formally override the President's emergency powers.

Even mere whispers of this possibility can never be publicly acknowledged by any currently serving central banker; to do so would seriously undermine their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, who have become accustomed to their spoon-fed propaganda. These experts are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the problems we now face. They allow politicians to spend beyond their respective countries' means, then give them blank checks to bail them out whenever they get into too much trouble.
The overall goal seems to have been convincing second- and third-tier Indo-Pacific governments that China seeks to dominate them and giving them good reasons to push back while undermining China's efforts to present itself as an irresistible hegemonic power with a superior economic and political system. One of the major strategic objectives outlined in the Framework was promoting U.S. values throughout the region to maintain influence and counterbalance Chinese models of government. Another was investing in capabilities that promote uncensored communication between Chinese people.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the air strikes, saying, We are retaliating against attacks on Israel by very systematically attacking the [terror] infrastructure directed at us.
This move by the Times is more dangerous because it is more difficult to criticize. It is easy to spot apologetics for terrorism. It is harder, and more controversial, to call the Times out for manipulating American Jews in the service of left-wing antisemites.
The solution to Sical's problem is more work permits for U.S. jobs, said Andrew Selee, the well-paid president of the pro-migration Migration Policy Institute, The best way of dealing with irregular migration is not building walls but creating labor opportunities for people to work for periods of time in the United States, he told USAToday. Americans don't want those jobs, he insisted, without mentioning employers' pay offers or the coronavirus crash.
The regulation determines which countries in the bloc are responsible for granting asylum to migrants, which is typically supposed to be the first safe country the migrant sets foot in. This, however, has not been the case with France and Britain, with nearly 9,000 illegal migrants landing in England in 2020 and scant deportations back to the wealthy European nation — because it is not the first safe country they passed through, for the most part.
Despite the partisan turmoil over the last few days, McConnell said the Senate will pass the historic relief package today:
Biden comes to the White House with an undeniable record of supporting the kind of job-killing free trade and globalization of the American economy that Trump has denounced for decades. That record has helped make Biden friendly with multinational corporations, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street — all of which benefit massively from outsourcing manufacturing to foreign countries that tolerate slave labor.
Democrats have voiced outrage over the placement of Grenell, who takes charge after a period of tension between intelligence professionals and Trump, who has played down Russian interference in the last election.
The Justice Department's posture toward sanctuary cities comes after Culberson pressured the department to bring sanctuary cities into compliance with existing law. Culberson is the chairman of the House Appropriation's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.
The Kochs are the latest to join a corporate donation blacklist in which multinational conglomerates, Wall Street banks, and Big Tech firms have said they will not donate to election-objecting Republicans.
In a statement to Politico, CEO of the Kochs' Americans for Prosperity Emily Seidel suggested that the group's super PAC will weigh heavy who they will provide campaign cash to in the next election cycles following a riot that took place at the United States Capitol by protestors who opposed the presidential electoral college results.
These centers outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by a 20:1 ratio, notes Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser.
No wonder Pelosi and Schumer wanted to debate this issue behind closed doors. They have no case.
Perched on a hill, Trebisht is a sleepy place.
I frequently like to quote Friedrich Nietzsche, who said, Insanity in individuals is something rare – but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule. The Chinese will not be the Master Race that rules the world. Instead, they'll do exactly what the Nazis did—bring destruction and catastrophe to themselves and the world.

It takes courage, inner freedom, and a sense of responsibility. We did not cause the crisis. It has been building for months. Now, we will leave our seats, Renzi said, according to Il Giornale.
Bloomberg, whom polls show is gaining traction in his quest for the 2020 Democrat nomination, released his proposal for overhauling America's immigration and refugee laws on Monday. The plan, based on policies the mayor implemented during his tenure at the helm of New York City, is being touted as beneficial to not only the country's diversity, but also its profit margins.
Citing an internal U.S. intelligence report, the Daily Beast reported in 2009 that the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan were using the country's bounty supply of heroin as a tactical weapon against American troops.
Due to the Obama administration's high bar to enforce immigration law, the chairman say, at least two women are dead, one is in a coma, and another is injured.
Der Standard says the trial, in city of Graz, is being held under such tight security that journalists have to apply for accreditation before being given access to the court room.
Real reform means stronger border security, said Obama several years later as president, during his 2013 State Of The Union.
We absolutely cannot allow this, he told reporters at the prime minister's residence. We will take action to totally protect the safety and well-being of our people.
This is a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer. If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. Serious action MUST be taken NOW! the president tweeted. There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!
China's Global Times state-run newspaper urged the Chinese Communist Party to impose military pressure on Taiwan, a sovereign state that China claims as a rogue province, on Sunday following President Tsai Ing-wen's reelection on the island this weekend.
Born March 11, 1957, Soleimani was said in his homeland to have grown up near the mountainous and the historic Iranian town of Rabor, famous for its forests, its apricot, walnut and peach harvests and its brave soldiers. The U.S. State Department has said he was born in the Iranian religious capital of Qom.
There was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.
Despite major opposition from Trump's base of supporters to for an amnesty-for-wall funding deal, the plan has been touted in White House discussions, as it is favored by the billionaire donor class.
Pritzer is a leading donor to the various advocacy groups which are pushing the transgender ideology into U.S. law and civic life. The ideology insists that everyone should have an FBI-enforced federal right to switch their legal sex — regardless of science or their biology — to match their claimed gender identity whenever they enter sports competitions, lesbian nightclubs, K-12 bathrooms, hospitals, gym showers, the military, or single-sex civic groups.
Then came the big guns: With a loose promise that the 78-year-old Pelosi would term limit herself, something she intended to do anyway, Pelosi flipped another group of rebels into backing her. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), a senior leftist Democrat from Colorado who had previously been quoted in Politico publicly organizing against Pelosi, flipped and endorsed her, thereby rescinding his signature on the letter.
Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend, Perdue lit into Ossoff's pledge to grant a blanket amnesty to all illegal aliens in America, deeming it an affront to legal immigrants and struggling American workers alike.
Saudi censors might have also seen dangerous implications for the Wahhabi state in how National Geographic framed its coverage, as the cover referred to Francis leading a 'quiet revolution' to reform the Catholic Church, wrote Foreign Policy.
However, even the CNN article concedes there is more than thin skin behind the decision. For one thing, Abrams was not merely critical of Trump in a few random comments last year. He penned a May 2016 op-ed for the Weekly Standard entitled, When You Can't Stand Your Candidate, which declared Trump unfit for office, incorrectly predicted he couldn't possibly win, and compared him to George McGovern. (For those who lack 69-year-old Abrams' perspective on political history, that is not a flattering comparison.)
This is a no-brainer. It's not just China any longer. With the rise of cases in Europe & Asia, we need to take additional steps to protect Americans https://t.co/2ud0OqJDpv — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) February 26, 2020
A decade earlier, Hillary Clinton's husband and then-president Bill Clinton affirmed his own beliefs that illegal immigration should be stopped in his 1995 State Of The Union, stating that all Americans were right to be disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering [the United States], adding that illegal aliens impose burdens on [U.S.] taxpayers.
Even Turkey, whose president in 2012 famously vowed to pray at Omayyad Mosque in Damascus after Assad's ouster, has signaled it would consider working with Assad again if he wins in free and fair elections.
Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, according to the GAO, a congressional watchdog.
To be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a State must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether §20–18–401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go. The statute in ques- tion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Oberge- fell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders. In an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state supreme court agreed. And it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the Constitution. To the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this Court's prec- edents suggest just the opposite conclusion.
5. Radical left-wing ballot initiatives defeated. Though Democrats managed to defeat President Trump at the polls, voters rejected almost all of the left's most radical ballot initiatives. Tax hikes failed even in deep-blue California and Illinois, and California voters also rejected an effort (Proposition 16) to allow racial discrimination (affirmative action) in state-run institutions. These were major victories, and a sign that even Democratic voters were pushing back against the radical left.
Nobody believes that Wall St. cover story – except the people paid to promote it & the estb. journos whose editors don't want them to follow the money.
The incoming House Democrat majority will have 235 members, while Republicans will have 199 members and there will be one vacancy in North Carolina's yet-to-be-resolved ninth congressional district. That means if those 17 had held together and added one more to make their number 18, they would have had the votes to stop Pelosi from ascending to the Speakership at least on the first ballot–forcing a chaotic process and at least a second ballot.
Just at a time when people are finally waking up to the dangers of the CCP, after a year in which the whole world has suffered a global pandemic caused, at least in part, by the CCP's mendacity and repression, and at a time when increasingly experts are accusing the CCP of committing genocide against the Uyghurs, now is not the time to be doing such deals, especially without any human rights safeguards in them, Rogers said.
There's a moment, which I'm not saying is now, when it is possible for it to bring rewards. But the moment is not any moment – you can do it at exactly the wrong time and cause a complete meltdown and undermine all the resistance to extremism. And, secondly, the result [can be] the people in the middle become more disempowered, and you end up privileging those who cause the most difficulty, you reward bad behaviour by attention.
The 2020 presidential candidate has made the radical shift leftward with the rest of his party.
The Iran nuclear deal, so despised by Israel, is solidly in place. The U.S. Embassy is no closer to moving to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government wants. As it has under past presidents, Washington is still telling Israel to slow settlement construction.
She's the epitome of meritocracy. I mean, first-generation wealth, Wellesley, Yale Law School, always prepared, always does her homework, articulate, perfectly spoken — but also perceived as cold and calculating, Brill said.
As president of the Republic of China, I must stress that we've never accepted the '1992 Consensus,' & the 'four musts' are crucial for positive cross-strait developments. I call on #China to bravely take steps towards democracy, so they can truly understand the people of #Taiwan, she said, referring to four conditions to more positive relations.
During his first year in office, Mike will set the target for refugee admissions at 125,000, and—recognizing the changing conditions causing displacement—will also establish a precedent for people permanently displaced by climate change to qualify as refugees, Bloomberg's plan states.
I would have our federal government invest in helping to rebuild our industrial base using advanced manufacturing technology that can produce our medicines much more cheaply, safely, with less environmental footprint, and fully, from soup to nuts from those core raw materials to finished drug in one location all here in the United States.
Jo Johnson, British Minister of State for Universities and Science has written to universities informing them that they will be expected to uphold free speech for their students, faculty, and visiting guests. The move is being described as a response to the rise of safe spaces and other forms of censorship in higher education.
LISTEN TO SEN. DAVID PERDUE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
Trump has been saying for several months that he does not think the Fed should be raising rates. Trump and Fed officials have often appeared to disagree on how fast the economy should be growing. Trump wants it to grow at 3 percent or more for several years. Many Fed officials think the economy has been growing faster than its long-term potential and see their role as creating conditions for a soft-landing in which growth falls back toward 2 percent.
It appears he has failed yet again. We now call upon President-elect Biden to formally rescind this unconstitutional policy after inauguration, they continued. Doing so would send the message that under our Constitution, everyone in this country counts.
The student, Caitlin Jeffers, claims that Professor Scott instructed students to avoid using gender-specific language at the beginning of the semester.

Her story came to light after Breitbart London found deleted Facebook posts from the open borders campaign group on Facebook called Calais Migrant Solidarity (No Borders). The group is associated with migrant violence in Calais, as confirmed by a French police official in early December 2015.
Italy's interior ministry boasted in 2017 that counter-terrorism units had stopped and questioned 160,593 people between March 2016 to March 2017, as well as interrogating some 34,000 people at airports and arresting around 550 suspected terrorists. They also shut down more than 500 websites while monitoring nearly half a million more.
The primary reason for this reevaluation, Lorenzoni explained, was that the PT had ruled the country for 14 years, most of the 21st century. While its two presidents fared poorly after their tenures – Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is serving a 12-year sentence for corruption while president; Dilma Rousseff was impeached out of office and lost a senate bid last year – 14 years is over a decade of low-profile hires throughout the expansive Brazilian federal state infrastructure. Maintaining staff in key positions in agencies like the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of Justice who oppose the reforms Bolsonaro campaigned on could make those reforms impossible.
Eugene Kontorovich, head of International Law at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative think-tank in Jerusalem, said no international law was being violated by countries who do business in settlements, and said Israel was being singled out unfairly.
The new process will allocate the annual supply of 85,000 H-1B visas to corporations that offer the highest pay. The ranking system will end the economic incentive to hire mid-skilled H-1B foreign workers instead of younger American graduates. Currently, companies, universities, and hospitals keep roughly 1 million H-1B non-immigrant contract workers in jobs which sidelined, unemployed, or underpaid American professionals need.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) promised Sunday to advance racial, economic, and environmental justice during the new congressional term.
Lacker had previously announced his intention to retire this fall. Under the Fed's rotating schedule, the Richmond Fed president will not become a voting member of the 12-person interest rate setting board until 2018.
The president, during the campaign, always talked about an America First foreign policy. What he said expressly he meant by that was that American national interests have to dominate what a president does – not abstract ideas about the way the world order should look, but concentrating on threats to America and dealing with them, Bolton recalled.
As mayor, though, Bloomberg did not apply his stop and frisk policy equally, he deliberately targeted young, black men.
If you continue to discourage people from seeking services under normal circumstances, you cannot expect them necessarily to seek those services just because you as the racist, anti-immigrant president have decided that now it's a good idea, Max Hadler, director of health policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, told the Guardian.
All week, the media has been full of stories — leaked, of course, by her Deep State enemies in the Civil Service — about what an awful, useless minister Patel is. One egregious rumour claimed that MI5 officials were withholding intelligence from her because they did not trust her. (MI5 has robustly denied this). Other reports have claimed that she is a workplace bully in the habit of swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands.
The free speech network announced that it would bring ten new servers online to handle the increased traffic volume.
Ahead of Wednesday's session, Schiff released new records from Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, about the Ukraine strategy, including an exchange with another man about surveilling later-fired Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.
The government's failure to enforce immigration laws for many years has created a large population of 10 million to 20 million migrants, who are mixed in the population of roughly 315 million Americans. The resulting flooded labor market keeps many of these illegal or legal migrants — and many Americans — in low-wage careers, in crowded apartments, and in service sector jobs such as restaurants.
The video ignored the impact of the cheap-labor migrant workforce on the employment and income of American workers. In 2018, Breitbart reported:
While acknowledging that some had cast protest votes, the German leader refused to change her position.
The survey of 1,994 young adults from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland was commissioned by think tank Demos and supported by the British Council as part of the Next Generation project.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to Chinese state television Saturday in which he credited the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party with defeating the coronavirus pandemic and celebrated the incoming Biden administration in America as a new window of hope for relations between the U.S. and China.
But the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.

This is clearly not an escalation, this is clearly an act of self-defense, Carafano said. The president has also never said we're walking away from the Middle East. What he says he wants is a sustainable security architecture in place which means we're going to protect our interest and we're going to expect others to do more to protect theirs.

According to an extensive report in the Japan Times, the mission lasted ten hours and was launched out of U.S. territory in Guam. The goal of the operation was to improve coordination between the ship and the bombers by refining joint tactics, techniques and procedures while simultaneously strengthening their ability to seamlessly integrate their operations, Pacific Command said. The statement explicitly did not refer to the operation as an FONOP.
More importantly, Sessions said, the mask has slipped off Jones, revealing he is just as radical as the rest of them—and his claims to be a moderate are failing and untrue.

On top of the new migrant crisis, Europe is also grappling with the threat of the China-origin coronavirus. Hungary has changed its already robust asylum rules in light of the spreading virus, with the country's national security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi announcing on Sunday that because of the related risks of uncontrolled movements of people and infection, Hungary has indefinitely suspended access to border transit areas for asylum seekers.
[Democrats'] slapdash process has concluded in the first purely partisan presidential impeachment since the wake of the Civil War, McConnell noted the day after the House majority impeached Trump without a single Republican vote, echoing his recent comment.
His comments echoed those of Social Democrat MP Heinz Buschkowsky who said in November that Germany faces an avalanche of migrants, and should expect up to 10 million by 2020 if current trends continue.
Democrats are using the epidemic to delegitimize migration rules, says Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter enforcement. There is a pragmatic way of limiting the public health fallout of the disease, and there there is the Democratic effort to undermine immigration laws, to morally stigmatize them using the virus as an excuse, he said.
Three of Orange County's four Republican districts that have flipped to Democrat have foreign-born populations that make up 25 percent or more of the region. For example, California's 39th District — where Democrat Gil Cisneros won over Republican Young Kim — has a 34.1 percent foreign-born population.
The President and the Secretary of State and I met over that issue, and the President has endorsed that reform that obviously would require a statutory change, along with reallocation of State Department resources in the State Department appropriations bill, but it's one that we're prepared to support. And we also believe that we should match that with one other statutory change that the Secretary just alluded to, which is unaccompanied children who apply for asylum, who, after due process, are determined not to be eligible for asylum … We cannot return them, even if their families request them to be — we cannot return them to their families in Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala.

Instead of taking a stand against this agitation and fighting for the diversity of viewpoints in their institutions, universities in recent years have imposed politically correct speech codes on students and faculty, restricted controversial speech to free speech zones, and actively torpedoed primarily right-leaning student groups and invited speakers.

The snowflake idea is true, but incomplete. The snowflake idea addresses that these students have helicopter parents who didn't want to see them get hurt in any way, who coddled them, and didn't get them used to the hard knocks of life. I think there's some real truth in that. So – when they hear someone who disagrees with them – they sort of want to shrivel up and die, which makes them want to silence people. But, I think that this psychological explanation underplays the importance of ideology in all this. If you look at what's happened to the university over the last few decades, they've really been taken over by the studies programs – African-American studies, Latino studies, women's studies, environmental studies, gender studies – and sometimes they literally have studies that teach activism. These studies programs are generally built around political assumptions, and their classes are teaching leftist politics.
Bill McKibben was one of just five people Sanders named to the Platform Drafting Committee at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
But it is backfiring. They started by telling the story of Alexander Downer, an Australian diplomat, as having remembered a bar conversation with George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. But how did the FBI know they should talk to him? That's left out of their narrative. Downer's signature appears on a $25 million contribution to the Clinton Foundation. You don't need much imagination to figure that he was close with Clinton Foundation operatives who relayed information to the State Department, which then called the FBI to complete the loop. This wasn't intelligence. It was likely opposition research from the start.
President Obama also altered the Affordable Care Act — i.e. Obamacare — several times without any authorization from the legislature.
Perry said that collection of electronic communications … that merely mention a foreign target of surveillance has been used as an end-around the Fourth Amendment, commending the NSA for finally aligning their collection efforts with the Constitution.

Based on oil minister's reports, Iran's oil sales have been continuing just as it was expected, but there are some minor issues that are solvable and will be solved soon, he claimed. No one looking at the actual data could possibly believe that, but Iranians will be required to believe it so their leaders can claim victory over the American quest to reduce its oil exports to zero.
Christianity is technically legal in China. China allows only five legal religions – Christianity, Catholicism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Islam – but only allows the practice of each under the auspices of patriotic, state-controlled institutions. Chinese Catholics cannot legally be part of the Roman Catholic Church, only of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Similarly, non-Catholic Christians in China can only partake in practices led by the Three-Self Patriotic Church, a communist entity. Communism is by definition an atheist political ideology, which has made the vast majority of Christians reject communist-led Christian services.

I listened to the analysts, and I heard only two things mentioned that make this different from the previous peace plan:
There were several incidents in the past several weeks. No one has lost his life, but several Americans have received eye injuries.
The H-1B temporary visa program has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs, said Joseph Edlow, the policy director at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency. He continued:

The president of CENI, the election commission of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), indefinitely postponed the release of the preliminary results of the December 30 presidential election, saying that it was not yet clear when the results would be ready for release.
And in May 2020, Mr. Trump threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the W.H.O. altogether — a move that would cost the agency nearly $900 million biennially — over concerns about Chinese influence.
So today, Pompeo and the Trump administration, operating as Kirkpatrick-type realists, believe that the U.S. has an affirmative duty to look out for itself. And that means, as a matter of strategic necessity, allying with other countries that also fear China's rise. We can worry about the nature of those governments later; the first priority is to make sure that we don't lose the greater geopolitical struggle.
That long campaign has fractured and loopholed what once was expected by the public to be an orderly legal immigration system for legal migrants from south of the U.S. border.
Trump confirmed reports that he would tackle unfairly subsidized aluminum imports in the upcoming weeks, and preview additional actions after that.

Open Doors is dedicated to aiding Christians in parts of the world where they face persecution, either from the government or from civil society.
In the text released of his final State of the Union address, President Obama cynically attacks Congress for his own inaction against ISIS. Although — whether it's flooding the country with illegals or restricting gun ownership for law-abiding Americans — this lawless president is always eager to usurp the Constitution through illegal executive actions, on the one issue where he does have the constitutional authority (foreign policy) he blames Congress for his dereliction of duty:
According to the poll, 20 percent of millennials identify themselves as Republicans and an equal percentage as Democrats.
In his inaugural address, Newsom promised sanctuary to all who seek it — a reference to California's status as a sanctuary state for illegal aliens that refuses to help enforce federal immigration law.
In a statement, the city of East Lansing said the farmer's decision not to host a same-sex wedding violated a long-standing ordinance that protects sexual orientation as well as the Supreme Court's ruling that grants the right for same-sex couples to be married.
Late last year, Germany called on France to give up its seat to the EU so the bloc could speak with one voice — a request France rejected. Germany began her two-year stint in the Security Council as one of ten non-permanent members in January, with Mrs Merkel telling her country in her New Year's address that she would keep pushing for global solutions to the world's problems, including mass migration and climate change.
He pointed out that allowing four commercial planes to reach Yemen with a total of 1,000 passengers is a dirty tactic by the US-Saudi aggression, while only two flights have been allowed per week since the beginning of the aggression. He explained that sometimes months pass by without allowing any flights to land in Yemen, Mehr relayed.
After its top general was killed in a U.S. drone attack earlier this month, Iran announced that it would no longer respect limits set on how many centrifuges it can use to enrich uranium. Tehran said the new move was a remedial step in line with the deal and that it could be reversed.

Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez became the poster-child for passing the bill after she quickly reversed her department's policies of cooperating with federal immigration officials shortly after being sworn in in January 2017.
The Vice President slammed ABC for its attack on Christianity. During an interview with Axios, the VP said, It's just simply wrong for ABC to have a television program that expresses that kind of religious intolerance. He added that the whole discussion shows how out of touch some in the mainstream media is.

Free Venezuela—the one before Hugo Chávez—developed a reputation as a tropical paradise known for its beauty queens and delicious food. Political activism, both within its borders and by the Venezuelan exile community, highlights the dramatic change in national character that socialism has triggered. Its lifestyle and society writers, struggling to impose normalcy in a time of chaos, prove just how deep the political wounds go, deforming far more than ideological affiliations and policy preferences.
In the interview, Father Cervellera said he had been receiving information piecemeal regarding the details of the forthcoming agreement, including the worrisome final authority of the Chinese bishop's council to overrule eventual objections by the pope to a given candidate, allowing them to proceed as if nothing happened.
Kim Jong Un has overseen two of the North's four nuclear tests and three long-range rocket tests since taking over after the death of his father, dictator Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. North Korea says its rocket launches are satellite missions, but the U.S., South Korea and others say they are a covert test of ballistic missile technology. The U.N. Security Council prohibits North Korea from nuclear and ballistic missile activity. Experts say that ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology.
Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden, who boasted during the CNN debate Sunday evening of his 100 percent rating from abortion political advocacy group NARAL, presents his Agenda for the Catholic Community at his campaign website.
For someone to win the vote, they need to win a majority of those members who voted for a candidate. Voting present technically is a thrown-away vote, as it does not count toward the number of votes cast for candidates, and thereby lowers the total threshold. Assuming all 435 members of the House are present and vote for a candidate, that would mean the winner needs 218 votes. If anyone is absent or votes present and not for a candidate, that lowers the number of votes a winner needs one member for each two members voting present or absent from the vote.
In the past year around 3,000 underage Afghan migrants have arrived in Sweden and 600 of them have been rejected for asylum status. Of those rejected, many have been allowed to stay in Sweden because they claim not to have any family back in their native country.
As has been hammered home repeatedly over the years by meteorologist Anthony Watts (who is also a Senior Fellow with The Heartland Institute), many of the monitoring stations throughout the United States fail to meet the standards established by the agencies themselves for reliable data measurement. Watts recorded hundreds of stations on pavement, at airports collecting jet exhaust, located next to artificial sources of hot and cold, such as air conditioning systems or commercial grill heat exhausts. Many of these stations were once located in rural areas, but are now surrounded by development, and others are rural stations where data is not recorded or monitored regularly.
Kirkpatrick thus put her finger on a central and enduring aspect of liberalism: namely, the instinct to focus intensely on the small flaws of friends, while being blind to the larger flaws of foes. She derided this liberal impulse as a formula for self-abasement and apology. And we might add that this mindset never seems to change—hence, decades later, Barack Obama's notorious apology tours.

What's more, it is not even Roberts who would be revealing the name; it is the senator asking the question revealing the name. Roberts is merely reading someone else's question, which proves his motives are not only partisan, but one more example of the chief justice fabricating something out of whole cloth to benefit Democrats.
The Muslim Ban expansion is about one thing: weaponizing anti-Muslim bigotry for political gain. Like the administration's earlier Muslim bans, this expanded ban overwhelmingly targets Muslims and forces tens of thousands Americans to sacrifice their families, their health and their educational and professional opportunities. In fact, over a million Americans were born in Muslim Ban countries and could be affected. It is clear that the president's goal, as always, is to target Muslims, immigrants, black and African countries and other people or color.
The Americans are stationed in Djibouti at the Camp Lemonnier naval base which is the primary base of operations and logistics hub for missions across Africa. It supports approximately 4,000 U.S., joint and allied forces military and civilian personnel and defense contractors.

Only 15 nations in the world recognize the reality of Taiwan's statehood; the United States is not one of them, but it does provide military and civilian support to the country. The state newspaper predicted that America will get up to more little tricks on the Taiwan question in the coming years, condemning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for congratulating Tsai on her election victory.
George Washington was indispensable, but only for what he was, not for what he did, McDonald continued. He was the symbol of the presidency, the epitome of propriety in government, the means by which Americans accommodated the change from monarchy to republicanism, and the instrument by which an inconsequential people took its first steps to becoming a great nation.
Huawei has told its Chinese employees working in Europe that if they marry Westerners, they could face being fired or forced to leave the continent for betrayal, an investigation has found.
Announced in September of 2017, the new Amazon building will be called HQ2 and will cost approximately $5 billion to develop and operate. Amazon estimates that the building could create up to 50,000 high-paying jobs in the city they choose to construct it in. Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy commented on Amazon's decision to cut down their list of 238 cities to only 20 saying, Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity. Through this process, we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Monday endorsed a policy prescription in which the U.S. government would give $1,000 to every American adult as part of an effort to help ease financial strain during the coronavirus outbreak.

It's the equivalent of waking up to find Warren Buffett and the heads of ABC, CBS and NBC have been arrested, a former U.S. official told the New Yorker. It has all the appearances of a coup d'état. Saudi Arabia is rapidly becoming another country. The kingdom has never been this unstable.
She was elected as part of the movement, she intends to govern as part of the movement, former Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent stated.
If your strategy consists of releasing you into the interior of the United States once you've illegally entered and have been apprehended, protecting you from local deportation, and providing substantial rewards such as free health care, you have just created a complete system of incentives. Who wouldn't try to enter with Release, Protect, and Reward being the new open border strategy?
McConnell noted on the Senate floor:
Immigration Voice claims to be an independent group, but reportedly works closely with Compete America, an advocacy group formed by the nation's major tech companies, nearly all of whom employees large blocs of Indian and Chinese visa-workers in jobs that could be filled by young American graduates.
The President is determined to finally build a wall at the Southern border. This will make it harder – much harder – and more expensive for illegal aliens to break our laws and smuggle drugs or even human beings into this country. For many, it will become too costly, or too much trouble, and they will stay home.
A policy that applies different standards to the same type of indoor sports facility isn't fair, a Seoul-area gym owner named Oh Seong-young told the newspaper.
Just days after satellite imagery showed that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is rapidly militarizing the South China Sea by deploying advanced surface-to-air missile systems, new imagery shows that China appears to be building a an advanced radar system potentially giving China control of the entire South China Sea.
Zaman has a circulation of 650,000, according to Vice, largely the product of providing an alternative view of current affairs from pro-government publications. Journalists at Zaman were warned that the newspaper would experience a change in editorial policy after its editor-in-chief was forced out of his job, but were assured the newspaper would remain unbiased and objective, neutral. Doubting this, they released a statement on Friday calling the takeover the darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press, which is a major benchmark for democracy and the rule of law.
For those who cannot find any starch or flour for their baked goods, another newspaper, El Diario de Caracas, published a recipe for bread without flour. If you did not have time to go to the bakery, if yesterday's bread wasn't enough for today, or if you just prefer home cooking, this alternative can save your morning coffee or breakfast, the recipe suggests. The recipe uses powdered milk and baking powder as a substitute for flour.
The original WaPo editorial ran May 29. In it, WaPo admitted the some benefits can be gained from suppressors, but presented them as marginal at best and called on Congress to stand up for the people in general rather shooting sports participants.

3) Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet This is the biggest BS of the lot. The cooling of the Earth's climate between 1940 and the 1970s, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, was well known by climate scientists at the time. For instance, HH Lamb wrote this piece for the UNESCO's Courier magazine in 1973:
Buttigieg faced criticism this summer for his penchant for flying private from presidential rival Beto O'Rourke, who produced an online ad filmed aboard a commercial jet proclaiming No private planes for this campaign. Buttigieg responded during a CNN climate change town hall by saying, This is a very big country, and I'm running to be president of the whole country. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, dropped out of the race in November.

The President and the Secretary of State and I met over that issue, and the President has endorsed that reform that obviously would require a statutory change, along with reallocation of State Department resources in the State Department appropriations bill, but it's one that we're prepared to support. And we also believe that we should match that with one other statutory change that the Secretary just alluded to, which is unaccompanied children who apply for asylum, who, after due process, are determined not to be eligible for asylum … We cannot return them, even if their families request them to be — we cannot return them to their families in Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala.

The country exported only $1.867 billion non-oil goods during November 21-December 22, less than half of Iran's monthly average during the current fiscal year, which started on March 21, 2018. The plunge in exports was partly due to a complete stoppage in ultra-light oil (gas condensate) sales, which Iran includes in non-oil export basket. The monthly gas condensate export has averaged at about $330 million, or only a seventh of the drop in total non-oil exports during November 21-December 22. In the other world, U.S. oil-related sanctions also seriously impacted Iran's non-oil exports as well. The U.S. also imposed financial sanctions on Iran in August, but the details of customs statistics does not show any meaningful change in the non-oil exports level during the August-November period. During the first nine months of the fiscal year (FY), the country has exported about 5.6 million metric tons of gas condensate at $2.776 billion, which indicates a 50% decline year-on-year. However, the country's total non-oil exports during March 21-December 22 reached $33.36 billions, or 4.5% more than the same period in last FY. Despite this growth, Iran has fulfilled less than 70% of its non-oil export target for the period. Its non-fuel imports also declined 13.3% year-on-year to $32.62 billion.

But while tensions prompted by mass immigration were clearly of concern to those leaving Europe, the possibility of a British exit from the European Union was not a concern. If anything, those questioned were more likely to welcome the possibility of Britain being able to regain her borders, making a Brexit more likely to keep high net worth individuals within the UK.
Stripe alleges that President Trump violated the company's policies against encouraging violence, following his reaction events at Capitol Hill.

A report by Real Clear Investigations (RCI) suggests Sheriff Scott Israel did not fire Deputy Scot Peterson–aka, the Coward of Broward–following the Parkland school shooting because Peterson covered up a sexual assault incident involving the sheriff's son.
We're not at the mercy of what's happening outside our borders. We can't control worsening economic conditions within an entire Western Hemisphere, which we all know drives illegal migration. But we can and should control how we address its impacts at our borders. And that's exactly what we're doing now. By ending catch and release, and by closing loopholes, we've de-incentivized the pull factors and positioned ourselves to be able to effectively address the constant fluctuation in the numbers, regardless of the external factors out of our control. Tools like the CDC public health order, the migrant protection protocols, and yes, the border wall system. If we remove those tools, the current increase in illegal migration we're already experiencing will become our next full-blown illegal immigration crisis. If the Biden team implements the immigration policy that they have campaigned on, that they promised the American people they would do on Day One, they will create an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.

The authoritative peer-reviewed, 'Impacts of Surface Water Diversions for Marijuana Cultivation' published in the POLS ONE journal, estimated that marijuana cultivation in the Emerald Triangle has the potential to cause a 23 percent reduction of stream flow during the driest periods of the year. Such diminished streamflow is likely to lethal to salmon, steelhead trout and cause further decline of sensitive amphibian species.
Registered churches under the Three-Self Patriotic Movement have been forced to sing national and pro-Communist songs during services, to fly the national flag and remove religious images. Across the country, churches have had their crosses removed, and many report that under-18s are now banned from attending religious activities, the Christian human rights group added.
People who wish to remain non-partisan emphasize the 'snowflake' thing, and others have taken it up, but the truth is there is a one-sidedness in the ideology of colleges that have become so far-left that they have broken from classical liberalism, Kurtz concludes. If we don't acknowledge that's at the root of the problem, then we'll never solve it.
Perez Arriaga was arrested in December 2018 for the killing of Singh — a legal immigrant from Fiji — but was officially charged with the murder of a law enforcement officer on Wednesday. The illegal alien, whom authorities said is a known gang member, had been caught by police after a more than 50-hour manhunt. Officials said he was planning to flee the U.S. to Mexico.
Nelson said that the White House didn't invite him to the meeting on purpose. He continued, I'm not unhappy about it. I think it shows the excessive partisanship of, if not the president, at least those around him, which is so silly. I mean, what people want is they want us to come together in bipartisan agreement.

Inflation has risen sharply from last June's 0.5 percent, largely because the country's vote to leave the European Union triggered a 15 percent drop in the value of the pound. Though a lower pound may help exporters sell their wares in international markets, all other things being equal, it makes imported goods such as food and energy more expensive.
Blaine amendments, borne out of 19th-century anti-Catholic bigotry, have been the constant bane of the modern education-choice movement. The amendments, currently found in the constitutions of 37 states, prohibit public funds from supporting sectarian schools.

And the public's opinion around our continued involvement after 20 years in Afghanistan is no secret at this point, he added.

We need to enforce our laws, the Alabama Senator added, and we have to make the consequences of drug trafficking a deterrent … Law enforcement plays a critical role in it.

Ahmed Hafez, the spokesman for Egypt's Foreign Ministry, said last week that Cairo supports efforts to reach a resolution that respects non-interference in internal affairs in an apparent reference to Qatar's backing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The conflict in Libya is also a contentious issue, with Egypt and the UAE supporting militias fighting a Tripoli-based bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar.

From technology to the weather, the factors affecting the price of oil are frequent and varied. One key constant, however, is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC), a cartel that uses its significant reserves of crude and concentrated political power structures to exert undue influence on the world price, affecting the U.S. economy as a result. This influence was felt most prominently and recently in our own energy industry. Amid the rising oil prices of the previous decade, a small group of innovative American producers used new technology to unlock the oil held in U.S. shale formations, long considered to be too expensive and limited to produce. This new production rewrote the energy rulebook, and our oil imports were halved.

The American people have known for more than 30 years – the American people are right about this – that our immigration system is broken. It's intentionally designed to be blind to merit. It doesn't favor education or skills. It just favors anybody who has a relative in America — and not necessarily a close relative. That defies common sense. Employers don't roll dice when deciding who to hire. Our incredible military doesn't draw straws when deciding whom to accept. But for some reason, when we're admitting new Americans — the future of this country — our government uses a randomized lottery system and chain migration.
Commissioner Richard Ross said Starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing. He said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything, as he said is company policy. He said they then refused to leave. Ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released after the company elected not to prosecute. He said the officers 'did absolutely nothing wrong' and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but 'got the opposite back.' He did not mention the person who said he was meeting with the men. 'As an African American male, I am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,' Ross said. But he added If a business calls and they say that 'Someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business' (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.'

The comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect.

The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.

If you doubt America's commitment — or mine — to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.

Moreover, House Democrats' accusations rest on the false and dangerous premise that Vice President Biden somehow immunized his conduct (and his son's) from any scrutiny by declaring his run for the presidency. There is no such rule of law. It certainly was not a rule applied when President Trump was a candidate. His political opponents called for investigations against him and his children almost daily. Nothing in the law requires the government to turn a blind eye to potential wrongdoing based on a person's status as a candidate for President of the United States. If anything, the possibility that Vice President Biden may ascend to the highest office in the country provides a compelling reason for ensuring that, when he forced Ukraine to fire its Prosecutor General, his family was not corruptly benefitting from his actions.

A new social order has emerged across Honduras. Many of the markers of status that defined life before the migration boom — such as land ownership, advanced age, education, and political connections—are being replaced by knowledge of how to migrate successfully to the United States and remit earnings to family members in Honduras. Migrants and returnees have become the very models of success for young people in rural areas. At the same time, new forms of social differentiation are emerging.

Less clear is is whether a declared state of emergency qualifies as one of the circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress under which Posse Comitatus applies.

Fortunately, Congress has already taken specific actions that obviate the need for litigation.

It is too hard to say right now when the situation may improve, but we are monitoring closely and will make sure that our members have the information they need to make the best decisions they can to protect themselves and our community, White added.
Firing Cordray will not be as simple. The CFPB is an independent agency, and his term as director expires in 2018. Trump can only dismiss Cordray for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Sources say that the administration examines Cordray's five-year tenure as director to justify his termination.
Our goal is not to see how many people we can arrest, Sessions continued. … But to end the illegality and restore in this country a legal system of immigration. We want people to apply and wait their turn. And if they're not selected, they are not entitled to come into the country illegally. It's just that simple.
In other words, Aquinas taught that total integration of immigrants into the life, language, customs and culture (including worship, in this case) was necessary for full citizenship.
Tensions with the United States eased after the ballistic missile attack, when President Donald Trump declined to respond and welcomed Iran's apparent decision to stand down.
MCCAIN: I wanted to ask you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car should be eliminated within the next eleven years. Everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party?

Italian newspaper il Giornale — otherwise highly supportive of Salvini's populist Lega party — declared the delay the work of amateurs, noting that new discussions could add days more onto Italy being without a functioning government. The paper, in particular, pointed out the differences between the parties in the key areas of policy, including taxation, immigration, justice, and the European Union.
To build back better in a way that advances justices in America. Indeed the pandemic has pulled back the curtain on and showing and even worsened the disparities in our society.

Over the past three years, our administration has been firm on our bottom line on Taiwan's sovereignty, but we have also been willing to maintain healthy exchanges with China, Tsai said. In the face of China's diplomatic pressure and military threats, we have maintained a non-provocative, non-adventurist attitude that has prevented serious conflict from breaking out in the Taiwan Strait.
President Donald Trump has widened his so-called 'travel ban' to pressure foreign governments to tighten up their security checks on airline travelers.

Sandweg worked as the ICE chief and top legal advisor to Obama's Department of Homeland Security. In the agency, he helped to implement Obama's 2012 amnesty — dubbed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy — which printed 800,000 work permits for illegals during the extended post-2008 recession.
Yet the question, always, is, Compared to what? That is, what's the plausible alternative to el-Sisi and his heavy-handed ways? It's worth recalling that el-Sisi, while no democrat, is a vast improvement over what came before—namely, the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, the Brotherhood was so scary that back in 2013, when el-Sisi seized power, even the Obama administration praised the move.
Is she the chief economist? Who is she? I'm confused, he said. Then following a brief pause, he said it was a joke.
Graham's promised support for emergency powers would be valuable because the House and Senate can jointly override any emergency declaration by the president. Graham chairs the Senates judiciary committee.
As for why America's financial industry and intelligence agencies have overestimated China's growth potential, Eberstadt said that it's the easy temptation to think that tomorrow is going to be just like today plus two percent. Growing in a straight line. But straight lines don't happen in history when you actually look at it, he said.
Criticism of the supreme leader is punishable by up to two years in prison.
A significant majority of French now support banning the radical Salafist sect of Islam, and the government reinstating the national state of emergency, as the nation reels from another deadly radical Islamic terror attack in March.
The document added: They received no training to help them make such judgments. Some local authorities were concerned that the Home Office applied its 'benefit of the doubt' policy too readily, and highlighted the risks of wrongly placing an adult with children in their care.
If this sounds familiar, it is because it is basically the monetary policy advocated by Donald Trump in the years when he was regularly criticizing the Fed for raising rates.
We've come a long way … we're starting to put the pieces together, he added with evident pride.
Senate Republicans signaled they would reject the idea of simply voting to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Trump, as Trump himself has suggested. McConnell agreed he does not have the votes to do that.
That only adds to the mystery of why the Hellfire bungle or theft occurred, why it was kept under wraps for so long, and why it is surfacing now. Maybe some of this story manipulation is intended to make the Hellfire in Cuban hands seem like a bigger deal than it really is, to distract bad actors and give them a distorted impression of where the cutting edge in American missile technology lies.
Alternatively, one might speculate that increasingly accessible and affordable private care is making couples more comfortable with accepting the risks and hardships of childbirth. State-run clinics in Russia don't sound like a very welcoming environment for accepting stork deliveries as Reuters describes them.
However, the document went on to say that When resources are insufficient, decisions need to include a broader view on what is ethically fair for the wider community (society).
That is a total reverse of most of the history of this country, he said.
Deutsche Welle reports the country's government will also seek to cap the number of new asylum seekers at 37,500 this year compared the 90,000 it accepted in 2015.

Myanmar's army has just recently completed most of the job of genocide and ethnic cleansing of Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine State, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee for their lives to neighboring Bangladesh, where they are trapped in refugee camps. Myanmar's army began committing atrocities including torture, rape, beatings, and slaughter, burning down entire Rohingya villages, targeting the Rohingyas, as early as 2011. But they crossed the line into full-scale genocide and ethnic cleansing after an August 25, 2017, attack on Burma police outposts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), killing 8 policemen. At that point, Burma's army began full-scale clearance operations, sending hundreds of thousands more Rohingyas into Bangladesh.
Schaeuble's meeting with Mnuchin comes after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration criticized Germany's trade surplus.

Breitbart News reported that California's Bureau of Cannabis Control projections that legal marijuana industry would grow at about the same 28 percent compounded rate as the roll-out of Internet broadband access in the 1990s, resulting in state and local tax collections of $1 billion in 2018 spiking to $3 billion by 2021.
Trump suggested over the weekend he might prefer simply dismissing the charges rather than giving legitimacy to charges from the House, which he considers a hoax.
The report said that since 2016, the repression in Tibet has continued and intensified, resulting in the further detention of monks and nuns and severe restrictions on freedom of expression and belief as well as on other human rights.
The Jan. 6 nuclear test has led to another push in the U.N. to tighten sanctions. North Korea in 2013 also did a nuclear test and then unnerved the international community by orchestrating an escalating campaign of bombast, including threats to fire nuclear missiles at the U.S. and Seoul.
Utah's Mitt Romney also is arguing that the government should let states import cheap labor.
Asked who told her to smuggle the Tunisian into the UK, she replied, I don't even know if I was in that Facebook group. I told my friend (the one I was going to give supplies to) she said there was an emergency. A pregnant Syrian woman. She asked me to help her get to UK. Her [boyfriend] was in UK. She and some others paid for [the lady] to stay in a guest house as she was poorly. She'd hurt her leg whilst trying to board a lorry and was about 8 months pregnant. My friend, let's call her Clare, knew I was going to Calais with supplies. She asked if we would bring the girl home on our return as the person who was supposed to had bottled out. Obviously I was shocked and said it was up to my husband. We did it because she was pregnant.
The governor did not mention anything about fines.
On the issue of overall satisfaction, 41 percent say they are say are satisfied, while 58 percent are dissatisfied. This is the first time since 2005 that number has crept over 40 percent.
The case was always designed to go to the Supreme Court and now it will, he said. It's high time that the justices end the 40-year error of interpreting the Constitution to allow universities that accept public funding to use racial preferences in admissions decisions.
For the roll call, all but one Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, voted to transmit the articles. All Republicans voted against. One former Republican-turned-independent, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, joined Democrats.
EDITOR'S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.
Tlaib is one of several Democrats involved in the Justice Democrats, a group associated with newly-installed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), which seeks to advance a left-wing policy agenda and to replace white, male Democratic incumbents with more diverse candidates.
The numbers will become a border crisis if Biden follows through on his campaign promise to remove Trump's border reforms, Morgan added. You take that ability away and that 2,500 [arrivals] a day becomes a crisis overnight. That's what concerns us.
But Democrast will not budge until they feel more pressure from supporters and voters, she said:
In their essay, O. Carter Snead and Mary O'Callahan note that Indiana law HEA 1337 mirrors those passed by Ohio, Louisiana, and North Dakota and that several other states have introduced analogous bills.
President Trump on Wednesday also asked the media to name the White House official who said Kung Flu, but the name had not been made public as of Thursday morning.

Google told CNBC that they have maintained strong relations with universities and research institutes, ever since it was created from the minds of ex-students of Stanford's Computer Science Department, and that they have always valued their independence and integrity. They went on to explain that they are happy to support academic researchers across computer science and policy topics, including copyright, free expression and surveillance, and to help amplify voices that support the principles of an open internet.
It seemed like a good idea at the time, Brill remarked. What Ralph Nader and his lawyers did was, there were some discount pharmacies in Virginia who wanted to advertise their discount prices. To us consumers, that's a good thing. We'd see that you could buy the drugs at a discount price somewhere.

TEL AVIV, Israel – The Syrian army's recent victories over the Islamic State will foster cooperation between Syria and the U.S., despite the latter's reticence, a Damascus official told Breitbart Jerusalem.
I think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach, he said. Paul Ryan, who is supposed to be helping President Trump get through his agenda in the House of Representatives and the congress more generally, should have known better. He either didn't, which justifies removal on the grounds of incompetence, or did – in which case I think the argument is that he's simply not a reliable partner for the president in getting this agenda done.
That's a critically important thing, Abrams noted. The whole US government takes its cue from the relationship at the top.
In a recent article titled Facebook, Twitter Solicit Outside Groups, Often on the Right, to Referee Political Speech, the Wall Street Journal notes that social media firms such as Facebook and Twitter consult with outside groups in order to develop their policies surrounding political speech on their platforms. Although it appears the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have begun reaching out to some conservative groups for at least some semblance of ideological balance, the articles most illuminating revelation is about Twitter's blacklisting of Laura Loomer.
United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer says President Donald Trump's commitment to economic nationalism changed the way people think about China as free trade globalists admit their failures.
Hayden said it would be probably a low-probability shot if North Korea actually launched a nuclear missile at Seattle, but stressed there was an inexorability about their developing the capability.
Writing in the Daily Press, supervisor Lovingood made clear his belief that empowering the people to protect themselves is a good place to start in the fight against terrorism.

Months ago, Breitbart News reported the district-by-district breakdown of Orange County's enormous foreign-born populations, which have aided the Democrats' electoral sweep in the region.
We all need to reject racism, disrespect or brutality in speech and action, he said, adding that racism occurs when we ignore the fundamental truth that, because all humans share a common origin, they are all brothers and sisters, all equally made in the image of God.
Meanwhile, plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, reduce legal immigration levels, and implement mandatory E-Verify to reduce illegal competition against American workers have stalled.

Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut.
Donald Trump's DHS has taken two steps to speed the delivery of 86,000 foreign graduates into American grads' jobs:
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News during a conference call Wednesday that he thought the next defense secretary needs to be someone who agrees with Trump on ending unnecessary wars.
On either grounds, I think that it would be necessary for the country, not just for the Trump presidency but for the country, to have leaders in both the House and the Senate who want to ensure that the president's projects, the president's agenda, the president's promises to the American people – which I think were momentous, not just for health care reform but in so many other respects, including the return to the prospect of peace through strength, which if course is near and dear to my heart, and I think yours Raheem – is going to be a necessary condition going forward, he argued.
Crowder's producer Jared Monroe then uploaded the video again, with potentially offensive words censored, but also received a Twitter suspension:

Norway's Labour party will look at introducing a third gender category if they are voted to power in the general election due to take place later this year.
Fox LA reports that Lovingood wants citizens to get concealed carry permits, and he wants to see a change in policy at county offices that will allow county workers to volunteer to become authorized to carry concealed weapons as well. And it appears many San Bernardino County residents are thinking the same way. For example, Waiting times for concealed carry permits in San Bernardino County have spiked from 3 months before the shooting, to more than a year, due to the flood of applicants.
Sessions proclaimed that current immigration policies are not serving America's interests in his address after being introduced by First Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy McCormick of the Eastern District of Virginia. For a permanent fix … of our immigration laws, Congress needs to act, he said, moving to address the new framework, which has come under fire from immigration hawks in the congressional GOP.
Add to that the number of people who are travelling to Europe to join family members who are already in the continent, and we can expect to see one million new arrivals from Syria if the current trend contines, Mr Blanche said.
The network is also limiting non-essential travel and asking its employees to limit large meetings and not bring visitors into the New York office, according to a memo sent Wednesday by NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin.
So now we know that the FBI report of Clinton's 'interview' is incomplete and that Peter Strzok may have details on the classified briefing of candidate Trump that were used as pretext for a spy operation. No wonder the FBI had been stonewalling the release of these emails.
Trump has already made several concessions, and Democrats have not moved from their no-wall stance.
And for those elected officials who want to engage in life-affirming legislation, Millennial voters are listening when you compassionately address the specifics of Life in law, she added.
The student, Caitlin Jeffers, claims that Professor Scott instructed students to avoid using gender-specific language at the beginning of the semester. Jeffers claim that she wished to test the policy to see if Scott would actually lower her grade on an assignment due to the use of gender-specific language.
On a much larger scale, from businesses and entire nations, the hard choice of living within one's means has been rejected by short-sighted voters who seemingly aren't doing the math or thinking of the implications beyond just a few years.
Kolfage said the dream team that's been assembled is working with people on the border to achieve border security that the federal government has failed to put in place.
But with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday's violence in DC, we're taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration, continued Facebook.
Revised phrasing will be applied to new pre-recorded announcements made across the network.
Not for the first time, you've misled me by asking me to come in and talk about the referendum but instead wanting to talk about me… If you had told me that I was coming in to discuss me, I would have said there are much bigger issues that the British public are occupied by than six, or however many voxpops you had.
Analysts and officials are expecting the economy to level out this year.
The Republican Party more closely aligns with my beliefs in a less interventionist government. Democratic Party policies can be too costly and restrictive on citizens. Lowering regulations helps protect people's individual rights with private property, business and investments. Increasing taxes and creating or adding to government agencies are not a guaranteed solution to any problem.
The memo makes the case for plugging leaks wherever they be found., Rogin wrote.
Here's what we think happened. The original video that went out didn't have the word f*ggot soft bleeped. The original video was immediately pulled from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook as the studio team added bleeps for the offensive content. After the bleeps were added into the video, the studio re-uploaded the SXSW undercover video back to YouTube and Facebook.

The article claimed that the FBI was aware Mr. Steele was creating these memos as part of work for an opposition research firm connected to Hillary Clinton. The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for President in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI's independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration's use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends. It is additionally troubling that the FBI reportedly agreed to such an arrangement given that, in January of 2017, then-Director Clapper issued a statement stating that the IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. According to the Washington Post, the FBI's arrangement with Mr. Steele fell through when the media published his dossier and revealed his identity.

We recognize that they are a blessing to America … the dreamers are all over our country, Mr. Speaker, they are a blessing so across the board … These are the best of the best. They are so fabulous … I was impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on their country. Each of them with their individual contribution to the greatness of America. So exciting, so proud of them … [They have] great humility about conveying their stories because when you see them and they tell their stories and the passion and the pride — the patriotism, passion, pride, patriotism, that they demonstrate, you will see why anyone who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our dreamers, understand why they have had such a high reputation among the American people. some of whom have met them, some of whom have heard about them, some of whom have just catch the spark, catch the spark. Recognize, recognize again the hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of America.

In that same book, Dawkins expressed his contempt for Catholic education in particular. Asked to comment on publicized cases of child abuse by Catholic priests, Dawkins replied that as horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the long-term psychological damage of bringing the child up Catholic in the first place.

It's worth keeping in mind that el-Sisi's government must fight a low-grade war against murderous Islamist radicals; just on December 29, terrorists killed three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian tour guide. In response, the Egyptian military struck back, killing 40 alleged terrorists. The situation in Egypt certainly isn't pretty, but so long as his country is under siege, what else can el-Sisi do?
The trade preference program, known as Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP), grants to Myanmar the right to export goods to the E.U. without paying tariffs. The GSP Everything But Arms (EBA) status allows Myanmar to sell any goods except weapons tariff-free into the E.U. The GSP privilege was granted in 2013. Exports from Myanmar to the E.U., especially in garments and foodstuffs, have risen tenfold in the past five years.

Shares of Amazon, which have not yet become collateral damage in the Data Debacle, rose 2.69 percent, bringing its market cap up to $768 billion. So for the first time, Amazon is worth more than Alphabet. The only public company worth more is Apple.
Despite the negative effects of December's increase, minimum wages in the city are set to increase again by another two dollars at the end of 2017.
The report notes: In our view, a Brexit will not result in an outflow of millionaires from the UK. On the contrary, we believe that wealthy UK citizens are more likely to stay in the UK if there is a Brexit. This view is backed up by the fact that most of the wealthy British people we interviewed voiced concern over the UK's open border policy with Europe.
For nearly a decade, Pelosi clung to hopes of a return to power from her perch as Minority Leader–the head of the House Democrat Conference–but nearly was denied the opportunity when her massive unpopularity forced Democrat candidates to pledge opposition to her Speakership candidacy in exchange for support from the public.

This is what Washington, Adams, and the Founding Fathers fought for and dedicated their lives to. They were creating a republic based around the idea of ordered liberty. Washington was undoubtedly a great man, but knew that to establish a grand republic to survive the ages the new country would have to thrive without the perpetual need for great men wielding unlimited power in high office.
According to a Hadashot TV news report, if the tunnel were to blow up under the crossing, hundreds of workers in the area could die or be injured and there would be major damage to aid trucks carrying medicine, food and fuel. The IDF said that Hamas was sabotaging the humanitarian efforts that Israel is making for the citizens of Gaza and added that the Hamas terror organization repeatedly chooses to harm the welfare of Gaza residents.
The U.S. military confirmed a military exercise by Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers over the South China Sea Thursday, a move that prompted Beijing, which illegally claims most of the sea, to remind Washington that it remains vigilant before U.S. exercises.
Eagles are attempting to eject @Jeff_McLane from the press box because he objected to being yelled at by an Eagles media relations staffer — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017
What we're talking about is a new blacklist, Volokh said. One of the things that's troubling about the National Association of Realtors' position is that it is trying to deploy the organized economic power of this group in order to suppress dissenting political views among members.
This is part three of a three-part series. Read part one here and part two here.
Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019

The 60 Minutes interview is not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has struggled to explain how she would fund $40 trillion in entitlement programs she is proposing.
It strains credulity to believe that, regardless of his Brooklyn pedigree, Sen. Schumer, who is a Harvard-educated lawyer, Senator minority leader, and vocal opponent of both Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, did not intend to choose the exact words he spoke as he turned and pointed to the Supreme Court behind him to further emphasize his point, the NLPC's complaint reads. In short, his non-apology is a lame excuse for inexcusable conduct.
Erick Erickson, a conservative blogger and radio host who called Donald Trump a racist and fascist in 2016, also said that those involved in the discord at the capitol should be shot.
Bromund saw the State Department as a less than optimum choice for implementing congressional instructions since State actually has very little to do with Interpol coordination. He reflected that the United States tends to treat Interpol as what it actually is—essentially a global bulletin board for the police—and uses law enforcement agencies to interact with it, whereas China and some other members view Interpol as a political entity and use political and diplomatic agencies to deal with it.
Welby's latest Mideast intervention follows his call earlier this week for bridges to be built between Christians and Jews to help fight the rising tide of global anti-Semitism, as Breitbart Jerusalem reported.
The poll found that, while 56 percent of American millennials – now the largest voting bloc in the country – are political Independents, 65 percent want to vote on abortion policy, compared to only 16 percent who want abortion to remain in the hands of the courts, and 19 percent who are unsure.
At the same time, they'll bang the drum of 'rule of law' and 'taxpayer accountability' and yet simultaneously be marketing to a population of families that we might speculate that some of their top donors don't want them marketing to, she added.
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, the same dean who pushed dropping the term master in favor of faculty dean, instructed the Honor Council to help carry out enforcement of the penalty against students participating in both single-sex social groups and leadership positions on campus. In January, after faculty criticism of the policy, Khurana created a task force to address the criticisms and reconsider the policy.
At the ceremony, which took place at a military training base in Northern China with 7,000 PLA troops and 300 armed vehicles, Xi reportedly inspected his troops and ordered them to strengthen combat readiness and put military training in a strategic position, as well as their overall capability to win.
Trebisht residents who said they consider themselves Bulgarian spoke to AFP in Albanian, but said they spoke Bulgarian at home with their families.
As we reported last month, there is a parallel development in progress. Djibouti's strategic port at the entrance to the Red Sea is the Doraleh Container Terminal. A Dubai firm, DP World, had been operating the terminal since 2006, when DP World had signed a 30 year contract.
The document reportedly says the duration of the 'transition period' should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes.
Williams said that he has not seen any official plan being worked on by House Republican Leadership or the White House, but he has offered his input to the Trump Administration. He noted that he had also testified for the Ways and Means Committee, chaired by his good friend Rep. Kevin Brady, about the Jumpstart America tax plan.
China has once again escalated its massive military occupation of the South China Sea by deploying offensive anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles systems. The missiles are being deployed on the artificial islands that China constructed in violation of international law, as the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that all of China's activities in the South China Sea are illegal.
In response to a court order in a Judicial Watch case, Clinton declared under penalty of perjury that she had directed that all my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or are potentially federal records be provided to the Department of State, and on information and belief, this has been done.
Perhaps the most shocking example to date was Meng Hongwei, the former head of the Interpol international law enforcement agency, who vanished while returning home to China from a trip to France and reappeared as a prison convict a few months later, sentenced to 13 and a half years in prison on charges of bribery. His wife believes Meng was another victim of the endless anti-corruption crusade that serves the CCP as a rolling political purge.
Trump's motorcade will travel amid cheers from a battery of carefully picked and vetted Modi loyalists and workers from his Bharatiya Janata Party who will stand for hours alongside the neatly manicured 22-kilometer (14-mile) stretch of road to accord the president a grand welcome on his way to the newly constructed stadium. Tens of thousands of police officers will be on hand to keep security tight and a new wall has come up in front of a slum, apparently to hide it from presidential passers-by.
3. Britain insisted the Geneva Convention applied in a similar case in 2007. As PBS reported at the time.
The Philippines' FDA has yet to approve any coronavirus vaccines for the country's citizens and has not yet set a timeline for when Filipinos will receive the injection.
Chinese military personnel are using high-grade blinding lasers to target American pilots and American military crews flying over Djibouti in northeast Africa (the horn of Africa), according to the Pentagon.
Combine that with what they want to do with open borders, sanctuary cities, and defunding the police, Perdue said. Explain to me how that makes our cities safer. If you want to see what Georgia would look like, and you've said this before, under a Democratic regime in Washington, just go to California. Look at the anarchy in the streets of Portland, Oregon, today. Atlanta is now tied with Chicago as the murder capital of the world on a per capita basis. This is not something Democrats will own up to, that they do not want to talk about, so he is pandering to that Latino community and my question is the same thing I would ask the African American community: What have they done for you lately? President [Donald] Trump has just passed tremendous things that help both communities. We passed opportunity zones, which brings millions of dollars into these economically challenged areas in both the Latino and the African American communities. We've funded HBCUs, our historically black colleges and universities, and we passed a criminal justice reform act that we've been trying to do forever to correct the Joe Biden bill from 1994. The Latino community is smarter than these Democrats think. We did very well with them in the general election and we're going to do well with them on Tuesday. We've just got to get all Republican voters out on Tuesday. It is absolutely essential that every person who's concerned about the future of America must hold the line here.
Pence remarked how important the men and women who serve in U.S. Health and Human Services are and thanked them for their service.
Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said the new policy was important, but even more important is to end our open door policy and not let so many refugees into the country in future.
There are clear signs that solidarity rapidly decreases in societies with a high proportion of immigrants, he said.
TrumpStore.com and the Trump campaign's Shop.DonaldJTrump.com, which sold Make America Great Again hats and other Trump-related merchandise, were both offline today following the events at Capitol Hill.
I just want my mother, she continued, after she regained her composure. Dozens of people are still seized. We even didn't have water to drink.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
The Jobs, Jobs, Jobs bus tour will carry on through the Iowa caucuses and head to New Hampshire ahead of the state's February 11 primary. Parker is hopeful that they, during the bus tour, will have the opportunity to interview some of the Democrat candidates and discuss some of their policies.
People are suspicious. Ronald Reagan is held up as a hero in Texas — except for the Simpson–Mazzoli [1986 amnesty] bill … where President Reagan was promised 'Give us the amnesty today and you'll get your border security tomorrow. There is a fear that Congress will promise [security] and not deliver — people need to see something tangible. That is what the wall is to them.
On January 18, triple deportee Saul Bustos-Bustos, 38, and Irepan-Juanchi-Salgado, also from Mexico pleaded guilty to federal drug charges after a sting on November 28, 2017.
Turning to enforcement to prevent further illegal immigration, Sessions trumpeted President Trump's signature campaign promise – the wall – which is included in the administration's framework. He said:
The dovish economic outlook pushed the U.S. Dow Jones Industrials up 74.23 points to a new 2016 closing high, and sent the VIX cost to hedge market volatility to its lowest level since early December.
I'm going to have a Secretary of Education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf, and only if this person believes that our Secretary or Secretary of Education nominee is absolutely committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone will that person actually be advanced to be Secretary of Education, the senator told supporters at a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Two weeks prior, Warren vowed to ensure transgender women aren't in the same prisons as men if she is elected president.

In another email exchange on September 2, 2016, FBI agent Stephen Laycock tells Strzok and Moffa that the meeting referenced in the previous exchange on September 2 relates to the project. FBI Congressional Affairs Chief Jason Herring is looped in and reveals that the meeting involves alleged foreign hacking activity.
The plan would cut poorer and working-class Americans completely out of the U.S. labor force by replacing them with foreign workers.
They should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.
In no way would a fourth-hand report from a Maltese professor justify wholesale targeting of four or five members of the Trump campaign. It took Christopher Steele, with his funding concealed through false campaign filings, to be incredibly successful at creating a vast echo chamber around his unverified, fanciful dossier, bouncing it back and forth between the press and the FBI so it appeared that there were multiple sources all coming to the same conclusion.
Mihai only stopped attacking her after her husband caught up with him, leaving their infant child in the care of others at the bus stop, forcing Mihai off his wife and punching him in the face. Mihai then fled and waited to be arrested by the police at a nearby garage whilst his sister-in-law was taken to hospital for treatment.
Roll Call explained the dynamics behind the new Democratic-controlled House:
7. Let the engineers design a barrier that works. The wall should not be a Democratic or Republican issue. Nor should it be a budget issue: Democrats are fighting over a mere $5 billion, when their own budget bill spends tens of billions more in excess of White House requests on other items, including foreign aid. The wall — or fence — is little more than an engineering problem. We should let experts make their recommendations about what kind of physical barriers to build at each point along the border. Let the engineers do their job — and let's put America first.
President Donald Trump has made strengthening the military a priority in his administration, including in 2017 reserving military service to men and women based on their biological sex and not their gender identity.
The Propel Center will help cultivate leadership and drive innovation in tech and beyond, acting as a springboard for change in communities across America, Ed Farm founder Anthony Oni said in a statement.
NBC News writes in its account of Facebook's decision:
ICE has 37,000 people caught in detention, and only a small percentage should be kept in detention, he suggested. In fact, only a small percentage of those in ICE detention have been convicted of a violent crime. Many have never even been charged with a criminal offense. ICE can quickly reduce the detained population without endangering our communities, he wrote.
It said he was taken to the Foreign Ministry, which later released him.

The writer ended his piece urging America to stop shaming people for their religious beliefs and for articulating those beliefs in public.
In secret U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, U.S. officials openly discussed Iraqi efforts to reach out to Soleimani to stop rocket attacks on the highly secured Green Zone in Baghdad in 2009. Another cable in 2007 outlines then-Iraqi President Jalal Talabani offering a U.S. official a message from Soleimani acknowledging having hundreds of agents in the country while pledging, I swear on the grave of (the late Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini I haven't authorized a bullet against the U.S.
Breitbart News Daily is the first live, conservative radio enterprise to air seven days a week. SiriusXM Vice President for news and talk Dave Gorab called the show the conservative news show of record.
Among the issues about which CTU has complained is that the district has not developed a full coronavirus testing and contact tracing program. The union said teachers who did return to school as ordered also noted problems with cleanliness, safety protocols, ventilation and more.
Biden's meeting included Xavier Becerra, his nominee to lead Health and Human Services (HHS), who as California attorney general has implemented one of the strictest sanctuary state policies in the nation — even going as far as to say the state would prosecute employers who cooperate with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
Continuing the 'transition' for an extended period could stop Britain from striking trade deals and keep its borders open, as the document contains no mention of Theresa May's promise to stop Free Movement after Brexit day.
According to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioids alone, including heroin (15,950) and drugs like fentanyl and its offshoot carfentanil (29,418) killed more people (about 49,000) than terrorist attacks across the globe in 2017, which left 26,400 individuals dead.
The move comes as Democratic Party (PD) Chamber leader Graziano Delrio announced that the government would be looking at reintroducing the protection system for asylum seekers and refugees (Sprar) that had seen its centres closed and defunded by the security decree of former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.
U.S. small-business optimism unexpectedly slumped in December to a seven-month low as owners grew increasingly concerned about the new economic policy of the incoming Biden administration and the spread of coronavirus infections triggered renewed restrictions.
Price said that the CBO report looked at a portion of our plan, but not the entire plan, according to a pooled press report from the White House.
The Chronicle claimed migrants have a right to enter American's homeland even if they need Americans to pay for their healthcare, and suggested that President-elect Joe Biden would probably reverse Trump's move:
U.S. Ambassador to London Woody Johnson has hailed Britain's departure from the European Union, reaffirming President Trump's enthusiasm for a free, world-facing United Kingdom and a future trade deal.
She also attended her swearing-in accompanied by radical Linda Sarsour, the Women's March leader who has come under criticism for antisemitic comments and for her organization's ties to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.

Rector pointed out that a nutritious meal of rice and beans cooked at home provides around 2,200 calories for each dollar of food spending; by contrast, a Big Mac provides 138 calories for each dollar spent, as well as a lot of unhealthy fat. Traditional food stuffs are far cheaper per calorie than fast food. All-purpose flour provides 4,717 calories per dollar; rice provides 3,599; rice and beans, 2,178; peanut butter, 1,750.
Encouraged by her lawyers from the ACLU, G.G. demanded the school allow her to use the boys' bathrooms and locker rooms at the same time that biological males are using those facilities. The school board instead adopted the policy that everyone must either use facilities matching their biological sex or single-person unisex bathrooms.
The Massachusetts senator plans to move fast and is committing to announce her Cabinet choices by December 1, 2020 — less than a month after the election. She also promises to announce top nominations by December 15, 2020, and fully staff all senior and mid-level White House positions by Inauguration Day.
Q. Mr. President, on the DACA wall, a bigger immigration deal, are you saying you would only consider a broader immigration agreement after you get the wall money? THE PRESIDENT: No, I would do it simultaneously, but I'd like to see them move fast. The nice part about the wall, or the barrier, is I can have that worked out — in 15 minutes we can start construction. We're already building. But now we would be able to carry the construction through. We actually have a fantastic design that's going to be efficient and fast and really, really work well.
He is completely anti-enforcement, not just in terms of blocking fraud investigations, but [is] utterly opposed to enforcement, Jenks said. He believes that the job of USCIS is to hand out green cards, period.
We are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at Apple, said Cook.
The three countries, which signed the international agreement in 2015 along with the United States, Russia and China, informed Borrell, who supervises the pact, in a letter that they are triggering its dispute mechanism, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic.
The Tennessee law will expressly prohibit the use of so-called free speech zones to limit the areas of campus on which certain viewpoints can be heard. University administrators are prohibited from rescinding the invitations from students or faculty of speakers with whom they disagree or fear will cause disruption.
Trump's diplomacy in the region appears to be gaining speed. As Netanyahu spoke to the AIPAC conference by video from Jerusalem, White House envoy Jason Greenblatt was headed to Jordan to attend an Arab summit, according to a U.S. official who wasn't authorized to discuss the trip publicly and requested anonymity.

The brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. They break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. For all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.
Of course, Xi has to leave that option on the table, but he makes clear it is not his preference, she said.
The things that the economy values become things that these knowledge workers do, he said. The lawyers figure out strategies for corporate takeover fights instead of strategies for corporations to employ more workers and make new things. They figure out strategies for stock buybacks. They figure out derivatives, which as you know ended up completely crashing the economy. The people behind it were not held accountable. The people who lost their homes were the ones who suffered and who lost their jobs.
A California woman is suing Walmart, claiming that the store's policy to lock certain products subject to a higher rate of shoplifting inside glass cases is racist.

TRUMP: A lot of people will have this, and it's very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don't even see a doctor … So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. – Fox News interview Wednesday.
What began as a small protest over the Texas bathroom bill grew to a 75-person Queer Dance Freakout on the street in front of the historic Texas Governor's Mansion. The troupe protested a bill in the Texas Legislature that would require men and women to use bathrooms and dressing rooms designated to the sex on their birth certificate.
Citing previous impeachment efforts in the House that fell short of authorizing inquiries, McConnell pointed out that Democrats had tried to impeach President Trump for being impolite to the press, for being mean to professional athletes, [and] for changing President [Barack] Obama's policy on transgender people in the military.
Without much to go on, Stars and Stripes theorized Abe might have been alluding to a mission last spring where a Japanese helicopter carrier escorted a U.S. Navy vessel to resupply one of the warships protecting Japan from North Korean missiles. That seems a bit less remarkable than what the prime minister alluded to, or perhaps that mission was more exciting than previously reported.
The Namaste Trump rally will be, in a way, the back half of home-and-home events for Modi and Trump who attended a Howdy Modi rally in Houston last year that drew 50,000 people.
The cheap-labor policy has also reduced investment and job creation in many interior states because the coastal cities have a surplus of imported labor. For example, almost 27 percent of zip codes in Missouri had fewer jobs or businesses in 2015 than in 2000, according to a new report by the Economic Innovation Group. In Kansas, almost 29 percent of zip codes had fewer jobs and businesses in 2015 compared to 2000, which was a two-decade period of massive cheap-labor immigration.
He and others argue that California can add to its storage capacity relatively easily — not just by building new dams, but expanding existing ones, such as the Shasta Dam, one of the major reservoirs in the federal Central Valley Project, which supplies water to farmers hundreds of miles south.
Support for President Donald Trump among American farmers is on the rise, according to a new poll released this week.
Authorities under these men arrested Meu Peou when he was just a boy. The state claimed he betrayed the hardline communist cadres by stealing rice. He lost over seventeen relatives during the regime. His father starved to death because, as a Muslim, he refused to eat pork.
The ruling makes clear that the Biden administration must move swiftly to rescind all of President Trump's xenophobic presidential proclamations, including this health care ban, Sung said in the Chronicle report. Countless people have been hurt by this ban, and each passing day keeps families needlessly separated.
These stringent calls for tougher border policy appear to have ceased since Donald Trump took office as President of the United States.
It´s a state scandal, said Jean Rottner, president of the Grand-Est region of eastern France, where infections are surging and some hospitals are overwhelmed. Getting vaccinated is becoming more complicated than buying a car.
Today we will make history, Pelosi said as she signed the documents, using multiple pens to hand out and mark the moment. This president will be held accountable.
This growing use of this Green Card Workforce is ignored and misunderstood by the largely powerless white-collar reporters in the corporate media. Many media companies — such as the Washington Post — are owned by firms or investors who want to grow the Green Card Workforce. Other white-collar reporters choose to view the visa workers via the lens of progressive immigration politics, even though the H-1B workers are foreign contract workers who replace white-collar Americans and who do not become immigrants until they receive a green card.
But they have also trafficked in more apocalyptic predictions — fears of a Eurabia, of mass Islamification — that were somewhat harder to credit. Until recently, Europe's assimilation challenge looked unpleasant but not insurmountable, and the likelihood of Yugoslavian-style balkanization relatively remote.
Constant political campaigning by the NUS, which is affiliated with around 600 student unions accounting for more than 95 per cent of higher and further education unions in the UK, has led thousands of students calling for their universities to break ties with the far-left organisation.
While Germany and France are uniting to create progressive-globalist union, nationalist and populist groups are working to reshape the EU into a Europe of independent nations ahead of European Parliament elections in May, with right-populist Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini meeting with Poland's conservative leadership in Warsaw on Wednesday.

In a recent article titled Google Nears Win in Europe Over 'Right to Be Forgotten', the Wall Street Journal notes that advisers to the European Union's Court of Justice have argued that search engines such as Google should not be forced to comply with the E.U.'s right to be forgotten rule which allows European citizens to request certain links or information be removed from search engines when their name is searched.
The Senate voted 152-76 in favour of removing the legal protection that had shielded the chief of the anti-immigrant League party, giving magistrates the go-ahead to charge him with abuse of power and illegal detention.
In October, Trump announced that he was readying a plan to end the country's birthright citizenship policy whereby the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are rewarded with American citizenship despite their parents having arrived unlawfully.
Zakaria noted that, in a recent essay about the collapse of the liberal international order, Karganov said that Hillary Clinton was viewed, particularly negatively as a symbol of liberal interventionism, of neo-conservatism, of a kind of expansionist American foreign policy that tried to maintain America's kind of central status in the world.
This is a basic measure that should have been in place for decades. Anyone who has studied these issues understands that, by bringing in these changes, the government is making history, said the minister.
We're not necessarily being singled out by those tech companies, but certainly by the people who have been putting pressure on them and, in fact, we think we're being set up in a lot of ways because in looking at some of the content, these are accounts that have been created two days ago and they have few pieces of content and some of them are parodies of what you would think a right-wing inciter of violence would be.
The report additionally lays out a path to recognition for social groups transitioning from single-gender to co-ed status, creating a temporary provisional social organization designation for clubs who reconstitute themselves with new characteristics and new goals. According to the document, which can be read in its entirety at The Harvard Crimson, must maintain non-discriminatory membership requirements and practice local governance and autonomy.

If SCOTUS removes Blaine amendments from the arsenal of anti-school choice advocates, what will the unions and their cohorts have left? Claims that school choice drains public school funding have been disproven many times over, and parents who want to send their child to a better school—one that is not decided for them based on their ZIP code—can hardly be expected to care about financing the failed school they've chosen to abandon.
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) has also published a model bill that is being considered by state lawmakers. FIRE is largely positive about the Goldwater bill, while it points out some differences:

1) The Simpson-Mazzoli Act — passed almost 30 years ago to the day Trump was elected president — came with elaborate promises that it would put an end to illegal immigration. In fact, 30 to 40 million more illegals have poured into our country since then.
Our policy remains the same: Over-preparation and not under-preparation and above all, caution and not hysteria, the prime minister said.
Adelson rose from poverty to success in business, and served in the U.S. Army. He was raised as a Democrat, but became a Republican over time, and was well-known as a Republican megadonor, the single biggest individual campaign donor in recent election cycles.

Johnson had delayed his entry into the EU referendum campaign, missed his moment when he unexpectedly won it, and hesitated to move against May when fellow Tory Brexiteers had begged him to move against her — he had even voted for May's turd deal on her third attempt to get it through Parliament, fearing, like many Brexiteers, that if he did not accept her fake Brexit then the Remain establishment in Parliament would ensure there was no Brexit at all.

Lincoln unhesitatingly defended these ideas at Cooper Union as he brilliantly and eloquently positioning himself as the leader of their movement.

As American lives and our economic sovereignty continue to be risked to ensure a free flow of oil for countries that do not share our interests, the time for action is now.

In her 1979 essay, Kirkpatrick never claimed that human rights and democracy were unimportant; she simply argued that the American national interest was more important. Indeed, it's worth noting that in recent decades, some authoritarian allies of the U.S.—including South Korea, Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—have evolved into functioning democracies, and those countries are stronger as a result. So yes, it's possible for our friends to improve and for the Free World to expand; it's just that the process must be handled with the utmost care.
Some of the other signers–and others who pledged to oppose Pelosi but did not sign the letter, which was circulated by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY)–are still in opposition to Pelosi.

Biden has repeatedly said he will support men's claim to female identity and women's claim to male identity.
But users quickly encouraged her to remove the post and cover up her crime, stating: It can be five years in prison. Be careful. And delete this before it incriminates you.

Ken O'Keefe, who attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship in 2001 , last week debated freelance journalist Philippe Assouline on the Iran nuclear deal.
it still remains to be seen what happens on the floor of the House on Thursday afternoon, and anything could go wrong for Pelosi before the vote happens, but for now it looks like she maneuvered her way through this rebellion and completed one of the biggest political comebacks in history against all odds.
At press time Friday, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed 31,527 cases of novel coronavirus. Of those, 638 people have died, all but two within China. The government also claimed another 1,568 people have fully recovered from the infection.

On the issue of abortion, labels like pro-life, pro-choice, access, health, or women's rights often camouflage the true realities of the policies that today crisscross the country, she said.

I feel that [people who claim to be neither male nor female are] a movement. When the country's largest party backs [creating a third gender option], I expect we'll see all the other parties following suit.

It could happen slower or faster, but if Assad is going to stay where he is, then obviously countries in the region are going to try to make the best of that situation, said Aron Lund, a fellow with The Century Foundation.

Marlow highlighted Bolton's recent New York Post editorial calling for the Trump administration to name and sanction Iranian terrorists and terror-supporting institutions.
País was an anti-Batista operative largely considered the mastermind of the overthrow of the president. País was killed at age 22, just as the ideological rift between himself and Fidel Castro, who had fled the true battle against Batista in the cities to impress the New York Times with a Sierra Maestra camping trip, began metastasizing.

Early the next morning, from his vacation home in Kauai, Hawaii, Zuckerberg held a phone call with Sandberg, Bickert, Clegg, Kaplan and other executives. Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, was on the call, along with Neil Potts, the public policy director for trust and safety policy, and Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams, among several others. Zuckerberg said he had decided that Trump's attempts to incite violence and undermine the democratic process were grounds for an indefinite suspension. No one voiced a dissenting opinion, the people familiar with the call said. Shortly thereafter, Zuckerberg published a Facebook post explaining that the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.
Over the past year, Sweden has also had problems with abuse in underage migrant homes.

U.S. and Irish politicians are quietly cooperating to transfer 5000 white-collar jobs per year from American graduates to Irish grads via the E-3 visa program. A sneak Senate vote is due soon.

This makes a nonsense of Johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. Of course it won't. There is plenty of evidence to support Heymann's claim. None to support Johnson's.
A precise continuous line will split the Gulf of Tonkin between China and Vietnam, go south into waters claimed by Malaysia, take a U-turn to the north along the west coast of the Philippines and finish at the southeast of Taiwan.
But Americans need a more nuanced policy that preserves enforcement while suppressing the disease among the mixed U.S. and illegal populations. It needs to be made clear that to get tested, you don't have to show proof of legal residency, and if you need to be hospitalized, you will be, regardless of legal status, he said.
The May 2016 policy presented the opportunity for our group to critically think and converse about our place on Harvard's campus and collectively determine our path forward, Menon added. The formation of The Fleur is the culmination of numerous discussions spanning the last two or so years within Harvard's Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma and with the administration. [Administrators] have helped shape the path we as a group have chosen to pursue.
Price said that the CBO report looked at a portion of our plan, but not the entire plan, according to a pooled press report from the White House.
Regarding China's one-child policy that former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping instituted over three decades ago, Eberstadt said that while lots of people were talking about the liberalization of China and the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping, the heart of the society—the basic unit of society is the family—and the claim that the government has the right to decide how many babies parents have is much more totalitarian than anything that Lenin even planned.

Corporate earnings are being propped up by rolling (refinancing) their debts into lower and lower rates, and borrowing to buy back outstanding shares. If a firm can purchase 10% of their outstanding stock, then earnings get a nice boost without them ever having to increase sales.

The immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.

Veteran Sir Patrick McLoughlin leaves cabinet after eight years, serving under May and Cameron, and has previously served in John Major and Margaret Thatcher's cabinets.
Pelosi seems to suggest the legislature is the most important because it comes first under Article I, but the president has some leeway to act independently, especially in national security and foreign policy, and the courts can overturn legislation.
Putin crowed that his policies would take care of people and increase human capital as Russia's most important resource in December 2016. He told his parliament he expected human capital to blossom so much that Europe and the United States would lose their ability to prod Russia with sanctions.

Breitbart News Editor at Large Peter Schweizer explained at the Breitbart News Masters of the Universe town hall event how individuals responsible for censorship at major technology firms may not even be senior employees.
This foreign labor force, which is dubbed the Green Card Workforce, is often preferred by executives because the dangled green cards ensure that the foreign workers will work long hours for lower wages. In addition, the workers have no legal protections in the workplace and have no professional authority to disagree with CEOs, who can also gain personally when Wall Street welcomes each outsourcing decision.

In the end, Nintendo's decision reflects nothing more than their prerogative when assessing an employee's compatibility with the image they want to present to the world. It's unsurprising that Nintendo as a family-centric brand would want to separate itself from an individual who has claimed that child porn constitutes free speech and believes that sexual consent laws for children should be loosened.
I think that is why there is a bit of a lag there. I think we need to do much more about the culture of white working class in this country.
WASHINGTON D.C. — Socialist Latin American nations and small Caribbean island states that benefit from Venezuela's oil supply have expressed disdain towards U.S.-backed efforts by the Organization of American States (OAS) to find a solution to Venezuela's political and humanitarian crisis, reminding member states of the international body's non-intervention policy.
On Wednesday, the ACLU praised the Census Bureau's stopping their count of the illegal alien population.
The articles of impeachment before us were not even the first ones House Democrats introduced. This was go-around number seven. Those previously-alleged 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors' included things like being impolite to the press and to professional athletes. It insults the intelligence of the American people to pretend this was a solemn process reluctantly begun because of withheld foreign aid. No, Washington Democrats' position on this president has been clear for years. … Here's their real position: Washington Democrats think President Donald Trump committed a 'High Crime or Misdemeanor' the moment he defeated Secretary [Hillary] Clinton in the 2016 election. That is the original sin of this presidency: That he won and they lost.
In a statement to the media Tuesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English had sent a letter expressing regret over the harm the resolution had caused to ties between the countries.

The GoFundMe campaign shows that people are not only willing to cast their votes for this cause; they are also willing to give their hard-earned money to it. The President cannot afford to back down on his promise to build the wall. The American people want it. They know that it will work. And if the politicians in Washington won't do it, patriotic Americans will try to do it themselves. They are doing so at https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall.

The protest surrounds Senate Bill 6, the Texas Privacy Act, filed by State Senator Lois Kolkhorst (R-Brenham).

President Trump has often stated that Obamacare is in a death spiral under which healthcare premiums continue to skyrocket. He has promised to repeal Obamacare.
By the time Fidel Castro rode victoriously into Santiago, the prevailing belief (including among the island's business leaders) was that Castro's overthrow of Batista would lead to democracy and free elections. Col. Haza believed democracy was Cuba's destiny and stood with Castro on a stage soon after. But it became evident that Castro neither believed in nor would support democracy; Col. Haza withdrew his support. Within a few days, Col. Haza was forced into a dark cow pasture where he and 70 other prisoners were executed under the direction of Raul Castro, Fidel's younger brother and now Cuban president.

Ehrlich prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans), that already-overpopulated India was doomed, and that most probably England will not exist in the year 2000.
This huge economic change will impose a huge psychological shift among Democrats, plus their billionaire and media allies, who have persuaded themselves that voters really want business groups to get an unending stream of cheap-labor in the hope that the cheap-labor will also vote Democratic. Many Democrats have already started their journey with shock on November 8, 2016, but it just takes time for people to work their way through denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, and eventually, acceptance and renewed hope. A DACA delay will help Democrats get through the bargaining stage, prior to guilt in summer, anger in November, then depression in Christmas and acceptance in the Spring of 2019. 9. Delays are not a primary problem because the 3.25 million 'dreamers,' including the 700,000 'DACA' illegals are foreigners and their interests are simply less important than Americans' interests, regardless of any deadline. Few of the illegals will be deported in 2018, partly because enforcement officers are chasing the many criminals protected under Obama's deputies. But if Trump's American First policy is to make any progress, he must first start by helping Americans get higher wages before offering the huge benefit of citizenship to foreigners who have jumped the line at the nation's large and generous immigration offices.

WhatsApp was downloaded by 10.6 million users during the same period, a 17% decline. … Millions of people value privacy enough to sustain it, and we're trying to demonstrate that there is an alternative to the ad-based business models that exploit user privacy, Acton said, adding donations were pouring in.
Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press (AP):
Olsen added, Romney was shocked. His pollsters told him he was going to win. They were all prepared to win, but the evidence was there all along that the people who gave Trump the presidency rejected Mitt Romney because he did not share their values.
All week, the media has been full of stories — leaked, of course, by her Deep State enemies in the Civil Service — about what an awful, useless minister Patel is. One egregious rumour claimed that MI5 officials were withholding intelligence from her because they did not trust her. (MI5 has robustly denied this). Other reports have claimed that she is a workplace bully in the habit of swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands.
I don't think they'll even be a European Union in ten years' time. I think that we have set the standard, Mr Farage continued, predicting a mainstreaming of eurosceptic thought on the continent in the next two to three years.
What Johnson's warmed up version of Mrs May's deal did achieve was MPs' agreement that, with the country essentially without a government heading into 2020, a general election should be held.

That means today, 102 Americans died while the Democrats were blocking consideration of this bill, Cruz said.
This growing use of this Green Card Workforce is ignored and misunderstood by the largely powerless white-collar reporters in the corporate media. Many media companies — such as the Washington Post — are owned by firms or investors who want to grow the Green Card Workforce. Other white-collar reporters choose to view the visa workers via the lens of progressive immigration politics, even though the H-1B workers are foreign contract workers who replace white-collar Americans and who do not become immigrants until they receive a green card.

Transportation emissions overall make up the largest share of U.S. climate-damaging emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, air travel pumps out about 3% of overall emissions of climate-destroying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Surging growth of air travel in Asia and around the world means those emissions will triple by 2050, the United Nations says, and recent studies say even that figure underestimates the explosive growth of air travel and its emissions.

Though the United Kingdom has left the Dublin III Regulation, it has not secured an agreement with the EU or any individual country in the bloc as for the return of illegal immigrants following Brexit.
Washington came into office as a great man: the hero of the American Revolution, a great warrior, general, and leader who had also made himself wealthy through hard work and shrewd business practices at his Mount Vernon plantation. Having already willingly resigned his commission to the Continental Congress at the end of the Revolutionary War, he ended any discussion of military dictatorship for the new country. Washington was aiming for something much higher than being simply one of history's great commanders and conquerers.
The process is, when you charge them enough, they're not going to send it anymore, it's a very simple process, he said.
The Bialowieza forest includes some of Europe's last primeval woodland and has been granted protected status by the UN heritage organisation.
On the one hand, you're telling hospitals to use their allotment by the end of the week or face a fine. But on the other hand, you're telling them if they mess up the prioritization they could also face a fine. Are those competing principles there and is that in any way slowing down the vaccination process?
For his part, Pullman has never concealed his disdain for the Catholic Church, or for Christianity more broadly.

Since being declared the winner of the 2020 contest, Biden has moved quickly to name the senior members of his cabinet. The quick pace has been a result of a desire of the incoming administration to immediately tackle the dual crises of the novel coronavirus pandemic and its economic fall out.

What will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.
Is this the way the EU will work post-Brexit? The Brits are just out and we're already missing their open market-oriented approach, the diplomat went on to say, adding: If Germany weighs in too much, smaller EU countries have nothing to say.

President Trump may be genuine in not wanting war with Iran, Price said. At the same, it is fair to say that he doesn't seem to understand the implication that an action like this could foretell.
[The Tennessee law] is the most comprehensive state legislation protecting free speech on college campuses that we've seen be passed anywhere in the country. It is gratifying to see the Tennessee legislature take decisive action to protect the expressive rights of students and faculty, especially in light of the number of restrictive speech codes across the country and the recent controversies over speech on campus.
The Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.
Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), who called for Pelosi to step aside in a CNN op-ed and was one of the most public organizers of the seemingly failed coup attempt, also flipped and backed her candidacy.

The Intercept report sheds light on why national security officials were so troubled by Kushner's meeting at the time with bin Salman, who reportedly told confidants that Kushner had discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince. Kushner's attorney's spokesperson denied that Kushner had such discussions.

His opponent, Assouline, calls O'Keefe's comments amusing and a cartoonish fantasy. He also says that O'Keefe needs a psychologist.
The controversy surrounding Hunter Biden's wheeling and dealing in Ukraine is at the center of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Congressional Democrats claim that the president committed a crime when he suggested Ukraine look into how Hunter Biden secured his position with Burisma.

Dr. Everson Hull, the representative for Saint Kitts and Nevis, stressed constraints in the form of OAS policies that allegedly prevent the international body from intervening in chaos-ridden Venezuela.
Thursday's court ruling involved his October 2019 proclamation denying visas to immigrants who did not have health insurance and could not show that they would obtain it within 30 days of entering the country. Immigrants could receive Medicare and be allowed to remain, but those who planned to obtain coverage under the low-income Medicaid program or the government-subsidized Affordable Care Act would not be eligible. Advocates for immigrants say Trump's proclamation would bar entry to nearly two-thirds of all otherwise legal migrants, those who obtain their entry visas from employers, U.S. relatives or an annual lottery. The ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, if it becomes final, would allow Trump's order to take effect for the first time. But attorney Esther Sung of the Justice Action Center, one of the legal organizations challenging the policy, said that under the court's standard timetable, the ruling will not be binding for 52 days. That would be well past President-elect Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden has promised to undo his predecessor's anti-immigration policies as soon as possible. A federal judge in Portland blocked Trump's proclamation from taking effect in December 2019, saying it exceeded the president's legal authority. Panels of the appeals court twice denied emergency orders that would have let Trump enforce the ban during the court proceedings. But a different panel of the court ruled 2-1 Thursday that the president's broad powers over immigration include the authority to limit entry only to those who can afford health insurance.
On the one hand, you're telling hospitals to use their allotment by the end of the week or face a fine.

$12 billion more for international affairs programs, including $2.9 billion more for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review.
Biden, likewise, has tapped other Democrat elected officials with little direct policy experience for top cabinet posts. One of the most notable of such appointments has been California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human services. Becerra, a former long serving congressman and ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has raised concerns from many over his lack of expertise on health-related topics.
And when he got divorced [from first wife Jane Wyman], it was very hard for him to accept. He kept thinking for awhile that they would get back together again. But Ms. Wyman, whom I didn't know, but I've heard from others who talked to her, just, he was consumed with politics 24-7. He was the head of the Screen Actors Guild for example. He was very liberal, he was very involved in politics, and then he made the transition to becoming the kind of typical conservative of his time. Divorce in those days was almost a lower s scandale. People didn't get divorced. They covered it up. I think he was very conscious of that. He came out of a strong Protestant background in the Midwest. He was part of that culture. His mother was a huge influence on him.
Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.
In addition to salary concerns, however, some young men express concern about perceptions that male teachers are not trustworthy and that the choice to become a teacher is an indication of homosexuality.

During Mayorkas' tenure, he oversaw the inflow of more than 2.5 million Mexican and Central American migrants into U.S. jobs, apartments, and schools. Most Mexican migrants have been sent home, but the vast majority of Central American migrants remained in the United States — and so encouraged a huge migration in 2019.
Bolton conceded these complex issues are not well-suited to 45-second answers in these serial press conferences we call 'debates,' so presidential candidates would have to use other venues to bring the voters up to speed.
On January 8, after Trump's national address, Pelosi downplayed the northward flow of economic migrants. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.

Abrams called for a floor fight at the Republican convention in 2016, to remind Trump how many in the party oppose and even fear his nomination, warned any Republican with future political aspirations to avoid becoming Trump's running mate, called for a purge of Trumpians from the GOP after Hillary Clinton's inevitable 2016 victory, and suggested running a third-party spoiler candidate to ensure a crushing defeat for Trump.
The solution to all of this is to stop the manipulation of interest rates and begin the painful reversal by beginning to live within ones means. Stagnation is the best we can hope for going forward. The longer this game of manipulating interest rates go on, the larger the future problems we will have to face. No one likes pain. No one likes change. Nevertheless, those days of whistling past the graveyard have passed. If we act now, the hope of living through this, rather than it crumbling all around us, increases exponentially. We must face reality and own up to our obligations by paying our debts. We must accept responsibility for our misguided collective mindset of choosing to have our cake and eat it too—the philosophy that has led us to this point and that we can no longer afford to indulge.
In reality, the virus had never before been identified in human beings until November 17, 2019, in Wuhan, China. There is no evidence of the virus existing anywhere else before that day.

Joe Biden understands that [immigration] is an irrefutable source of our strength. Generations of immigrants have come to this country with little more than the clothes on their backs, the hope in their heart, and a desire to claim their own piece of the American Dream. It's the reason we have constantly been able to renew ourselves, to grow better and stronger as a nation, and to meet new challenges. Immigration is essential to who we are as a nation, our core values, and our aspirations for our future. Under a Biden Administration, we will never turn our backs on who we are or that which makes us uniquely and proudly American. The United States deserves an immigration policy that reflects our highest values as a nation.
The California Democrat also expressed praise in serving as Speaker of the most diverse House of Representatives in the history of our country, with a record-shattering 122 women.

I'm tired of being criminalized. I'm tired of having police being called on me, I'm tired of having to come here every day, share my stories, having to cry every day because I can't contain this emotion, this exhaustion.
Even putting aside the risk of acquiring Covid on set – a risk that we have done a great deal to mitigate through our safety protocols – on-set production always poses some risk of injury, whether because of a stunt gone wrong, an equipment failure, or a garden-variety fall. Right now, with few, if any, hospital beds available, it is hard to understand how a worker injured on set is supposed to seek treatment. I would like to thank the JPC and the PGA for their efforts to reinforce safety measures for all, and we acknowledge and appreciate the major studios and other producers who have proactively stepped up and postponed their production during this emergency.
Channel stuffing has led to numerous corporate scandals in the tech world.

Apple has stated on conference calls that that its plan is to sell 4 million iPhones per week and carry five to seven weeks of inventory. But a 5.3 million increase in channel inventory indicates Apple has a significant shortfall in customer sales.

We ask help from anyone, from all countries of the world, because the threat of terrorism is not just in the Philippines, it's a worldwide concern. So if countries want to give whatever assistance they could and they want to, it's welcome, a spokesman for President Duterte said, while insisting the request was not inconsistent with Duterte's aspiration to develop a more independent foreign policy.
Sheldon was the love of my life. He was my partner in romance, philanthropy, political activism and enterprise. He was my soul-mate. … He was an American patriot: a US Army veteran who gave generously to wounded warriors and, wherever he could, looked to the advancement of these great United States. He was the proudest of Jews, who saw in the State of Israel not only the realization of an historical promise to a unique and deserving people, but also a gift from the Almighty to all of humanity. And Sheldon was kind. He gave readily of his fortune to charitable causes that may literally be countless, as he expected no credit and often preferred anonymity. Although bluff in build and speech – and, in the last two decades, beset by painful sickness – Sheldon was always sensitive to the needs of others.
I would hope that is something that will continue in the new administration, Manchin added. I think the Biden administration will be very open to working with USCIRF and all of the groups involved with religious freedom.

For whatever faults you want to find about the [Trump], or you don't like his style about things, he's the only guy that that points out problems, and then Republicans come along and say, 'Oh, okay, yeah, this is a problem,' and then they start to address it, Hurt remarked. I really do mean that. I get why people don't like his style, and I get that there are good Republicans, good conservatives, who don't like him, but this is what it's all about.
The statement is the latest by the Koch network in which they have indicated strong opposition to the Republican Party's growing economic nationalist base that catapulted President Trump to victory in 2016 and helped a number of House Republicans win their seats in the 2020 election cycle.
One smuggler said it was his patriotic duty to help get the migrants over the border into Europe, as their presence was slowing down the Turkish economy… https://t.co/YKc6f3gcrD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2020
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) during a press conference Friday called for a special counsel-like figure to examine what Hunter and Joe Biden did in Ukraine.
The event, which was highlighted by Robby Soave at Reason Magazine, took place at the end of April and was hosted by the student group, Georgetown United Against Police Aggression.
And she really shouldn't be underestimated. She has youth on her side: imagine the damage she's capable of doing between now and the time she's Nancy Pelosi's age! And, as Laura Perrins notes here, she knows how to exploit her beautiful woman privilege to the max:
Federal law permits schools to provide separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers 'on the basis of sex,' as long as the school provides comparable facilities for 'each sex,' the memo says. Therefore, we believe the plain ordinary public meaning of the controlling statutory and regulatory text requires a recipient providing 'separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex' to regulate access based on biological sex,' says the memo.
Stanford's Fundamental Standard policy ensures that no student will be discriminated against on the basis of their sex. Students are expected to respect and uphold the rights and dignity of others regardless of race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or socio-economic status, the policy reads.
The current law says that people who win green cards can become citizens and vote in just five years. Prior legislation also set a multi-year delay — around eight years — between an amnesty and the receipt of green cards.
After a violent government takeover on Friday, Turkish newspaper Zaman has published its first print edition: an ode to Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's infrastructure projects and the Turkish soldiers fighting Kurds in the nation's south.

The rocket, fired from North Korea's west coast and tracked by the governments in South Korea and Japan, came about two hours after an eight-day launch window opened Sunday morning. It follows North Korea's widely disputed claim last month to have tested a hydrogen bomb. Washington, Seoul and their allies will consider it a further provocation and will push for more tough sanctions in the United Nations.
Bolton agreed with Bannon that the American people have not been well-prepared by their political leaders to understand the enormous strategic significance of the South China Sea, or the true scope of China's ambitions. He laid the task of providing that perspective, and rallying public support for whatever American counter-moves are necessary, at the feet of the next President.
I noticed all of the African American products was locked up under lock and key, Grundy said at a press conference spearheaded by activist lawyer Gloria Allred.
More than a million migrants have arrived in Europe by sea or air over the last twelve months, swarming in from the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia in a bid to begin a new life in the west. Many more have headed west from the Balkan states, leading to Germany registering more than one million asylum claims alone during 2015. Sweden and France have also seen high levels of immigration.
There's no broad recognition of [migration-caused wage cuts] at all, Tom Jawatz, the vice president of immigration policy at American Progress, a leading progressive advocacy group, told Breitbart News on December 28.
Tsai, meanwhile, has insisted on respect for her nation's self-governance. In a speech in January, Tsai condemned Beijing for going back to the old path of dividing, coercing, and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan. For the sake of safeguarding regional peace and prosperity, I want to once again reiterate that our commitments will not change, and our goodwill will not change. But we will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation, she promised.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been extremely critical of Trump's impeachment by the House and Democrats have accused him of planning to oversee a sham trial in the Senate.
But intermittently tighter rules unluckily blocked his attempted returns in 2013. And in 2018, President Trump's consistent crackdown gave him 30 days for his felony re-entry.
We need clarity. Everyone must know that it is a false hope to think that Germany would simply wave people in, he told Die Welt daily.
What's at stake here is absolutely critical. We are holding the line here for the country to maintain a balance of power, Perdue said. If you look at what we have to do, it's simply to get our vote out. Five million people voted in November. There were nefarious activities that went on allegedly, and we have done a lot to add to the integrity of that by putting poll watchers in and we've got cameras on these drop boxes, so on and so forth. We're doing everything we can to make sure every vote is counted legally and accurately on Jan. 5. But what we've really got to do, we've only gotten 3 million out to vote so far. That's off from where we were in November — I think some 3.6 million had voted already by this point in November. So we've got a ways to go but we've got to get our vote out. We also know that Republicans win on election day. If there's any Republicans out there, any conservatives out there, any independents or libertarians out there who haven't voted it, they owe it to their children and grandchildren to help us hold the line against this radical socialist agenda. That's what's at stake here, pure and simple. I know that sounds like trite words, but this is not the typical election where you can just correct it in two or four years. If these things get done, we will not be able to help self-correct this.
Far less than one percent of Americans try to live as members of the other sex. For example, only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.
In addition to admitting that he confirmed some of the Medley analysts non-public information, Lacker also said that he did not initially tell the Fed's investigators that the analyst was in possession of that information during the call. Instead, he only disclosed this fact in 2015 when he was interviewed as part of the investigation by federal prosecutors, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
He said, 'Gen. Petreaus, you should know that I, Qassem Soleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan,' Petraeus said.
They plan to march on the 7th March, and say they are not worried about how many people turn out as they are after action, not publicity. The situation in Calais is known to all, what we want is a strong policy response, they commented.
On April 12th, 2019, Hunter came into my shop with three liquid-damaged machines. One was a complete write-off. [For] the other one, I actually loaned him a keyboard because he just had inoperable keys, so he couldn't log in. … The third one was not a complete write-off. It needed some surgery done. and all he wanted was data recovery, so he contracted me to recover the data off of that third machine, which I did and called him the next day when the recovery was complete.
She has made no comment on the particulars of the second job she held as being compatible or not with Nintendo's corporate culture, however, which involved racy photo shoots, including one that appears to feature one of her now-former employer's products.

But Biden's opposition will allow men to registers themselves as women in the military's records as women. Once that change is made, female service members would have to submit to the men's demands to be addressed as women in accommodations, promotion, fitness requirements, and the showers.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News during a press conference call on Wednesday that there remains no appetite for a potential Mitt Romney run for president in 2020.
It is nothing more than a symbol when you look at it in this perspective, Bustos said during an interview on CNN's New Day, in reference to President Donald Trump's proposal for a wall. If we have a partial wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our borders safe, all of that is fine. But it has just become this symbol that the president is not going to have any give-or-take when it comes to this $5 billion.
Washington decided to pressure Saudi Arabia to negotiate with the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, he said, after they realized that Al-Qaeda is gaining from the ongoing conflict between the Saudi-backed government and the rebels.

He not only wants to give them amnesty, but he said he wants illegals to be able to vote, Perdue told Breitbart News. He doesn't see anything wrong with undocumented people in this country voting and having access to benefits. He has said he will give a blanket amnesty. So, what does that say to the millions of people who have come to our country and gone through our immigration protocol properly and done it the right way and earned their citizenship? I know hundreds of people who just here in Georgia did that and they're outraged by his position because it totally denigrates what they did. The second thing is it's a threat to the American worker right now. We've got a situation where we've got to grow our economy and we've got to get over Covid [Chinese coronavirus], and a blanket amnesty just opens the door.
As educators we want all children to be able to achieve their best in exams that are so crucial to their future, she said. We shall continue to raise awareness of best practice and how education staff can support students during Ramadan.
However, the 1 in 5 statistic – spread widely by the Obama administration through its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – is wildly at odds with the official crime statistics, said American Enterprise Institute (AEI) resident scholar and former philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, in a fact-check video:
I received 127 corpses yesterday [February 3], and burned 116. Among them, 8 were confirmed [coronavirus cases] on the death certificate and 48 were suspected, a funeral home director in Hubei using the pseudonym You Hu told the newspaper. I am about to collapse, we are under great pressure now.
We are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world — and these new projects send a clear signal of Apple's enduring commitment. We're launching REJI's latest initiatives with partners across a broad range of industries and backgrounds — from students to teachers, developers to entrepreneurs, and community organizers to justice advocates — working together to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long.
Citing economists Orlando Ochoa and José Guerra, Venezuela's El Nacional reported in March that the Maduro government counts on the support at the OAS of small islands of the Caribbean that benefit from the supply of Venezuelan crude oil.
The White House and Pompeo have also noted that, while the United States was ready for the meeting, North Korea failed to make adequate preparations for the unprecedented event.
Half of the 3.5M blue-collar migrants who crossed from 2014-2019 are still in the U.S., says DHS data.
Pompeo told the crown prince that his Middle East journey, which has taken him to Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, had been good so far. I want to talk to you about a couple of places we've been. We think we learned a lot along the way that will be important going forward, he said. The prince replied that the Saudis would try to add more positivity, as much as we can.
Over the past week or so, we had reports of strong growth and rising wages (good things!), which sent bonds and stocks down (bad for most investors) due to justifiable fears that the Fed will tighten faster than is priced in the credit markets. The surge in growth and wages came because of both the fiscal stimulation and the rekindling of animal spirits, thrusting the economy into late-cycle capacity constraints, which is leading to the expectations of faster Fed tightening. In other words, fiscal stimulation is hitting the gas, which is driving the economy forward into the capacity constraints, which is triggering interest rate increases that are hitting the brakes, first in the markets and later in the economy. This confluence of circumstances will make it difficult for the Fed to get monetary policy exactly right. This is classic late-cycle behavior (when it's difficult to get monetary policy exactly right, which leads to recessions), though it is more exaggerated because the durations of assets are uniquely long, which means that when interest rates are low, prices of assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than when interest rates are high.
Joe Biden understands that [immigration] is an irrefutable source of our strength. Generations of immigrants have come to this country with little more than the clothes on their backs, the hope in their heart, and a desire to claim their own piece of the American Dream. It's the reason we have constantly been able to renew ourselves, to grow better and stronger as a nation, and to meet new challenges. Immigration is essential to who we are as a nation, our core values, and our aspirations for our future. Under a Biden Administration, we will never turn our backs on who we are or that which makes us uniquely and proudly American. The United States deserves an immigration policy that reflects our highest values as a nation.

The advancing state of European Union militarism is surprising, perhaps, given the strong terms in which the claims that plans were on the table were dismissed, or simply laughed off, by pro-Brussels EU loyalists in the pre-Brexit vote era. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, one of the chief cheerleaders for the EU in Britain — and now a top Facebook executive after the unceremonious end of his political career — infamously belittled Nigel Farage on stage during a debate in 2014, accusing him of holding a dangerous fantasy when the Brexit leader cited a future EU army.
How that happened is one for the ages: All of a sudden, when she opposed Pelosi, a letter she wrote seeking a lenient sentence for a Cleveland-area disgraced former judge convicted of beating his wife resurfaced. The timing could not have been better for Pelosi: that same judge had just been arrested on suspicion of brutally stabbing his wife to death after release from prison on the domestic violence charges for which Fudge sought a more lenient sentence for him. The judge has since been formally charged with his wife's murder, and pled not guilty, and Fudge's nascent bid for the speakership ended before it even took off. She dropped out of the running, took a token subcommittee chairmanship, and then endorsed Pelosi for speaker.
Before even taking office, Biden is being lobbied by corporate interests and factions of House Republicans and Democrats to drop U.S. tariffs on China in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Likewise, U.S. companies that make their products in China overwhelmingly say they are optimistic about Biden's presidency.
Pompeo concluded by addressing the administration's efforts to secure the freedom of Americans held by Middle Eastern countries, prominently mentioning Iran and former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared there 11 years ago. He included a reference to Egypt's refusal to pay the medical expenses of American tourist April Corley, who was severely injured in 2015 when Egyptian forces mistakenly bombed her tour group. Military aid to Egypt has been delayed over Egypt's actions in the Corley case:

Migrants are kept locked inside stash houses near the Mexican border until their journey to the U.S. interior can be scheduled. Often, they are beaten and held for ransom as cartel-connected human smugglers attempt to extort additional money from family members.
The capital city Kinshasa is very tense right now. There were almost full-scale riots in December 2016, but the Catholic Church intervened and quieted the situation. If CENI continues to delay announcing the election results, or if it announces that Shadary is the winner, there may be widespread riots again.

Australia, Japan, and South Korea were described as the backbone of effective opposition to Chinese ambitions in the Pacific, provided their capabilities and will could be strengthened sufficiently, while closer U.S. relations with other regional powers like the Philippines and Thailand were recommended to strengthen their role in upholding a rules-based international order.
The debate now appears to be about when, not whether, to re-admit Syria to the Arab League. At a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri said Syria's return to the League is connected to developments on the political track to end the crisis. Some officials in Lebanon insist Syria should be invited to an Arab economic summit the country is hosting next week, although final decision rests with the League.

A restaurant worker in Billings, Mont., Ms. Eixenberger, 22, has been laid off three times during the pandemic and was so in need of cash by October that she had to drop out of dental hygiene school. After donating plasma and doing odd jobs, she still didn't have enough to pay her bills, so at the suggestion of some friends, she turned to OnlyFans. She has made only about $500 so far. … Elle Morocco of West Palm Beach, Fla., was laid off from her job as an office manager in July. Her unemployment checks don't cover her $1,600 monthly rent, utility bills and food costs, so she joined OnlyFans in November. … She has made just $250 on the platform so far, despite sometimes spending upward of eight hours a day creating, posting and promoting her content. Ms. Morocco also worries that her presence on the platform will make it more difficult for her to be hired for traditional jobs in the future. If you're looking for a 9 to 5, they might not hire you if they find out you have an OnlyFans, she said. They may not want you if they know you're a sex worker.

Congress took a huge step forward today, sending the message to the president and the country that Muslims and other communities of color are welcome here. Now that the bill has passed out of committee, we look forward to its swift passage in the House without any further changes. We must end these bans and prevent presidents from using rank prejudice to discriminate against Black and brown people.
The European Union has defended its decision to plough through with the deal by likening the supposed concessions from China made in the EU agreement with the phase-one trade deal signed by the Trump administration. Brussels has argued that the deal represents the bloc's strategic autonomy.
Following his February 10 use of a concealed carry handgun to stop a stabbing at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, Didarul Sarder is scheduled to receive an honor for heroism from Warren Mayor Jim Fouts.
Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple, said Schumer, When we use phrases like 'undocumented workers,' we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose.
The TV tax is compulsory for anyone who watches live or records live television or uses BBC iPlayer. Payment is mandatory even if you watch live programming on a computer, phone, or other device and even if you watch live television from other providers but do not watch BBC programming at all.

Johnson had also agreed that Britain, unlike, say, Norway and Iceland, would continue with more or less the current fisheries arrangements for at least five-and-a-half years, with British fishermen on their knees from decades of EU plunder receiving only a meagre increase in their quota share, phased in little by little over the course of this new transition.

The country should be sanctuary for Americans, she concluded.
That was the observation made by callers to Breitbart News Tonight shortly after both addresses. It was a contrast that illustrated the difference between the parties — and how thoroughly Trump routed his rivals.
Italy has a long and bitter history with European Union interference in their politics. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was toppled in 2011 as a former European Union commissioner and economics professor Mario Monti was installed as his technocratic replacement after the Union decided the country had not been run to their satisfaction.

Maguire had been a favorite to be nominated for the permanent DNI post but Trump soured on the official, The Washington Post said, when he heard about the classified election security briefing.
It's really not difficult to read between the lines here. Rutnam – and his fellow civil servants – tried to frustrate Patel rather than help her. Patel wasn't having this and made her displeasure known. This then enabled the Civil Service to pretend that the issue was Patel's workplace bullying rather than its own institutional sclerosis and incompetence.

A significant 86 per cent of Austrians surveyed in a snap poll on Sunday night support their country continuing independent action to deal with the migrant crisis, without the guidance or agreement of the European Union (EU).
The poll was conducted between December 22 through January 6 and came after President Donald Trump announced in mid-November he was reducing the U.S. troop presence to 2,500 in both Afghanistan and Iraq.
Hoyer said, Our position is we have to stop using the shutdown of the people's government as a strategy to obtain our objectives.
Unsurprisingly, much of the tension in the new security assessment comes from the clash between Russia and Western powers over Ukraine and Crimea. As Russia sees it, the West supported an anti-constitutional coup in Ukraine (a reference to the ouster of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych), which led to a deep split in Ukrainian society and the emergence of an armed conflict, transforming Ukraine into a long-term source of instability in Europe and on Russia's borders.
England's first state-funded Muslim secondary schools – that segregated boys and girls and had books promoting domestic violence and marital rape – is to be taken over by the Government.

Serving as chief ideologist, he is believed to have played an integral part in shaping the Maoist regime's radical thinking. Prosecutors say Nuon Chea was one of a small group behind policies that drove city residents into forced labour and starvation in the countryside, and used systematic violence against perceived enemies of the regime. …. During his time in office, Khieu Samphan was the public face of regime and accompanied overseas diplomats on official visits. Like Nuon Chea, he is accused of helping sculpt some of the regime's deadliest policies as one of its top leaders. He publicly endorsed taking measures against the enemies of the revolution in a way that suggests knowledge and support of the policy of executing purported enemy agents, Stephen Heder and Brian Tittemore wrote in their book, Seven Candidates for Prosecution.
It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts, the company added.

In the end, Nintendo's decision reflects nothing more than their prerogative when assessing an employee's compatibility with the image they want to present to the world.

The Grenfell Tower disaster is uncomfortably similar to a fast-moving blaze at another London-area public housing project, Lakanal House, that killed six people, including three children, eight years ago. In that July 2009 fire, smoke and flames quickly engulfed the 14-story building. A coroner's inquest found that a series of failures contributed to the loss of life and made a number of recommendations to help prevent future disasters.
A third case involved those foreigners who wished to be admitted entirely to their fellowship and mode of worship. Even here, dealing with those who wished to integrate fully into the life and worship of Israel required a certain order, Aquinas observed. For they were not at once admitted to citizenship: just as it was law with some nations that no one was deemed a citizen except after two or three generations.
It was fun and exciting at the same time, you know the thrill of thinking the 'what-ifs,' Clerfe joked. Over the course of 48 hours, Clerfe had traveled from his Iraq deployment, all the way to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, in Monterey, California. He joined his wife, Natalia Svistunova, on New Year's Day. Kuwait, to Turkey, to Turkey to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Baltimore, Baltimore to Atlanta, he recounted. Seven connections, and more than 1000 miles worth of flying time later, he was home.

He reflected that the United States tends to treat Interpol as what it actually is—essentially a global bulletin board for the police—and uses law enforcement agencies to interact with it, whereas China and some other members view Interpol as a political entity and use political and diplomatic agencies to deal with it.
The big reason that having children, and even marrying in the first place, hurts women's pay relative to men's is that the division of labor at home is still unequal, even when both spouses work full time. That's especially true for college-educated women in high-earning occupations: Children are particularly damaging to their careers.
Three of Orange County's four Republican districts that have flipped to Democrat have foreign-born populations that make up 25 percent or more of the region. For example, California's 39th District — where Democrat Gil Cisneros won over Republican Young Kim — has a 34.1 percent foreign-born population.

Talia Jane's rambling complaint, as reported by the Huffington Post, was titled, An Open Letter To My CEO, and posted on Medium. It bemoaned her inability to pay for her $1,245-per-month rent and her lack of food on her bi-weekly $733.24 wage. She also moaned about the company's policy to make her wait one year before she earned a promotion, writing, A whole year answering calls and talking to customers just for the hope that someday I'd be able to make memes and twitter jokes about food.
They come to the house and take the children and accuse them of being spies, stated another source. If the mom cries and gets upset at them, they accuse of her [sic] being a spy too and take her to the jail and later kill her.
Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers considered high-skilled are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. This program gives hundreds of thousands of good white-collar jobs to foreigners instead of young American scientists, software developers, engineers, chemists, graphic designers, investment analysts, and accountants.
CENCO called on the election commission to do the following:
What this new policy will do is encourage companies to only ask for H-1Bs to fill higher salary jobs, not to fill the starter and mid-career jobs needed by Americans, said Kevin Lynn, the director of U.S. Tech Workers. Under her current [lottery] system, we encourage companies to recruit the lower-wage workers, so denying jobs to new U.S. graduates, he said.
That is our flag, which will never be red. It will only be red if it is necessary for our blood to keep her green and yellow, he concluded.

Major League Baseball is set to being Spring Training on February 27.
Last week, Ankara broke the 2015 agreement with Brussels in which it would stop the illegal flow of migrants through Turkey in exchange for money and continuing EU accession talks, and opened the gates which resulted in thousands of migrants amassing on the near-east country's land border with Greece. The migrants are reportedly from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
Still reluctant to recommend countries self-isolate to lessen the spread of the virus, the European Commission, however, told the EU27 on Monday that Member States may reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public policy, which, in extremely critical situations, may include public health.
The climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in London, where few jobs will be at risk.

China deploys cruise and surface-to-air missiles in South China Sea
On a much larger scale, from businesses and entire nations, the hard choice of living within one's means has been rejected by short-sighted voters who seemingly aren't doing the math or thinking of the implications beyond just a few years.
This horrific act of violence that has now claimed two lives and left a child without her mother might have been avoided if the suspect had been handed over to our officers months ago, Quinones said.
Overall, as of 2005, nearly 860,000 refugees have been resettled across America—a large proportion going to areas that have lagged behind the rest of the country in economic growth since the Great Recession. The incoming refugees have stressed the already depleted resources of state and local governments. The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) estimates that it costs taxpayers more than $64,000 over five years to resettle one Syrian refugee. To resettle an entire family, the cost estimate rises to more than $257,000 over five years.
In late December, China passed a new counterterrorism law aimed at protecting its burgeoning international commercial and diplomatic interests.

Italian newspaper il Giornale — otherwise highly supportive of Salvini's populist Lega party — declared the delay the work of amateurs, noting that new discussions could add days more onto Italy being without a functioning government. The paper, in particular, pointed out the differences between the parties in the key areas of policy, including taxation, immigration, justice, and the European Union.
All three rejected the argument that we could 'just get married'. All three emphasised that the Government cannot maintain the status quo for much longer – they are on borrowed time.

The leaders of Italy's two largest political parties remain in negotiations over the form and direction of a potential coalition government despite assurances made on Sunday that an agreement was just hours away, while European Union leaders in Brussels dictate that Italy should not pursue any radical policy changes.
The jury is out on whether this particular attack should be chalked up as a win or loss (the Washington Examiner describes it as a successful attack, because 101,000 PIN numbers were generated by the hackers), but a raid on IRS systems last year was able to purloin information on 330,000 taxpayers from an agency database containing old tax returns.
He also pointed to President Trump's executive order demanding agencies seek to remove two regulations for each new one they seek. He also touted the long-delayed approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and the role it will play in delivering cheap energy to American business. No matter where you look, President Trump has taken decisive action to get government out of the way so you can do more, create more, innovate more, and grow more jobs, Pence said.
The current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for the Indian-based outsourcing industry. The group's mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to extract salaries and wealth from the U.S. college-graduate class and to split the gains among both countries' executives and investors, as well as with the visa workers.

The Chinese government appears concerned with Taiwan's moves to protect itself from a mainland invasion. State propaganda outlet Global Times published a column Friday warning Taipei to abandon hopes of being recognized as a sovereign nation and instead accept the status China insists it has as a rogue province. No soldiers believe Taiwan forces are capable to defend the island if the People's Liberation Army (PLA) launches a comprehensive offensive against Taiwan, the column reads. As long as the Tsai government accepts of the 1992 Consensus, the island's security will be ensured. The eight-year-tenure of Ma Ying-Jeou is the most secure period Taiwan has enjoyed since entering the 21st century.
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a motion last Thursday to censure Schumer, with the support of 14 other Republican senators.
Even though Biden had previous administration's as a guide, the president-elect chose to depart from that bipartisan tradition when deciding on his cabinet appointees. While Biden has picked respected and well accredited nominees for the four most senior cabinet positions—including former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for treasury secretary and Judge Merrick Garland as attorney general—the rest of his choices are better known for political, rather than administrative accomplishments.

Saxony has become the epicentre of the latest media controversy in Germany after a video went viral showing bus full of migrants who were stopped by local protesters in the small town of Clausnitz. Media reacted by calling the non-violent protesters xenophobic and went as far as saying their slogans of we are the people were inciting hate against migrants.
On Tuesday, shortly after being sworn in, Newsom — who ran on the proposal of providing healthcare to everyone in California, though he struggled to explain how he would pay for it — signed an executive order taking steps in that direction.
Democrats are also using the epidemic to target the White House's public charge rule. Democrats already oppose the rule because it is designed to exclude legal migrants who cannot provide for their own health care.

Every year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants, consisting of mostly low-skilled foreign nationals who are only entering the country because they have foreign relatives already living in the U.S. In 2016, the illegal and legal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.
This is us who becomes the obstacle, said Robert Sanborn, president of Children at Risk. a Houston, Texas, advocacy group for migrants. I worry about all these kids [of illegal migrants] that could be tremendous economic assets for us … they're always going to be underperforming.
Last month, the NBS said China would revise its historical regional GDP data under a unified accounting mechanism to be introduced early 2020.
Rogin also cites unnamed State Department bureaucrats who don't feel that they are able to affect policy through the normal channels due to what they see as lack of communication coming from Trump's and Tillerson's people.
The Trump administration could point to two laws and say they allow officials to proceed with building a border wall without first obtaining explicit authorization and appropriations from Congress, according to Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw the Brennan Center's study and is a co-director of its Liberty and National Security Program. One of the laws permits the secretary of the Army to halt Army civil works projects during a presidentially declared emergency and instead direct troops and other resources to help construct authorized civil works, military construction and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense. Another law permits the secretary of defense, in an emergency, to begin military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces, using funds that Congress had appropriated for military construction purposes that have not yet been earmarked for specific projects.

When asked how to address the critics, particularly the younger voters who are captivated by Sanders' socialist rhetoric, Parker emphasized the importance of highlighting the successes of small business owners.
In a letter to Congress, Chamber of Commerce Vice President Neil Bradley writes that Republicans and Democrats must come together to grant amnesty to about 3.5 million illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Despite Obama having said he would be willing to meet with the NRA in his town hall, Cox dismissed that possibility.
The Commission said that evidence shows that between one and three million Uyghur Muslims have been detained in concentration camps in the Western Chinese province of Xinjiang, known also as East Turkestan by the local inhabitants.
Similarly, Wang Wenbin, a colleague of Zhao's, complained last year that the CBP's prior limitations on imports from Xinjiang were a naked act of bullying against China.

From now on, hospitals will face fines of up to $100,000 if they do not use all their doses within a week of receiving them, Cuomo indicated.
President Donald Trump initiated the appointment of a permanent adviser for international religious freedom to the President's office, Manchin said, a move that would highlight the plight of people around the world who are persecuted for their faith when foreign policy decisions are made.
But ministers cannot be tried for actions taken while in office unless their parliamentary immunity is revoked.
What's more, it is not even Roberts who would be revealing the name; it is the senator asking the question revealing the name. Roberts is merely reading someone else's question, which proves his motives are not only partisan, but one more example of the chief justice fabricating something out of whole cloth to benefit Democrats.
Obama likely would have had a further Republican in his first term-term cabinet if his initial choice for commerce secretary, former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), had not withdrawn before the confirmation process had begun.
In fact, Obama claimed in June 2012 that this is a temporary stopgap measure. By allowing Obama's temporary work permit to remain temporary, Trump is simply implementing the claimed spirit of Obama's promise — even if Obama intended to make his temporary deal into a permanent fixture. 6. Delay keeps Trump's political opponents fixated on their unpoular pro-illegal-immigrant rhetoric throughout 2018, while an amnesty deal instead would give Democrats a morale-boost before the 2018 election — plus the time to shift towards more popular rhetoric, such as stoking fears about government medical care. By refusing an amnesty, Trump helps makes the 2018 election all about the Democrats' noisy and unpopular demands for limitless amnesty. 7. Delay helps Trump's 2018 election turnout. Under Trump's Buy American, Hire American policies, wages are now rising in some cities, perhaps marking the arrival of a wage-boom in the run-up to the 2018 election. The scheduled expiration of DACA will nudge many illegals out of the labor market before November, likely boosting wages for American voters and encouraging the roughly nine million sidelined working-age American men to take jobs. But Trump's support for an amnesty would show that the establishment's cheap-labor policies are King, so deflating pressure on employers to pay higher wages to workers in the run-up to the 2018 election. 8. Delay gives time to Democrats to gradually accept the nation's desire to shift from a high immigration/low-wage economy to a low-immigration/high-wage economy.
McConnell has refused to commit, saying the issue will only be decided after the trial's opening arguments and questioning.
The poll also showed 44 percent support for a border wall and 47 percent opposition to a border wall. Eighty-three percent of Republicans and 13 percent of Democrats support the wall, while 83 percent of Democrats and 14 percent of Republicans oppose the wall.
One example of the progressives' harm to Americans is their quiet support for the flow of child laborers into the blue-collar jobs needed by lower-skilled Americans. In November 2o20, ProPublica reported:

Tom Tugendhat MP, the chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said: The use of abhorrent practices such as the imprisonment and torture of dissidents, mass surveillance, organ harvesting, and the use of slave labour shows the Chinese Communist Party for what it is.
Unsurprisingly, much of the tension in the new security assessment comes from the clash between Russia and Western powers over Ukraine and Crimea. As Russia sees it, the West supported an anti-constitutional coup in Ukraine (a reference to the ouster of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych), which led to a deep split in Ukrainian society and the emergence of an armed conflict, transforming Ukraine into a long-term source of instability in Europe and on Russia's borders.

McClintock is among the skeptics. He told Breitbart News that he has been hearing talk about the Sites Reservoir for decades, and that Californians are constantly told that construction is imminent. But somehow, that reservoir, and others, are never built.
Is the contrary argument that Trump would be somehow giving Kim Jong-un the green light to nuke half of Asia by refusing to respond at length to every missile launch, no matter how half-hearted the provocation? As the Fox News report points out, many analysts believe North Korea is preparing for another nuclear weapons test, possibly during Xi's visit to Washington. Perhaps saving the strong words for that will better convey the seriousness of the new administration's approach.

He said, Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.
Trump's plentiful and sometimes inaccurate comments on the outbreak this past week prompted the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen.

It really was striking for a number of reasons, Wolf. One of these, while we are used to since the days of Ronald Reagan, a president going to the people in the first lady's box to illustrate some sort of policy point or some sort of American note, whether it's honor troops or talking about education, we've never seen … a scholarship given, which is what the president did with the young girl from Philadelphia. We've seen the type of thing where a war hero like Tuskegee Airman Gen. McGee. That was a lovely moment. To have a 100-year-old Tuskegee Airman there with his grandson, who wants to be in the Space Force. President Trump telling a little girl that she's going to get a scholarship, President Trump announcing that there is a solider coming home and reuniting with his wife and children, we've never seen anything like that before.
Tensions between the nationalist-patriotic U.S. president and the globalist-progressive French premier came to a head when in early November Macron called for a real European army to protect the continent from threats from China, Russia, and the United States itself — a NATO ally.

In fact, the nexus between Huawei and the UK began as long ago as 2003, when BT began talks with the Chinese company to provide devices aggregating customer lines and connecting them to the main part of the network. The contract was signed in 2005. Astoundingly, although BT told the Cabinet Office that it was proposing to lock Huawei into UK telecommunications, the civil service 'did not refer the issue to ministers or even inform them until 2006 — a year after the contract between BT and Huawei had been signed', according to the damning words of a 2013 Commons Security and Intelligence Committee report.
In it, Stephens insisted that all of Trump's pro-Israel policies are basically meaningless. Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem; scrapping the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran; reinstating crippling economic sanctions on the Iranian regime; defunding the Palestinian Authority and UN agencies devoted to the perpetuation of Palestinian suffering and hatred for Israel — these are all meaningless gestures, by Stephens's telling.
What may be worse is the Times' campaign to effectively disenfranchise American Jews. The paper undertakes this campaign by using its pages to legitimize antisemitism emanating from the left, delegitimize friends of Jews on the political right, and shame American Jews who stubbornly refuse to abandon Israel, or turn their back on Israel's friends. These American Jews also impertinently notice the galloping Jew hatred on the political left.
A British-American trade deal has been a core part of the Brexit story since before even the 2016 referendum, with the fact that European Union laws and conventions ban its member-states from striking their own trade deals being a sticking point for many Eurosceptics during Britain's membership of the bloc.

Fellow member-states have criticised Germany for ordering an additional 30 million Pfizer/BioNTech doses for itself, as well as 20 million CureVac shots.

Despite protests by progressives and the many businesses, Trump closed the 2015 loophole by creating the Return to Mexico program.

They don't care if civil servants are unresponsive and aren't doing their jobs because they don't depend on the government, he said, citing the example of elite New Yorkers who suddenly became deeply concerned about the poor state of jury facilities after generous exemptions from jury duty were eliminated in the 1990s.
After lawmakers enacted [education savings accounts], teachers unions and other special interests challenged their legality in court, The Heritage Foundation's Lindsey Burke wrote in October 2016. Arizona unions based their suit on the state's Blaine amendment, which prohibits public funds from flowing to religious institutions. In 2014, Arizona courts ruled in Niehaus v. Huppenthal ESAs do not violate the state constitution.
Friday's protest was hardly the first incident of public unrest over vaccines. A smaller and less physical group of parents dared to protest in Beijing over the summer, demanding justice for the victims of corruption and incompetence in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. A series of scandalous revelations rocked China over the past year, with each new outrage erupting as soon as the previous one began to subside. This reinforced the public sense of distrust in both medical companies and government regulators, an attitude most unhelpful to Communist Party leader Xi Jinping's effort to rebrand China as a high-tech powerhouse and triumph of centralized economic policy.

These countries — for the most part — want to be helpful, want to do the right thing, [to] have relationships with the U.S. and are in some cases improving relations, but for a variety of different reasons failed to meet those minimum requirements that we laid out. The only way to mitigate the risk is to impose these travel restrictions.

But the president was annoyed by the presence of Adam Schiff, the Democratic head of the investigation that led to Trump being impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, according to The New York Times.
Bromund, however, argued that it is more a problem of the United States failing to appreciate how actors like China are willing to politicize and manipulate agencies with noble humanitarian charters.
It can be difficult for candidates to invest precious campaign energy on deep issues of foreign policy, even at a time of heightened public concern over national security, but Boton made an excellent point about how those seemingly far-off events in the South China Sea could be presented as immediate threats to the American way of life. There will indeed be swift and dire consequences for American citizens if China dominates the entire Pacific Rim by controlling the freedom of navigation, as Bolton described.
American businesses are increasingly concerned over access to goods and the overall economic outlook is more uncertain, the US Federal Reserve said in a period survey released on Wednesday.

What viewers don't understand is how lazy media personalities are. They are merely quoting what someone told them. They don't know. Their expertise consists of memorizing a set of talking points, like ABBA memorizing the syllables to English words without knowing what they meant.
We take some solace to report, Immigration Voice has convinced the House to include a provision in the upcoming stimulus bill which says – in light of the indefinite closing of USCIS offices and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, all existing lawful immigration statuses and EADs [Employment Authortization Documents] will be automatically extended for 1 year from the date the legislation is enacted. As per the current language, if you have an H4 EAD, it will be extended for a year. If you have an H-1B about to expire, it will be renewed and you can remain here even if furloughed until the crisis is over. … We need the Senate to agree to add the language into its stimulus in order for the doctors and other critical care workers we have in our community to be able to treat patients and go to work without fear of losing their status if they die. Please call your Senators and make sure they understand the importance of this provision and of the work you do.
The mechanism allows two weeks for ministers to resolve any problems, although that period can be extended if all sides agree. If needed, an advisory board would have an extra 20 days to adjudicate.

We are making significant investments to unite the country and address critical issues that will help people improve their lives, Koch spokesman James Davis told TIME. This starts with a major new initiative to fight poverty in America, and following on the success of the First Step Act in December continuing to build broad-based policy coalitions on issues from education reform to immigration. These will include a significant investment to support policy champions in Senate, House and state races. This is where we can make the biggest difference for millions of Americans. [Emphasis added]

The Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S. Code, Section 1385, was first passed in 1878 to resolve concerns that the federal military was being used to enforce domestic laws in former Confederate states.

Asserting that it supports the right of pregnant people rather than 'pregnant women' to abort their baby, the NUS said it would match any monetary contribution towards a student's travel to Ireland made by local union branches up to a maximum of £110 — which it warns is the cut-off for political 'donations' under Irish law before funding must be declared.
People were given only a few hours' notice before their homes were demolished, and they were forced into the sub-zero December temperatures. The demolitions included small businesses as well as homes, causing many migrants to lose their life savings as well as their source of income. Many migrants had been supporting their families by sending money back to them, but that source of support was cut off overnight.
Regardless of our nation's polarized views on the policy and politics of abortion, it is clear that our Constitution does not include a right to abort children merely because of disfavored characteristics, the authors conclude.

The only notable decreases were on the (confusing) questions of the quality of the environment — a six point drop from 52 to 46 percent; the level of immigration, a drop from 41 to 35 percent (which might mean people agree with Trump that there's too much immigration, or disagree); and the country's abortion policies, where satisfaction dropped seven points, from 39 to 32 percent. Again, though, we don't know if that means people think abortion policy is too restrictive or liberal.

Revolutionary Guard members patrolled the city on motorbikes and plainclothes security men were also out in force. People looked down as they walked briskly past the police, hoping not to draw attention to themselves.
The Central American deportation numbers show little improvement until 2020, partly because the D.C. establishment strenuously opposed Trump's campaign promise of border security — until Trump threatened trade sanctions with Mexico in 2019. The DHS data shows no confirmed departure for 97.2 percent of the 440,616 Central American family migrants in 2019 — and just 61 percent among the sharply lower 22,056 arrivals in the first three months of fiscal 2020, during October to December 2019.

Data for the remainder of the year hasn't been released. The U.S. Air Force dramatically increased the number of airstrikes it carried out in Afghanistan in 2016, data released by the military shows, a further sign of growing U.S. involvement in the country's war following the withdrawal of most coalition troops two years ago.
The comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. A 19th-century bigot would have regarded Catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with America's democratic rules. The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.

But now we would be able to carry the construction through. We actually have a fantastic design that's going to be efficient and fast and really, really work well.
We care about giving children access to the K-12 education of their family's choice, in full compliance with the law, she said. We don't take positions on tangential immigration issues. Immigration status does not play a factor in ESA eligibility, just like it does not affect whether or not a child can attend an Arizona public school.
The New York Stock Exchange has withdrawn plans to delist shares of three Chinese state-owned phone carriers. The shares were to be removed under an order from President Donald Trump, a move Beijing had warned might lead to retaliation.
So now to the present day. As we have seen, Secretary Pompeo is currently traveling the Middle East, seeking to rally our allies against Iran. As Pompeo declared in Cairo on January 10, in the showcasing policy speech of his Middle East trip, We ask every peace-loving nation of the Middle East to shoulder new responsibilities for defeating Islamist extremism wherever we find it. And in sharp contrast to the liberal apologetics of Obama and others, Pompeo added, The age of self-inflicted American shame is over.
O'Grady dismisses the official excuse about human error shipping the Hellfire to Cuba out of hand, arguing that stealing weapons technology is what spies do for a living, and getting hold of a sophisticated piece of U.S. equipment is a major coup for Havana.
Breitbart News recently reported that both Facebook and Twitter have suspended President Trump's social media accounts, with Facebook extending the ban indefinitely.
I will respect your choice to leave your diction choices 'as is' and to make whatever political and linguistic statement you want to make by doing so, the professor wrote. By the same token, I will still need to subtract a point because your choice will not be made in the letter or spirit of this particular class, which is all about having you and other students looking beneath your assumptions and understanding that 'mankind' does not mean 'all people' to all people. It positively does not.
He added that Trump does not represent the character and people in the USA that I have come to know and love.
A genius actress, but cheapness also, no? he said.
This is an attempt to distract the American people away from his failed policies, Cox explained. So did we participate in CNN's event tonight? No, we didn't. We were offered one pre-screened question. Megyn, I know that you don't send your questions over to the White House so I would rather have a conversation with you that's intellectually honest than sit through a lecture and get one opportunity to ask a pre-screened question.
National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said this month President Trump's talking points will include religious freedom, cooperating with the Church on humanitarian issues.
McCaul said, You look what happened in Pakistan, 70 women and children killed in a park by terrorists and in Turkey, ISIS is targeting Jewish children at schools, sufficient enough to pull our servicemen and family members and diplomat family members to evacuate out of Turkey. The State Department is following that warning about travel to Turkey. The world is on fire.
She said that the House of Representatives will pursue economic, racial, and environmental justice during the 117th Congress.
When NYPD officers brought her to the 62nd precinct, they instructed her to remove her headscarf. The teen refused the officers' orders, and was taken to a private room where a female officer took her photo separate from the men.

David Azerrad of the Heritage Foundation justly called the holiday insipid, and lamented the fact that a celebration of Washington was lumped in with a menagerie of other second-rate presidents. Washington, the 'indispensable man' of the revolution who was rightly extolled for being 'first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,' has now been lumped together with the likes of James Buchanan, Jimmy Carter, Franklin Pierce and John Tyler, he said.
The intervention in the Brexit debate by President Obama was poorly received by many British voters, and was subsequently credited with helping the public swing behind Brexit.
So why are conservatives fretting about corporate America cutting off the GOP, a process merely accelerated by last week's (disgraceful) mob assault on the Capitol. Did they think building a working-class party was going to be painless? That they could mouth pro-worker rhetoric while continuing to ignore workers' concerns on issues like immigration and wages? A country-club party with blue-collar décor?
At the time of the appointments, Obama was applauded for an unprecedented show of bipartisanship. The praise continued throughout Obama's tenure, even though appointees such as Lahood later resigned after coming to the conclusion the White House was never committed fully to a genuine bipartisan approach to policy making.
We need more legal immigration. … I don't want green cards just for computer engineers. If you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, I want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, I want them to have a chance to get a green card. I just don't want to be a country in the future of just computer engineers or high-tech people.
The then-interior minister's closed ports policy, aimed at stopping migrant arrivals from Libya, saw his popularity numbers shoot up.
On Monday, the social media company said it is removing Stop the Steal content from Facebook and Instagram, claiming that such language might incite violence on Inauguration Day, considering the riots that transpired last week on Capitol Hill.
During the 2020 campaign, President-elect Joe Biden embraced the radical transgender' claim that the government should treat each person's biological sex as subordinate to their claimed transgender cross-sex status.
Mainstream activists are cheering a justice department memo that says the Supreme Court's pro-transgender decision in 2020 does not apply to single-sex sports, education practices, and sexual privacy.
That solidarity in the EU is fracturing over the micromanagement of member-states' vaccination regimes may be unsurprising. Leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage predicted that there might not be an EU in a decade, because the bloc is already split culturally east and west, and financially north and south.
The share of owners thinking it's a good time to expand fell four points to eight percent. Sales expectations over the next three months dropped 14 points to a net negative 4 percent. Plans to grow payrolls fell four points to 22 percent.

Breitbart Texas reported extensively on the efforts by Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement organizations to crack down on smugglers who warehouse their human cargo in small houses located along the border towns and in interior cities along intermediate stops along the smuggling route.
WHISTLEBLOWER: If I hired a framer to do a small addition [in 1988], his wage would have been $45 an hour. That was the minimum for a framing contractor, a good carpenter. [Emphasis added] … Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. [Emphasis added]
Contradicting the NYT's claims, the head of immunisations for Public Health England, Dr Mary Ramsay, said: We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines — if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa.
He added, What's happened here is, the nation as a whole has decided it can no longer, in my view, continue to turn a blind eye to the prostitution of the 2nd Amendment here, and no longer can turn a blind eye to the enormous damage being done, not just in our schools, but on our streets, right here in Philly and Wilmington, Delaware, where I'm from, every night.
During the height of the European Migrant Crisis, eight countries imposed internal border restrictions on travel. The nations of France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have all notified Brussels that they will continue to enforce border checks to combat the threat of terrorism.
The written message came in the final hours of Britain's membership of the EU, when Ambassador Robert 'Woody' Johnson noted the historic occasion and expressed his good wishes to the United Kingdom in the next chapter of her national history.

With Merkel set to resign later this year, and France to take the reigns of the EU presidency in 2022 — when the deal is expected to be officially ratified by member states and the European Parliament — some smaller countries in the bloc have expressed worries that they are being steamrolled by the two major economic players in the Union.
We need to get it right. We don't need to be in a hurry. We need to get it done this year.
Many polls show that the public — white, brown, or black — personally welcomes legal migrants but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has said that his country will defend Europe against a wave of illegal mass migration as it had done in 2015 during the first migrant crisis.
This decision is, in our view, the latest step in what appears to be an ongoing process of land expropriations, settlement expansions, and legalizations of outposts that is fundamentally undermining the prospects for a two-state solution, U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Washington.
If you've got 50 Democrat Senators and 50 Republican Senators, the Democrat [vice president] could break the tie, and that's it, he continued. That is not the way the system works that we have operated on for decades and decades and decades.
You, as the commander in chief of the armed forces, are directly responsible for this, he said in a statement. If you were aware and you let military and security authorities deceive people, then there is no doubt you lack the attributes of constitutional leadership.
Germany has never been particularly good at integrating migrants, he said. Turkish migrants took a very long time to become part of mainstream society.
China's development of forward military bases in the South China Sea began in December 2013 when the first dredger arrived at Johnson Reef. Through 2015, China used dredging efforts to build up these reefs and create manmade islands, destroying the reefs in the process. Since then, China has constructed clear military facilities on the islands, with several bases including hangars, barracks, underground fuel and water storage facilities, and bunkers to house offense and defensive kinetic and non-kinetic systems. These actions stand in direct contrast to the assertion that President Xi made in 2015 in the Rose Garden when he commented that Beijing had no intent to militarize the South China Sea. Today these forward operating bases appear complete. The only thing lacking are the deployed forces. Once occupied, China will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania. The PLA will be able to use these bases to challenge U.S. presence in the region, and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants. In short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.
Leading Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said an indefinite Brexit 'transition' period would be a perversion of democracy, slamming a leaked government proposal containing no provision for immigration controls.
Since the populist PiS administration came to power in Warsaw in October 2015, it has come into conflict with Brussels on several fronts.
Sadly, in the field of climate research and climate policy, good data, when not ignored entirely, is increasingly twisted to fit the narrative claiming that humans are causing a climate crisis. Climate action partisans, in pursuit of political power and ever increasing resources, force data to fit their delusion that humans must forego modern, industrial civilization to save humanity and the earth from climate doom.
Government's gotta find a way to reduce the debt, but let Americans cash flow our country. Williams said you do that by doing the things we're talking about, as he referred to his Jumpstart America plan released last summer. He added that he has been talking about tax reform his entire time in congress.

Tennessee became one of the first states on Tuesday to pass legislation designed to stem the assault on free speech at its public universities.
The Guardian cites Taiwanese Defense Minister Feng Shih-kuan as alerting the nation's legislature that his government is seeking to purchase more modern aircraft to replace its currently fleet of F-16s. Feng's request for more modern aircraft was a response to a review of Taiwan's defense capabilities recently released by his ministry and published every four years. The review warned that the Chinese government had significantly expanded its ability to attack Taiwan is necessary. China has invested heavily in military construction in the South China Sea, particularly in regions that are not sovereign Chinese territory but China insists has belonged to them since ancient times.
There should be a referendum on the future of the monarchy in the wake of the Woke Royals developments, a contender in the race to replace Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, as anti-monarchists scrabble to capitalise on the Royal family's woes.
Honestly, I think almost everyone in the system knows that most of the [migrant] teens are coming to work and send money back home, said Maria Woltjen, executive director and founder of the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, a national organization that advocates for immigrant children in court. They want to help their parents. But whether they stayed in a shelter in Florida or California or Illinois, the teens heard similar warnings from the staff: They had to enroll in school and stay out of trouble. The immigration judges who would decide their cases, they were told, didn't want to hear that they were working. They would ask you: 'Who are you going to live with? Is he going to support you financially?' said one 19-year-old who spent nearly six months at a shelter in New York before a family friend in Bensenville agreed to take him in. And you say yes. 'Are they going to be responsible for you?' And you say yes. 'Are they going to take you to school?' And you say yes.

We demand the end of the political lynching,'' added Alvarado.''Nothing can be imposed on the great and sovereign nation of Venezuela. It is absolutely essential that these actions cease.''
Let's be very clear that the administration has zero tolerance for the actions alleged in this complaint — and consistent with our zero tolerance policy and protocols, despite not having been served the complaint until today, the administration reported these allegations to the Archdiocese of Newark and the Bergen County prosecutor's office when it first learned of them, Walsh wrote in the statement.
Cyprus is also in talks with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu over supplying vaccines to the island nation, as the European Union's procurement process was not enough for rapid and mass vaccinations.
Austrian paper Der Standard reports that just over 490,000 people were registered unemployed last month, marking a 10 per cent increase on the same time last year, suggesting the massive influx of migrants is failing to boost the country's economy.

Paul said Abrams was untrustworthy due to his role in the Iran-Contra scandal: His conviction for deceiving Congress over secret arms deals, better known as the Iran-Contra scandal, show that his neocon agenda trumps his fidelity to the rule of law. The Constitution directs Congress to approve or disapprove of war. It would be a mistake to appoint anyone to the State Department who was previously convicted for defying Congressional authority.
A new report states that 65% of major US banks have failed web security testing designed to determine whether or not they are vulnerable to a cyber attack.
For players not already in the drug-testing program, it means that the once-per-year substance-abuse test can happen at any point between now and early August. Which means that, if/when a player not in the drug-testing program passes the annual substance-abuse test, he can use recreational drugs like marijuana without consequence until next year. As long as, of course, he isn't arrested for marijuana possession in a state where it's illegal or a bag of weed doesn't fall out of his coat pocket while visiting the league office. Given the amount of time necessary for marijuana metabolites to exit the system (it can take as long as 30 days) it may be too late to stop smoking yesterday. For those who stopped in time to produce a clean sample, they'll be hoping to get their number pulled sooner than later, so that they can resume doing what is now legal in nine states for recreational purposes and 29 states for medicinal purposes.
It may be the case Britain ultimately finds itself fighting the same old battles, with politicians saying they can't protect this steel plant or prevent that contract from going abroad not because the EU ties their hands, but because the EU deal does.
This kind of positive change is made possible by our students' leadership in creating environments and cultures rooted in respect and inclusion, Khurana wrote.

Hundreds of students gathered at Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University on Sunday to mourn the victims and protest against authorities for concealing the cause of the crash, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported. They later dispersed peacefully.
The Project Veritas videos, filmed without apparent awareness or consent, show a range of selectively edited insights from inside Twitter, claimed Wired. Many of the employees filmed used sensational language, but they also thought they were talking candidly to strangers at a bar. It's not exactly unusual to embellish your job — and to elide its nuances — to a potential new friend or romantic interest. Apparently, Wired has chosen calling Twitter employees lonely nerds as the best defense available for the social media platform.

And it is the general public upon whose behalf Congress is supposed to legislate, not the tens of millions who participate in shooting sports. Even a marginal increase in risk to the population cannot be justified, unless the harms to the minority from current policy are very severe and there are no means to reduce them other than the proposed legislation. In fact, the harms to shooters are modest — somewhat elevated risk of non-total hearing loss, essentially — and effective alternatives to silencers are readily available.
The final line of Lincoln's great speech gave hope to the battered forces of the Union and the Constitution in 1860—as they should always give hope to patriots who believe in American exceptionalism: Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.
On Breitbart News Sunday, host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon interviewed Ronald Reagan historian Craig Shirley about the the death of Nancy Reagan.

Bannon and Shirley spoke about how important Nancy was to Ronald Reagan's career.
The election was originally supposed to take place in December 2016. Joseph Kabila, the incumbent president, is not permitted to run again, according to the constitution, and so he has postponed the election several times. The last postponement was from December 23, 2018, to December 30, when the election finally took place.
Eric Schneiderman's missive comes in the wake of an Atlanta Falcons coach asking Ohio State cornerback Eli Apple at the NFL Combine: So, do you like men?

Perhaps the most shocking example to date was Meng Hongwei, the former head of the Interpol international law enforcement agency, who vanished while returning home to China from a trip to France and reappeared as a prison convict a few months later, sentenced to 13 and a half years in prison on charges of bribery. His wife believes Meng was another victim of the endless anti-corruption crusade that serves the CCP as a rolling political purge.
The new rule, however, does not prohibit doctors in Title X facilities from counseling women about abortion.
China's longstanding one-child policy has produced a population where boys far outnumber girls. Yet teachers are predominantly female and boys have consistently fallen behind in academic performance – with disparities in performance seen as early as third grade – causing concern for many parents who are now pressing for more assertive male role models in classrooms. The recruiting effort – that has included relaxing college admissions requirements and providing full scholarships with job guarantees to male applicants – has been labeled, by some, as sexist.
The Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC is still growing, but not as quickly as had been feared. The outbreak total is 613 cases, including 565 confirmed and 54 suspected cases. Health officials are still investigating 54 suspected infections.
Trump has repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. needs a tougher approach to trade that would put American workers and companies first. He has already pulled the U.S. out of a proposed trade deal with Pacific Rim countries and has started the process to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.
They never saw them as enemies or ideological adversaries, he said.
You can't overstate how important this this [sic] race is, Hurt said.

That's what what life is actually about [for] these people.
Maybe they were arrested because trespassing is still against the law? As the commissioner said, the men were asked to leave by Starbucks employees and refused. Which is why the police were called in the first place. The police themselves then asked the men to leave three times, and they refused.

And the thing I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it's good for the party. I frankly think it's good for the country. Let's look at the bold ideas. And I'm eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend the status quo, then do it. If there's not merit, let's explore new ideas.

Roughly 1.5 million foreign visa-workers hold college-graduates jobs in the United States via the various H-1B, OPT, CPT, L-1, J-1, E-3, H4EAD, TN, and O-1 visa programs. Companies are allowed to hire these foreign workers no matter how many young Americans are applying for the same jobs.
We rely on the wisdom of the President of the Republic for a quick solution: the centre-right parties clearly reaffirm their unwillingness to support left-wing governments, he added.
Additionally, the IRGC's action [i.e. detaining the sailors] is a response that embarrasses the propaganda of the Iranian president [Rohani] and his men – particularly the wily foreign minister [Zarif] and others – who claim that they want peace and openness, as they market lies and corrupt accusations against Saudi Arabia.
The terrorist who killed four in and around Carcassonne in March, Radouane Lakdim, was a high priority subject of that list and had been on it since 2014 — but still, French police were unable to prevent the attack. Deportations could relieve some pressure from the security services — a former French intelligence official whistleblower this week revealed the state did not have enough agents or resources to watch all of the suspects.
Alonso Benítez was considered a model farmer, growing organic coffee in Honduras' western highlands. In recent years, he had switched to organic methods, planted timber-producing trees to diversify his income, and worked with a cooperative to earn a premium on the world price. Benítez also had a large extended family in the area, who pitched in with harvests and lowered his labor costs. But Benítez vanished one day in April 2019 with his 17-year-old son, leaving an elder, 18-year-old son to oversee the farm. He paid a coyote 170,000 lempiras ($7,300) to take him and his son to the U.S. border, according to the elder son, Jordi Benítez. After spending four days in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, the pair were released and went to Houston—where Benítez found work in a gravel pit.

On the subject of Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70% marginal tax rate to fund her Green New Deal, Lieberman said a progressive tax system already exists in the U.S. If you… accumulate income in the country the big bump is still in the middle class, he said. So you've got to be careful about raising taxes too high… a 70 percent tax on high-income people is really done for political reasons.
It remains unclear how the Medley analyst originally obtained the information that Lacker says he confirmed. But the report was so detailed that it left little doubt it was based on non-public information.
In short, there is ample reason to believe Trump's decision was about more than thin skin, and his skin didn't have to be very thin to think Abrams wouldn't be a good fit for an administration he previously regarded as an improbable catastrophe. Six weeks of non-stop leaking and bureaucratic sabotage might understandably have reduced the president's tolerance for a Number Two official at the State Department who (according to Senator Paul) once declared Donald Trump unfit to occupy the chair where Washington and Lincoln once sat—but evidently had no such reservations about Hillary Clinton.
Bloomberg, whom polls show is gaining traction in his quest for the 2020 Democrat nomination, released his proposal for overhauling America's immigration and refugee laws on Monday. The plan, based on policies the mayor implemented during his tenure at the helm of New York City, is being touted as beneficial to not only the country's diversity, but also its profit margins.
Give the huge influx over the past year, however, the figure of 50,000 will likely raise scepticism over whether the Austrian government can effectively deal with the ongoing migrant crisis.

The poor figures bolster arguments for more Chinese monetary policy easing on top of the six interest rates cuts seen since November 2014 and suggest that more currency depreciation is coming to prop up corporate profitability, bad news for advanced economies.
Ingram, Sterling More, Vonn Bell, and a few other Saints players decided to take in London's night life on Monday evening and at some point ended up in front of the exclusive Cirque Le Soir club in London's Soho district.
If the wall talks are expanded, Pelosi will be under pressure to accept a compromise, Vaughan said, because she has to show she can govern. Moreover, Pelosi's majority is made possible by semi-centrist Democrats who ran to her right in the November elections. They need compromises to keep their seats in 2020, she said.
Johnson's administration was much less disagreeable to Tory Brexiteers than May's, but faced the same fundamental problem: the House of Commons was dominated by Remainers, who would neither agree a Brexit deal nor allow a no-deal Brexit to take place.

Noting wistfully that because of financial constraints, the terror group ditched its past practice of dispatching a Santa to give out gifts in Christian neighborhoods, the Times lauded Hezbollah, which seeks the annihilation of world Jewry and has seeded terror cells across the globe, because it sent representatives to a Christmas concert sponsored by Iran.
The O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics … … To qualify for an O-1 visa, the beneficiary must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.

Now, he cuts an exotic figure in the international media, holding press conferences in the traditional dress of Poland's southern highlanders as ad hoc spokesman of some 200 businesses which have promised to end this madness.
Sunder Katwala, British Future's director, said: Most people now know that being in the [European Union] with free movement means high immigration. It's better to have real-world plans to manage the impacts of migration – on welfare costs, housing, public services and integration – than promises that are unlikely to be kept or believed.
A log of updates to hate speech policy documents show some of the new phrases and sentiments that were defined as hate speech following the Charlottesville protest. In November 2017, trainers added the comparison of Mexican people to worms as an example of hate speech, in December they added the comparison of Muslims and pigs, and in February, trainers added that referring to transgender people as it rather than their preferred pronouns was hate speech.
The first panel is titled Obama's Dangerous National Security Legacy and How it Must Be Reversed.
Today the Campaign for Accountability released a report about our funding of academic research. It claims to list hundreds of papers we've in some way funded. The report is highly misleading. For example, the report attributes to Google any work that was supported by any organization to which we belong or have ever donated (such as CCIA)… [Moreover], the researchers and institutions to whom we award research grants will often publish research with which we disagree. In fact, many of the academics listed by the Campaign for Accountability have criticized Google and our policy positions heavily on a variety of topics.
[Redacted] but we can find the references in the 302 which discuss it.
The solution, as always, is not government, Gab wrote this week. It is to build your won. People mock this meme, but Gab lives it. While others whine, we build.
Time to expose all the abortions paid for by the hypocrite politicians that vote for this. Make no mistake, this is about limiting women's choices while courting a specific voting block. This could not be less about morals or life. https://t.co/NkivIkdOuL — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) May 18, 2018
According to a Monday Politico report, state Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) is leading the charge by reportedly arguing that California needs to be a laboratory for social change by taking the lead on progressive causes.
No one likes a bully. But equally no one likes the tendency — especially prevalent among the kind of Social Justice Warrior snowflake types rampant in the Civil Service — towards using mental health issues as a way of avoiding responsibility for laziness or incompetence.
A collection of leaked documents appears to show Facebook redefining rules around hate speech and re-educating content moderators following the Charlottesville protest in 2017.
They are now taking down the American flag in the capital and replacing it with a MAGA flag. Shoot. Them. All. — Vincent Frank (@VincentFrankNFL) January 6, 2021
With 80 percent of Wall Street analysts calling the stock a buy, and an average target price of $165, such talk by Breitbart at the time was considered tech blasphemy. But the stock closed on Feb. 18 at $96.26, down 27 percent since Breitbart's warning.
What a shame if that were to happen! Bolton added sarcastically.
I call it a reciprocal tax, Trump said. If a country is charging us a 100 percent tax, and we're charging them nothing for the same product … why didn't these politicians just say reciprocal tax? We're going to be very heavy on the reciprocal tax.
Merkel has been praised for opening Germany's doors to those fleeing war and misery, but has also weathered harsh criticism, especially from southern Bavaria state, the main gateway for arriving migrants.
Inflation, which currently stands at an annual rate of 1.6 percent, has picked up over recent months and is expected to continue to do.
Step one, apparently, was passing his amended version of the May deal.
In the meantime, wage growth for American workers is at risk as illegal immigration is set to majorly increase this year.
First of all, there have been a lot of attacks on my staff, and as I said when this issue came up earlier, I'm appalled at some of the smearing of some of the professional people that work for the intelligence committee. Now this question refers to allegations in a newspaper article which are circulating smears on my staff and ask me to respond to those smears and I will not dignify those smears on my staff by giving them any credence whatsoever. Nor will I share any information that I believe could or could not lead to the identification of the whistleblower.
A visit by Israeli officials last week ended with a public statement saying Israel would take Trump's concerns into consideration and pledges by both countries to keep talking.
After months of bitter protests that the Facebook opponents referred to as the modern Quit India, in celebration of Mahatma Gandhi's efforts to expel the British in 1942, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India suspended the free Facebook service in December.
If you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the Remain-biased Civil Service — led by arch-Remainer Mark Sedwill — is using the Huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage Boris's post-Brexit deals in order to make the Brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the EU more likely. You would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment.
Great news, Americans! You lost your jobs, your businesses collapsed, your children were denied an education, your freedoms were stolen, you were imprisoned in your own home, you were forced to wear a mask, you couldn't travel – but it was all worth it because guess what? In 2020, thanks to Chinese Coronavirus, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions fell by ten whole per cent last year.
The core view at the bank remains that domestically-generated inflation, especially wage growth, will remain too weak to justify raising rates over the next year, a view we share.
The recommendation has given renewed hope. Every day at least seven or eight people come to ask about obtaining Bulgarian citizenship, said Haxhi Pirushi.
Tur said Trump's sentences are stronger than they are. … And this is exactly the way he operated in the campaign, and what was so — brilliant is the wrong word, but what was so brilliant about it was that anybody who watched him could take whatever they wanted to take from that. So, if you were a Donald Trump supporter because you believed he's going to bring back jobs, the offensive things he said, you put to the side, you didn't worry about. If you were a Donald Trump supporter because you liked the offensive things he said, you were a white nationalist, maybe, you took his subtle queues and his lack of severe condemnations as a cue that, you know, he is accepting of my point of view, and he's going to champion what I want. And you're seeing that with foreign policy.
Despite claims to the contrary, the Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit President Trump from sending military forces to the U.S.-Mexico border. Just as President Trump has the authority to declare a state of national emergency, he also has the authority to send troops to our southern border under certain circumstances.

There is no indication of an effort to integrate male students into Yale's sororities.
Radio Farda reviewed the numbers on Tuesday and found Iran's exports were growing significantly before the second, much tougher round of U.S. sanctions took effect in November:
The California primary will take place on Super Tuesday, March 3, instead of in early June, as in previous years.
The Americans now understand that they will have to cooperate with Russia and the Syrian regime, which they declined to do before, he added. They now realize that they have to be part of the war against terror, rather than aid and abet it, whether directly or indirectly.
In Islam, it is considered sacrilegious to remove the headscarf of a Muslim woman by force. It is typical for only a Muslim woman's husband or her family members to see her without her headscarf.
The Koch brothers' organizations claim Americans have a commitment to providing amnesty to DACA illegal aliens, though doing so would strain the country's social safety net intended for U.S. citizens.
Bolton also was to convey the message that the United States is very supportive of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets in Syria, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss Bolton's plans before the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Russian and American military forces are setting up a communications hotline. That's the big difference, according to one analyst.
This makes a nonsense of Johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. Of course it won't. There is plenty of evidence to support Heymann's claim. None to support Johnson's.
More recently, a report by the think tank Onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'Red Wall' seats (i.e. traditional Labour constituencies in the Midlands and North which lent their votes to the Conservatives in the 2019 election so that Johnson could deliver Brexit) face being wiped out in Johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.
President Donald Trump will deliver his first address from the Oval Office on Tuesday evening at 9 p.m. ET. He will explain why the country needs a physical barrier at the U.S.-Mexico border, and why he is refusing to consider bills to end the partial federal government shutdown unless they provide the funding he is seeking.
Stan Marek, the owner of Marek Brothers, a Houston-based construction firm that has employed many illegal migrants, is pushing the ID & Tax Proposal amnesty:
These are Christ's representatives on Earth, former student Peter Alrutz said. You're taught to do whatever they tell you. And then all of a sudden the people who are supposed to be protecting you are abusing you.
In November, Home Secretary Priti Patel agreed to send £28 million to France to increase patrols of beaches used by migrants to set sail for England.
Hunter has repeatedly defied multiple court orders, refusing to comply with deadlines to provide the financial information.
Stanford University announced this semester that male students are banned from the university gym twice a week in order to promote inclusivity.
Obviously, this is all very good news, not only for the president, but the country.
In an opinion piece for the globalist, establishment newspaper, the Financial Times, Gideon Rachman said that the European Union's claims that the deal will discipline the behaviour of the communist regime are in fact naive.
That Democrats' opposition to a wall is entwined with Democrats' increasing promotion of migrants above Americans and their children.
The Eagles have not clarified what policy Jeff is alleged to have violated. — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017
Over the course of presidency, Trump's hawkishness on Iran has lacked coherence and has, in no small part, been informed by his desire to do away with the fragile peace brokered by Obama, said Abbas Kadhim, a Middle East analyst at the Atlantic Council in Washington.
At that meeting, Trump and Netanyahu voiced confidence they could work out an understanding, while providing few hints how.
Now Trump and the Israeli leader are both speaking vaguely of a broader Middle East package. Israel's Arab neighbors, who traditionally opposed Israel but have realigned because of common concerns about Iran — would serve as guarantors.
The National Federation of Independent Business said Tuesday that its index of sentiment declined by 5.5 points to 95.9.
French President Emmanuel Macron hit a similar note in 2018 when he said the EU needed its own armed forces to protect ourselves from external threats. Incredibly, among the threats Macron listed was the United States of America — prompting President Donald Trump to call the claim very insulting.
Following her suspension from the platform, Loomer staged a protest outside Twitter's offices in New York. Wearing a yellow star of David on her jacket, Loomer shouted: I threw away the key, and I'm here for the millions of conservatives who have been censored by Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg.
The maroon passport currently held by British citizens will revert back to its original dark blue colour as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, the Home Office has confirmed.
Trump needs the rural vote to keep the same states he won in 2016 in his win column come November, Wiesemeyer said. In fact, contacts say he is focusing on winning Minnesota this time as a backstop should he lose a state he won in 2016. That means agriculture will continue to be a key topic in the president's re-election campaign.
China ended its one-child policy in favor of a two-child policy last year because it feared the country's aging population could lead to a massive economic slowdown.
When in October 2016 the Washington Post uncovered the infamous Access Hollywood tape of Trump using vulgar language to describe interactions with women, Ryan held a conference call with members of the House GOP conference urging them to do whatever they wanted with regards to pulling endorsements of Trump.

The hardline daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline, A sky full of sadness, while the Hamshahri daily went with Shame, and the IRAN daily said Unforgivable.
They argue the fact that President Trump has used his @realdonaldtrump Twitter account to make statements relating to public policy, his account acts as a public forum which people may not be excluded from by the government simply because they disagree with the opinion expressed.
First Daughter Ivanka Trump will be meeting with victims of human trafficking in Rome as part of President Donald Trump's international trip to Europe and the Middle East.
In addition to admitting that he confirmed some of the Medley analysts non-public information, Lacker also said that he did not initially tell the Fed's investigators that the analyst was in possession of that information during the call. Instead, he only disclosed this fact in 2015 when he was interviewed as part of the investigation by federal prosecutors, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

Earlier this week, the Israeli monitoring organization Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) highlighted a statement in Abbas's name on the Facebook page of the PA, in which the 82 year-old Palestinian leader said he would not bend on the issue, even if it cost him his job.
In my opinion, the company try to stop people from using the company as a tool to emigrate to Western Europe, so if they find out you want to settle down in Western Europe they will tell you to leave, he said.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency cited an unnamed official as saying the ambassador was suspected of organizing and provoking the protesters, which was in violation of diplomatic protocol and justified his arrest on national security grounds.
After Louder with Crowder scheduled video promotional tweets of the newly censored video, Crowder's suspension on Twitter was increased to a week:
President Donald Trump downplayed the goal of pro-American immigration reform in his 2020 State of the Union speech, providing only a sketch of a much-touted 2021 reform push.
Farage rejected Ms. Rigby's question as a false dichotomy, saying: No. If you have someone in your front room taking your possessions, you get rid of them, and get back control of your own life.
Since my last post, the already massive influx of new users to Telegram has only accelerated. We may be witnessing the largest digital migration in human history. Following this global phenomenon, two presidents started their Telegram channels: The President of Brazil – @jairbolsonarobrasil
Whether the British people will ultimately notice any difference between Johnson's Brexit and no Brexit remains to be seen. One thing he has secured is an end to the Free Movement of People — but as his government is presiding over massive increases in non-EU immigration and record levels of effectively unchecked illegal immigration, it is likely that the overall net inflow of people will continue to rise.
The drive to impeach President Trump did not begin with the allegations before us. Here was reporting in April of 2016: 'Donald Trump isn't even the Republican nominee yet… [but] 'Impeachment' is already on the lips of pundits, newspaper editorials, constitutional scholars, and even a few members of Congress.' Here was the Washington Post headline minutes after President Trump's inauguration: 'The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.' … [Democrats'] position was obvious when they openly rooted for the [Robert] Mueller [Russian collusion hoax] investigation to tear our country apart and were disappointed when the facts proved otherwise. It was obvious when they sought to impeach this president over and over.
Israel could stand to lose between NIS 3.6 billion ($1 billion) and NIS 14 billion ($4 billion), the finance ministry estimated, and that forecast does not account for a nightmare scenario of a widespread outbreak of the virus in Israel, the Hebrew-language Globes newspaper reported.
Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner has admitted that the focus of the British political class on ethnic minorities and women's agendas has seen the white working class — and white working-class boys in particular — falling by the wayside.
Economists will no doubt spend years figuring out exactly what gave rise to the Trump manufacturing boom and why so many forecasts were so far off-base. No doubt trade policy, tax cuts, and regulatory reform all played a role. But a good deal of the manufacturing revival is likely based on something less tangible but no less real: the revival of hope. People who believe we can make America great again are hiring, starting new businesses, and returning to the workforce.
Quoting from the Old Testament books of Exodus and Leviticus, Francis said that oppressing strangers is contrary to God's will.
Sources familiar with the meetings told Politico that Biden's policy advisers met with Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA), as well as Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) and Linda Sanchez (D-CA) to discuss an immigration agenda:
He went on to contend that there is evidence that major technology companies are systematically eliminating certain types of content to fit their own political agenda.
The move, pushed by the Palestinian delegation, typifies the anti-Israeli boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement of pro-Palestinian activists.
In a 2015 article, The New York Times observed that worrying about an overcrowded planet has fallen off the international agenda and has now been replaced by climate change and related concerns.
Thus far, the J-1 visa has remained in place, unreformed, though the new year brings a new opportunity for the Trump administration to tackle the small, but essential reform.
We could go down the list of all the Arab countries that Pompeo is visiting and conclude that the regimes, noxious as they might be to human-rights purists, are a whole lot better than any possible successor. And all of them are, for sure, an improvement over the regime that the Iranians, if they could, would put in place.

In comments made to Breitbart London, the chairman and founder of the UK-based think tank Hong Kong Watch, Benedict Rogers, described the deal as a real setback for the free world.
She added, It seems all he wants to do, all he understands how to do is fight, fight, fight. When there's no fight, pick a fight. 'I'm going to do everything I can to keep myself in every single one of the headlines and the only way I know how to do that is by blowing things up over and over again.'
Many Catholics believe that this would mean handing the Church over to the Chinese government, the priest said. These are understandable and sharable concerns.
However, it is vital that we cut the spread of the virus and everyone can play their part by following the advice on 'hands, face, space' and staying at home.
The report cited a 2020 study from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which found that Uyghurs have been used as slave labour in factories that supply at least 83 well-known global brands. The ASPI estimated that between 2017 and 2019, alone, over 80,000 Uyghurs were shipped out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China.
I was thrilled to hear it, white lesbian Mary Wagner, a real estate agent in Buffalo, told Murawski. I think it's long overdue.
According to Gay Star News, the biblical view of marriage is homophobic and the City of East Lansing barred Tennes for his homophobic religious views.
Williams was asked about other points of his Jumpstart America tax reform plan such as preserving LIFO accounting and allowing for 100% expensing of fixed asset purchases. He said 100% expensing would not affect everyone, but would help the economy as people are freed up to buy more things. On LIFO, he noted that for years the Obama Administration said the LIFO carry forward as money, but countered that it is a legitimate tax issue that if hit at around 40%, most businesses would not have the cash and it would hurt Main Street America.
On August 30, 2016, former FBI Director James Comey emails then-Assistant Director Andrew McCabe, copying Page, James Baker, Priestap and James Trainor with the subject line WH and said Both meetings went well and I was well prepared.… I will need an update briefing on [redacted] next week. As you might imagine, there was great interest in what each of us is doing on that front and in understanding what more we can do and the obstacles we see. Page forwards the email to Strzok, who replied, Thanks. Bill asked me as I was leaving if I thought it should be in CD [Counterintelligence Division]. Guessing this prompted it. I said yes then described and endorsed Allies reorganization idea.
Global business research firm Dun & Bradstreet found the virus' outbreak on the Chinese economy could cause a drag of approximately one percentage point on global GDP growth if the virus is not contained by the end of the summer of 2020.
To put it another way: if Americans have a constitutional right to access the Twitter feeds of public officials, that means that no one — neither the President nor the CEO of Twitter — is allowed to prevent them doing so.
Sant'Egido was founded in 1968 by Italian layman Andrea Richard, a historian and former minister in the Italian government to offer services to the poor, build conflict resolution, and to encourage ecumenical and inter-faith dialogue. Human trafficking is also part of its mission, according to the Catholic news site, cruxnow.com.
Rep. Steve King (R-IA) is facing new criticism Thursday after comments appeared in the New York Times in which he questioned when the terms white nationalist and white supremacist had become offensive.
This is high stakes, he added. And for whatever reason, it got dropped in Georgia's lap. And it is literally going to be up to 5 million or so Georgia voters as to not whether we are going to keep the deal that we have had with the other states and the other people in the country for decades. Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court in 1937 and failed. Otherwise, the Supreme Court, which by the way — the Constitution doesn't say how many justices there are. It has been just by agreement for decades, and most of us think it ought to stay that way. There are some Democrats, just like Joe Manchin, who say they won't get rid of the filibuster. But the way to make sure is to vote for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.
The leaders of the three nations said in a statement that they've been left with no choice, given Iran's actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments.
Trump followed through on his campaign vow in May 2018 by officially withdrawing from the treaty and reimposing crippling sanctions on Tehran.
Matteo Salvini also released a statement on behalf of the centre-right coalition, saying: The centre-right is the country's leading political force and after a summit that confirmed the great unity of the coalition, asks that the prime minister take note of the crisis and resign immediately or, otherwise, appear in Parliament tomorrow to ask for a vote of confidence.
The invitation to the event makes clear the anti-Fascist sentiment of the evening, proclaiming the venue as the former home of artist Marcel Hastir, a member of the Second World War Belgian resistance.
Congratulations to Qatar for the success of its brave resistance to pressure and extortion. To our other Arab neighbors: Iran is neither an enemy nor threat. Enough scapegoating, especially with your reckless patron on his way out. Time to take our offer for a strong region, tweeted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.
The brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. They break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. For all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.
Over the weekend, unmarked white coaches were seen driving migrants from Istanbul to the border with Greece, free of charge. People smugglers in the border region have said that they have been given free rein by Erdoğan's government, with one telling media that it was his patriotic duty to get migrants out of Turkey so that his country's economy can improve.
Ashford agrees with the vice president.
This regime is not going to change its behavior, he stressed. It has three times in the past 25 years made unequivocal statements it would give up its nuclear weapons program. It has violated them every time, usually before the ink was dry. That's the pattern Iran is watching. They see this: there are no consequences really for North Korea. Even in the Bush administration, the administration lifted sanctions against North Korea that now we're looking at reimposing. If this is the way North Korea behaves before they can hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, imagine how they're going to behave once they're able to.
Home Office staff did not feel confident about making initial age assessments of applicants claiming to be children, particularly judging whether the claimant was 'significantly over 18' and should be entered into the adult process.
Importantly, mentioning the whole Biden-Burisma affair would have been entirely justified as long as there was a reasonable basis to think that looking into the matter would advance the public interest. To defend merely asking a question, the President would not bear any burden of showing that Vice President Biden (or his son) actually committed any wrongdoing.
it still remains to be seen what happens on the floor of the House on Thursday afternoon, and anything could go wrong for Pelosi before the vote happens, but for now it looks like she maneuvered her way through this rebellion and completed one of the biggest political comebacks in history against all odds.
This kind of positive change is made possible by our students' leadership in creating environments and cultures rooted in respect and inclusion, Khurana wrote. As members of this community, we all have an opportunity to strengthen our culture both for current students and future generations, and I applaud the Fleur-de-Lis on their efforts.
In late December, China passed a new counterterrorism law aimed at protecting its burgeoning international commercial and diplomatic interests.
The Palestinians have argued that settlement activity is a barrier to the so-called peace process. Israel counters that the Palestinian refusal to hold direct negotiations is halting the advancement of the two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority has numerous times walked away from negotiations, including Israeli offers of a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem.
In fact, it's the kind of racism that takes you right back to when Democrats created and enforced segregation and Jim Crow 60 years ago in the Deep South.
The Granma column on Trump's Cuba address last week reserves a particular bitterness towards Haza, however, condemning Trump's decision to showcase his talent. Trump, the column reads, chose to bring to the stage, violin in hand, the son of a Batista henchman from Santiago de Cuba, a murderer who was involved in the death of Frank País.
President Barack Obama's immigration enforcement director is urging President Donald Trump to release thousands of migrants from detention facilities into the U.S. jobs market amid an economic meltdown.
Following an online furor regarding an employee discussing underage pornography working for a corporation that has spent decades marketing itself as a family-friendly company, the controversial Alison Rapp has been terminated. Still — and this is a point that several outlets seem to have missed or rushed to print in order to push a narrative before the facts were established — that's not actually why she was let go.
Trump is accused of abuse of power for withholding military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting for the country's president in exchange for an investigation into his potential presidential election rival Democrat Joe Biden.
I spoke with the ruler in Saudi Arabia, the king, and the crown prince, and the foreign minister, and we spoke about a wide range of issues. And where we're working closely together and being successful we want to redouble our efforts, and where friends think the other one is falling short I was very clear and candid about those things where America is not satisfied, where they're not meeting our expectations. And they – and they appreciate that. By the way, you should know they shared places they think America may not be doing everything. I mean, this is – this is how friends engage. You have conversations where you're not always exactly in the same place, and each tries to ensure that the other understands their position and why it is they're there, and then you do your best to move forward together.
The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported on Saturday:
Breitbart News recently reported that more than 225 Google engineers and other workers have banded together to form a union, following years of growing activism at the tech giant.

Investigators probing the Grenfell Tower fire will have to look at which of those recommendations were implemented in the building and which were not, said Jim Fitzpatrick, a former firefighter who now serves in the House of Commons.
Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), who won reelection narrowly, defeating Republican Matt Rosendale after a hard-fought campaign, believes Ocasio-Cortez's celebrity will taper off. I hope she has a great, successful career, said Tester. I was here when they elected the guy [Sen. Scott Brown] from Massachusetts and he was a flavor of the month.
Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican, acknowledged that because ESAs are taxpayer funds and federal law prohibits the state from asking about a student's immigration status, the funds can be used for illegal aliens. He said, nevertheless, that he opposes marketing ESAs to people who are in the country illegally.
And then there is the Islamic State, which grabbed a good $700 million worth of fully operational Hellfire missiles when it captured the Iraqi city of Mosul. Remember that ISIS doesn't have much in the way of air power to actually fire said missiles, so we can only assume that the cash-hungry organization at least tried to sell them off, Templeton writes.
After a few days, Russian forces used a gas, reported by state news agency Interfax to be fentanyl, to incapacitate the attackers, though more than 100 hostages were also killed, Bloomberg pointed out.
Axios reported that the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized the American supply of roughly 150 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, generics, and brand-name drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market.
President-elect Joe Biden's advisers are reportedly meeting with House Democrats to discuss a swift immigration agenda for the incoming administration, which is almost certain to include some form of amnesty for illegal aliens living in the United States.
Trump added both Perdue and Loeffler stand with him in their desire to deliver $2,000 direct payments to Americans as part of the federal government's coronavirus relief efforts.
On Monday, President Donald Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which reiterates U.S. commitment to a peaceful resolution of the status of Taiwan.
Acton considered expanding Signal's revenue through a donation-driven model via its user base. If Signal gets to a billion users, that's a billion donors. All we have to do is get you so excited about Signal that you want to give us a dollar or 50 rupees, he said. The idea is that we want to earn that donation. The only way to earn that donation is building an innovative and delightful product. That's a better relationship in my opinion.
The licence fee is currently £154.50 a year but is set to go up by £3 in April to £157.50. By comparison, Amazon Prime, which includes a streaming service, costs £79 a year; a single-user Netflix costs £6.99 a month, or £83.88 a year; and NOW TV's basic Entertainment Pass costs £7.99 a month, or £95.88 annually, meaning that a consumer could almost cover the cost of two subscription services for what they are forced to pay per year to support the BBC.
The move further illistrates an apparent attempt by Western technology leaders to bridge the gap between the West with communist authoritarian countries in a bid to find new audiences. Just last week, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with China's propaganda czar in a growing attempt to reintroduce Facebook across the heavily Internet-restricted country after being banned seven years ago for allowing dissidents a platform to speak.
Breitbart News reported in July that Wall Street's Love Affair with Apple May Be Over. With the stock trading within pennies of the all-time-record price of $132.54, it was clear that the upgrade cycle for the newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was only about 20 percent, almost a third lower than previous cycles after two quarters. We added, It would appear that the Apple iOS ecosystem is being challenge.
The white working class, she claimed, have not been able to adapt to modern, multicultural Britain.
The 6.1 percent rate is a sharp drop from the 6.6 percent the year before and marks the third straight drop, though it met the government's target and analysts said leaders were unlikely to open up the stimulus taps just yet.
Abolishing the monarchy has long been a pet project of the hard-left in Britain.

Cervellera also said he fears what will happen to the underground bishops, who have been faithful to Rome for so many years, often with great personal suffering.
I think Trump's victory was an extraordinary one, and he did it by being, frankly, different, not being a run-of-the-mill establishment Republican. I don't think there's an appetite for a Romney run in the Republican party, nor do I think Mitt Romney-style big government establishment Republicanism is frankly popular enough to win in a general election, Paul continued.
The situation is irreversible. The people who are here now, this society is challenged to integrate them and to offer them a perspective on life.

The faithful in the underground Church are freer without the constant control of the Patriotic Association, Cervellera said. One only has to see what is happening in the official Church, which is controlled completely. There are cameras in the parish offices, in the corridors, the police are always there. This is because China greatly fears religions, he said.
China has a tremendous power over North Korea, in my opinion they can help us … lets see what they do, that will have a lot to do with my thinking.

That would be perfectly fine with many environmental groups, for whom opposition to dams has become something of an article of faith over the past several decades. Dams were once thought to provide an environmentally-friendly source of renewable energy, through hydroelectric power. But they destroy whatever habitat finds itself submerged by reservoirs; impede fish migration; and — if managed poorly — create new hazards, such as mechanical failure.
Ms Steinfeld said: We are pleased that today's ruling has shown that the Government must act very soon to end this unfair situation.

Democrats are trying to revive the establishment's 'virtual fence' substitute for a physical barrier. G.W. Bush and Obama ran that $1 billion scam from 2005 to 2015, but it only ensured more migrants, lower wages, and Trump's 2016 election. https://t.co/ZAQiunXoKl — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019

Biden must also strengthen WHO, not only for the response to COVID-19, but also for the full gamut of health challenges, ranging from maternal, child, and adolescent health to injuries, non-communicable diseases, and universal health coverage, the Lancet declares in its op-ed. Addressing health inequities will be crucial in all these domains. WHO's $5.8 billion biennial budget—about the size of a large US hospital—is incommensurate with its global mandate.

It was important for the staff to know not just where she stood on issues, but on personnel as well. I do think that, as a modern First Lady, she had a huge impact on the politics of the White House. I know for a fact that she dialed Ronnie, as she called him, dialed him down on his rhetoric about the Soviet Union because she could see the possibilities of getting something done with Mikhail Gorbachev at that time. And also understood the historic importance of that, if he were the President who could start to unwind the nuclear confrontation.
In a heavily redacted email chain between January 25-26, 2009, Clinton CCs her BlackBerry in a discussion about an envoy to North Korea with her then-Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, and former State Department Special Advisor for Nonproliferation and Arms Control Robert Einhorn.

In the case of Syria, as we've discussed before, I think a lot of people were worried that the retaliation for the chemical weapons attack was just the first step toward a much greater involvement in the Syrian conflict. Those who wanted that said there was a change of policy, and they liked it. Those who opposed it said there was a change in policy and they didn't like it, he said.

Al-Houthi's proclamation, for which he added no verifiable information, follows similar claims by Iranian and Chinese officials that the virus, which originated in Wuhan and first began infecting people in November, was somehow manufactured in an American laboratory.

Most recently, the Koch network lobbied the Trump administration not to enforce an existing law whereby foreign nationals seeking to permanently resettle in the U.S. would need to prove that they will not become drains on the American taxpayer.
The manufacturing jobs boom also defies the predictions that tariffs and trade disputes would weigh on domestic manufacturers outside of steel and aluminum. Instead, manufacturing added jobs at a faster clip than the broader economy.

In a statement, Gabbard asserted that the NSA has been defying the rights and liberties granted to us under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. She criticized the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — namely Section 702 — for bringing on a massive government-led exploitation of personal privacy. She says that the bill will keep our country from backtracking on this progress by permanently codifying this policy change and banning this privacy-invading collection from taking place again.

The irresponsible and cold-blooded words and actions of some federal politicians stand in sharp contrast with many U.S. states and cities which have expressed sympathy and support for Chinese provinces and cities. American businesses, institutions and people have also donated money and supplies to China. Now Chinese businesses and civil society are supporting the American people's epidemic response. The U.S. politicians should be clearly aware that distracting the world from the shortcomings of their response will lead to nothing but division, domestically and internationally, damage the government's credibility, and make the United States weaker rather than stronger. The only correct way out for the U.S. side is to focus on self-improvement, handle its domestic issues and provide convincing evidence that the spread of the virus can be brought under control as promised.

In the last two years, Virginia, Missouri, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Kentucky have all adopted some version of the Campus Free Expression Act advocated by FIRE, mostly with broad bipartisan support.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, in which she said:
The Texas Privacy Act is a thoughtful solution to a sensitive issue. It preserves an expected level of privacy for our public schools and buildings, Kolkhorst said in a written statement. At the same time, it also allows for schools and universities to make personal accommodations for those requesting an alternate setting. Senate Bill 6 also allows Texas businesses to determine their own policy without government interference.

Carney was speaking after the bank kept interest rates on hold – again as expected. How long they will stay on hold will likely depend on how long rate-setters can overlook rising inflation.

6. Return to space. In May, the U.S. finally returned to manned space flight on board the SpaceX Dragon, marking the first time a private company had ever taken humans into orbit. The feat inspired the world, and gave hope to a nation struggling with the pandemic and ongoing riots. It also heralded the start of a new era in space exploration, giving new momentum to Elon Musk's dream of bringing humans to Mars, and restoring U.S. dominance in space ahead of China and other rivals.

Putin did not offer his rubles-for-rugrats scheme as a crisis measure for dealing with demographic collapse. He flaunted it as a sign of inevitable Russian triumph while taunting European nations for their anemic birth rates. His criticism was not without merit, as Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain, Greece, and Portugal all have lower birth rates than Russia – the latter three nations' birth rates are much lower.
This simply kicks the crisis can down the road, Morgan said. Without significant and permanent walk back of their open-borders strategies, without actively listening and continuing to work based on truth in reality, the only result will be a continuing and steady increase in the numbers.

Following the announcement of Amazon's plans to build the new HQ, cities across America began attempting to entice Amazon to develop the building in their city. Kansas City Mayor Sly James bought and reviewed as many as 1,000 Amazon products in an attempt to convince Amazon to locate there while Stonecrest, Georgia, offered to rename the city Amazon, Georgia, and give the company 345 acres of land on which to develop their new HQ for free. However, it seems that many of these locations didn't fit Amazon's criteria which included being close to a major airport and the city's ability to attract talented tech workers.

Rather than use the savings gained from the lower rates to pay down the principal on the debt, the opposite has occurred—it has encouraging even more reckless borrowing.

These two economies are in the worst financial shape, hamstrung by falling birth rates and debt loads well above 100% of GDP.

Step up and recognize that there is a political game going on in these organizations, and that in order to fight the politicization of these organizations, you have to be willing to call it out for what it is, and to appoint individuals to U.S. leadership positions inside the U.S. government who are willing to fight to keep these organizations technical and apolitical, by recognizing that other people want to treat them as political, he advised.

From a layman's perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist – well, 'Obamacare Lite' it's been called – approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for, Gaffney said. I think that's what Donald Trump set out to do. That's what he promised the voters. It's what I think you could get a majority of the Congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you're not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support.

Given that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for Sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. Watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. He said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and Native American groups. And he added that the Sites Reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout California — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.

while his peers in the Republican Party tried to strike a balance between good legal immigrants and bad illegal ones, he has always taken a skeptical attitude toward immigrants and immigration, period, believing that the burden of proof ought to be on an immigrant to prove that she deserves to come to or stay in the US, and preferring, always, to keep worthy people out rather than let anyone unworthy in. … As Sessions has put it, more people want to move to the United States than the country could ever possibly accept; the dividing line between whom the country should accept and whom it shouldn't, he believes, should be determined by the American people based on who they feel serves the national interest — defined as assimilating into American culture and helping the fortunes of American workers.

This huge imported workforce ensures that executives rarely have to compete for American graduates by offering higher wages, even when profits are growing. A 2020 report by the Federal Reserve said median salaries for U.S. graduates fell by two percent from 2016 to 2019 as blue-collar salaries rose amid President Donald Trump's border policies.
The U.S. is nearly alone in granting birthright citizenship to the children of foreign nationals. For example, the U.S. and Canada are two of the only developed nations with birthright citizenship.

America's greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry plummeted more than 10 percent in 2020, reaching their lowest levels in at least three decades as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on the nation's economy, according to an estimate published Tuesday by the Rhodium Group. The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks.

An Al Qaeda-linked jihadist group Hay'at Tahir al-Sham (HTS) is gaining swaths of territory in the northern province of Idlib, usurping control from Turkish-backed groups connected to the National Liberation Front (NLF). The goals of the group, otherwise known as the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, are centered on dominating as much territory as possible ahead of planned talks between Russia and Turkey, to bring a final end to the almost eight-year Syrian civil war. Based on a previous agreement, Turkey was supposed to have reigned in the extremist outfit – now raising concerns it may not have the capacity to do so.

Proponents of closed borders and small social safety nets have a tendency to highlight the tension between citizen and noncitizen, to imply or explicitly state that the only way to help one group is to deprive the other.

I think it was a mistake to certify compliance, but as I say, it's exactly what the State Department did in the early Bush administration with the agreed framework with North Korea.

Halting construction of the border wall system, stopping deportations for 100 days, expanding DACA, ending MPP [Migrant Protection Protocols] , providing free health care, providing amnesty to millions of individuals here illegally, and the list goes on and on. This isn't an immigration strategy; it is an open-borders strategy. If your strategy consists of releasing you into the interior of the United States once you've illegally entered and have been apprehended, protecting you from local deportation, and providing substantial rewards such as free health care, you have just created a complete system of incentives. Who wouldn't try to enter with Release, Protect, and Reward being the new open border strategy?

Over the past week or so, we had reports of strong growth and rising wages (good things!), which sent bonds and stocks down (bad for most investors) due to justifiable fears that the Fed will tighten faster than is priced in the credit markets. The surge in growth and wages came because of both the fiscal stimulation and the rekindling of animal spirits, thrusting the economy into late-cycle capacity constraints, which is leading to the expectations of faster Fed tightening. In other words, fiscal stimulation is hitting the gas, which is driving the economy forward into the capacity constraints, which is triggering interest rate increases that are hitting the brakes, first in the markets and later in the economy. This confluence of circumstances will make it difficult for the Fed to get monetary policy exactly right. This is classic late-cycle behavior (when it's difficult to get monetary policy exactly right, which leads to recessions), though it is more exaggerated because the durations of assets are uniquely long, which means that when interest rates are low, prices of assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than when interest rates are high.
It is actually a silver lining in this pandemic, that Planned Parenthood and many other health providers have actually been able to really lean into telehealth infrastructure and provide service, she said.
Although music, TV, and film productions are allowed to operate, the health department said late last month, we ask you to strongly consider pausing work for a few weeks during this catastrophic surge in Covid cases.

Following the announcement of Amazon's plans to build the new HQ, cities across America began attempting to entice Amazon to develop the building in their city. Kansas City Mayor Sly James bought and reviewed as many as 1,000 Amazon products in an attempt to convince Amazon to locate there while Stonecrest, Georgia, offered to rename the city Amazon, Georgia, and give the company 345 acres of land on which to develop their new HQ for free. However, it seems that many of these locations didn't fit Amazon's criteria which included being close to a major airport and the city's ability to attract talented tech workers.
Matteo Salvini also released a statement on behalf of the centre-right coalition, saying: The centre-right is the country's leading political force and after a summit that confirmed the great unity of the coalition, asks that the prime minister take note of the crisis and resign immediately or, otherwise, appear in Parliament tomorrow to ask for a vote of confidence.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border, and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do? Would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?

In the summer of 2019, Sical told his wife that he could use one of their three under-18 children to get through Trump's border like her brother and nephew had done shortly before.

The law prohibited abortions based on the sex or race of the child or a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome or any other disability. The law also required that the remains of aborted babies be disposed of in a dignified fashion proper to human remains, rather than merely thrown out in the trash.
McClintock's office was well-apprised of the state of talks between the various parties, including outgoing Governor Jerry Brown and incoming governor Gavin Newsom. The two liberal Democrats asked the SWRCB to postpone its decision, originally scheduled for November, to Dec. 12 to leave time for voluntary agreements with local water authorities. (The day following my meeting with McClintock, the SWRCB voted to approve the Bay-Delta Plan, despite some agreements being reached.)
Rosebush said there was a real compact between the Reagans and they worked together on so many things. They supported each other in areas of weakness, and Nancy worked hard to ensure Ronald Reagan's success. This relationship ultimately benefitted the American people, according to Rosebush.

Although some PMU fighters fought alongside the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, some of those Shiite fighters may have American blood on their hands having clashed with the United States armed forces following the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
He continued, Well, we have both a covert counter-terrorism operation in Turkey to try to — there is an active plot underway I should say, this is imminent threat. We had six operatives taken into custody. ISIS operatives from the caliphate who basically have been talking about this imminent threat and plotting it. So right now in Turkey what is underway is an attempt to stop this plot. This gives you insight into what the president is talking about—the sort of sinister nature of ISIS and terrorists and Taliban—they would go after little children and kill them in the name of their religion. I think it really shows you what we're at war with right now. And why we need to win this war.
This doesn't mean that dangerous criminals will be walking the streets. Those who threaten Americans' safety can and must continue to be detained. … When an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs in an ICE facility, the detainees won't be the only ones at risk. An outbreak will expose the hundreds of ICE agents and officers, medical personnel, contract workers, and others who work in these facilities to the virus. Once exposed, many of them will unknowingly take the virus home to their family and community.

Under First Amendment standards, universities may put in place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on where and when demonstrations can take place on campus in order to limit disruptions to regular college activities and functions. However, forcing students to apply for a permit two weeks in advance in order to conduct all sorts of demonstrations — whether involving a group of three people or one of three hundred — is nowhere near reasonable. Promising students that they'll have the right to hold a demonstration is meaningless and misleading when students are prevented from actually reacting to current and still-unfolding events in the moment. USC must revise this policy so that students are not discouraged from protesting altogether by a burdensome permit application process, and so that students can instead conduct spontaneous expressive activities on campus.
After several months of meeting at the North Branch library, on Wednesday (2/19), the Nashville Chapter of Black Lives Matter was contacted through email and by phone that library administrators received complaints regarding BLM's policy of general meetings being open to black and non-black people of color only. Although meeting rooms are available to local organizations for use of a cultural nature, we were informed that due to the library policy of open meetings for meeting room use, all future meetings held at the library would be cancelled. Ironically, all cancelled dates were in February during Black History Month. The Nashville Chapter of BLM has this policy in place to center the voices and experiences of people of color that have historically been excluded or segregated within supposedly public spaces. Black and/or people of color only spaces are often questioned and viewed with suspicion, though there is seldom any interrogation of white-only board rooms and staffs. However, we view these spaces as integral to healing and community building, particularly to those who have experienced racialized violence and ardently maintain this policy as imperative to the work and mission of BLM.

It was this adherence to ideas and the rule of law that separated Washington from a Napoleon Buonaparte—another great man who helped topple the French Monarchy to established a republic, but eventually drove his nation to an empire of arbitrary rule. And it was the commitment to the Constitution and ultimately the virtue of the American people that allowed America's founding generation to create an empire of liberty. Washington understood this when he become the first president of the United States. He said in his inaugural address, The sacred fire of liberty and destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.

On the other hand, Graham Templeton at ExtremeTech argues that exposing Hellfire technology to Cuba might not matter all that much because that technology is already available. Not only is there a strong possibility that hackers have looted Hellfire data during numerous raids on U.S. systems, but the weapons have been sold to dubious allies like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, who would have had many opportunities to share Hellfire tech with their even more dubious allies.

They know they cannot afford to be seen blocking border security. We have to remember that Nancy Pelosi is not in the Speaker's chair now because voters want to abolish ICE or open the border.

Van Jones was one of the early proponents of the Green New Deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems. An Amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of FDR's original New Deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. This also happens to be exactly what Ocasio-Cortez promises in her version of the Green New Deal. Wiki said, The book is a detailed proposal for a 'Green New Deal.' In 2009, Jones resigned from the White House under a cloud for supporting the view that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the Green New Deal failed to get traction.

Nationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.

But with inflation very low despite extremely low levels of unemployment and stronger-than-expected growth, many now think the Fed should rethink its model. The economy appears to be able to grow at a faster rate and unemployment to fall further than Fed economists thought was possible without inflation getting out of control.

The articles of impeachment before us were not even the first ones House Democrats introduced. This was go-around number seven. Those previously-alleged 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors' included things like being impolite to the press and to professional athletes. It insults the intelligence of the American people to pretend this was a solemn process reluctantly begun because of withheld foreign aid. No, Washington Democrats' position on this president has been clear for years. … Here's their real position: Washington Democrats think President Donald Trump committed a 'High Crime or Misdemeanor' the moment he defeated Secretary [Hillary] Clinton in the 2016 election. That is the original sin of this presidency: That he won and they lost.

Giuseppe Civati, a former member of the PD, said that the Salvini migration and security decrees should be totally abolished and advocated the return of the so-called humanitarian protection residency permit which allows migrants who fail asylum claims because they are not legitimate refugees to remain in the country — a policy that was scrapped by Salvini.
Russia is unusual among demographically-challenged countries in having an official blueprint for dealing with the problem, but it is evidently a rather vague blueprint that has yet to produce much in the way of effective policy. Berman suggests the Kremlin knock off its extensive military spending and foreign adventurism in places like Ukraine and Syria, and spend more on health care and education. The Kremlin is not very likely to heed that advice.
According to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioids alone, including heroin (15,950) and drugs like fentanyl and its offshoot carfentanil (29,418) killed more people (about 49,000) than terrorist attacks across the globe in 2017, which left 26,400 individuals dead.

The goal should never be a two-state solution, the goal is peace. And there are many ways of moving in that direction and there are several potential endpoints. And I think that it's useful to the Israelis and for us to remind everybody that the goal is peace.

Here's what Eurasia Group sees as the risks for 2018.
Under that memorandum, ICE may refuse to take custody of dangerous aliens from state and local law enforcement agencies when such aliens exhibit criminal behavior, but have not been convicted of a felony and most misdemeanors, Goodlatte and Grassley wrote, noting that the mere fact that an alien is illegally present should be enough for ICE to take custody.

The Epoch Times report is not the first one to accuse the Chinese regime of secretly cremating large numbers of individuals suspected of carrying the novel coronavirus – or refusing to take patients in hospitals and confirm their disease.

At issue is DHS' selective immigration enforcement policies — laid out in a Johnson memo offered in conjunction with President Obama's 2014 executive amnesty — in which the Obama administration prioritizes removal for illegal immigrants only if they have been convicted of felonies, are a threat to national security, have multiple misdemeanors, or are recent border crossers.
But Sessions isn't using his leadership of the DOJ simply to make the immigration court system more efficient. He's using the full extent of his power as attorney general to reduce the likelihood that a case gets resolved (quickly or otherwise) in an immigrant's favor — removing tools and resources that make courts more efficient but improve immigrants' odds of winning their cases, while pressuring immigration judges to plow through cases at an unheard-of rate. He's removing the safety valves from the pipeline while increasing the pressure.

Similarly, President Barack Obama had several high-ranking Republicans in his administration. During his first term, Obama appointed then-GOP congressman Ray Lahood, a fellow Illinoisan, to the post of transportation secretary. Obama also kept on President George W. Bush's defense secretary, Robert Gates, in order to ensure continuity in national security matters. The retention of Gates was followed up by the appointment of two well-known Republican elected officials, then-Rep. John McHugh (R-NY) and Gov. Jon Huntsman (R-UT), to the posts of secretary of the army and ambassador to China, respectively.

It is absurd for House Democrats to argue that any reference to the Biden-Burisma affair had no purpose other than damaging the President's potential political opponent. The two participants on the call—the leaders of two sovereign nations—clearly understood the discussion to advance the U.S. foreign policy interest in ensuring that Ukraine's new President felt free, in President Zelenskyy's words, to restore the honesty to corruption investigations.

This is a highly significant document. It's extraordinary that it's been released decades early, Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at ANU, said. I think it's a signal about the kind of continuity that the permanent government of America, or if you like the officials, want to see in America's relations with the Indo-Pacific, including in managing China's power.

Human Rights Watch's Andrea Prasow praised Omar as a leader on the subject:  With an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that Congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.
Senator Paul is hardly the only observer to see Abrams' possible appointment this way. The Washington Post found it surprising Abrams was ever under consideration, acknowledging his resumé and reputation as a tough negotiator, but finding little in common with Trump's foreign policy vision beyond being fiercely pro-Israel. Fox News host Tucker Carlson said he was baffled while interviewing Senator Paul about his op-ed. Doug Bandow at Forbes said choosing Abrams would be a particularly stunning reversal of candidate Trump's claim to reject his predecessors' failed policies of perpetual war.

Though Trump in the campaign said he'd renegotiate or dismantle the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel fiercely opposes, as president he's continuing to implement the accord while examining whether it should stand and hitting Iran with other, non-nuclear sanctions. GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, rather than urging that the deal be terminated, told AIPAC that the U.S. must vigorously enforce the deal and tighten the screws on Iranian compliance.

I will respect your choice to leave your diction choices 'as is' and to make whatever political and linguistic statement you want to make by doing so, the professor wrote. By the same token, I will still need to subtract a point because your choice will not be made in the letter or spirit of this particular class, which is all about having you and other students looking beneath your assumptions and understanding that 'mankind' does not mean 'all people' to all people. It positively does not.
If Trump takes this unprecedented action, it WILL be challenged in the courts. This is why we fight. Give $5 now. We won't allow Trump to hold our country hostage with his fearmongering and scare tactics. The courts may be our last line of defense against Trump's authoritarian impulses and now is the time to show him we won't stand down. Give $5 now to help us fight back.

Yes on the April Corley case, and with respect to conversations about prisoners, there are few things that occupy more of my mind than getting Americans back from everyplace, and the Iranian regime has been particularly brutal with respect to the unlawful detention of Americans. I mean, Bob Levinson goes back now years. I don't want to say more than to say that we are very focused. We have the whole team, certainly at the State Department but across the entire United States Government, that night and day tirelessly is working to return Americans wherever they're wrongfully detained. And that certainly includes folks that are held inside the Islamic Republic of Iran as well.

THE FACTS: Actually, the White House rationale for canceling the trip was contradicted a short time later by Trump, who said he postponed because a CDC employee in Atlanta was thought to have contracted the infectious disease and because of the one person, they didn't want me going.

CASTRO: What I believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That's a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know – and many of them have said – in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric, but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer.

We cannot and will not allow voices like Tucker Carlson to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts from the likes of Moveon.org, Media Matters and Sleeping Giants. Attempts were made last month to bully and terrorize Tucker and his family at their home. He is now once again being threatened via Twitter by far left activist groups with deeply political motives. While we do not advocate boycotts, these same groups never target other broadcasters and operate under a grossly hypocritical double standard given their intolerance to all opposing points of view.

If you're a Republican and still want Republican policy but don't want the tweets and the madness, you might go to him. If you're a Democrat that just wants to beat Trump at all costs, you see Trump as just this force of evil, and you just want the money that it's's going to take to defeat him, and you think this guy will spend $2 billion to beat him, you might vote for him.

In his letter, the pope does not descend to the level of practical public policy concerning immigration, and elsewhere in the text criticizes groups of Christians who give excessive importance to certain rules, customs or ways of acting, as if only one viewpoint were acceptable.

The country exported only $1.867 billion non-oil goods during November 21-December 22, less than half of Iran's monthly average during the current fiscal year, which started on March 21, 2018. The plunge in exports was partly due to a complete stoppage in ultra-light oil (gas condensate) sales, which Iran includes in non-oil export basket. The monthly gas condensate export has averaged at about $330 million, or only a seventh of the drop in total non-oil exports during November 21-December 22. In the other world, U.S. oil-related sanctions also seriously impacted Iran's non-oil exports as well. The U.S. also imposed financial sanctions on Iran in August, but the details of customs statistics does not show any meaningful change in the non-oil exports level during the August-November period. During the first nine months of the fiscal year (FY), the country has exported about 5.6 million metric tons of gas condensate at $2.776 billion, which indicates a 50% decline year-on-year. However, the country's total non-oil exports during March 21-December 22 reached $33.36 billions, or 4.5% more than the same period in last FY. Despite this growth, Iran has fulfilled less than 70% of its non-oil export target for the period. Its non-fuel imports also declined 13.3% year-on-year to $32.62 billion.

Let's face it: those 11 million [illegal migrants] are not sitting on their duff. They're working somewhere. They may be working under a fake Social [Security Number], they may be working as an independent subcontractor, but they're working and they've got skills. A lot of these workers working in the underground economy, used to work for [construction company] people like me. They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they're 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they're working for cash and not paying taxes.

A month after the election, Sanders hosted the National Town Hall on Climate Change Solutions—featuring Bill McKibben, activist Van Jones, and Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—to introduce the Green New Deal to the world. While this event looked like a gathering of disparate groups throwing their support behind this new movement, it was actually a gathering of compatriots working together to promote their common agenda. Specifically:
Spectator editor Fraser Nelson observed that Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) tables have white working-class boys literally at the bottom of the heap during an interview with the Labour MP.
As a result of the backlash, the editorial team at the Dartmouth distanced themselves from Spector's column, claiming that it does not represent the team's views. Guest columns, and any column published in The Dartmouth not under the authorship of 'The Dartmouth Editorial Board,' do not represent the views of the newspaper or the editors who worked to bring it to publication, they wrote.
Brill described a protected class that is insulated from the decrepit state of the social safety net because it does not rely on government for essential benefits and has minimal contact with enforcement agencies like the Internal Revenue Service.

The USA should always be paying the lowest rate. No Inflation! Trump tweeted in September of 2019. It is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing.
President Trump has already signed more bills cutting job-killing regulations than any president in American history already, Pence said, highlighting the more than a dozen pieces legislation taking advantage of the Congressional Review Act to reign in regulations issued by the administrative state.
It is time for the UK to work with others across the free world to build an alliance of democracies to defend liberty and counter the CCP's repression and aggression.
Building a wall is kind of an obvious idea for protecting a border. Not only have walls been used from time immemorial to defend borders, but those precise three words have been used to describe what should happen at our specific border thousands of times before Trump used them, according to a quick Nexis search.
McConnell was meeting behind closed doors later Tuesday with GOP senators as they negotiate the terms of the trial.

BREAKING: Senator @DougJones just released his statement on Senator on his Impeachment Decision. Jones *will vote to convict the President on both articles of impeachment: — Kellie Meyer (@KellieMeyerNews) February 5, 2020
Actress and comedian Sarah Silverman started off ripping Trump on May 18 with her assertion the new rule is not about protecting life, but about limiting women's choices while courting a specific voting block:
What's more, the policies are supposed to discourage that behavior in the first place. Clawbacks still aren't invoked all that much, but they have come up lately. Earlier this year, two Wells Fargo (WFC, +1.42%) executives gave back some of their pay amid the bank's recent phony accounts scandal, the publication continued. Yahoo has a clawback provision, and Mayer's pay is covered by it. But the company's policy only permits Yahoo to recoup executive pay 'in the event of a restatement of incorrect Yahoo financial results' — basically accounting fraud, and that's it. Not covered by a clawback: Allegedly covering up two hacking incidents so you can complete a multi-billion sale of your company's main business.
Senate Republicans are signaling they would reject the idea of simply voting to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Trump as he has suggested. They are considering whether to allow a vote on such a motion to dismiss and another to subpoena testimony from new witnesses.
Instead, Democrats opted to pursuit radical legislation covering a flurry of progressive policy agendas unrelated to the crisis at hand.
Even so, the report showed employment at hotels was flat. Restaurant hiring jumped by more than 50,000, but most economists attributed that to relatively warm weather.

In major policy shift, China will demolish thousands of migrant homes in cities
Regardless of political predilection, during years of drought, one thought pervades public consciousness: how much water is left? Residents anxiously turn to the state's reservoirs as they slowly drain, and dry.
Pompeo told the crown prince that his Middle East journey, which has taken him to Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, had been good so far. I want to talk to you about a couple of places we've been. We think we learned a lot along the way that will be important going forward, he said. The prince replied that the Saudis would try to add more positivity, as much as we can.
An NHS spokesperson claimed: The NHS has been clear that no patient who could benefit from treatment should be denied it and, thanks to the hard work of nurses, doctors and countless others in creating surge capacity and hospitals working together and that has not happened.
This is not the National Front which is anxious; the reality is anxiety, she said, before insisting her party would never have allowed in such a migrant wave from the Middle East.
The TV tax is compulsory for anyone who watches live or records live television or uses BBC iPlayer. Payment is mandatory even if you watch live programming on a computer, phone, or other device and even if you watch live television from other providers but do not watch BBC programming at all.
More broadly, the vice president praised the vital role small business owners play in the American economy. Every single one of you is a profile in courage. Every single one of you took a risk when you set up shop, he said. When small business is strong, America is strong.
A shocking report published Saturday local time by the Epoch Times revealed that crematoriums in China are struggling to keep up with the hundreds of bodies they are receiving, suggesting Beijing is undercounting the number of coronavirus deaths in the country.
The sad result of the attempt to create more long weekends is this uninspiring, mishmash holiday that falls between Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's on February 12, and ends up being barely more than a bland, generic February day off to clean house. This is a shame; the Father of Our Country deserves better.
The policy and social context will always influence Australians' views on population growth. Most people are now supportive of cultural diversity as a by-product of population growth.
Sources familiar with the meetings told Politico that Biden's policy advisers met with Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA), as well as Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) and Linda Sanchez (D-CA) to discuss an immigration agenda:
He says the company must not be seen to be censoring what our customers read and influencing their freedom of choice.
With President Trump in office, the opportunity to tackle OPEC's outsized influence has presented itself. The swift establishment of this committee will give it the potential to frame the administration's energy agenda for at least the next four years—and ensure, most importantly, that our energy system truly works in our national interest.
But instead of explaining to the Times' readers why Trump's promise to build a wall shook the political world to its foundation, the newspaper trotted out campaign adviser Sam Nunberg's boast that he invented build the wall because Trump's mind tends to wander. It was only a dumb talking point, you see, not a serious campaign pledge.
Denmark proposed the new measures as Sweden tightened its borders, leading to fears thousands of refugees would choose the country as their final place of residence. Hundreds of thousands passed through Denmark last year, but most were simply on their way to Sweden.

The database seems to bear a spiritual resemblance to the short-lived Trump Accountability Project, an effort promoted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) that was intended to publicly ostracize Trump administration officials and staffers. The project was abandoned after it received backlash from public figures across the political spectrum.
The European Commission has described the deal as the most ambitious agreement that China has ever concluded with a third country.
The Article 50 negotiating period, supposed to expire in March 2019, had already been extended twice. Johnson found he had no effective means to break the deadlock. Some alterations were made to May's deal in an effort to force Remain diehards to agree at least some form of Brexit, with the substance of the changes being the subject of fiery debate at the time but so minor that few now remember the details — they were not sufficient to convince the DUP that Northern Ireland was being sold out, at any rate.
In France, where more than 280 people are infected, the government said it would requisition all face mask stocks and production in the coming months in response to the outbreak.
Eric Schneiderman's missive comes in the wake of an Atlanta Falcons coach asking Ohio State cornerback Eli Apple at the NFL Combine: So, do you like men? A coach at the Senior Bowl also allegedly asked Michael Sam's agent in 2014 if he had seen [Sam] around girls. Sam subsequently revealed his homosexuality well in advance of that year's draft.
He spoke of how the inheritance tax hurts the ability of families to carry on a family businesses.
THE FACTS: That's misleading, given the far more cautious pronouncements of federal public health officials and scientists. They say a vaccine is probably more than a year away at best and there are no special treatments for COVID-19. The notion of a quick cure is not in their vocabulary as they focus on trying to help people avoid getting the disease in the first place.
However, the restoration of the CAM program would not automatically ensure the delivery of any migrants to their illegal parents in the United States unless the Democrats also demanded a minimal number of transfers each year.
Much of what we heard from President Trump during this senseless shutdown has been misinformation and even malice, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.
He also referenced the 1.9 million Americans that signed up for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, but have not followed through on paying their premiums. This figure comes from a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report released on Monday, detailing the 10.3 million who have paid their premiums as of March 15, out of the 12.2 million who have signed up.
He's the first president really in a lifetime who has had the ability to declare victory and say, 'We need to come home.' He needs a defense secretary who agrees with him and will carry out the policy, not try to stymie the policy, he added.
Clinton herself put her name on a separate fundraising email pitch via her associated Onward Together progressive organization seeking funds to fight back against the administration's hateful rhetoric and harmful policies — donate directly to the organizations helping to reunite and provide support to families seeking asylum at the border.
I listened to the analysts, and I heard only two things mentioned that make this different from the previous peace plan:
The new 501(c)4 called We Build the Wall, Inc., has formed a board of directors that Folgate will lead and a team of advisers 'to provide critical guidance on the project's legal, engineering, contracting, environmental, accounting, maintenance, and real estate issues and serve on the advisory board and or the construction, finance and or audit committees', a Business Wire press release said.

To recap, 5G — which stands for 'fifth generation' — is the next wave of wireless telecoms technology. Insanely, against the advice of allies from the U.S. to Australia, the British government has decided to award the contract for this strategically vital communications system to a country which is not only a major geopolitical rival but which is also infamous for spying on its competitors: China.
Apple says that it will invest $60 million to support minority entrepreneurs, a move that comes as part of a racial equity and justice project to challenge systemic racism.
Experts argue that the most efficient way to reduce the wage gap would be to encourage employers to put less emphasis on asking their employees to work long hours and to allow them to work remotely.

Damian Collins, the head of the committee that is also investigating the impact of social media on recent elections, had invited Zuckerberg to answer for a catastrophic failure of process.
I have hoped the Republican Party would reform from within and end its assault on the LGBTQ community. Yet, the party continues to champion policies that marginalize me out of existence, define me as an eccentric character and persecute me for using the public restrooms that correspond to my gender identity. As a result, the GOP's positions have forced me to refocus my attention away from their agendas I support. Instead, I find myself focusing on issues to protect myself and others like me. Every dollar spent defending transgender rights is one dollar less I can contribute toward other party initiatives.
The Propel Center was designed by Ed Farm, an education social justice group that works primarily with Birmingham City Schools and adults in the greater Birmingham area. Its key partners are Apple and Alabama Power.

This is a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer. If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. Serious action MUST be taken NOW! the president tweeted. There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!
On August 19, 2016, the same day as Paul Manafort's resignation from the Trump campaign, Dave Bowdich in FBI Director James Comey's office initiates an email exchange with the subject line OGA [Other Government Agency], in which he tells the top management of the FBI (Randy Coleman, Josh Skule, Michael Steinbach, Amy Hess, Valerie Parlave, James Turgal, James Trainor, Laura Bucheit, Bill Priestap and WL Bean), We are clear to [redacted]. DJ [likely Associate Executive Assistant Director Dave Johnson] will determine the composition of the team with your collective input. This gets our foot in the door, but we can scale as necessary later.
Just about every media report on the outcome of this military investigation mentions the controversial U.S. airstrike in the Kunduz region from October 2015, which killed 42 at a Doctors Without Borders hospital, and led to disciplinary actions against a two-star U.S. general and 15 other military personnel.
Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin Asset Management and co-sponsor of the proposal, said, We're at a critical juncture in the life of Apple – where it needs to pivot from the iPhone and the Mac to captivate consumers again. How can Apple be sure it knows its customers well enough to build the smartest web services and AI assistants when its executive ranks still don't reflect the diversity of key markets?

Poblete argues it is improbable that Congress would not have known about the missile and, in fact, claims congressional sources who assured him several key members and their staffers were in the loop. He argues that it was hypocritical for knowledgeable members to sit on the Hellfire story while opposing Obama's Cuba policy on other grounds… or possibly collusion with the administration to keep the story secret until now.
Adelson is survived by three sons, three daughters, and eleven grandchildren.

The Chamber supports a deal that combines increasing border security with protection and legal status for Dreamers and long-term beneficiaries of the TPS program, Bradley continues.

Now that Trump has finally turned to the campaign promise that won him the election — build a wall and deport illegals — the Democrats, the media and even most Republicans are hysterical.

Redlining is a racist policy where mortgage lenders refuse mortgages to people who live in a certain neighborhood. Most of those neighborhoods are minority neighborhoods.
All we're getting from the media on immigration is an avalanche of lies, neurotically repeated by people citing one another:
Alida Garcia with Mark Zuckerberg's FWD.us attended the meeting. As Breitbart News has chronicled, FWD.us is one of the leading pressure groups to expand the number of foreign visa workers that corporations are allowed to import to take high-paying, white-collar U.S. jobs.
Alison Rapp was terminated due to violation of an internal company policy involving holding a second job in conflict with Nintendo's corporate culture. Though Ms. Rapp's termination follows her being the subject of criticism from certain groups via social media several weeks ago, the two are absolutely not related.

We wish Ms. Rapp well in her future endeavors.

I taught in an all-girls STEAM academy that was all about empowerment for women, Woodward said Tuesday. The sad thing is that if these girls find out that I'm being punished for something that I did nearly 20 years ago and had no control of and fought to get out of, well, what does that say about empowerment?

We basically got too much of a good thing, said Brill, describing the premise of his new book and his cover essay for TIME magazine's May 28 issue. What I mean by that is the kinds of core American values that we cherish were kind of hijacked and have been used and turned against us.

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have spent the past year courting the Democratic Party's base with appeals to the working class and sweeping promises to curb climate change.

(The same office once displayed a Confederate flag on his desk.) At the same time, he said, he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is the culture of America based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? Mr. King said.

The law also demands campuses use the actual legal definition of student-on-student harassment handed down by the Supreme Court, behavior so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims' educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities.

Levinson. … [Kim Lane Scheppele, a legal scholar and professor at Princeton University's Center for Human Values] said if Trump continues to make the case that the wall is necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the U.S., then he may be able to make the case that building a wall has a military purpose and he has a freer hand.

This isn't an immigration strategy; it is an open-borders strategy. If your strategy consists of releasing you into the interior of the United States once you've illegally entered and have been apprehended, protecting you from local deportation, and providing substantial rewards such as free health care, you have just created a complete system of incentives. Who wouldn't try to enter with Release, Protect, and Reward being the new open border strategy?

We paid lip service to that through something called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which for 40 years running, through the Kennedy administration and the Nixon administration, Carter, all the way on down, has been a total fiasco. No one paid attention because the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of that program were largely in the middle of the country.

Religiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values, with 70% voting for Democrats in 2018, 80% supporting same-sex marriage, and 61% saying immigrants make American society stronger, the DNC stated, further defending secularists by asserting they have often been subjected to unfair bias and exclusion in American society, particularly in the areas of politics and policymaking where assumptions of religiosity have long predominated.
The Arkansas senator's action also prevented a political headache for many GOP politicians who would have faced a backlash from many Americans graduates for not opposing Ryan's bill to outsource jobs to Irish graduates by expanding the existing Australian-only E-3 visa program.

The statute in question establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate.

Democrats are trying to revive the establishment's 'virtual fence' substitute for a physical barrier. G.W.

If it is an HF [high-frequency or over-the-horizon] radar, then it would enormously boost China's capacity to monitor ships and aircraft in the South China Sea. Cuarteron is the logical place for such an installation because it is the southernmost of China's features in the Spratlys, meaning that it would be the best place if you wanted early warning radar to give notice of ships or planes coming up from the Strait of Malacca and other areas to the south such as Singapore. This would be very important in a Chinese anti-access area denial strategy that sought to reduce the ability of the U.S. to operate freely in the South China Sea, including bringing forces up through the South China Sea in case of any future crisis in Northeast Asia.
Friday's panel appeared to be designed to reassure markets. Powell had remarks written down on a piece of paper despite the informality of the panel setting. That seemed to indicate that he had chosen his words carefully.

They'll change the filibuster rule which as you know is very difficult and we'll never be able to get that back and that means they are creating a single-party system. This is what was tried in Cuba and Venezuela and North Korea and Iran and all the places we know it's failed. They want total control. AOC said that 'we want to win these two seats so we don't have to negotiate.' Then, defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, amnesty, higher taxes, socialization of our healthcare, and the Green New Deal.

Christianity is technically legal in China. China allows only five legal religions – Christianity, Catholicism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Islam – but only allows the practice of each under the auspices of patriotic, state-controlled institutions. Chinese Catholics cannot legally be part of the Roman Catholic Church, only of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Similarly, non-Catholic Christians in China can only partake in practices led by the Three-Self Patriotic Church, a communist entity. Communism is by definition an atheist political ideology, which has made the vast majority of Christians reject communist-led Christian services.

He added, And increasingly, we are hearing from Republicans, Democrats, journalists, citizens, on the basis of real hard information why it may be that a consensus is developing that Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States, because of his actions in obstructing justice because of what we just saw in Syria, because of his ignorance on foreign policy, because of his putting his self-interest and that of his family ahead of the national interest, but above all the lying.
Here is how it began its snarky put-down:
Now that the Census Bureau has stopped counting the illegal alien population, it is unlikely for the order to be carried out.

1. The border issue is about national security, the first priority of government. Americans are used to fights over immigration policy. This is different. The nation faces a crisis at its southern border. The drug cartels are taking advantage of our open border to smuggle drugs, weapons, and people. They are also waging a bloody civil war that bleeds over into our country. Everything else the government does is secondary to protecting the country. There is literally no point to opening the government until politicians are prepared to take care of its first priority.
Ning Jizhe, commissioner of the NBS, said momentum remained generally stable through the year and said the same could be expected in 2020.

He also stated on the campaign page, '100 percent of your donations will go to the Trump Wall. If for ANY reason we don't reach our goal we will refund your donation.' However, that did not happen. This means all donors will receive a refund, Whithorne continued. If a donor does not want a refund, and they want their donation to go to the new organization, they must proactively elect to redirect their donation to that organization. If they do not take that step, they will automatically receive a full refund.

The war for Yemen's future is no longer between Saudi and Iranian loyalists, but between Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The United States must push for a Saudi-Houthi pact immediately, so they can collaborate to fend off the jihadists. The recent bombings in Ivory Coast, and IS's storming of areas in Libya, prove that Washington has yet to grasp the threat posed by IS and Al-Qaeda, or at least adopt a consistent strategy to fight them.

Now, they say the NSC is reviewing it. They're looking at further sanctions because of Iran's terrorist activity, but there's plenty of evidence out there already publicly that Iran is violating the deal, he contended. It's not just a problem, as Tillerson said later in the day, that ultimately, the deal just delays Iran's nuclear weapon; it doesn't prevent it. It doesn't delay it, either, if they're violating it, which I think they're doing.

When a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples 'the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage' … we reverse the state court's judgment.

· We never issued a booklet to staff to tell them how to/how not to speak to customers on board. · We DID put some collateral on our corporate intranet about inclusive language in the workplace as part of a focus on inclusion during the month of March. · These were not rules or a change of policy or procedures. It was simply some material to start an internal discussion about how language choice can impact how inclusive (or not) a workplace is.

For his part, Putin was as gracious as a big winner with big plans can afford to be, declaring after his meeting with Kerry, What we have been able to achieve on Syria has been possible only thanks to the position of the U.S. top political leadership, President Obama.
We're simply trying to open some community dialogue and get people to understand some rules are okay to change, Joe said.
I would guess, in a year or period when political opinion polling has not been exactly accurate, it's going to be very hard to say with any certainty who comes out in the top two spots this coming Sunday. But it's possible Marine Le Pen would be one, as you correctly say, and the other would be a candidate of the extreme left actually backed by the French Communist Party. Melenchon is his name, he told Marlow.
Until either the federal workers' unions — which have a lot of sway — put more pressure on them, until the American people start getting in touch with Democratic politicians, I think the Democrats will refuse to move, despite the fact that what they are doing is against the interests of the American people and of America.

U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January, adding to fears that inflationary pressures could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace.
Although news stories have focused mainly on Beijing, thanks to the shantytown fire on November 18, we are apparently seeing a major change in Chinese policy that affects all large cities, and possibly medium-sized cities as well.
Beijing (AFP) – China's economy grew last year at its slowest pace in three decades, hit by weak domestic demand and trade tensions, but while officials warned of further headwinds, separate figures Friday suggest the downward trend is bottoming out.

Like so many other tragedies, this case illustrates the threat posed by the egregious and often recidivist criminal offenders our agency identifies, targets, and seeks to apprehend and remove, and is another example of how California's sanctuary policies lead to violence against innocent victims while protecting illegal aliens who have no authority to be in our country, Quinones continued.

Pritzker donates heavily to business-first establishment Republicans, party committies, and state parties. The strategy is likely intended to encourage party committees to suppress GOP voters' rising concerns about the broad campaign to impose the transgender ideology on communities and families.
Hunter's conduct is willful and contemptuous, Roberts' lawyers also argued, urging the court to order him to appear in person at a March 13 pretrial hearing to explain why the tribunal should not hold him in contempt, Fox News reported on Sunday.
Initially somewhat skeptical of Donald Trump, Adelson eventually supported him, and played an influential role in pushing the administration to adopt bold Middle East policy changes, including the movement of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Known as a hawk for his staunchly pro-Israel views, Adelson helped shape a legacy of peacemaking, as the Abraham Accords came to fruition between Israel and several neighboring Arab states.

For instance, the Koch network has expressed their wanting to work with President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on issues like amnesty for illegal aliens, expanding legal immigration levels, and returning toa free trade policy.
A handful of Republican and Democrat lawmakers are continuing to tout a plan that gives amnesty to nearly a million illegal aliens in exchange for some amount of funding for President Trump's proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Democrats such as Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and Debbie Dingell (D-MI) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.

5. Democrats are hypocrites. Many Democrats — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) — have voted for a barrier at the border in the past. Border walls, and fences, are not immoral, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi keeps saying. Nor are they racist. They work — which is why the European Union builds them, why our ally Israel builds them, and why even developing countries in Africa build them. The main reason Democrats oppose a barrier at the border is because they don't want President Trump to have a political win. Stop making this personal.
The post-2013 arrival of 1.9 million Central American migrants was prompted, in part, by claims from coyotes and cartels that Obama's deputies were allowing migrants into the United States. Obama's deputies, including DHS chief Jeh Johnson, publicly denied the claims even as they allowed the migrants free passage. There is no free pass, Johnson said in June 2014. There are no permisos for children, for your children, who come to the United States.
Taking to Facebook last night, French born co-organiser and European Parliament foreign policy adviser Schams El-Ghoneimi begged: Friends, I URGENTLY need journalists to cover this in Brussels, they can call me directly to meet 5 WONDERFUL human beings who also happen to be Syrian refugees – and which will show their talent at this Thursday's SYRIANS GOT TALENT event we're organising near the EU Parliament.
No one is ever going to celebrate a price increase, Wang said. But I think that with the wage increases, people won't see working in the food industry as a lowest-paying job you take if you can't find work, and start viewing it as a career. It will be good for the industry in the long run.

According to the report, based on the whistleblower documents and parents' comments, the teacher asked the young children to create an identity map, composed of characteristics such as race, class, gender, religion, and family structure.
But, in fact, I don't really think there was a change in policy, Bolton continued. I think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons, just as we would respond if it were nuclear weapons or biological weapons. It's a threat to American national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction. So Trump's response – which so far, at least, has been confined to the one strike at the Syrian airbase, although obviously, it took place in Syria – was not a shift in policy on the civil war.
Growth has held up because of a combination of factors including the sharp fall in the pound following the vote, which boosts exports, and the Bank's own efforts to stimulate the economy. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the British economy expanded by a quarterly rate of 0.6 percent, making it one of the fastest-growing major economies.

This is crony capitalism … business partnering with government to increase its profits [by cutting Americans' wages] while dumping the costs on taxpayers, responded Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Paul viewed Abrams as an exemplar of the sneering, latte-sipping political class in Washington that Trump was elected to fight, and which shows every intention of fighting dirty in return, as the geysers of leaked information pouring from the new administration attest. (In fact, this very story is the subject of leaks intended to manipulate media coverage, as noted above.)
There is no getting around the simple reality that population growth demands a sizable number of couples having three or more children, which generally requires getting started on family life at a relatively young age. Financial incentives to defray the cost of having and raising children may be helpful, but Russia's experience offers the latest evidence that it takes more than money for populations to flourish.

Yet there were some things that went so well that we should bring them into the new year.
I and a lot of the other senators, who I've spoken to over the weekend, are worried that we're not doing enough to get cash in the hands of affected workers and families quickly so we're going to be focused this week on how to do just that, the Arkansas Republican continued. We worry that the bill setting up a new and complicated system relying on businesses giving paid sick leave and then getting a refundable tax credit won't move quickly enough and could put pressure on those businesses to lay workers off.

The Clausnitz asylum centre director was also fired after the video, reports Kurier, following allegations that he was also a member of the AfD. It is alleged that his brother was one of the organisers of the protest and that he was removed from his position for his own safety.
According to an article last month in Chinese media, China is close to announcing how much of each country's territory it plans to annex:
Friday was Powell's second attempt to reassure markets and businesses that the Fed would not go overboard in its rate hikes. In mid-December, following the Fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time in 2019, Powell sounded somewhat less certain about future rate hikes than he had in an interview in October. That interview with Judy Woodruff is widely seen as sparking the recent stock market volatility.
41 percent of the [H-1B] workers approved [in 2015] by the government were at wage Level 1 [which is defined as] a basic understanding of the occupation. These employees perform routine tasks that require limited, if any, exercise of judgment … Level I wages are typically 40% below the average wage. Almost another forty percent of approved H-1B applications were at second lowest wage level, Level II, which is typically 20% below the average wage for Americans in those occupations. So, nearly 4-in-5 H-1B applications were approved by the U.S. Department of Labor for the lowest two wage levels, providing large discounts to employers.

Last year, the Fed undertook a review of its strategies for achieving its goals and its conduct of monetary policy. The review followed several years of inflation coming in below the Fed's target and a series of rate hikes and a drawdown of bond purchases that now look ill-advised. Following the review, the Fed changed its approach so that it would let inflation run higher than the two percent target for some time so that the long term average would be at the target.

Proponents of closed borders and small social safety nets have a tendency to highlight the tension between citizen and noncitizen, to imply or explicitly state that the only way to help one group is to deprive the other.

China's longstanding one-child policy has produced a population where boys far outnumber girls. Yet teachers are predominantly female and boys have consistently fallen behind in academic performance – with disparities in performance seen as early as third grade – causing concern for many parents who are now pressing for more assertive male role models in classrooms. The recruiting effort – that has included relaxing college admissions requirements and providing full scholarships with job guarantees to male applicants – has been labeled, by some, as sexist.

The leaders spoke to Italian President Sergio Mattarella Sunday and promised a decision on the next Italian Prime Minister for his approval — certain to be neither party leader but a third, less contentious choice — but as of Tuesday morning, the two parties seem to have drifted further from an agreement.
When some U.S. politicians insist on finding scapegoats to cover up their own incompetence in responding to COVID-19, the threat to public health will only worsen. Faced with domestic criticism and deepened public fears, some White House politicians sharpened their rhetoric against China this week, referring to the widespread coronavirus as the Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, or the kung-flu, blaming China for the epidemic, and arousing virus-related hatred. But putting the blame on China is not an easy or quick way out of the twin health and economic crises faced by the U.S. administration. The tactic can only hurt China-U.S. relations and dampen the confidence in fighting the coronavirus, domestically and internationally. When the U.S. public sees that their government has sunk so low as to scapegoat China, fears will only deepen, as shown in the continuous slide in the U.S. stock market despite increasing policy efforts.
The poll, which surveyed 3,500 likely voters across geographic regions, ethnicity, sex, and political affiliation, showed how unpopular such policies are in America, despite activist and media attempts to normalize them. Even liberal voters, according to the poll, disapprove of efforts to undermine biological sex with gender ideology. Overall, results found 66.93 percent of those polled say they strongly disagree with gender identity policies, including a majority of liberal voters.
The miracle of the nation state is that it creates a common identity and makes solidarity possible. Too much immigration endangers this arrangement.

On Tuesday evening, Sheriff Hernandez responded to the courts ruling, stating:
The FWD.us lobby group was formed by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and other West Coast investors to help push the Gang of Eight amnesty bill through Congress. The group was subsequently funded by a roster of investors and business chiefs, including top executives from Walmart, Google, and Microsoft. The investors strongly support mass immigration because it cuts companies' labor costs and inflates consumer sales.
So, what would such an immigration system look like? For starters, it would have realistic, evidence-based avenues for legal immigration … [where migrant] Workers would be able to find legal pathways into the country to fill needed positions.
According to testimony submitted from the Tibet Post International, Tibet has fewer foreign journalists than in North Korea and Reporters Without Borders lists Tibet 176th out of 180 on its Press Freedom Index.
So yes, el-Sisi is a friend to the U.S., and, under the Trump administration, the U.S. is a friend to him. Again, it's a safe bet that Kirkpatrick, were she still with us, would agree that it's better to have him as a friend than someone else as an enemy.

This is not coincidental. The idea of 'degrowth' as a virtuous goal is a key tenet not only of hard-left environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion but also of the Great Reset, which sees the economic destruction wrought by Covid-19 not as a crisis but as an opportunity for a 'new normal.'

Nicaragua condemned and rejected the attempt to ''subvert the rights'' of a sovereign country, declared the country's diplomat Luis Alvarado.
However, Facebook notes that the difference between nationalism and supremacy expressed by some users can be hard to distinguish. Overlaps with white nationalism/separatism, even orgs and individuals define themselves inconsistently, says one slide in a section titled challenges for white supremacy. Another slide asks: Can you say you're a racist on Facebook? Facebook's official response to this is No. By definition, as a racist, you hate on at least one of our characteristics that are protected.

It was widely feared – or, among oil executives and the heads of nations whose economies are driven by oil revenue, devoutly hoped – that knocking Iran out of the market with sanctions would cause oil prices to soar and supplies to become tight. That does not appear to be happening, as another Radio Farda report pointed out.
Salvini's League party joined a coalition government as the Five Star Movement's junior partner in 2018 but gained popularity largely thanks to his tough anti-immigrant stance.
They were always prepared to help deliver that, not just on a substantive point of view, but also in a kind of metaphorical way. So when they went out in public, they had a patina, more than a patina, of glamour about them, and she kept that up after we lost the President. At the [Reagan] Library, for example, she would be always introduced as the former First Lady of the United States. They had ruffles and flourishes played. The whole setting at the library, I think, is a real tribute to their personal tastes, but also to the place of the Presidency in our lives, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or a Tea Party member or whatever. You go in there and you have a sense of the majesty of the office, if you will, and I mean that in a pragmatic sense, not in the royal sense.
Because 95 percent of the undocumented residents in this country are employed, it means that the market can bear it, said Tony Payan, from the James A. Baker Institute at Rice University. I think the immigration system in the United States has a huge gap — we don't have [work] visas for the kinds of workers that our very dynamic economy often needs.

If you've got 50 Democrat Senators and 50 Republican Senators, the Democrat [vice president] could break the tie, and that's it, he continued. That is not the way the system works that we have operated on for decades and decades and decades.

For a candidate to win the Speakership of the House, that person must receive a majority of those present and voting for a person. Members of Congress can vote for formally introduced candidates–for Democrats that will be Pelosi and for Republicans that will be Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the current Majority Leader who will become the House Minority Leader on Thursday when Democrats take over–or they can vote for someone not listed. The candidate can be a member of the House, but does not have to be–the Constitution is very nonspecific on the requirements for candidates for election to be Speaker of the House–though there has never been a Speaker who is not a member of the House.
Columnist Pat Buchanan said President Obama's reluctance to intervene on foreign policy is good and his fundamental idea is poorly applied, but is right on Friday's McLaughlin Group.
Ashford also noted the many other media personalities who are attacking Pence for his religious beliefs, and criticized those who put the worst possible spin on the VP's faith.
These countries — for the most part — want to be helpful, want to do the right thing, [to] have relationships with the U.S. and are in some cases improving relations, but for a variety of different reasons failed to meet those minimum requirements that we laid out. The only way to mitigate the risk is to impose these travel restrictions.

Romney's backing of the measure comes after Harvard Professor Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under President Barack Obama, proposed the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Congress should pass a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria, wrote Furman. The law should also specify that the payments would continue in 2021 and beyond if the unemployment rate rises to 5.5% and remains there or higher. Hopefully this will not happen, but if it does, the money will be needed, he added.
The colonialist comment caused a firestorm of protests across India.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Those statistics are cited at the conclusion of an article about how New York high school students are passing tests, not because of increased knowledge but because the bar has been repeatedly set lower to get desired results.
That no-checks policy may become painful if there is a shortage of hospital beds for sick Americans, he said.

The poll is bad news for Democrats, who are increasingly claiming there is no border crisis that President Trump can cite to declare a national emergency and then build a border wall with unspent funds.
Analysts predicted continued oversupply from the astounding surge in U.S. production, reduced demand from the global economic slowdown, anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war, waivers granted to Iran's largest customers, the failure of the OPEC cartel to arrange a production slowdown, and possibly President Donald Trump's lobbying for lower oil prices will keep fuel relatively cheap in 2019.
This unprovoked response to North Korea's flaccid provocation was, in turn, highly provocative to Chris Cillizza of CNN, who suffered a complete meltdown on Wednesday morning:
We feel like we're living inside a sealed casket, described Abu Ahmed.
This is crony capitalism … business partnering with government to increase its profits [by cutting Americans' wages] while dumping the costs on taxpayers, responded Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. By legalizing the illegal immigrants, the benefit to employers is greater because there's more of the cost of [cheap labor] immigration that taxpayers can be forced to bear.
Stop and frisk is not a racist policy. If it's based on an objective criteria of reasonable suspicion or probable cause, there's nothing racist about it. Even if a disproportionate number of black people are caught up in it, it's not a racist policy as long as the criteria is applied equally to everyone.
The drug misoprostol (also called Cytotec) then causes contractions and bleeding to expel the baby from the mother's uterus.
Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.

Worse, It is clear that Iran used its American prisoners as a bargaining chip–first to ensure that the U.S. dropped sanctions as the Iran nuclear deal went through; second, to expand its ballistic missile program in violation of the U.N. resolution giving effect to that deal; and third, to humiliate the U.S., most recently in the arrest of ten sailors.

Besides money wasted on cigarettes, there is the belief, particularly harmful to the poor, that fast food is a cheap way to eat. But fast food is not the poor man's friend. Nothing could be further from the truth. A regular diet of fast food not only makes you fat and can kill you, but it's also far more expensive per calorie than cooking and eating at home.
A 45-day appeal process is set to ensue.
The cheap-labor policy has also reduced investment and job creation in many interior states because the coastal cities have a surplus of imported labor. For example, almost 27 percent of zip codes in Missouri had fewer jobs or businesses in 2015 than in 2000, according to a new report by the Economic Innovation Group. In Kansas, almost 29 percent of zip codes had fewer jobs and businesses in 2015 compared to 2000, which was a two-decade period of massive cheap-labor immigration.

The union is quite unusual in Silicon Valley which has largely resisted efforts to organize its workforce. For years Google employees have demanded policy overhauls on pay, harassment, and ethics, publishing multiple open letters to upper management over issues such as government contracts and allegations of sexual harassment at the company.
The California Policy Center reported that the Oakland's Human Resources Management Department also expected a $15 minimum wage to have a contractual ripple effect from the compaction of city wage comparisons.

Wang claimed China was able to build a strong defense against the virus at our borders without mentioning Beijing's implacable opposition to other nations defending themselves against the virus during the crucial months of spread in the late winter of 2020. Instead, he credited China with helping to erect an international bulwark against the coronavirus and said his government has made more friends in the world during the pandemic it unleashed.

Zaman has a circulation of 650,000, according to Vice, largely the product of providing an alternative view of current affairs from pro-government publications. Journalists at Zaman were warned that the newspaper would experience a change in editorial policy after its editor-in-chief was forced out of his job, but were assured the newspaper would remain unbiased and objective, neutral. Doubting this, they released a statement on Friday calling the takeover the darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press, which is a major benchmark for democracy and the rule of law.

Bolton said U.S. troops would remain at the critical area of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region. He defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's Constitutional authority, adding I'm a strong believer in Article II.
The things that the economy values become things that these knowledge workers do, he said. The lawyers figure out strategies for corporate takeover fights instead of strategies for corporations to employ more workers and make new things. They figure out strategies for stock buybacks. They figure out derivatives, which as you know ended up completely crashing the economy. The people behind it were not held accountable. The people who lost their homes were the ones who suffered and who lost their jobs.
If a problem is serious enough for Trump and Soros to agree on it, then you know it's a serious problem.

The teen claimed that she felt exposed, violated, and distraught after a male officer took her mugshot photo of her without her hijab while officers and prisoners watched.
There's not that many unions, generally speaking, but American workers in a tight labor market have bargaining power, even as just individuals. But if the labor market is expanded to include in effect the entire world, then there can never be a tight labor market. It becomes effectively impossible. That puts employers in the driver's seat and takes away any [marketplace] bargaining power that American workers would have, even those who aren't in unions or have any kind of formal organization.
Mehdi Karroubi, an opposition activist under house arrest, lashed out at Khamenei himself.
Our office has received multiple complaints alleging that the San Antonio police chief violated Senate Bill 4, the Texas law prohibiting sanctuary city policies that the attorney general has authority to enforce, OAG spokesman Mark Rylander said in response to an inquiry from Breitbart Texas.

I have a terrible regret … I have a regret that the entire discussion about this article ignores its purpose, which was to try to contribute to this discussion about the policy in the War on Drugs. Let's go to the big picture of what we all want. We all want this drug problem to stop. We all want them — the killings in Chicago to stop. We are the consumer. Whether you agree with Sean Penn or not, there is a complicity there. And if you are in the moral right, or on the far left, just as many of your children are doing these drugs, just as many. And how much time have they spent in the last week since this article come out, talking about that? One percent? I think that'd be generous. My article has failed.

On Thursday, Biden and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris met with a handful of cabinet nominees, executives with open borders lobbying groups, and sanctuary city politicians about his day one plans to introduce immigration reform legislation and protect DACA recipients, according to a readout of the meeting.
Her views don't represent a lot of my constituents, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said of Ocasio-Cortez to The Hill. Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) agrees with Shaheen, who told The Hill that Ocasio-Cortez becoming the face of the Democratic Party hurts its brand. I think it skews what's really there for the Democratic Party, Jones, the Senate's most vulnerable member, said. He warned that if House Democrats attempt a far-left agenda, its legislative accomplishments will be few and far between. If the House did all the crazy things on the left that the House did on the right for the last two years, that's not going to happen, the Alabama Democrat said.
Australia's ABC News theorized that the document, which was not due for declassification until 2043, was made public with such extraordinary speed in an effort to keep American strategy consistent through the next administration:
Those in the South of England were also more likely to identify as European as those in the North.
Remain MPs did not play along, however — and they did not allow Johnson to force a no-deal by running down the clock, either, with the Tony Blair-created Supreme Court overturning a move to prorogue (temporarily suspend) Parliament before the deadline in a highly dubious and possibly unconstitutional use of their powers.
James Carafano, vice president of the Heritage Foundation's Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute who served as an adviser on the Trump transition team, also recommended that the president choose someone onboard with his agenda.

The Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet. Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming. A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements.
Simply finishing the Shasta Dam to its design height [of 800 feet] could add nine million acre-feet to the system, McClintock says. Indeed, the Trump administration, is proposing to raise the dam by 18.5 feet, increasing the capacity of the dam by 7 percent (630,000 acre-feet) — if tiny salamander species that environmentalists wish to have declared endangered do not stop plans for expansion.
Recent reporting described two NSC staff holdovers from the Obama administration attending an all-hands meeting of NSC staff held about two weeks into the Trump administration and talking loudly enough to be overheard, saying, 'We need to do everything we can to take out the president. On July 26, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee hired one of those individuals, Sean Misko. The report further describes relationships between Misko, Lt. Col. Vindman, and an individual alleged as the whistleblower. Why did your committee hire Sean Misko the day after the phone call between President Trump and Zelensky, and what role has he played throughout your committee's investigation?

After consulting several of my predecessors and analyzing the NSC's current configuration, I have determined that the agency can and should be streamlined, and am in the process of restoring the NSC to its historical mission. With the president's approval, we will reduce the NSC staff, making it more effective by reaffirming its mission to coordinate policy and ensure policy implementation. The NSC staff should not, as it has in the past, duplicate the work of military officers, diplomats or intelligence officers. With that in mind, we will be able to reduce 174 policy positions to under 120 by early 2020.

The six month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We hadn't cut the number of drug prosecutors, we didn't cut the number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we've been doing for 25 years. And it's having an impact and I'm afraid it's going to continue.
In Italy, the epicentre of the European outbreak, there are now 322 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with the death toll reaching 11, reports The Guardian. In an attempt to stop the virus from spreading, Italy has imposed travel restrictions for at least 50,000 people, cancelled the Venice Carnival and has closed business and schools.
A sampling of the past week's rhetoric on the virus and other matters and how it compares with the facts:
The measure is fair, popular, good for families and children, and long overdue. They have everything to gain.
Hawley's legislation follows as the Missouri populist wrote a letter this week to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, asking Hahn what actions he and the agency can take to ensure that American citizens do not face shortages of life-saving drugs and medical drugs.
If you believe in individual rights, if you believe everyone should be judged on their own personal merits, redlining is indefensible — as is Bloomberg's wholly ignorant and anti-science comments.
But we do have a clear policy around expectations to return to work. We should also be reminded that thousands of individuals in our school system have been reporting to work since the pandemic began: our nutrition support staff, our principals and administrators, some central office staff, as well as security and others throughout the building.
To complicate matters, the European Union has also made itself known in the formation of the new government, warning the potential coalition partners against pursuing the policies they were elected over. Lega in particular wishes to radically cut taxes, including VAT and excise duties, but EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis spoke out Tuesday morning to tell Italy they must conform with EU demands.
That has the same problem as the AP U.S. History curriculum. It focuses on group conflict – exactly the sort of thing that you find in the studies departments. And there's even a neo-Marxist element to the AP U.S. History standards – they're very materialist. The AP European History standards imply that the original liberals, like John Locke and Hobbs, and the Parliaments that brought modern democracy to England, were somehow motivated by class interest, and the implication is there's something inauthentic and not very believable about classical liberalism. So, there's no doubt that the curriculum the College Board has put in place has been adding to and exacerbating the underlying problem that we're experiencing on free speech.
Facebook launched its Free Basics/Internet.org in more than 35 countries as a supposedly free way to obtain access to data for 5 billion poor people who currently have no Internet access. But the product only allowed access to Facebook and a few other pet sites in a walled garden, TechCrunch notes.

The renovation project included installation of insulated exterior cladding, double-glazed windows and a communal heating system. Investigators need to look at what materials were used in the project and who approved their use, Ruane said. But he said the speed with which the fire spread suggests that more than one fire protection safeguard failed.
Importantly, mentioning the whole Biden-Burisma affair would have been entirely justified as long as there was a reasonable basis to think that looking into the matter would advance the public interest. To defend merely asking a question, the President would not bear any burden of showing that Vice President Biden (or his son) actually committed any wrongdoing.
Crutchfield continued to make it clear that his Black Lives Matter chapter just wants to hold meetings in what he calls black only or non-white safe spaces.
A leaked report from Frontex, the EU's border agency, warned of mass migration flows to Greece that will be difficult to stop this time around. European leaders like Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have called Turkey's action an attack on Greece and Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited the border with Turkey and said that the bloc would show solidarity with Greece.
And Julia Kloeckner, touted previously as a possible CDU successor to Merkel, failed to lift the party to a win in Rhineland-Palatinate with a campaign that challenged Berlin's line on asylum.

Curry explained to Breitbart News that the crackdown on Christianity in China has occurred in tandem with significant repression of all religions and ethnic minorities, perhaps most intensely the repression of majority-Muslim Uyghur people. As of April 2020, the U.S. government believes that as many as two million Uyghurs and other ethnic minority Muslims are trapped in government-run concentration camps in their native Xinjiang region, in northwest China.
I'll take whatever Israel has because it's working 100 percent. … They have a huge problem with illegal aliens and they're fantastic.

The plane crash early Wednesday killed all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians.

Mr Keidan said: The Court of Appeal has made it clear the status quo cannot continue. The Government should now recognise the benefits of opening civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples.
I concluded [Trump] does not care about the policy on this, Kaine told host Alisyn Camerota. He wants immigration as a talking point to rev people up and he's willing to say anything. 'Mexico will pay for it,' that was a lie. 'Democrats are for open borders,' that's a lie. 'Democrats won't cooperate with me,' that's a lie. There is a deal to be had here, but first, we've got to reopen government.

We applaud the Administration and the Senate for scuttling the nomination of Hanna Skandera due to her past support for Common Core standards and testing. Parents, students, and teachers detest Common Core because it locks children into an inferior education. As President Trump has said, Common Core is a total disaster. We urge the Administration to look for appointees committed to achieving the President's vision that education has to be at a local level. We cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child's education.

Myanmar's army has just recently completed most of the job of genocide and ethnic cleansing of Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine State, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee for their lives to neighboring Bangladesh, where they are trapped in refugee camps. Myanmar's army began committing atrocities including torture, rape, beatings, and slaughter, burning down entire Rohingya villages, targeting the Rohingyas, as early as 2011. But they crossed the line into full-scale genocide and ethnic cleansing after an August 25, 2017, attack on Burma police outposts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), killing 8 policemen. At that point, Burma's army began full-scale clearance operations, sending hundreds of thousands more Rohingyas into Bangladesh.

At its root, such thinking seems based on the idea that if a foreign government chooses to ally itself with the U.S., then that government can't be much good. Why not? Because, as liberals like to believe, the U.S. isn't so good, either. And this attitude, Kirkpatrick added, was a form of masochism.
Dolezal notes that California uses an average of about 80 million acre-feet of water per year, and over the past two decades, roughly half of that is preserved for environmental use — dropping to 40% in the most recent drought, with agriculture using just over 40%, in both wet and dry years.

We live in trying times. Times of fear, of suppression, of hate. We don't need more, or better leaders. We need someone willing to fight. We need to stop asking them to give us our rights. They won't support us, they won't compromise. We need to stop expecting that our systems will somehow fix themselves. We need to actually take the reigns of power from them. We need to challenge them at every level. We need to fix this. We don't need them anymore. We can do better. You're damn right we got this.
Trump is accused of abuse of power for withholding military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting for the country's president in exchange for an investigation into his potential presidential election rival Democrat Joe Biden.

More recently, a report by the think tank Onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'Red Wall' seats (i.e. traditional Labour constituencies in the Midlands and North which lent their votes to the Conservatives in the 2019 election so that Johnson could deliver Brexit) face being wiped out in Johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.
Legal experts say the act gives the president the power to declare a national emergency. But the act does not require presidents to prove a crisis exists to declare an emergency — it's at their sole discretion.
Ryan repeatedly, over the course of the Trump administration, has taken shots at the president on stylistic and political matters–on everything from the Charlottesville incident to Trump's push to end birthright citizenship.But Ryan did not just oppose Trump stylistically and politically: On major policy fronts, from healthcare to trade policy to immigration, Ryan was a thorn in Trump's side for the whole first two years of his administration–not to mention the rising deficit, increased federal spending across the board, and massive heaps onto the national debt that happened on Ryan's watch under both Presidents Obama and Trump–all from a supposedly conservative Republican who had for years preached fiscal responsibility but failed to deliver.
Immigration [policy] requires making choices, said Miano, and because these progressives don't want to make the choices, they let the coyotes and the desert make the choices for them.

Now it's looking like the most stupid idea since the Trojans saw the Wooden Horse their Greek enemies had left outside the gates of Ilium and said: Nice! Let's drag it inside.
Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told top Pentagon officials in his first meeting as department chief that he wants them to remember China, China, China.

Acton, who cofounded WhatsApp before selling it to Facebook, said recent changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy are driving people to Signal. He told TechCrunch that Signal's user base exploded in recent weeks.
The United States disputes this characterization and wants Turkey to halt its military incursion into Syria against Kurdish forces, an assault Turkey named Operation Olive Branch because it believes peace can only be established by pushing Syrian Kurdish forces away from the Turkish border. President Trump strives to assuage fears that U.S. military withdrawal from Syria will give Turkey a green light to massacre the Kurds.
Parents were reportedly outraged when they discovered the lesson and assignment.
The Trump administration could point to two laws and say they allow officials to proceed with building a border wall without first obtaining explicit authorization and appropriations from Congress, according to Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw the Brennan Center's study and is a co-director of its Liberty and National Security Program. One of the laws permits the secretary of the Army to halt Army civil works projects during a presidentially declared emergency and instead direct troops and other resources to help construct authorized civil works, military construction and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense. Another law permits the secretary of defense, in an emergency, to begin military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces, using funds that Congress had appropriated for military construction purposes that have not yet been earmarked for specific projects.
BEIRUT (AP) — He has survived eight years of war and billions of dollars in money and weapons aimed at toppling him. Now Syrian President Bashar Assad is poised to be readmitted to the fold of Arab nations, a feat once deemed unthinkable as he forcefully crushed the uprising against his family's rule.
In other words, the Posse Comitatus Act's own exception can be triggered under the conditions outlined in the 2007 NDAA. Thus, it is not an absolute prohibition on the domestic use of military forces. Indeed, in 2005, Congress issued a Joint Resolution stating that:

Wages for white-collar workers are growing slower, in part, because companies already have outsourced jobs to roughly 1.5 million non-immigrant visa workers throughout the United States.
With or without the filter, left-leaning users frequently attract thousands of retweets with their replies to the president:
There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It's time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they're worth. Joe will start by strengthening unions and helping workers bargain successfully for what they deserve. His plan will check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws. He will also encourage and incentivize unionization and collective bargaining.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News during a conference call Wednesday that he thought the next defense secretary needs to be someone who agrees with Trump on ending unnecessary wars.
He's been in office for almost half a century. I follow this rather carefully and I don't know of a single piece of religious liberty legislation he's ever penned. If he's in favor of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, well, that's rather deceitful because he's now in favor of the Equality Act which, if it were passed … would literally destroy the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed under President Bill Clinton.
He lamented the failure of mainstream parties to make a policy that appears at least halfway sensible and said this failure had triggered panic in many people.

As far back as November, shortly after Ma was summoned to a meeting with Chinese regulators, state media began describing him as an irresponsible renegade who no longer had the best interests of the people at heart. Another high-flying billionaire, Liu Qiangdong of JD.com, has been subjected to similar treatment and subsequently welcomed enhanced supervision from the CCP.
Biden's campaign promises are an open-borders strategy, Morgan said:
Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge regime between 1963 and 1981. The regime committed genocide between 1975 and 1979, when they sought to install the purest form of communism in the world, leaving one to three million people dead. The country lost 25% of its population from torture, malnutrition, executions, disease, and forced labor.
Nobody believes that Wall St. cover story – except the people paid to promote it & the estb. journos whose editors don't want them to follow the money.
From that statement, you recognize that dangerous aliens who are illegally present need not be convicted of a crime to be arrested by ICE, Goodlatte and Grassley continued. Astonishingly, in all of these tragic cases, ICE determined that it was not an important federal interest to protect the public by detaining these dangerous individuals, so that they will not victimize others.
In other words, the Posse Comitatus Act's own exception can be triggered under the conditions outlined in the 2007 NDAA. Thus, it is not an absolute prohibition on the domestic use of military forces. Indeed, in 2005, Congress issued a Joint Resolution stating that:
In recent days, the al-Qaeda affiliates conquered the strategic town of Darat Izza, located close to two main highways in Syria used to move fighters and supplies within the country and along the Turkish border.
In our own little ways—whether as employers, consumers, or homeowners—each of us has long counted on, and effectively encouraged, the development of this extralegal immigration system, Jawetz testified in 2019. At the risk of being provocative, the truth is that our arcane immigration system is so broken that it long ago abandoned the right to expect and deserve compliance and respect.
We have to proliferate the access to testing and services, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), whose Latino-dominated district includes many suspected victims. If someone is undocumented — or has a green card — and they feel that they're not eligible for any of these kinds of services, that's just going to worsen the situation, that's going to prevent us from really addressing the coronavirus issue in an effective way, he told the the Hill.
Another man reportedly told police, I'm a Syrian! You have to treat me kindly! Mrs. Merkel invited me. Germany's Justice Minister indicated on Thursday that asylum seekers found guilty of sexual assault could be deported.

Despite almost unanimous support from the media and establishment and foreign money having poured into Ireland — the target of an international campaign to dismantle its strict abortion laws — opinion polls show repealing the Eighth Amendment has only a narrow lead.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissented in a decision that reverses what until now was a space on one's birth certificate reserved for the opposite-sex spouse. Both the majority and minority opinions held opposing views on whether the Arkansas law reserves the parental space on the birth certificate for biological parents.

The Obama policy delivered kangaroo courts on college campuses in which mostly male students were accused of sexual misconduct with little information about the allegations against them and no recourse to defend themselves.
He has also announced his opposition to Trump's Pentagon rules. Trump's rule does not bar people who claim to be transgender but do require each service member's recorded gender market to match the bright line' of their biology. A 2018 Pentagon report set the policy, saying:
Right-wing parties and populist movements on the rise in Europe are also on friendly terms with Assad, seeing him as a secular bulwark against Islamic extremists.
He pointed out that allowing four commercial planes to reach Yemen with a total of 1,000 passengers is a dirty tactic by the US-Saudi aggression, while only two flights have been allowed per week since the beginning of the aggression. He explained that sometimes months pass by without allowing any flights to land in Yemen, Mehr relayed.
The panel participants worried that China is flexing its muscles in various international organizations at the same moment that American influence is waning, and that Beijing acts aggressively to prosecute agenda items such as isolating Taiwan while Washington is often unclear about what it wants from international bodies. This has allowed China to become the gatekeeper for membership in some important organizations, especially those where each member state is allowed a single vote no matter how large and powerful it is, since China can wrangle supporting votes from a large number of smaller nations in its orbit.
These are five legal immigration reforms that Trump can readily follow through on in 2019 to fulfill his campaign promises ahead of 2020.
There's just one snag. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which brought the case on behalf of the blocked Verified Liberals, argued that the President had violated the rights of the blocked users by limiting their participation in a public forum.
There are signs of a great deal of xenophobia between the elite residents of the cities, and the low-paid migrants who do all the work.
Meanwhile, business groups are trying to expand the H-1B program. For example, activists are citing the coronavirus as an excuse for Congress to allow investors to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates for jobs in the healthcare sector. Sen.

One Planned Parenthood official in New York State boasted in April that the organization's new tele-abortion service is so much in demand that one mother began her drug-induced abortion at home with her children running around behind her.
In December of last year, a demolition campaign evicted tens of thousands of migrant workers in just one month alone, so these figures seem to be credible.
Numerous reports have shown data manipulation is not limited to the United States, but is common across the globe. Temperatures recorded at pristine rural monitoring stations in far flung locations such as Australia, Paraguay, and Switzerland have been inexplicably homogenized so that past temperatures are now reported as cooler than were actually recorded, and recent temperatures are now reported as warmer than were recorded, necessarily making the temperature rise at these locations over the past century appear steeper and larger than the unadjusted data indicate.
There's a lot at stake here, he concluded. A real leader could explain that, could explain to the American people how it could affect their daily lives – and why we have to take actions such as a substantial naval rebuilding program, so that our Navy doesn't sink to levels we haven't seen since World War I, and so that we can protect our freedoms here, and our way of life.
The number of extended-family foreign nationals who have resettled in the U.S. in the last decade is greater than the total combined population of Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland.

TfL has made a commitment to transition from gender-specific phrases like 'ladies and gentlemen' which are currently used in announcements, to a gender-neutral alternative such as 'good morning/good afternoon everyone'.
Even now, he said, when I go to China and meet an official bishop, they don't want to talk, because they say people from the Patriotic Association are there, so we can't talk, we can't talk. I go to talk to a bishop in Peking, and he says, no, we can't talk, because the place is bugged.

We have a more intuitive sense of children's needs, said Li Yue, 36, a kindergarten teacher in Fuzhou. It isn't the responsibility of schools to teach boys to be boys. It's the responsibility of parents.
It's worth keeping in mind that el-Sisi's government must fight a low-grade war against murderous Islamist radicals; just on December 29, terrorists killed three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian tour guide. In response, the Egyptian military struck back, killing 40 alleged terrorists. The situation in Egypt certainly isn't pretty, but so long as his country is under siege, what else can el-Sisi do?
There are genuinely deep concerns about policy areas, particularly around not being able to sign trade deals.

We're trying to avoid conflict in the world. We're trying to protect our interest without hostilities. But you have to do that from a position of strength, Bolton explained. You've got to start with political leadership, then you've got to follow it up with some very extensive programs to re-furbish the military. That's going to cost money. Nobody better blink at that.
In 2018 the company shut down the account of social media Gab after the corporate media reported that a gunman who killed 11 people in an attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue had posted anti-Semitic content to the platform.
David White, SAG-AFTRA's national executive director, added:
Make no mistake, Sessions continued, federal prisons are not filled with low-level, non-violent drug possessors. According to the bureau of justice statistics … 99.7 percent of drug offenders in federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug-trafficking offenses, not drug possession.
The President of Taiwan – @iingtw
Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Giuseppe Civati, a former member of the PD, said that the Salvini migration and security decrees should be totally abolished and advocated the return of the so-called humanitarian protection residency permit which allows migrants who fail asylum claims because they are not legitimate refugees to remain in the country — a policy that was scrapped by Salvini.
NEW YORK — Demand Justice, an organization founded by former members of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and associated with a social welfare organization financed by billionaire activist George Soros, is raising money for an eventual court fight against what the group describes as President Trump's proposed racist, unnecessary wall.

In February 2014 – just half a year after her famous filibuster – Davis told the Dallas Morning News she supported bans on abortion after 20 weeks. The news was not a complete shock, since several months earlier Davis had also described herself as pro-life.
Fiona earned two college degrees in the early 2000s after she left the real estate industry following the 2007 collapse. Since then, she has worked a series of contract jobs, most recently at a seven-month stint at an insurance company run by an imported workforce of H-1B workers from India. She said her job ended when she was forced out by Indian managers, in part, because of her excellent performance reviews. She is in her 50s, has been unemployed for several months, and fears recruiters will blackball her if she speaks on the record.
Pompeo also noted that despite the Trump administration being criticized for hurting alliances around the world, it worked successfully to build an enormous coalition with the Indians, Australians, Japanese, the South Koreans, in some parts of Europe, to counter China. He touted that 120 international telecommunications companies that have forsworn any Chinese technology in their system.
It is a moral failing and a national shame when a father and his baby daughter drown seeking our shores. When children are locked away in overcrowded detention centers … When President Trump uses family separation as a weapon against desperate mothers, fathers, and children seeking safety and a better life … When children die while in custody due to lack of adequate care.
One way that Bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. If elected, Bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former President Barack Obama. A portion of the new refugees will be individuals fleeing the impact of climate change, an idea also favored by Bloomberg's more progressive rivals, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer.
Twitter user @pzriddle did not attend but tweeted out his favorite protest sign:
While COVID-19 remains an incredibly serious threat to our community, the public health data in Chicago and across the nation show that schools are rarely a source of COVID-19 transmission. With this new understanding of COVID-19, we must challenge the assumption that school buildings must stay closed and do everything we can to bring students back to school.
French President Emanuel Macron threatened to ban travel from the United Kingdom if stricter measures were not enacted to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
Said Gaffney in discussing the unmasking controversy, citing the duration of the effort and potential involvement of others, I think that there's unquestionably a political warfare operation being run by their former boss, Barack Obama. And I think there's a lot of evidence that they're still lashed up with him and therefore i think it's a safe assumption that they are probably performing opposition research, if you wish to call it that, for Organizing for Action… and their purpose for it is pretty clear – destroying the Trump presidency.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the President's decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world. Zuckerberg added: We removed these statements yesterday because we judged that their effect — and likely their intent — would be to provoke further violence.

1. Operation Warp Speed. When President Trump demanded a coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible, he was told by the experts and the media fact-checkers that it could not be done until the middle of 2021, at the earliest. But Trump insisted, and the scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and logistics experts responded. As a result, millions have already been vaccinated for a disease that was virtually unknown at the start of 2020, and humanity is entering 2021 with hope for a speedy recovery.
Alida Garcia with Mark Zuckerberg's FWD.us attended the meeting. As Breitbart News has chronicled, FWD.us is one of the leading pressure groups to expand the number of foreign visa workers that corporations are allowed to import to take high-paying, white-collar U.S. jobs.

Louisville Metro Emergency Services spokesman Mitchell Burmeister said most of the overdose calls were from heroin, although he also mentioned there were calls about overdoses from alcohol, prescription medications and other controlled substances.
Furthermore, it doesn't even look like much of a test, because a defense official told Fox it was an older SCUD missile, not one of the new weapons North Korea has been working on.
Romney's policies would allow the states to import huge levels of cheap labor. His plan would cut investors' labor costs, impose new costs on state residents and federal taxpayers, and also deter employers from buying the U.S.-built labor-saving machinery that raises Americans' productivity and wealth.
Writing at his D.C. Dispatches blog, attorney Jason Poblete has some interesting follow-up questions about this story, chief among them: Was Congress aware of the missing Hellfire? If so, why did they not speak up, at a moment when President Obama was adjusting U.S. policy towards Cuba?
We don't live in Saudi Arabia where they need to fit the exams around sharia principles. It's wrong imposing this festival on everybody else.
Deporting illegal migrants would be an economic tragedy, said Daniel Griswold, the immigration policy director at the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Think of the workplaces that would be disrupted, he lamented.

Despite decades of agrarian reform, state-led development programs, and billions of dollars of foreign aid spent on international development schemes, remitted wages from people working in the United States have become the most important source of income for many rural communities,' said a 2o13 report by Selee's Migration Policy Institute. The report continued:

Such a ruling wouldn't be all bad for public schools, either. More school choice would mean greater competition and motivation for government schools to strive to their greatest potential. All public schools have to worry about is whether the private sector can do things better, and again, their fears are legitimate.
We are totally supportive of our men and women in the military. This has nothing to do with a lack of our support, a spokesperson for the district said.
But users quickly encouraged her to remove the post and cover up her crime, stating: It can be five years in prison. Be careful. And delete this before it incriminates you. Another said, better to delete, really… 7178 persons on this page! A Facebook user followed up: …and not all of them on the side of refugees.
The goal should never be a two-state solution, the goal is peace. And there are many ways of moving in that direction and there are several potential endpoints. And I think that it's useful to the Israelis and for us to remind everybody that the goal is peace. We should not let the means become more important than the end, and we should think about that goal, rather than saying there is no other possible arrangement ever than the two-state solution.
Making the speech in New York City was a risky move for Lincoln, as it was a stronghold of his chief rival for the GOP nomination, William H. Seward. At that point in the race, Lincoln was a heavy underdog to lead the surging and strengthening Republican Party.

Because science is the pursuit of knowledge, and political actions almost necessarily restrict personal freedom, science, laws, and regulations should use the best available data. Using bad data undermines both the pursuit of truth and the legitimate justification of laws and regulations.
Durov added, In 2019 alone, Facebook spent almost 10 billion dollars on marketing (I guess this includes paid bots on Wikipedia and other sites). Unlike Facebook, Telegram doesn't spend any money, let alone billions of dollars, on marketing. We believe that people are smart enough to choose what is best for them. And, judging by the half a billion people using Telegram, this belief is justified.
We will not win the presidency by telling people they're wrong for being angry that middle class wages have declined under this president, he said in an interview with Laura Ingraham. We're not going to win the presidency by telling the people that they're wrong when the foreign policy of this country has made America weaker and a joke.
George Washington was indispensable, but only for what he was, not for what he did, McDonald continued. He was the symbol of the presidency, the epitome of propriety in government, the means by which Americans accommodated the change from monarchy to republicanism, and the instrument by which an inconsequential people took its first steps to becoming a great nation.
The group, composed of activists who have pushed the Green New Deal and backed the four far-left members of the Squad — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) — endorsed Sanders for president this week.

A TPS-to-citizenship rule would further reduce American' power over who gets to be an American, Krikorian said:
The underlying controversy here is not a new one. For decades conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic have warned that Europe's generous immigration policies, often pursued in defiance of ordinary Europeans' wishes, threaten to destabilize the continent.
Kurdish Peshmerga forces fighting alongside the Iraqi military on the mission to liberate Mosul from the Islamic State warn that the Iraqi army is too weak to fight ISIS, even with its advanced weaponry, while the Peshmerga is better trained but ill-equipped to fight alone.
For his part, Sen. Paul who, unlike Roberts, is an elected official, was not amused. He tweeted:
The value of Americans' citizenship would be reduced because Presidents would simply be able to give citizenship out to anybody after first selecting them for TPS, said Krikorian. He could award green cards — which permit citizenship — to anybody he wants from any country in any number — it is appalling.
4. Illegal immigration hurts all Americans, but especially legal immigrants, minorities, and the poor. With better border enforcement, black and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest ever, and wages are rising for all Americans. Those gains are threatened by illegal aliens who compete with U.S. citizens and legal immigrants for jobs. Illegal immigration also hurts public health care and education, as illegal aliens place additional burdens on services that are already struggling. We can have a generous welfare state, or open borders, but not both.

This rule comes from an admin we all hate, he tweeted, but the substance takes a lottery that randomly allocates H-1B visas & instead prioritizes them for the highest-paid workers, which incentivizes better pay for migrants. Someone will have to explain to me why that's bad. Notably, Costa did not discuss the possible benefits for American graduates.
On January 7, Facebook and Instagram locked President Trump out of his accounts indefinitely. Twitter, on the other hand, permanently banned the president from its platform.

TEL AVIV – Al-Qaeda's recent gains in Yemen attest to the failure of the Obama administration's Middle East policy, said an Arab intelligence official who spoke to Breitbart Jerusalem.
The best example of that, and I'm sure you may disagree with me with this one, is the reason the Republicans could not come up with an alternative to Obamacare is that Obamacare, as I write in the book, was for years the Republican idea for how to reform health care, he said.

Hungary vowed to stop the flows into Europe by building a border fence, increasing border guard patrols, and enacting zero-tolerance on illegal migrants. A report from September 2017 revealed that the central European nation's common sense approach to stopping mass migration worked, slashing illegal immigration by 99 per cent, the numbers falling from 391,000 in 2015, to just 1,184 in 2017.

The Twilight Zone economy we are currently experiencing could implode if interest rates were to ever normalize.
Trump needs an ally. Tillerson and Mattis both didn't agree with him on his foreign policy agenda. They were almost the opposition to Trump. He needs someone who isn't going to fight him on things, he added.

If we want to write a new chapter in the American story … we will have to cleanse the corruption from our government and urgently act to appoint officials who will bring integrity to public service, she adds.
Another project, the Sites Reservoir, has been debated for decades. Rather than capturing water by blocking a river with a dam, the reservoir would be built in a valley with minimal water and would receive excess water during floods, relieving pressure on other dams and allowing them to store more.

Yonhap News reports that Hayden also quoted former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's assessment that Pyongyang would be crazy to halt its nuclear program after the effort already devoted to it, and China regards North Korea as a bad toothache it can generally ignore.

We know it's a terror tunnel because it passes under different strategic assets, Conricus said, referring to its proximity to the fuel pipelines into Gaza, the Kerem Shalom Crossing and a military installation nearby.
It can seem like a mind-boggling reversal for a leader whose military once seemed dangerously close to collapse. But Russia's military intervention, which began in 2015, steadily reversed Assad's losses, allowing his troops, aided by Iranian-backed fighters, to recapture cities like Homs and Aleppo, key to his rule.

While most companies accused of using Xinjiang slave labor — even those reportedly lobbying Congress to let them continue the practice, like Nike and Coca-Cola — do not promote the fact that they do business in the region, some openly boast about it.

A restaurant worker in Billings, Mont., Ms. Eixenberger, 22, has been laid off three times during the pandemic and was so in need of cash by October that she had to drop out of dental hygiene school. After donating plasma and doing odd jobs, she still didn't have enough to pay her bills, so at the suggestion of some friends, she turned to OnlyFans. She has made only about $500 so far. … Elle Morocco of West Palm Beach, Fla., was laid off from her job as an office manager in July. Her unemployment checks don't cover her $1,600 monthly rent, utility bills and food costs, so she joined OnlyFans in November. … She has made just $250 on the platform so far, despite sometimes spending upward of eight hours a day creating, posting and promoting her content. Ms. Morocco also worries that her presence on the platform will make it more difficult for her to be hired for traditional jobs in the future. If you're looking for a 9 to 5, they might not hire you if they find out you have an OnlyFans, she said. They may not want you if they know you're a sex worker.

Despite the H-2B visa program keeping working-class Americans' wages down, the Democrat and Republican political establishments have joined the business lobby to push a plan that would give U.S. industry an unlimited supply of low-skilled foreign workers through the H-2B visa program.
Princeton Policy Adviser President Steven Kopits says illegal immigration in 2018 is likely to increase by 70 percent—or about 590,000 border-crossings for 2018.
These claims are based on the utterly unreliable adjusted temperature measurements recorded by surface temperature stations scattered across the globe. These measurements, at least the raw data from them, are usually sufficiently accurate to inform local inhabitants of the temperature and weather anomalies in their area on a particular day, but as measures of actual trends telling us something important about whether humans are causing global warming, most of them are virtually worthless.

President Xi, who as well as being the leader of the Chinese Communist Party also serves as chairman of the Central Military Commission, reportedly ordered the exercises during a large Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) ceremony broadcast to 4,000 military units across the country.
Bolton agreed with Bannon that the American people have not been well-prepared by their political leaders to understand the enormous strategic significance of the South China Sea, or the true scope of China's ambitions. He laid the task of providing that perspective, and rallying public support for whatever American counter-moves are necessary, at the feet of the next President.
Moreover, the liberal cities that have incubated America's utopian environmental movement for decades could not exist without ongoing human intervention in the environment that brings water from mountaintop to tap.
Policies like the one in question at USC have unfortunately become increasingly common at universities around the country. True liberals should take issue with the reality that students now have to get permission if they want to stand in a campus courtyard with poster boards promoting their political positions. These types of demonstrations have been an integral part of American academic culture, specifically as a result of our country's emphasis on First Amendment principles.
The CNN sources were bitingly critical of Trump for deciding not to nominate Abrams. This is a loss for the State Department and the country and, for that matter, for the President, said one, while another maintained Abrams was bumped off the list because of Donald Trump's thin skin and nothing else.
This isn't just about illegal immigration, and it isn't just about stopping dangerous gang members from coming into our country. It's also about stopping the flow of drugs coming across our border, killing Americans in communities across the country, said Sen. Cassidy. It's time we uphold our responsibility to secure the border and protect Americans. It's a national security priority, it's a health priority, it should be an American priority.
Ninety-five percent of murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16-25. That's true in New York, that's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of people that are getting killed. You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets. Put the cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods. So one of the unintended consequences is people say, 'Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.' Yes, that's true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is. And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them… And then they start, 'Oh I don't want to get caught.' So they don't bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.

When asked why Democrats are not negotiating with the president, Hoyer said, What happens next time when the president says, 'do as I say, and if you don't I'll shut down the government.' or the next time after that, or the next time after that?

A Saudi attempt to patch up relations with Assad would be a public acknowledgement of the kingdom's failure to oust him. At the same time, the involvement of Gulf Arab governments and private companies is crucial for any serious reconstruction effort in Syria. Reconstruction costs are estimated between $200 and $350 billion.
For instance, there's Saudi Arabia, which has admitted its culpability in the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. Khashoggi's death was an outrage, but still, we must ask ourselves: Should the terrible fate of one person, who was not even a U.S. citizen, be used as a reason to overturn a seven-decade-long friendship with the Saudis?
The families rebelled against the Democrats' affirmative action laws that actually penalize academically successful Asian-American students by limiting their admissions to the University of Washington system.

I concluded [Trump] does not care about the policy on this, Kaine told host Alisyn Camerota. He wants immigration as a talking point to rev people up and he's willing to say anything. 'Mexico will pay for it,' that was a lie. 'Democrats are for open borders,' that's a lie. 'Democrats won't cooperate with me,' that's a lie. There is a deal to be had here, but first, we've got to reopen government.

We want a China policy that thinks about the geopolitical competition between the United States and an adversary—an economic adversary, Lighthizer told the Journal, adding:
The other thing that [the federal government is] trying to do is to deny certain federal law enforcement grants to sanctuary jurisdictions, whether they're cities, states, counties; they're trying to make these grants off-limits for sanctuaries, which makes sense. Why should a jurisdiction get taxpayer money for law enforcement when they're stiffing one of the biggest law enforcement agencies of the federal government. They shouldn't. There needs to be some consequence for having a sanctuary policy. … Hopefully the federal government will be able to deny them some funding.

WASHINGTON D.C. — Socialist Latin American nations and small Caribbean island states that benefit from Venezuela's oil supply have expressed disdain towards U.S.-backed efforts by the Organization of American States (OAS) to find a solution to Venezuela's political and humanitarian crisis, reminding member states of the international body's non-intervention policy.
Proposed by the Left party, but supported by just the Greens and the Socialist Left Party, Norway's parliament overwhelmingly voted against the introduction of a third gender category last April.
It's a dangerous thing because Congress can change immigration law anyway but that has to be done through a process of debate and deliberation and people have to vote on it, and those people are accountable to voters [every two years]. The President, of course, is accountable to voters but this would make any political control over immigration much more difficult … A president would be tempted to use it for whatever purpose they want at the time. It could be to serve business interests. It could be to serve foreign policy interests, to promote the political objectives of the President.

Weisman's January 4 article in the Times was an amplification of the arguments he made in his book. Again he ignored left wing anti-Semitism. He regurgitated Goldberg's allegations of Israeli moral infirmity. He defended Tlaib and Omar and their hatred for Israel. And thne, Weisman insisted that American Jewry should forget its ties to Jewish tradition and to the Jewish people and instead embrace an identity based entirely on leftist ideology and propaganda.
Indeed, we must also ask: If anything were to happen to the current government in Riyadh, who would take power? Al Qaeda? ISIS? Iran? Pompeo's answer is, in effect, that for the foreseeable future, we must stick with the current regime, and one would bet that Kirkpatrick, who died in 2006, would agree.
Additionally, Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who has been serving since August as the special representative for Syrian engagement and was named last week as the American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, is to travel to Syria this week in an effort to reassure the U.S.'s Kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned, Bolton said.

In February 2014 – just half a year after her famous filibuster – Davis told the Dallas Morning News she supported bans on abortion after 20 weeks. The news was not a complete shock, since several months earlier Davis had also described herself as pro-life.
I think there's still hope for the Trump administration on this. Their utterly inexplicable finding that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal – I mean, that's kind of an embarrassment. Fred Fleitz, a former colleague of mine, has an excellent article up on the Fox News opinion website on what's wrong with that finding. I urge people to take a look at that. This has got to be stopped. Otherwise, I think it will risk embarrassing the Trump administration, given the president's very strong stand against this deal in the campaign, Bolton advised.

Finally, looming over all pro-American countries—and, in fact, over just about every country in the world—is the threat of China. China, of course, is a human rights-violator second to none: Even if we put its Maoist mass-murderous past aside, today, we see that it is defiantly anti-democratic; it routinely suppresses Christians, as well as Tibetans and other minorities and dissidents, including the Falun Gong. Indeed, it's reliably reported to have preemptively locked up as many as one million Muslims, without even the pretense of a legal trial.
They said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it's exactly what they've done, she explained. I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they've hired.
She continued, I know Republicans who — they don't mind the fiscal policies of Trump. They like that, but they also want to sleep at night. If you're a Republican and still want Republican policy but don't want the tweets and the madness, you might go to him. If you're a Democrat that just wants to beat Trump at all costs, you see Trump as just this force of evil, and you just want the money that it's's going to take to defeat him, and you think this guy will spend $2 billion to beat him, you might vote for him.
In response, MILO stated, Our ads promoted my smash #1 bestseller DANGEROUS just by stating my name, its title, and a quote from the press.

What advertisement could we have posted that *did not* break those policies?
A Democratic staffer told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats would object to the President's use of the emergency laws, implicitly admitting the policy would be likely legal:
Republicans and Democrats had worked together to dramatically strengthen and rework unemployment insurance during this crisis.

Today the Campaign for Accountability released a report about our funding of academic research. It claims to list hundreds of papers we've in some way funded. The report is highly misleading. For example, the report attributes to Google any work that was supported by any organization to which we belong or have ever donated (such as CCIA)… [Moreover], the researchers and institutions to whom we award research grants will often publish research with which we disagree. In fact, many of the academics listed by the Campaign for Accountability have criticized Google and our policy positions heavily on a variety of topics.

Abrams, who also served as deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush, added, Other governments also pay attention. I've always believed that most governments, particularly in Europe, base their relationship [with Israel] on ours. They don't want to be quite as close to Israel. So if we're distant, they're more distant. If we're close, then they get closer.

The reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. If I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. Now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.

Another proposal is to build the Sites Reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of Maxwell, just over an hour north of Sacramento. As noted earlier, the Sites Reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. Proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.

But there are several flaws in Pelosi's analysis.
The goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.

The Democrats continued by demeaning Americans of faith, referring to them as those most loudly claiming that morals, values, and patriotism must be defined by their religious views.
Biden was silent on many critical details. For example, he did not say how migrants would be judged as welcome for life in the United States — even though at least 150 million people want that prize. He was silent about how rejected migrants would be deterred from entering the obstacle course, and how they would be sent home — even though 11 million resident illegals are already refusing to leave the United States.

The bill, sponsored by California Democrat representative Judy Chu, has been endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union, who characterized it as a response to Trump's racism. Three years after the first Muslim ban, President Trump expanded his discriminatory Muslim ban, targeting more Black and brown immigrants and their families, employers, and educational institutions, they said, continuing:
Similar purges have been conducted in rural Iraq, where either the Islamic State or Iran-backed Shiite militia units have wiped out some of the world's oldest Christian communities.
It's risky because it puts in the hands of the government the possibility to choose all the bishops it wants depending on the criteria it has always had, he said, that is, choosing the most malleable, controllable ones and making them into an instrument of their politics instead of working for the evangelization of China.

The authors and contributing agencies behind the Framework emphasized that China must not be allowed to believe it has gained air and sea military dominance over first-island-chain nations, prominently including Taiwan but not limited to that particular island. The implicit concern is that China would become more likely to invade Taiwan if it believed it held such a dominant position that it could score a swift victory, and then it might keep going, securing all of its military objectives across the Indo-Pacific.

Then came the big guns: With a loose promise that the 78-year-old Pelosi would term limit herself, something she intended to do anyway, Pelosi flipped another group of rebels into backing her. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), a senior leftist Democrat from Colorado who had previously been quoted in Politico publicly organizing against Pelosi, flipped and endorsed her, thereby rescinding his signature on the letter.

Marek's DACA refers to President Barack Obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The DACA work-permit giveaway has not been approved by Congress, partly because many millions of Americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. It's not amnesty, Marek wrote in 2014. It is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the United States. That's the kind of border security we need.

That delay has now cost Cologne's police chief his job. But the German government still seems more concerned about policing restless natives — most recently through a deal with Facebook and Google to restrict anti-immigrant postings — than with policing migration.

With each presidential election, Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free, democratic way of life, and how much we cherish our nation: the Republic of China, Tsai said, using the official name of the island nation. This election has shown that the Taiwanese people hope the international community will witness our commitment to democratic values and will respect our national identity. We also hope that Taiwan will be given a fair opportunity to participate in international affairs, she said. Tsai also demanded an end to China's violent threats.

The deportation of migrants from the United States would shift wealth back to lower-skilled Americans, said a 2018 report by the International Food Policy Research Institute. The trade compression caused by deportations [of lower skill migrants] suggests that the U.S. may experience losses of higher-paying export jobs. Based on the aims of the current U.S. administration, these potential losses must be compared with potential gains in jobs with lower skill levels, said the report, which was validated by the blue-collar wage gains for Americans in 2018 and 2019. after 40 years of flat wages for men.

There was another change this week by this president, not a change in his policy, but from the previous presidents, Wallace said. He now says that this White House is no longer going to routinely release visitor logs showing who's coming to the White House, who they're meeting with, as President Obama did. And another interesting development this weekend, there were massive marches across the country, people protesting. These were called tax marches. People demanding that President Trump releases his tax returns as presidents have routinely since Jimmy Carter. And that was the subject of a tweet this morning from President Trump. Let's put it up on the screen. The president apparently not liking those marches. He says, I did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a Republican, easily won the electrical college. Now tax returns are brought up again? Gillian, this president apparently thinks transparency is overrated.

The primary responsibility of the federal government is the defense of our nation, which includes strong border security, said Sen. Rounds. The WALL Act pays for the wall by closing existing loopholes that allow illegal immigrants to receive federal benefits and increasing fines for illegal border crossings and visa overstays, he added. By funding the wall through increased fines, we prevent any risk of dipping into Department of Defense (DoD) funding, which is already stretched thin.

Vox is a progressive site, which generally adopts pro-migration policies that subordinate the interests of white-collar and blue-collar Americans to the interests of migrants, investors and cheap-labor CEOs. Like many other sites, Vox's articles reflect the progressive view that Americans have a moral duty to help foreigners migrate to the United States, and it is eager to overlook the resulting civic and economic damage done to ordinary Americans — and also to ignore the huge economic gains that cheap-labor migration delivers to investors and upper-income postgraduate progressives.

China has definitely cracked down on religion. They're returning what I call the 'government is God' philosophy that they had when they were connected with the Soviet Union years ago, Curry told Breitbart News. What's unique about China is that they have the capacity and the will to roll out this very sophisticated surveillance system against Christians. And, of course, with COVID [the Chinese coronavirus], people are forced to watch church online.

Sessions also took the opportunity to continue his campaign against the policies of sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. These so-called 'sanctuary' policies force police to release criminal aliens back into the community — no matter what their crimes they may have committed in those jurisdictions, he said. And we're not going – and cannot – continue giving federal grants to cities that actively undermine the safety of federal law officers and intentionally frustrate our efforts to reduce crime in America.
Under the proposals, migrants would be able to keep assets which are necessary to maintain a modest standard of living, e.g. watches and mobile phones.

But what has Barack Obama done for eight years? In the very early years of his administration, he sent Hillary Clinton to push the reset button with the Russian foreign minister, he continued. In the middle of his re-election campaign in 2012 he told the Russian president that he would have more flexibility after the election. When Mitt Romney characterized Russia as our number one geopolitical adversary, Barack Obama mocked him and said that the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back. I'm glad the president has finally realized the threat that Russia poses to the United States and our interests but I wish he had recognized this eight years ago.
The American people have known for more than 30 years – the American people are right about this – that our immigration system is broken. It's intentionally designed to be blind to merit. It doesn't favor education or skills. It just favors anybody who has a relative in America — and not necessarily a close relative. That defies common sense. Employers don't roll dice when deciding who to hire. Our incredible military doesn't draw straws when deciding whom to accept. But for some reason, when we're admitting new Americans — the future of this country — our government uses a randomized lottery system and chain migration.
The best example of that, and I'm sure you may disagree with me with this one, is the reason the Republicans could not come up with an alternative to Obamacare is that Obamacare, as I write in the book, was for years the Republican idea for how to reform health care, he said.

And as President Donald Trump plans to pull out America's 2,000 soldiers from northeastern Syria, government troops are primed to retake the area they abandoned in 2012 at the height of the war.

The test, which sent a missile into the sea off North Korea's east coast Wednesday, occurred ahead of a hugely important meeting between the leaders of the US and China this week and has been described by one analyst as an insult from Pyongyang to US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. It was an airborne middle finger to Trump and Xi before they sit down for their summit, said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at Australia's Lowy Institute. The US response, delivered via Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was short and sharp — The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. It was very different from previous lengthy, threat-laden responses. And while Tillerson's taciturn comments were instantly criticized online, analysts said it was difficult to gauge if his approach would make much of a difference compared to his predecessors'.

But that is a fight about allocation. McClintock focused on storage, noting that the cheapest and best way to solve the state's water problems — measured in cost per acre-foot — is to build more reservoirs rather than letting much of the state's rainfall run out to sea. McClintock reminded me that it has been 40 years since California's last dam, the New Melones Dam, was completed in 1978.
Australia's ABC News theorized that the document, which was not due for declassification until 2043, was made public with such extraordinary speed in an effort to keep American strategy consistent through the next administration:
The figures come just days after a think tank called on Prime Minister David Cameron to admit that his target to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands was effectively dead.

People who have medical problems or a history of them are protected in the health insurance marketplace because of Obama's Affordable Care Act, which Trump is trying to dismantle in and out of court.
I think the Democrats are terrified. I think it goes beyond just hostility to President Trump, Sessions said. I think they believe he's assembling a majority coalition in America that could govern this country for a decade or more. The loser will be the radical, socialist, secular left who are going to be left out in the cold. They are a minority in America. President Trump has shown he knows how to appeal across party lines and draw in the extra voters that you need to win elections. So they went after him personally because they feared him, and they feared they were losing the support of the American people. It's not just that they didn't like him personally but he and his agenda—that I've believed in for a long time—his agenda assembles a working majority of Americans. They support that. He will now have this impeachment behind and he'll be even more effective driving his policies, and the American people will continue to respond and the economy is growing at a very, very positive rate. I think we have a window of opportunity in the next year or two to make some changes that will be historic for America, to build on the good judges and to build on the tax reductions and regulation reductions and to defend people of faith and reduce our involvement in endless war and to protect our borders and protect American jobs and manufacturing. That can be a matter of great historic importance. I'm just really excited about it.

Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities.

The reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago. [N]umber two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when I'm elected president – if I'm elected president – a codification of Roe v Wade, amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose.

In addition, ICE's only response to this terrible crime is to pledge that it will review Pedraza for possible enforcement action, the lawmakers wrote. Such a response is wholly unacceptable.

Sheldon was the love of my life. He was my partner in romance, philanthropy, political activism and enterprise. He was my soul-mate. … He was an American patriot: a US Army veteran who gave generously to wounded warriors and, wherever he could, looked to the advancement of these great United States. He was the proudest of Jews, who saw in the State of Israel not only the realization of an historical promise to a unique and deserving people, but also a gift from the Almighty to all of humanity. And Sheldon was kind. He gave readily of his fortune to charitable causes that may literally be countless, as he expected no credit and often preferred anonymity. Although bluff in build and speech – and, in the last two decades, beset by painful sickness – Sheldon was always sensitive to the needs of others.

The spike in inflation over the past year has caused concern among some rate-setters at the Bank of England. Last month, three of the eight members of the bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to increase the benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point from the record low of 0.25 percent. The rest, though, while acknowledging the inflation spike, thought a rate hike could be counterproductive for the British economy, which grew by less than any other Group of Seven country in the first quarter of the year.

CASTRO: I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. And we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. So no, I don't agree with that. The other thing I'll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually, the exact opposite happened. And so he's failed. He's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And it's just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.

The choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear, Trump said. He touted Perdue, who is seeking his second term in the Senate, as an ally who voted in favor of Trump's tax cuts, led a charge to secure relief for workers and farmers after Hurricane Michael ravaged southwest Georgia in 2018, and has supported immigration policy that favors American jobs.
Moreover, the liberal cities that have incubated America's utopian environmental movement for decades could not exist without ongoing human intervention in the environment that brings water from mountaintop to tap.
Advocates for the Irish giveaway will try again in 2019 to pass their bill, perhaps burying it within a routine funding bill or as part of a larger migration and labor legislative package.
This whole issue is outside the bounds of the High Commissioner for Human Rights office's mandate and is a waste of time and resources, Haley said in a statement.
And the pig is the Green New Deal itself which isn't remotely new, or particularly green, and which is far too expensive and damaging to merit the flattering term 'deal'.
Silicon Beat reports that this is the second year that the proposal has been put forward and the second year that it has been denied. The proposal calls for an accelerated recruitment policy to introduce diversity within the ranks of Apple's senior management and board of directors. Supporters of the policy noted that due to the proposal receiving less than six percent of votes from shareholders this year, it can be blocked from appearing on next year's proxy ballot.
If Trump takes this unprecedented action, it WILL be challenged in the courts. This is why we fight. Give $5 now. We won't allow Trump to hold our country hostage with his fearmongering and scare tactics. The courts may be our last line of defense against Trump's authoritarian impulses and now is the time to show him we won't stand down. Give $5 now to help us fight back.
I think it's bad foreign policy if you're going to be in charge of dealing with corruption in the Ukraine that your son hook up with the most corrupt company in the Ukraine and turn the Ukraine into an ATM machine, he said.
Kirby told reporters that in order to arrive at a two-state solution both sides must be willing to take the steps necessary to ratchet down the violence, to tone down the rhetoric, and through policy and decisions and actual actions, move that process forward. It has to start there. It has to start organically.
According to the East Bay Times, three of the nine members of the City Council are blasting Mayor Libby Schaaf's plan to repurpose the soda tax revenue away from health spending to plug the city's two-year budget that she plans to present on May 5.

Nonetheless, the singer-songwriter also took issue with Trump continuing to use his music at his famous MAGA rallies.
He continued to say: So when they talk about Farrakhan, call me a hater, you know they do, call me an antisemite — stop it! I'm anti-termite! I don't know nothing about hating somebody because of their religious preference. Farrakhan was not banned from Twitter for this video.

After months of pressure from rights groups, the E.U. is considering punishing Myanmar for the blatant violation of human rights referring to ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas and the failure of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to resolve the crisis. E.U.'s trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said in October, Our trade policy is value-based. These are not just words. We have to act when there are severe violations.
Whatever the political analysts say, Wall Street thinks China is open for business again and the NYSE's move is trumpet announcing it, the former official said.
The issue of migration has returned to the political foreground in Italy with the ongoing saga of the two vessels operated by the NGOs Sea Watch and Sea Eye. The story has highlighted tensions in relations with the EU and other international organizations such as the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
But what he leaves out of this glowing self-praise is perhaps most important: He failed to repeal Obamacare, he failed to secure the border or do any big picture immigration deal, in large part because his open borders views were out of line with the rest of the conference, he failed to cut spending, he failed to shrink the deficit, he failed to bring the national debt under control, and he failed to do major welfare or entitlement reforms–things he also spent years pitching.
The League has topped opinion polls for months, but the FdI has seen rapid growth in popularity over the last two years, rising from the 6 per cent at the European Parliament elections in 2019.
From western Europe to eastern Asia, supermarket shelves have been stripped of supplies in recent weeks, including toilet paper and hand sanitiser.
According to three Republican sources who spoke to CNN, Abrams was personally scratched off the list by President Donald Trump, due to outspoken criticism of Trump during the 2016 campaign. Abrams had been seen as the top contender for the job, supported by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and even senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is President Trump's son-in-law.
In Germany health minister Jens Spahn said the outbreak had become a global pandemic — meaning it is spreading in several regions through local transmission — telling lawmakers we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak.
The sanctuary state of California previously freed from police custody an illegal alien MS-13 Gang member who went on to murder a woman in front of her daughter, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency reveals.
This is the civil rights issue of our time – if this fails think of all else that fails, Biden said. It would have a profound effect on who we are as a people.
The most dramatic thing I can tell your listeners is if we lose these two seats in Georgia, then [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-VT] would be chairman of the Budget Committee, Perdue said. It doesn't get much further left than that. But the Senate, if we hold these seats, we can be the balance of power in Washington that keeps the Democrats from perpetrating this leftwing leftist agenda that's too dangerous for our country. We get to advise and consent on all nominees. That's Justice nominees, that's cabinet members, a lot of people that go into an administration have to come through the Senate to get confirmed. So we can control and get some of the more radical people out of the government. That's why you have checks and balances. It's worked in our country extremely well for 230 years. Democrats now just believe that America is wrong. Obama apologized for America all during his administration. So what is at stake here is if they get these two seats they will perpetrate the agenda and load up the cabinet with very liberal people who have no idea how this economy works and want to perpetrate their own agenda and then the courts will be absolutely decimated. They will stack the courts and not just the Supreme Court but the appellate courts and federal judges and they want to increase the number of seats until they get the balance that they want. We won't ever get that back.

Iconic fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld claims Meryl Streep wanted to be paid to wear one of his Chanel dresses to the 2017 Academy Awards.
Eliott Abrams, who was deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration, has been removed from the list of candidates for Deputy Secretary of State.
The claim rings a bit hollow, considering the repeated public teaser images of herself that she posted to social media.
His reticence to play ball with the Euro club of leaders in Brussels while working out ad hoc solutions with neighbours may prove unpopular in Brussels. As Breitbart London reported, Swedish leader Stephen Löfven slammed European countries not accepting migrant quotas as beneath contempt.
As Grassley explains to Comey in his letter, the Washington Post reported last week that the FBI reached an agreement a few weeks before the presidential election to pay Steele for continuing investigations of President Trump:
Worse, these foreign workers — most of whom are employed as contractors by little-known foreign-0wned staffing companies — usually accept lower wages than Americans because they hope to be paid by winning the hugely valuable deferred bonus of green cards from the U.S. government. Americans cannot get that federal bonus because they are already citizens.
As president, Joe Biden will renew a robust commitment to U.S. leadership in the region and pursue a comprehensive strategy for Central America by: Developing a comprehensive four-year, $4 billion regional strategy to address factors driving migration from Central America; Mobilizing private investment in the region; Improving security and rule of law; Addressing endemic corruption; Prioritizing poverty reduction and economic development.
Strzok forwarded the exchange to Page, saying, Need to nip this in the bud.
Meanwhile, beyond China's borders, the Belt and Road initiative of the People's Republic, while officially peaceful and cooperative, is, in fact, a key part of that country's bid for global dominion. It was Bloomberg News—not exactly a mouthpiece for hawks—that summed up China's goals in a stark headline late last year: Xi Jinping's Plan to Dominate the World. And oh yes: the Chinese are also busy hacking into America; there's a new report on China's cyber-espionage against the U.S. virtually every day.
Goldberg insisted that the Jewish people's right to self-determination is contingent on Israel's satisfaction of the Palestinians' demands and its appeasement of the left's ever-expanding list of grievances. Israel is guilty of a raft of sins, she alleged — from failing to give the Palestinians a state (despite the fact that the Palestinians have rejected every offer of statehood Israel has put forward); to standing with right-wing European governments – which stand with Israel; to supporting President Donald Trump – who supports Israel; to cultivating good relations with Saudi Arabia – which is supposed to be the point of peace processes Goldberg and her comrades supposedly want to advance.
Vox notes that Sessions avoids sentimental arguments about individual migrants' tragic circumstances and often admirable character. Those personalized, sentimental arguments are exploited by the establishment media and activists who can always find striving illegals or pitiable women, and sad children to serve as a sympathetic face for progressives' nation-changing ambitions and CEO's cheap-labor goals. Instead, Sessions uses the law — not emotion — to deliver gains for Americans:
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — For Iranians whose icons since the Islamic Revolution have been stern-faced clergy, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani widely represented a figure of national resilience in the face of four decades of U.S. pressure.

Soon after, Iraq invaded Iran and began the two countries long, bloody eight-year war. The fighting killed more than 1 million people and saw Iran send waves of lightly armed troops into minefields and the fire of Iraqi forces, including teenage soldiers. Solemani's unit and others came under attack by Iraqi chemical weapons as well.

Ehrlich prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans), that already-overpopulated India was doomed, and that most probably England will not exist in the year 2000.
Reid said, He still sounds like a Republican to a lot of people. So it's a weird coalition. I have to tell you — if this is an exhaustion election, which I think it is. An exhaustion election means people just want to sleep at night.
The two tech giants recently banned Parler from their app stores. Amazon Web Services also suspended their servicing of Parler, citing allegedly insufficient content moderation practices.
Regarding China's one-child policy that former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping instituted over three decades ago, Eberstadt said that while lots of people were talking about the liberalization of China and the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping, the heart of the society—the basic unit of society is the family—and the claim that the government has the right to decide how many babies parents have is much more totalitarian than anything that Lenin even planned.
In the wake of criticism of the governor's order, Gary Holmes, a Cuomo administration spokesperson, has insisted that New York is still prioritizing nursing home residents to receive the vaccine.
Saudi Arabia tried briefly to help overthrow him when he seemed most vulnerable using proxy militants, Itani said. With his regime likely to survive, however, Saudi Arabia would prefer to try and exercise influence over Assad to balance against Iran while avoiding escalation with Iran itself.
IBS Intelligence states that a new report from the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) claims that up to 65% of US banks are extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks. As part of the firm's Online Trust Audit & Honor Roll for 2017, more than 1000 website were anonymously audited with their security and privacy features ranked from best to worse. Following the audit, many US banks were ranked as the worst for security and privacy.
The nominee for deputy defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, boasts long-time business experience at Boeing, one of the largest defense contractors in the country.
The 2018 performance is all the more remarkable because it was not a rebound from a recession. In fact, last year the economy added 207,000 manufacturing jobs.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that harsh retaliation is waiting for the U.S. after the airstrike and called Soleimani the international face of resistance.
The chain migration inflow from a DACA amnesty has the potential to reach nine million foreign nationals arriving in the country, as every two newly naturalized citizens bring about seven foreign relatives to the U.S. with them.

Rome (AFP) – Europe's coronavirus hotspot Italy shut all schools and universities on Wednesday in a bid to stop the deadly disease from spreading, as governments bolstered supplies and intensified protective measures.
[S]ince these identities are inborn characteristics people cannot change, the only way to change it is via violent revolution. Growing up in China, I had learned it many times. The outcome is the family will be ripped apart; husband hates wife, children hate parents. I think it is already happening here.
Ursula von der Leyen made the proposal on Monday, saying: As I have just informed our G7 partners, I propose to the heads of state and government to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the European Union. These travel restrictions should be in place for an initial period of 30 days, which can be prolonged as necessary.
Despite not giving any specifics on how she would pay for the expansive government programs she had proposed, Ocasio-Cortez suggested at another point during the interview that the government should raise the tax rate to as high as 70 percent to fund climate change programs.
Those in UKIP areas and the working classes were more likely to feel British, whilst those in London and the South of England purported to feel more European than in the North.

Merkel is increasingly isolated on the European stage as she has refused to impose a cap on arrivals, a decision that is irritating her neighbours who say it encourages migrants to keep coming.
There were some members of the Holy See's foreign policy establishment that feel a rivalry with Sant' Egidio and didn't like it, Rooney said in a recent interview for The Crux of the Matter radio show. We had to navigate through that a little bit.

Only a small percentage of the visa workers are elite people who cannot be replaced even if U.S. companies tried to hire similar American experts away from other Americans companies.
Democrats are using the epidemic to delegitimize migration rules, says Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter enforcement. There is a pragmatic way of limiting the public health fallout of the disease, and there there is the Democratic effort to undermine immigration laws, to morally stigmatize them using the virus as an excuse, he said.
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley has made cracking down on the UN's anti-Israel bias a top priority since taking her position last year. In March she won a significant victory when, after complaints from the U.S., the UN withdrew a report that called Israel an apartheid state.'
The huge 2019 inflow was largely allowed by legal rules established by progressives under Obama, and it ended in early 2020 when Trump and his populists blocked the catch and release of economic migrants into the U.S. labor market.
The EU had also retained the right to bid for public contracts on largely the same terms as before — terms which had seen British shipbuilding jobs and even the manufacture of the new EU-free blue British passports farmed out to Continental Europe.
The minister (Salvini) had a new decree approved which strengthened his powers, Conte said in January. He claimed the right to decide if and when to disembark the people aboard the Gregoretti.
The important thing is not holding a meeting itself but becoming an opportunity to move toward the solution of the nuclear and missile issues as well as the abduction [of Japanese citizens] issue. Japan, the United States, and South Korea will continue to put pressure on North Korea to change its policy.
The gender language is usually advocated by those who claim that the law should treat a person's sense of their gender as more important than their biological sex. For example, a man who claims that he is transgender should be allowed to race in women's athletic competitions, say the advocates for transgenderism.
United Airlines released a statement apologizing for the incident: We are disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn't meet their expectations, and our customer care team is reaching out to this customer to issue a refund for his oversized bag as a gesture of goodwill.
Another individual, who only identified himself as Saeed, said the largely state-run media had concealed the cause of the crash for political reasons.
It's a tough test—but not so tough to pass, the Post reported. New York high-schoolers who took the Regents Common Core Algebra I exam this month had to earn just 27 of 86 points, or 31.4 percent, to pass.
These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President for nomination. Secretary Mattis is grateful to Deputy Secretary Bob Work for agreeing to continue serving until his successor is confirmed. His steady leadership is critical during this time of transition, and Secretary Mattis continues to have full confidence in him as he carries out crucial work in managing in the Department.
Starting today, we will no longer serve ads on YPP [YouTube Partner Program] videos until the channel reaches 10k lifetime views, they continued. This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10k views up until today will not be impacted.
Three times Johnson attempted to call a general election so the people could break the impasse — and three times MPs refused to grant one, fearing the verdict of an angry public on their shenanigans. Once, they would not have been able to do so, with the power to call elections being, like the power to prorogue, an executive prerogative — but David Cameron and his Lib Dem cohort Nick Clegg had made early elections conditional on two-thirds of MPs backing one.
There are a million reasons we want a wall, but here are five:
Eurozone ministers agreed after a meeting that they were ready to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth, according to Eurogroup president Mario Centeno.
As that date has now passed with still no sign of Hollande, the group plan to march on Paris to make their voices heard. Commenting on the lack of interest from the government the group said they felt deep distress and a sense of abandonment, and lamented that the President didn't even mention Calais in a recent televised speech.
I was shocked at the number of violent criminals set free by Travis County–and these are just the ones that ICE knows about because they were re-arrested, Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughan told Breitbart Texas at the time. There could be many others who have not yet been found by ICE. It's wrong for Travis County to put the public safety at risk for its narrow political purposes, and wrong to put ICE and other law enforcement officers at risk when they have to take to the streets to catch these people, or when they re-offend.
The school's president, Brother Brian Walsh, claimed in a statement that the school has zero tolerance for the alleged conduct that took place in the wrestling program. However, Walsh stated that the administration believes that the allegations are untrue.

The trade preference program, known as Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP), grants to Myanmar the right to export goods to the E.U. without paying tariffs. The GSP Everything But Arms (EBA) status allows Myanmar to sell any goods except weapons tariff-free into the E.U. The GSP privilege was granted in 2013. Exports from Myanmar to the E.U., especially in garments and foodstuffs, have risen tenfold in the past five years.
On Dec. 27, the United Arab Emirates reopened its embassy in Damascus with a public ceremony, in the most significant Arab overture yet toward the Assad government, almost certainly coordinated with Saudi Arabia. The Bahrain Embassy followed the next day.
Controversial addition to the Grassroots Out rally, George Galloway, has ripped into the childish and tabloid BBC for asking him to come into studio to discuss the European Union, but then launching a personal 'gotcha' attack on him demanding he defend his appearance at the event.
At this point, there is little doubt that the highest echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department broke their own rules to end the Hillary Clinton matter, but we can expect the inspector general to document what was done or, more pointedly, not done. It is hard to see how a year-long investigation of this won't come down hard on former FBI Director James Comey and perhaps even former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who definitely wasn't playing mahjong in a secret no aides allowed meeting with former President Clinton on a Phoenix airport tarmac.
The man said that he had never heard of anyone leaving the internment camps, with the exceptions of those who fell ill, saying: Some people were given 'medicine' to change their thinking, 'for their minds'. When this made them mentally ill, only then were they released.
Although the invitation encourages would-be concert goers to book in advance due to limited seating, there appears to be some concern over attendance of particular desired groups may be insufficient.
Fellow member-states have criticised Germany for ordering an additional 30 million Pfizer/BioNTech doses for itself, as well as 20 million CureVac shots. Germany purchased another 26 million — 21 million by Moderna and the rest Pfizer — after other EU nations had rejected them either because of their cost, difficulty in delivering the product, or the vaccines' experimental nature.
Sanders recently suggested on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that he'd consider a kind of jet-pooling arrangement in which he and other candidates could share private flights, saying, Maybe we can all chip in, get one plane and come back.
So this all – step back and this all starts with extremism in whatever form you find it. In this case you have Iranian-backed Houthis, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq, Iranian-backed forces in Syria, and in each case the root of the challenge stems from the revolutionary nature of the Islamic regime and their efforts abroad. And so they're focused on doing the things they can do. I talked to – I shared with the crown prince and with the king, if I recall correctly, my conversations to help Iraq as well. We want an Iraq that is independent, sovereign, and how it is we might do that – there are lots of economic things we can do to assist Iraq in getting back on its feet, which will permit them to be more independent and have more control and be more sovereign. I shared with the crown prince my conversations when I traveled to Iraq.
A crowd of angry Chinese parents gathered outside the Licheng Health Center in Jiangsu province on Friday and demanded answers about the seemingly bottomless vaccine scandal that saw thousands of children receiving substandard or expired doses of vaccine.
While perhaps failing to observe the irony of its own reporting, the Times juxtaposed the thoroughly discredited population explosion theories of the 1970s with the (equally alarmist) global warming predictions of our day.
With the current pandemic, PSG needs to ensure that they are not themselves [a] threat to the President's health and safety. As such the PSG administered Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccine to its personnel performing close-in security operations to the President, Durante said in a statement. PSG's decision to take the risk is a courageous step that greatly supports its mandate. We did it not for personal agenda but on a greater pursuit that is even way beyond our mission of protecting our President.
The organizer did not say that she would return to her homeland. The organizer is likely Marianne Baesa.
The state's largest water reservoir — by far — is the natural reservoir provided by its Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountain Range snowpack. That dwarfs the man-made facilities and, through gradual snowmelt in spring, continuously refills the man-made reservoirs long after winter rains and snows have stopped for the season.
Opening the Senate floor to the second round of speeches by lawmakers explaining their vote to acquit or convict Trump on the two articles of impeachment approved by House Democrats along party lines, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged:
Is there anything more contradictory than touting your faith while simultaneously threatening nuns who serve the elderly poor? she asked.
The immigration process is going to be about shortening the time by creating more and greater efficiencies, allowing people who have Temporary Protected Status — and in particular dreamers and TPS holders — to automatically get green cards.
Wired then criticized Breitbart News and Sean Hannity for covering the story, and Twitter for going on the defense, despite uncovering a whole lot of nothing. Wired seems more interested in attacking conservative media than it is in investigating the claims of Twitter's own employees that the company ignores user privacy in a desperate attempt to bolster advertising revenue.
Despite Turkey's talk of peace and olive branches, it has repeatedly made clear it intends to attack the Kurds if they do not withdraw from the envisioned buffer zone, which is considerably larger than what U.S. planners and the Kurds are comfortable with. Turkey's determination to push east of the Euphrates River is especially worrisome.
For example, the group's call for automatic visa-worker extensions is buried in a press release urging common-sense measures to provide economic support to jobless Americans and small companies:
That's a total of 23 words, if you're counting. Twenty-three words that leave you more confused when you get to the end of them than when you started. Is Tillerson trying to talk tough? Or is he refusing to give North Korea the attention he thinks they're trying to grab in advance of the US-China meeting? Somewhere in between? Neither? Both? The statement reads, to channel Winston Churchill, like a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. It's Ernest Hemingway but for complicated and delicate matters of foreign policy. It's, in a (hyphenated) word, a head-scratcher.
While analysts interpreted Thursday's report as a signal that the central bank's next move will be to raise interest rates, they also said that move is likely to be a long way off.
Twitter said its rules make clear that such acts, or any violent threat, are not permitted on its service.
The backlash against the endeavor, however, has been heard.
What the President is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders … We all support border security, and there is a better way to do it … The positive, shall we say, almost technological wall, that can be built is what we should be doing, Pelosi said January 10.

Even before President Donald Trump has left office, Wall Street and Washington bureaucrats are moving to patch things up with China's state enterprises.
Cuomo blamed hospitals for the slow vaccine rollout amid growing concerns that his administration's strict prioritization guidelines for who can get the vaccine could be slowing down the process, Fox News noted.
Built upon an ever-increasing mountain of debt, any significant uptick in rates could bring the whole financial system down. Most existing borrowers, be they individuals or institutions, would likely be unable to handle higher payments if forced to refinance at pre-2008 levels.
Chairman Janet Yellen says the Federal Reserve is delaying hiking interest rates. That could mean the rapidly inflating real-estate bubble is headed toward another crisis.
During the past two fiscal years, the DoS used appropriated FMF [Foreign Military Financing] funds to underwrite loans totaling $3.8 billion to enable the Iraqi government to purchase, sustain, and maintain military vehicles, aircraft, and weapons.
On the issue of abortion, labels like pro-life, pro-choice, access, health, or women's rights often camouflage the true realities of the policies that today crisscross the country, she said. Especially as we talk with Millennials, who are often outside the political structure of Washington D.C., the anti-abortion movement must be clear on what we are advancing and its impact on mothers, the preborn and taxpayers.
Steven Brill, the founder of Court TV and the American Lawyer, discussed his new book Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America's Fifty-Year Fall and Those Fighting to Reverse It with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Tonight.

Trump may be headed out of the White House but Trumpian monetary policy will be with us for years to come.
Facebook commented on their attempts to crack down on certain groups on the platform saying: Our policies against organized hate groups and individuals are longstanding and explicit — we don't allow these groups to maintain a presence on Facebook because we don't want to be a platform for hate. Using a combination of technology and people we work aggressively to root out extremist content and hate organizations from our platform.
6. We have to act now because both parties failed in the past. Many Democrats want open borders because they see illegal aliens as future voters. Many donor-class Republicans have tolerated illegal immigration because of business demand for cheap labor. That is why both parties have overlooked the laws they voted to pass, and ignored the wishes of the American people. President Barack Obama told Congress in 2011: I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. They did nothing. We can no longer wait.
Report: China's military buildup neutralizes America's aircraft carriers
I am encouraged by Attorney General Lynch's announcement today, and I commend Chairman Culberson for working with the Department of Justice to get their commitment to stop any grant funding to jurisdictions that are in violation of applicable federal laws. This is a significant matter for a lot of us and I look forward to verifying DOJ's progress each quarter, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) added in a statement.
Kim Martinez, AFC Arizona communications director, said immigration status isn't a factor when applying for an ESA.
Eagles Sr VP Anne Gordon made it clear to everyone objecting that she would be happy to eject us all, and that fallout did not concern her. — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017
I think that is why when the President campaigned about building a wall, it resonated with people, he said.

Washington's policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.

We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women, Trump promised, but instead departed to the White House on his own while a small group of those in attendance went to the Capitol and burglarized it, leading to at least four deaths. Photos from inside the Capitol during the raid showed rioters breaking through glass windows, looting items from the historic building, and rushing into the legislative chambers. The riot caused lawmakers, who were in the middle of certifying the electoral college votes for President-elect Joe Biden, to go into hiding. They formalized Biden's election in the early hours of Thursday.
Al-Homayed believes the incident was also aimed at the domestic Iranian audience, with hardliners in the country seeking to solidify their grasp on power ahead of expected economic changes following any major sanctions relief.
Release people from the public health disaster that are jails, detention centers, and prisons. Federal, state, and local officials should be looking for every opportunity to dramatically reduce incarcerated populations, who are at some of the highest risk.

Sheldon Adelson, who rose from selling newspapers on Boston street corners at age 12 to one of the most successful luxury resort developers, philanthropists and political influencers of his generation, died Monday night at his home in Malibu, California. He was 87. Adelson founded and served as Chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., the world's largest gaming corporation, from its inception in 1988.

His most recent arrest came in September 2020, when he was charged with domestic violence by the LAPD. ICE officials issued a detainer for Flores the following day — which is a request for law enforcement to turn illegal aliens over to federal immigration agents for arrest and deportation — but LAPD instead released him back into the community.
America's Founding Fathers denied entirely any right of Caesar… Caesarism, which became the ultimate origin of the divine right of kings, was accordingly anathema to Americans. The American Founders looked toward and empire of freedom unprecedented in human history. They meant to combine power greater than that of the Rome of the Caesars with freedom greater than that of the roman republic or any other republic of antiquity.

A few months later in April, another underage migrant was sexually abused. In that case, the victim was a 15-year-old girl, and her attacker was another Afghan migrant who claimed to be underage, though authorities discovered that he was lying about his age and had only been in Sweden for two days before the attack.
In their letter to The Telegraph, Rowan Williams, Richard Dawkins and more than 60 other signatories—including Dawkins' fellow atheist crusader Philip Pullman—expressed their view that allowing more than 50 percent of students from a single faith would highlight and entrench the differences and prejudices that so often divide society. Diluting the religious population in a school, on the other hand, serves to emphasise instead the common values that we all share.

After consulting several of my predecessors and analyzing the NSC's current configuration, I have determined that the agency can and should be streamlined, and am in the process of restoring the NSC to its historical mission. With the president's approval, we will reduce the NSC staff, making it more effective by reaffirming its mission to coordinate policy and ensure policy implementation. The NSC staff should not, as it has in the past, duplicate the work of military officers, diplomats or intelligence officers. With that in mind, we will be able to reduce 174 policy positions to under 120 by early 2020.

No this fight is not going to be won or lost in Washington, he added. It's the American people who will beat this virus.
1) The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago According to Jevrejeva's study in 2014, based on 1277 tidal gauges: The new reconstruction suggests a linear trend of 1.9 ± 0.3 mm·yr− 1 during the 20th century, with 1.8 ± 0.5 mm·yr− 1 since 1970. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818113002750?via%3Dihub And this is their graph of global sea levels: Jevrejevaetal2013GPChange It is plainly evident that sea levels have been steadily rising since the mid 19thC, with a slight slow down between 1970 and 1990. The IPCC acknowledged the same thing in their AR5 Report in 2013.
It is particularly unfortunate that there is not a more proper celebration of Washington in 2016, as the United States gears up to choose its next president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. George Washington set a precedent of presidential leadership and dedication to Constitution.

While the paramilitary police-style Frontex is the European Union's first uniformed armed service, it seems unlikely to be the last. European leaders frequently discuss the need for a combined European conventional armed forces, with EU Commission boss Ursula von der Leyen — the former German defence secretary before she went to Brussels — calling for credible military capabilities in 2020.
But despite this success in decimating America's domestic oil industry, OPEC has not finished yet. Spurred on by domestic issues such as social spending, OPEC is shifting strategy and creating more volatility by bringing in Russia and others to collaborate on production as a supercartel. The group's unprecedented influence stems from its control of 90 percent of global reserves, but these entities do not act in the free-market, profit maximizing manner of American producers. They serve instead as government proxies, generating revenues to support regimes that do not share U.S. strategic priorities.
He said it was not surprising that the first mandated 90-day status report on the Iran nuclear deal from the Trump State Department would falsely declare compliance because the State Department is almost genetically incapable of saying foreign governments actually violate their treaties.
The forces liberated Ramadi from the Islamic State in late December.
Remainers and Leaver alike were baffled. The impasse between Britain and the EU had remained fairly constant: the EU wanted Britain to submit to its regulations and state aid rules essentially in perpetuity, via what it called a level playing field, as well as a guarantee that Britain would not escape to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.
He went on the say that it is not racist to oppose the huge migrant influx, and criticised the media narrative around the subject.

In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.
Today, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus, as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S., the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan.

A short while later, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey discussed the best course of action with Vijaya Gadde, the company's legal chief, and a number of other Twitter executives.

Mr. Trump! This is the voice of Iranian nation. Listen! Larijani said as lawmakers chanted.
The core of improving combat readiness is to maintain and promote combat capability. China can't copy the US' measure to improve combat capability through actual combat overseas since our national defense policy is defensive rather than offensive, he continued. Therefore, military training becomes extremely important for China,
Psychologist Julia Tiberg works with young migrants at Vi står inte ut, an organisation dedicated to helping young asylum seekers in Sweden. Tilberg said, We observe young asylum seekers in closed internet forums encouraging each other to commit suicide, adding, suicide is also considered moral by the group and is for the sake of others, to affect the current policy.
We make everyone from Central America wait in line, while the Cubans walk in even though they are not refugees, Gabriel Lopez, a Mexican-American Navy veteran who is president of the group of veterans who have been protesting the Cubans in Laredo, told reporters. We are saying, don't open the borders to Cubans and give them instant benefits while we have American veterans living on the streets.
Mayer's reign as CEO of Yahoo has often been controversial, with the CEO facing a lawsuit last year that claimed she purposely purged male employees, and with several employees of Tumblr, the popular micro-blogging platform owned by Yahoo, also claiming that Mayer and her management were responsible for the decline of the social network.
White House officials are increasingly emphasizing the cartels' role in smuggling labor and drugs into the United States. The cartels are massive criminal enterprises, Homeland defense secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told reporters January 7. They don't just deal with smuggling. They exploit children. They deal with trafficking, they deal with drugs. That emphasis will help officials fend off commonplace Democratic claims that Trump's support for the border wall is merely an expression of racial animus.
Authorities under these men arrested Meu Peou when he was just a boy. The state claimed he betrayed the hardline communist cadres by stealing rice. He lost over seventeen relatives during the regime. His father starved to death because, as a Muslim, he refused to eat pork.

On the other hand, Graham Templeton at ExtremeTech argues that exposing Hellfire technology to Cuba might not matter all that much because that technology is already available. Not only is there a strong possibility that hackers have looted Hellfire data during numerous raids on U.S. systems, but the weapons have been sold to dubious allies like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, who would have had many opportunities to share Hellfire tech with their even more dubious allies.

Corporate interests and the big business lobby have the most to gain from granting an amensty to DACA illegal aliens, as legalizing millions of low-skilled foreign workers would drag down wages for Americans, drive up profit margins for corporations, and leave U.S. taxpayers with the costs.
Friday's panel appeared to be designed to reassure markets. Powell had remarks written down on a piece of paper despite the informality of the panel setting. That seemed to indicate that he had chosen his words carefully.
On December 31, the Omaha World-Herald ran the Bloomberg piece published earlier in the month, which noted:
Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, Ground Game.

Asylum applications in the UK have hit an all-time high, sailing past 5,000 in the month of October alone – more than double the number arriving per month at the beginning of 2015. Critics have called the figure another nail in the coffin of the government's migration targets.

In comments made to Breitbart London, the chairman and founder of the UK-based think tank Hong Kong Watch, Benedict Rogers, described the deal as a real setback for the free world.
I think that [Trump was] moving back to the George W. Bush approach. And what was the Bush approach? Basically it was, don't change the footprint [and] don't expand the settlements geographically. Population growth, that's different. Build up and in. In built-up areas, if you want to build a new house, a new apartment, that doesn't affect the Palestinians or the chances of peace really. So the Google Earth map, if you put it that way, of the settlements doesn't change.
This applies not only to transgender people but also a great number of heterosexuals who have alternating gender expression.
The army denied the claim, made by Hamas late Saturday night, that the Israeli jets had targeted a smuggling tunnel between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.

Meanwhile, the European Commission's investigation of Facebook is providing an excellent window into just how insidious Facebook's business model has become.

Another former employee, who had been stationed in Europe for two and a half years, was told by his Huawei manager that he could only continue working for the company if he left Europe after it was discovered that he planned to marry a European woman.
The economy would be in an official financial depression if not for the world's central banks conspiring to push rates down—effectively stealing from savers. This policy is no different than cutting off your leg to feed yourself when on the brink of starvation—you may no longer be hungry, but you'll still bleed out. When the Fed drops rates to benefit people purchasing and refinancing homes, for example, savers have to resort to eating into their principal. This one action is likely going to be the cause of the next mounting financial crisis: pension and insurance failures.
The choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear, Trump said. He touted Perdue, who is seeking his second term in the Senate, as an ally who voted in favor of Trump's tax cuts, led a charge to secure relief for workers and farmers after Hurricane Michael ravaged southwest Georgia in 2018, and has supported immigration policy that favors American jobs.
MCCAIN: I wanted to ask you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car should be eliminated within the next eleven years. Everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party?
Peterson arrived on scene at Building 12 on the Parkland campus some 90 seconds into the attack. He stood outside the building as the gunman continued shooting and moving floor-to-floor to find more innocents to kill. Months after the incident Peterson told CBS News that would enter that building in a heartbeat if he could do it all over again.
Biden's deputies are promising to delay some of their campaign promises, he said. But this isn't good enough, not by a long shot, Morgan said.
I'd rather see us as citizens than subjects in the 21st century. Let's talk about what a modern state looks like, and what the role of the Royal family would be, if it had one.
Kabila has shut down the internet all week, supposedly to prevent the incitement of riots. Kabila has made it illegal for any organization to announce election results before CENI does. It is believed that these laws were specifically targeted against the Catholic Church, which had sent more than 40,000 observers to polling stations across the country.
Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost one trillion dollars in the next two decades, said Obama during his 2014 State Of The Union, bringing up his alleged concern about stopping illegal immigration once again.

[W]e learned during the course of our review that in August 2016, the supervisor of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, SSA 1, participated on behalf of the FBI in a strategic intelligence briefing given by Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to candidate Trump and his national security advisors, including Michael Flynn, and in a separate strategic intelligence briefing given to candidate Clinton and her national security advisors. The stated purpose of the FBI portion of the briefing was to provide the recipients a baseline on the presence and threat posed by foreign intelligence services to the National Security of the U.S. However, we found that SSA 1 was selected to provide the FBI briefings, in part, because Flynn, who was a subject in the ongoing Crossfire Hurricane investigation, would be attending the Trump campaign briefing.

In a statement to the media Tuesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English had sent a letter expressing regret over the harm the resolution had caused to ties between the countries. On Wednesday, English said Wellington did not regret co-sponsoring UN Security Council resolution 2334 and still opposed Israeli settlement building in the West Bank.
The culprit is adults' bad choices. Cigarette smoking is a major cause of very low food security, Rector told Congress. He is not a no-smoking scold; he is concerned about the cost of the habit. Very low food security adults are much more likely to smoke than are food-secure adults, and money that is spent on cigarettes cannot be spent on food.
The Sites Reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the Sacramento River, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. More than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. In addition to reducing flows in the Sacramento River, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western Sacramento Valley. Impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. The Sites Project Authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. But this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …
The President is now asking Congress for $5.7 billion to fund a wall in 2019. Overall the wall is expected to cost roughly $20 billion to build.
Granma did not elaborate on the comparison, and the similarities are not immediately clear, as there is no indication that Trump was personally in danger at any point on Wednesday. The assassination of Lincoln in 1865 followed the U.S. Civil War, the most violent period moment in American history not involving foreign powers.
Violent protests on college campuses throughout the country, including Evergreen State College, University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Virginia, have led think tanks that seek to protect the First Amendment rights of all students to provide model bills to state lawmakers.
I have so many companies coming into this country, you're not going to have to worry about it, Trump said in the interview, adding, It is always going to be a shortage [of workers] … We have so many companies coming in from Japan … [and] China now.
Others are sounding the alarm not because of what it implies of those who lost the missile, but how those who found it can use it against the United States. As Mary Anastasia O'Grady at the Wall Street Journal points out, Cuba is just about the only friend the pariah regime in North Korea has: In the past 2½ years Cuba has tried to smuggle weapons to Pyongyang, engaged in high-level meetings with North Korean officials, and secured US military technology. Anybody want to connect the dots?
On the third Monday of February, Americans celebrate George Washington's Birthday, often inappropriately called Presidents Day. Even more unfortunately, this holiday doesn't even fall on Washington's Birthday due to the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill, which pushed numerous holidays to Monday in order to create more three-day weekends. Washington's real birthday does not occur until February 22.

Despite this clear conflict of interest, our military ensures the free flow of their crude because oil is vital to the U.S. economy, powering 92 percent of our transportation system. The global nature of oil pricing means that no matter how much oil we produce, our economic sovereignty remains jeopardized by OPEC and the supercartel.
In the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to reform the H-1B program. Since then, business-first appointees in his administration have blocked proposed reforms by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services division of the Department of Homeland Security.
Free Venezuela—the one before Hugo Chávez—developed a reputation as a tropical paradise known for its beauty queens and delicious food. Political activism, both within its borders and by the Venezuelan exile community, highlights the dramatic change in national character that socialism has triggered. Its lifestyle and society writers, struggling to impose normalcy in a time of chaos, prove just how deep the political wounds go, deforming far more than ideological affiliations and policy preferences.
On social media, El Nacional shares not only recipes for food and household products, but seeks out individuals who possess basic drugs that families cannot find on the market. A typical El Nacional medical tweet will read like this:
The 40-billion-plus euro divorce bill, and suggestions it might not be paid if the EU did not negotiate in good faith, rapidly disappeared from the public discourse. It would be paid in full.
One of the things that is so beautiful to watch is 3.2 percent wage growth. That hasn't happened in so long for our country. That's an incredible thing. That means people are actually getting more money, taking home more money, and that's something that is really nice to see. A lot of you have been following me when we were on a thing called the campaign — that was an exciting campaign, a great campaign — and I used to talk about wages going down, not going up, but going down for years. Nineteen years. And now they went up 3.2 percent and yet there's no inflation because other things are going down, like the price of your gasoline at the tank. It is low and that doesn't happen by luck. I worked hard on that. That's like a tax cut for people. So a lot of good things are happening. Labor participation rate increased to 63.1 [percent]. That's an incredible number also.

The exercises are the latest in recent years that show the efforts China is making to boost its expeditionary force capabilities, notes the report. In 2014, the marines conducted their first training in the grasslands of the northern landlocked Inner Mongolia region.

Two Notre Dame scholars published an essay in the journal Public Discourse Wednesday arguing that it is time for the Supreme Court to provide some much-needed clarity to the vexed jurisprudence of abortion, especially by confirming the modest proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution—originally aimed at advancing the cause of equality among people—does not forbid states from acting to prevent invidious and lethal forms of discrimination against the disabled.
Officials brought Soleimani's body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard's newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.
School employees who want to arm themselves have to qualify by getting a Council on Law Enforcement Education Training certification or license; possess an Oklahoma Self Defense Act License; and be CLEET qualified with the firearm.

Washington has removed Turkey from the F-35 program and U.S. lawmakers have called for sanctions over the Turkish government's decision to proceed with the purchase and deployment of the Russian technology.
Just about every media report on the outcome of this military investigation mentions the controversial U.S. airstrike in the Kunduz region from October 2015, which killed 42 at a Doctors Without Borders hospital, and led to disciplinary actions against a two-star U.S. general and 15 other military personnel.
Require that manufacturers report imminent or forecasted shortages of medical devices to the FDA as they currently do for pharmaceutical drugs.
Perhaps the highest profile attack on Trump's manufacturing jobs promise came from then-President Barack Obama.
We are going to work … to defeat President Trump, she said, to cheers from union members.
Despite the fact that numerous national-level politicians, journalists, and media personalities have identified Eric Ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower, Silicon Valley companies have refused to relax their censorship of his name. Facebook previously said it would lift the ban if enough public figures named the alleged whistleblower, but it has not done so. Twitter does not have an official policy banning the naming of Ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower, but it has mistakenly taken down accounts for mentioning his name.
As water continued to pour in, authorities opened the spillway gates as wide as possible. But the concrete cracked, and the main spillway failed — spectacularly. The earthen emergency spillway, used for the first time ever, eroded itself and nearly failed.
Well, the large pharmacies in Virginia banded together and lobbied and got the state to pass a law saying you can't advertise the price of drugs, he related. Ralph Nader brought a case saying, well, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. In this case, the listeners were consumers of drugs who would benefit from that speech, so why are you stopping it just because the speaker is a corporation, i.e. a drug store?
Newly-installed Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed Thursday that the Constitution gives her equal power to President Donald Trump.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been extremely critical of Trump's impeachment by the House and Democrats have accused him of planning to oversee a sham trial in the Senate.
What the media and critics haven't done, and won't do, Ashford added, is to point out that their attacks on Pence are part of a larger and very disturbing trend in American life – an ugly form of prejudice called Christian shaming.
According to the news report's military correspondent, Hamas prefers to harm Gazans rather than have them live with any semblance of normalcy. He added that this was the second time Hamas had attempted to destroy a border crossing, the first time being in 2007 after its takeover of the Strip.

The Democrats are not negotiating at all, said Rosemary Jenks of NumbersUSA. They're not at the table, and that is why we are in Day 19 of the shutdown. [For Democrats] this isn't a negotiation — this is 'We're going to slap the face of the entire country and we don't give a damn.' she said.
The likely causes of this change of policy are as follows:
Cafe and gym owners in South Korea are filing separate lawsuits against the government this week seeking compensation for losses suffered under federally-mandated business shutdowns during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.
This rule comes from an admin we all hate, he tweeted, but the substance takes a lottery that randomly allocates H-1B visas & instead prioritizes them for the highest-paid workers, which incentivizes better pay for migrants. Someone will have to explain to me why that's bad. Notably, Costa did not discuss the possible benefits for American graduates.
As opposed to the Obama administration, whom Caldwell says opposed the bill, the Trump administration worked with the VA to develop The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 that would make it easier to fire a bad VA employee. It'd make it much, much quicker and reduces the firing process significantly … by about ninety percent.
The memo makes the case for plugging leaks wherever they be found., Rogin wrote.
In its first abortion case since Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court, SCOTUS has ruled to protect women from dangerous abortion drugs. This ruling represents a major pro-life victory against an abortion industry that consistently puts profit margins ahead of the welfare of mothers and unborn babies. We hope these federal regulations protecting women will remain in place and that this will be the first of many such rulings to come.
The new union is called the Alphabet Workers Union and was organized in secret for the better part of a year, electing its leadership last month.

O'Brien stressed the importance of coordinating strategy with America's partners in the region and said the U.S. strategic framework was developed in harmony with the regional strategies of Australia, Japan, India, South Korea, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). He quoted President Trump describing the Indo-Pacific in 2017 as a beautiful constellation of nations, each with its own bright star, satellites to none — and each one, a people, a culture, a way of life, and a home.
EngenderHealth has been described as a prime example of how the modern U.S. family planning movement was shaped by three overlapping social forces, namely the eugenics movement, the movement for reproductive rights and the population control movement.

Ernst, a first term lawmaker who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Bloomberg News on Sunday that the door for impeachment has been opened. In particular, the Iowa lawmaker cited Biden's role in overseeing Obama administration policy toward Ukraine, while his son, Hunter, was simultaneously serving on the board of directors of one of the country's largest natural gas conglomerates. Ernst said:

Complicating matters is the education levels of recently admitted refugees has plummeted, according to data analyzed by CIS. In 1996, only 35 percent of incoming refugees lacked a high school diploma. By 2015, the number had skyrocketed to 51 percent. The low educational attainment levels help explain why 56 percent of refugee households received food stamps or other government benefits in 2015.
If Macron's preferred candidates suffer in the vote, as they have been already across Europe in 2018, it could be another serious blow to his credibility.
The EU launched both the logging inquiry — based on a complaint by environmentalists — and the rule of law investigation last year.
Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman also commented on the strike: We performed a professional and precise [military] action. The destruction of the terror tunnel network is an essential component of our systematic policy to harm Hamas's strategic capabilities. Our message to the Gazan leadership and residents of the strip is clear: invest in the sanctity of life and not in death tunnels.
Gab was the first free speech alternative to Twitter. It takes a hardline stance on freedom of speech, allowing all legal content except pornography. Users are allowed to control their own experience on the platform through the creation of custom word filters and blocks.
Only a small percentage of the visa workers are elite people who cannot be replaced even if U.S. companies tried to hire similar American experts away from other Americans companies.
His most recent arrest came in September 2020, when he was charged with domestic violence by the LAPD. ICE officials issued a detainer for Flores the following day — which is a request for law enforcement to turn illegal aliens over to federal immigration agents for arrest and deportation — but LAPD instead released him back into the community.
Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.

Sunday's elections were the biggest since Germany registered a record influx of asylum seekers that reached 1.1 million in 2015, and the vote was largely regarded as a referendum on Merkel's decision to open the doors to people fleeing war.
5. Democrats are hypocrites. Many Democrats — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) — have voted for a barrier at the border in the past. Border walls, and fences, are not immoral, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi keeps saying. Nor are they racist. They work — which is why the European Union builds them, why our ally Israel builds them, and why even developing countries in Africa build them. The main reason Democrats oppose a barrier at the border is because they don't want President Trump to have a political win. Stop making this personal.
We fully expect teachers to be treated the absolute same way as any other employee, Jackson said. If they are in essential functions, we are asking them to come back to work and failure to do so we will follow the progressive discipline process.
Löfven commented on the results blaming the sharp increase in bombings, the high number of shootings and gang-related violence in 2019 saying, It is not so strange with the situation we have had in the autumn with far too many shootings and too many blasts. There is a worry and there is anger.
The new policy has drawn the concern of others, nevertheless, since it allows any individual to file a complaint against a real estate agent, and could be used to censor debate and opinions on race, such as opposition to Black Lives Matter, and gender, such as criticism of men claiming to be transgender and pushing to compete against women in sports.
Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person, Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of U.K. public policy, said in a statement Tuesday.

Grundy explained that she originally bought a small comb in another Walmart outside her neighborhood and wanted to get more as gifts, but when she went to the location near her, she found the 50-cent items inside locked glass cases.
Food insecurity is a question of money. Folks spend unwisely, run out of money by the end of the month, and end up skipping a meal, eating less, or being worried about food. The vast majority of food insecurity— even very high food insecurity—could be alleviated by simple changes in behavior.
Despite the efforts of European nations to tighten their borders, one million Syrian migrants are set to arrive in the continent over the coming year, a Middle East analyst has said.
Sites Reservoir … reduces the flood potential of the Sacramento River … and it allows the entire Central Valley system, all the other major dams in the north — Trinity, Shasta, Oroville, and Folsom — to rebalance … [A]s much as 3 million more acre-feet of water can be stored in Trinity, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom because they don't have to prevent flooding of Sacramento and other downriver communities, rebalancing the system.

The Harvest Moon rocker recently called Trump, as well as other past presidents, losers for failing to take action to combat climate change.
All train, bus and ferry passengers travelling from Denmark to Sweden will from Monday be required to show photo identification before being allowed across the border in a drastic move by the Swedish government to stem an unprecedented migrant influx.
The warfront is mankind's lost paradise, Soleimani recounted in a 2009 interview. One type of paradise that is portrayed for mankind is streams, beautiful nymphs and greeneries. But there is another kind of paradise. … The warfront was the lost paradise of the human beings, indeed.

Ochoa was proven to be right at the OAS meeting on Thursday. Socialist Nicaragua, a staunch ally of Venezuela, has also benefitted from Venezuelan's oil supplies.
I've long argued that we would become the biggest party sooner or later. Throughout the years we have consistently talked about gang crime, escalating insecurity, migration policy that has not worked and integration policy that has made the situation worse, Åkesson said.
Amid the flows of migrants and drugs from Central America, 12 percent say the U.S. isn't facing a problem or crisis, according to the poll, which was conducted January 4 to 6.
They're very good at stopping any illegal alien prototypes. … I don't know why we need prototypes, except that it's all just a fakeout and the whole thing about building a wall is just 'I'm going to get four years saying I'm going to build the wall and inspecting prototypes, but I'll never actually build the wall.' … No, it's a ridiculous waste of time.

Several other European Union countries, including Germany, Austria and France, also re-imposed border checks last year as the continent grappled with its biggest refugee crisis since World War II.
Sounds impressive. Except, as Paul Homewood notes, the idea that Duffy is a dispassionate observer is risible. Woods Hole Research Center is a green think tank, not a reputable scientific research establishment. And Duffy is more of a policy wonk than a practicing scientist.
The Conservative Party has complacently taken many thousands of pounds in donations to its coffers from Huawei. The Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, joined the Huawei 'advisory board'. (She was accompanied in this enterprise by such luminaries as the former senior civil servant Sir Andrew Cahn, the former BP chief executive Lord Browne, and the late former head of the Confederation of British Industry, Dame Helen Alexander.) Huawei's meticulous ingratiation into the heart of the British Establishment went to the very top: it donated half a million pounds to the Prince's Trust. It was only a year ago that Prince Charles's most treasured public enterprise declared it would 'not be accepting new donations from Huawei' because of 'public concerns'.
The Uyghur workers are then allegedly forced to attend Mandarin Chinese language classes and political indoctrination classes and are monitored by guards in the factories who report daily on the thoughts of the Uyghurs and guard against spontaneous mass instances.
As the virus continues its march across the world, governments are scrambling to tighten prevention efforts.
As a result, the government guidance is that if you have one of two symptoms — a new persistent cough or a high temperature — that you should self-isolate for 14 days. All others in your household should also isolate for 14 days.
We have to allow smart people to stay in our country — if you graduate number one in your class at Harvard [if] you graduate from the Wharton School of Finance, Trump told Fox News. If we tell smart people to get the hell out, that's not America first.
They have to make it sound like they are for some kind of enforcement, and so what they say they are in favor of is 'smarter enforcement,' just like the [Barack] Obama administration used to say their ICE strategy of 'prosecutorial prioritization' was really 'smarter enforcement,' she said.

The Palestinians have argued that settlement activity is a barrier to the so-called peace process. Israel counters that the Palestinian refusal to hold direct negotiations is halting the advancement of the two-state solution.

Some parts of the Framework are redacted, but the available text makes it clear that containing China without aggressively confronting it, and perhaps sparking a wider regional conflict, was a major strategic goal. Protecting Taiwan, preserving free and open access to the Indo-Pacific region, and containing the nuclear threat posed by China's clients in North Korea were outlined as major goals, even as the strategic document recognized that the balance of powers in the Indo-Pacific is inexorably shifting.

Well, actually the majority of Catholics voted for Democrats in 2016, Perez shot back during the Axios interview when reminded of Dolan's comment, adding:
U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has explicitly described the Trump administration's approach to China and North Korea in these terms: I think the United States has seen China, for 25-plus years, say that they're concerned about North Korea, but we haven't seen them act like they're concerned about North Korea. I think this administration wants to see them act, and they're going to pressure them to do that. Hopefully China will respond favorably, because we know at the end of the day, the only one that North Korea's really going to respond to is China.

That created a housing boom for the middle class because mortgage interest rates went down and more money was available. That was an unalloyed good thing until it got taken way, way too far and became these crazy financial instruments that farmed out the risks to people all over the world who had no idea what these securities were, or what the risks were. That's how we got the crash, he said.
The assassination attempt changed Nancy Reagan to a certain extent, Rosebush said. It added a degree of fear and uncertainty to her life, but strengthened the bond with the Secret Service and those who were tasked with protecting the president.

The sentencing of Alaa Brinji to a five-year prison term is utterly shameful.

The Democrats' refusal to negotiate was spotlighted by the failure of January 9 talks between Trump and top Democrats.
Even as many US white-collars are about to be laid off by US managers & Indian subcontractors.
One commenter on Talia Jane's post wrote bluntly, I'm going to be brutally honest. You do in fact, like many others have pointed out, sound like a stereotypical, entitled, and whiny millennial. The reason why you were/are in the predicament you are now is because you put yourself there. You made poor financial decisions because you wanted to live in a fancy apartment that you could not afford.
They thought that the war would be easy and that they would accomplish their objectives in a few days or a few weeks, and they did not prepare for it financially, and there is no popular support that would enable it to carry on a war for a decade or more. The sons of Islam have opposed them and stood between them and their plans and objectives, bin Laden continued.
Koskinen said $900 million has been pulled from cybersecurity, and customer service hasn't been fully funded for the past three or four years, resulting in some eight million unanswered calls to the IRS customer service line.
In addition, the Adelsons were known for their donations to the cause of treating drug addiction. During the coronavirus pandemic, he continued to pay the salaries of his 10,000 employees, even though they could not work. He also helped import much-needed personal protective equipment (PPE) from overseas.
Each year we learn that customer service diminishes, Crenshaw said to Koskinen. You may argue it's because the IRS budget has been cut, but I'm going to argue that it's because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences.
This is not the first time that the BBC has been told to evolve or die. Viewing figured revealed last year that fewer than half (49 per cent) of Britons aged 16 to 24 watch BBC programmes even a minimum of once a week. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom warned the BBC in October warned that public support for the licence fee could become eroded in future.
The number of students who failed eighth grade math exams went from 14,000 in 2012 to 44,483 most recently.
Unlike the House vote to impeach Trump, the motion to acquit the president may garner bipartisan support.
While the government's strategy is explicitly gender-based, stating that it sets out to combat violence against women, studies carried out both in the wider West and in Sweden show that women are more likely to initiate domestic violence.

Our position is no, the European Union can only be strong, and Europe as such can only be strong again, if the member-states are themselves strong, and in order to be strong you need to stick to heritage and you need to be proud of your roots, he said.
The deal — which was not done in consultation with the United States — is seen as a big diplomatic loss for the incoming Biden administration, which had promised to develop closer ties with the EU to counteract the rise of China as opposed to President Trump's tougher unilateral approach.
The former deputy premier faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty. A conviction could also bar him from political office.
He added that this reduction was in the works long before NSC staffers Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his twin brother were removed earlier this month. Vindman testified in the House impeachment inquiry that he reported the president's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president to the NSC general counsel, and likely reported his concerns to the whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment effort.
We've talked about campaigns that I've been involved in since 1968, and I will tell you sincerely, and without any hesitation, the stakes of this election are higher than any I've ever worked, including races for the presidency, Barbour said. Why? If you can imagine — 52 years in politics, how many times have I been asked the question: What do you worry about most about government and politics? And it is very simple — I worry my children and grandchildren are not going to inherit the same country I inherited. For the first time, I believe that could be actually happening because if you look at the left's agenda — what they say publicly they want to do. I mean, they want to do away with the rules of the Senate that keep you from just having a simple majority to pass things. And they would pass the rules to end the filibuster and make the Senate like the House.

Facebook says that they do not classify every organization listed as a hate group by the Anti Defamation League as a hate group on their platform, but states that: Online extremism can only be tackled with strong partnerships which is why we continue to work closely with academics and organisations, including the Anti-Defamation League, to further develop and refine this process.

In the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Veneto and Piedmont all sporting events have been cancelled in light of the outbreak.
The Jan. 6 nuclear test has led to another push in the U.N. to tighten sanctions. North Korea in 2013 also did a nuclear test and then unnerved the international community by orchestrating an escalating campaign of bombast, including threats to fire nuclear missiles at the U.S. and Seoul.
Democrats have been pushing Republicans, who have a slim Senate majority, to consider new testimony, arguing that fresh information has emerged during Pelosi's monthlong delay in transmitting the charges.

All claims for asylum are considered on their individual merits, and where people establish a genuine need for protection from persecution, refuge will be granted.
The main uncertainty surrounding the British economy relates to Brexit and what trading relationship the country will have with the EU after it leaves the bloc in March 2019. The British government has only just started full-scale Brexit discussions with the EU and there are fears that the country could end up crashing out of the bloc with no deal, which could result in tariffs being slapped on British goods.
In a 2017 report, the Guardian asked: Why has Italy been spared mass terror attacks in recent years? In its response, the UK daily proposed that one factor was Italy's relatively small Muslim population as compared with other European nations.
This next two chart show how the Keynesian shell game has worked since we adopted the fiat money system on August 15, 1971. Debt has grown at more than twice the rate of GDP. This is nothing short of a debt-based Ponzi scheme that has entered the terminal stages. Everything has its limits, even debt. The recent adoption of negative interest rates by over 20 advanced countries as some solution to this failure is akin to financial chemotherapy that will likely damage or kill, rather than provide the needed cure.
A crowd of angry Chinese parents gathered outside the Licheng Health Center in Jiangsu province on Friday and demanded answers about the seemingly bottomless vaccine scandal that saw thousands of children receiving substandard or expired doses of vaccine.
In particular, Haley has put focus on the Human Rights Council for its anti-Israel bias and a membership that includes countries such as Venezuela, Cuba and Saudi Arabia. In June she called the Council a haven of dictators.
He also declined to offer assurance to Americans who are worried about their jobs and investment, even though millions of his fellow Americans are unemployed, and even though wages have been flat for decades– aside from a brief spike in Trump's 2019.
The Article 50 negotiating period, supposed to expire in March 2019, had already been extended twice. Johnson found he had no effective means to break the deadlock. Some alterations were made to May's deal in an effort to force Remain diehards to agree at least some form of Brexit, with the substance of the changes being the subject of fiery debate at the time but so minor that few now remember the details — they were not sufficient to convince the DUP that Northern Ireland was being sold out, at any rate.
It would be very dangerous and unwise to proceed with the Senate Judiciary bill, which would lead to the release of thousands of violent felons, Cotton told Politico on January 25. I think it's no surprise that Republicans are divided on this question … [but] I don't think any Republicans want legislation that is going to let out violent felons, which this bill would do.
That dignity, however, does not extend to the unborn in Biden's vision for Catholics, though the Church makes clear its unchanging teaching in the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death.

We need to build the wall, said Inhofe. Over the past two weeks, Democrats have refused to secure our border from drugs, human trafficking, and crime all because they are determined to oppose any policy of President Trump—even policies they have supported in the past.
Finally, Pelosi did something inexcusable: she accused President Trump of malice. Not only is it unseemly to accuse any president of bad motives, but the word malice has deep connotations in American oratory. At the height of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln urged Americans to have malice toward none. Pelosi implied the opposite.
Because 95 percent of the undocumented residents in this country are employed, it means that the market can bear it, said Tony Payan, from the James A. Baker Institute at Rice University. I think the immigration system in the United States has a huge gap — we don't have [work] visas for the kinds of workers that our very dynamic economy often needs.
Curtis described the value of the project in terms environmentalists might understand: given that the state's climate is changing, and becoming warmer, that means more of California's annual precipitation is falling as rain, rather than snow.
Camp Lemonnier was built in 2001, but is now being challenged by a new Chinese base in Djibouti, built in 2017. The US has formally protested to China's government, and requested that China launch an investigation of the situation.
If you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the Remain-biased Civil Service — led by arch-Remainer Mark Sedwill — is using the Huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage Boris's post-Brexit deals in order to make the Brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the EU more likely. You would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment.
During his Senate confirmation hearing in June 2017, he pointed at China when asked what his thoughts were on how the U.S. should move forward in the Asia-Pacific theater.
Student activists at Yale University who believe that fraternities contribute to discrimination, harassment, and sexual assault are campaigning to institute a major policy change that would allow fraternities to accept females.
The congressman did say that he hears some of what Ways and Means is talking about for a tax plan and some of it scares me. He later adjusted the use of the term scares to mean disagree with. Asked what items those include he quickly cited the border tax, The border tax I disagree with. That's a tax increase. He said that tax raises the cost of goods and services to the consumer. He also wants to see businesses to be able to interest expense.
The first case of the coronavirus in Cuba was reported on March 11, carried by three Italians who had arrived on the island two days earlier. One of those patients, a 61-year-old man who had a history of bronchial asthma, died seven days later after presenting clinical manifestations of complications of the disease.
We played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there, she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced.
The Supreme Court announced in July that it would hear Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski and began with oral arguments Tuesday.
The library didn't cancel anyone's meeting, library spokeswoman Emily Waltenbaugh said after Black Lives Matter members moved their Saturday meeting to a church located a mile away. We're taxpayer funded. We have to be open to anyone any time.

As all of you know we are being governed by a regime that has no respect for our constitution, rule of law, or democracy, English-language Today's Zaman editor-in-chief Sevgi Akarcesme remarked. Today's Zaman's Twitter account has been deleted, and it does not appear to have published any new material since the takeover. Its articles on the seizure itself remain, however, providing a straightforward interpretation of events and promoting a petition against the takeover.
He is completely anti-enforcement, not just in terms of blocking fraud investigations, but [is] utterly opposed to enforcement, Jenks said. He believes that the job of USCIS is to hand out green cards, period.

Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.
The managing director of Dresden Marketing (DMG) Bettina Bunge lays the blame not at the declining global economy, which has seen severe contractions, but rather at the PEGIDA movement. She said that the group which meets weekly in the main square of Dresden and often attracts hundreds to thousands, had caused a loss of image due to what she called xenophobic sloganeering.
This straining of public services by a booming 44.5 million foreign-born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.
In a comment posted publicly on his Facebook page, MILO stated: The Washington D.C. Metro — the public transportation system of the swamp itself — has banned ads for my book. You already knew the mainstream media doesn't want you to read DANGEROUS. Now you can add the government to that list. What leftists fail to realize is that every banned ad, every negative review, and every nasty article about me is a ringing endorsement to the people that really matter — real Americans.
A policy of automatic renewal would keep roughly 500,000 foreign college-level visa-workers on U.S. company payrolls by the end of 2020, even as many thousands of American graduates are losing jobs amid the economic meltdown caused by China's Wuhan virus.

If you disregard your food and make use of the policy advantages given by the state to do business that is not conducive to economic development and not beneficial to the people's lives, you will only end up reaping the consequences, Chinese state media said of Liu and Ma, suggesting other tycoons had better remember they owe their success entirely to the support and guidance of the Chinese state and its dictator, Xi Jinping.
Sessions pointed out in his speech that heroin, not low-level drugs like pot, is fueling the rise in inmates and is also fueling the rising violence. Sessions said:
Several reports published this week allege that officials at Bergen Catholic High School conspired to cover up sexual and verbal abuse in the school's celebrated wrestling program. The abuse included the sharing of pornographic images, coaches watching wrestles strip naked and intimate text messages sent from coaches to students.

Every aspect of Tibetan life is under siege and Tibetans have even fewer civil and political rights than Chinese people also ruled by the Communist Party. The regime enforces its control over every aspect through the threat and use of arbitrary punishments, at times including severe violence. Any act deemed to threaten its rule becomes a criminal offence, Tibet Post International told the Commission.
In a recent article, NBC News provides an insight into the moments leading up to the decision by Facebook and Twitter to blacklist President Donald Trump. One Facebook executive betrayed the depth of progressive groupthink amongst the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe when they reported said: We don't have a policy for what to do when a sitting president starts a coup.
Looking at the grander scheme here, added Klein. it's Russia now with the Saudis taking over basically in Syria. You see new alliances now being created…This leaves Turkey in political and soon maybe militarily chaos.
TRUMP: Preexisting conditions, 100% we take care of. — Fox News town-hall show Thursday.
Shanahan, the deputy defense secretary, was thrust suddenly into the position, after Mattis announced in mid-December he would resign in February, but was ousted early by President Trump.
Complicating matters is the education levels of recently admitted refugees has plummeted, according to data analyzed by CIS. In 1996, only 35 percent of incoming refugees lacked a high school diploma. By 2015, the number had skyrocketed to 51 percent. The low educational attainment levels help explain why 56 percent of refugee households received food stamps or other government benefits in 2015.
At this point, we anticipate the offices will be open Monday, Zirinsky wrote.
Law enforcement officials investigating the case said they witnessed eight individuals come in and out of the apartment where the accused drug dealers were allegedly operating the heroin and fentanyl packaging mill.

The document is strongly supportive of Trump's maximum pressure campaign against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, for example, and it encouraged expanding U.S. intelligence and law enforcement activities that counter Chinese influence operations, a goal the Trump administration unquestionably emphasized.
Now, Ryan says the Democrat conference is unified behind her:
The GOP plan has three parts and the CBO based its reports on the first phase.
On second thought, maybe the media won't applaud Grassley for digging into this after all. They're currently very eager to promote the idea that the Obama administration was utterly incorruptible and completely above partisan politics. It won't look good at all if the FBI was preparing to hire the creator of the slipshod, frequently ridiculous Trump Dossier until certain media outlets decided to attack Trump by leaking his work.

Mansour applauded the theory Brill advanced in Tailspin that Hillary Clinton became the avatar of our malfunctioning meritocracy, so voters turned from her to Donald Trump in revolt.
For example, meritocracy, he continued. Everybody loves meritocracy, right? I'm a beneficiary of meritocracy. I got a scholarship to Yale at a time that was a really new thing, that Ivy League schools gave people like me scholarships. But what that created was a generation of much smarter knowledge workers at the same time that the knowledge economy was replacing the factory economy.
Earlier Wednesday, the House voted 228-193, almost entirely along party lines to deliver the charges. The split reflected the deeply divided nation at the start of this presidential election year. It came one month after the House impeached Trump alleging he abused his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Trump was also charged with obstructing Congress' ensuing probe.
The miracle of the nation state is that it creates a common identity and makes solidarity possible. Too much immigration endangers this arrangement.
We're practically in an open-air concentration camp, he said.
The J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner-city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program, the Trump immigration policy paper stated under a section header calling for a jobs program for inner-city youth.
On January 4, 2016, you stated that the enforcement priorities contained in your November 20, 2014, memorandum 'focus [DHS] enforcement resources on convicted criminals and threats to public safety,' they recalled.
Given that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for Sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. Watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. He said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and Native American groups. And he added that the Sites Reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout California — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.
Republicans believe that the CFPB has made it harder for Republicans to get credit. Other conservatives contend that accountable to the president or Congress. Reformers in Congress want Congress, not the Federal Reserve, to fund the CFPB.
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is set to receive nearly $141 million merger pay following Verizon's purchase of the company, despite the SEC launching an investigation into whether Yahoo intentionally covered up a widespread hack and leak of its users data for nearly two years.
Remain MPs did not play along, however — and they did not allow Johnson to force a no-deal by running down the clock, either, with the Tony Blair-created Supreme Court overturning a move to prorogue (temporarily suspend) Parliament before the deadline in a highly dubious and possibly unconstitutional use of their powers.
But some pro-migration activists are using the epidemic to argue for looser enforcement, even at the southern border where almost a million poor migrants arrived during 2019. The Hill quoted one activist who suggested that the U.S. should admit roughly 30,000 migrants who are now waiting in Mexico:

This is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.
Karaganov agreed with that characterization of his essay, adding that Russia was even more concerned with the clique of neo-conservatives and liberal interventionists surrounding Clinton, deeming them dangerous because they would have tried to restore the international order that died under Barack Obama.
The common dangers faced by Israel and many of our Arab neighbors now offer a rare opportunity to build bridges towards a better future, Netanyahu said.
CVA Executive Director Nate Anderson told Breitbart News in an interview that one of the things that immediately jumps out from the polling is the increase of support around individuals who support a full withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq from previous years.
Another project, the Sites Reservoir, has been debated for decades. Rather than capturing water by blocking a river with a dam, the reservoir would be built in a valley with minimal water and would receive excess water during floods, relieving pressure on other dams and allowing them to store more.

For nearly a decade, Pelosi clung to hopes of a return to power from her perch as Minority Leader–the head of the House Democrat Conference–but nearly was denied the opportunity when her massive unpopularity forced Democrat candidates to pledge opposition to her Speakership candidacy in exchange for support from the public. According to NBC News, a whopping 58 Democrats–11 incumbents and 47 new candidates who won their party's nominations for House seats–pledged campaign trail opposition to Pelosi's re-ascent to the Speakership.
The companies' massive use of H-1B workers can be tracked at H1Bfacts.com, MyVisaJobs.com, and at some government sites. For example, Google sought to hire 4,875 H-1B workers in 2018, sponsored 764 other foreign employees for green cards, and employed 1,501 foreign OPT workers in 2017, even as top managers developed plans to block conservatives' use of the Internet.
The Brexit Party had now more or less gifted him the succession, however, and with it the keys to 10 Downing Street — but what could he do with his newfound power?

Nancy's largest role, however, was advancing Ronald Reagan's legacy as he succumbed to Alzheimer's in the later stages of his life. She not only took care of him, but secured the building of the Reagan Presidential Library and preserved numerous documents that were attached to his life. Shirley said that all the projects to preserve Reagan's memory to posterity bear her fingerprints.

Where the Department of Justice (the Department) receives a credible allegation that an entity receiving funds under a Department grant or reimbursement program has, after assuring or certifying compliance with applicable federal laws, violated specific federal law, the Department can potentially seek criminal or civil enforcement options against the entity, the letter, dated Tuesday, reads.

Indiana's legislation sought to combat discrimination against people with disabilities or perceived defects targeted by selective abortions.
I would guess, in a year or period when political opinion polling has not been exactly accurate, it's going to be very hard to say with any certainty who comes out in the top two spots this coming Sunday. But it's possible Marine Le Pen would be one, as you correctly say, and the other would be a candidate of the extreme left actually backed by the French Communist Party. Melenchon is his name, he told Marlow.
The emergency triage document was first published in the Journal for Medical Ethics in November but is now being sent to National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across the country.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, told reporters at a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on Tuesday that his country and its allies will fully set our differences aside with Qatar, ending a virtual blockade that has endured for over three years.
The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
I know there is one piece of legislation that's scheduled for the floor this week that I would urge Speaker Pelosi to pull back on, and that is the No Ban Act. You saw at the very beginning of this, President Trump was able to take quick action when so many cases were coming out of China, and we still don't know enough about the genesis of this disease in China and how it may have started there. Unfortunately, they didn't share enough information with us as quickly, where we could have done more things earlier. But at the same time, the president was able to take quick action to limit the number of people coming in from China that had exposure to coronavirus, but the No Ban Act would make it more difficult for the president to keep Americans safe by addressing needs as we see other countries like Iran — you're seeing a large, potential large outbreak in Iran — Iran is one of those countries that we currently have a travel ban on because they don't allow us to properly vet that terrorists aren't coming into our country.
The Justice Department's posture toward sanctuary cities comes after Culberson pressured the department to bring sanctuary cities into compliance with existing law. Culberson is the chairman of the House Appropriation's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.

In February, the KRG admitted it had begun accepting munitions from Iran, describing it as the first country to provide us with weapons and ammunition directly. Kurdistan Region Security Council head Masrour Barzani, son of President Masoud Barzani, complained then of U.S. support for the Iraqi army over the Kurdish forces. 90 percent of the burden for this war is on the shoulder of the Peshmerga, 90 percent of the work is done by the Peshmerga, but we are only getting 10 percent of the armaments, he argued. The shipments received in the last months of 2015, he protested, were not even close to what we were asking for.
Some of his military reforms have included the restructuring of managerial authority across the PLA, as well as retiring a number long-serving generals and replacing them with younger officers more supportive of his leadership. Some analysts see his control of the military as even tighter than that of former dictator Mao Zedong.
Williams was asked if passing tax reform would take away some of the uncertainty in not knowing what tax changes may come. He responded, We need some certainty, but it's got to be the right kind of certainty. He said you can't cut people's taxes in one place and raise it in another, or take away the way they've accounted for their business for 40-50 years.

McGovern's response came as several GOP legislators highlighted the language barring references to a person's sex.
Taiwan should be a member. China should be expelled under Interpol's own rules, he declared.
Many polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first. In April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak? Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.
I believe that these ID checks will be effective. More will have to seek asylum in other countries, Migration Minister Morgan Johansson recently told the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter.
In an email to Parler, Amazon stated: Recently, we've seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It's clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.
The immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.
As a candidate, Trump repeatedly vowed to be the president to finally relocate the embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital. As Pence said Sunday, that unequivocal promise has morphed into Trump now giving serious consideration to moving the American Embassy.
Fox 2 that Sarder intervened after seeing one woman repeatedly stabbing Kerr in the neck and abdomen outside the tech center. The suspect in the stabbing is a 32-year-old woman, and police say the suspect and Kerr argued in the lobby, then went outside where the suspect pulled a knife, stabbing [Kerr] multiple times in the neck, back and abdomen. Sarder pulled his gun and ordered the attacker to stop.

Meanwhile, we need to plan to crack down on Tsai's new provocative actions, including imposing military pressure, which is an unbearable option for Taiwan authorities, the newspaper urged.
Israel, the occupying power, continues its colonial project by maintaining its belligerent occupation and by annexing more Palestinian lands throughout the occupied West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, he said.
Actress Jessica Biel also tweeted the gag rule is a dangerous Trump-Pence policy that allows doctors to withhold information from women about their pregnancy options and block patients from coming to Planned Parenthood:
And I don't accept the idea that this has been looked at and there is nothing there. Somebody needs to look at it, and I would prefer it to be outside of politics but somebody will eventually look at it, he added.
Perdue did express some confidence, too, that Republicans will be successful if the GOP base turns out to vote on Tuesday.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering sweeping sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system as part of a broad review of measures to counter Pyongyang's nuclear and missile threat.
The proposal was nearly unanimously rejected, however, receiving only 4.91% of shares voting in favor of the policy and 95.09 shares voting against it. Silicon Beat states that Apple did not respond to a request for comment but did previously urge investors to vote against the proposal in the proxy statement sent to investors in January.
The speech marked 40 years since a thaw in Sino-Taiwanese relations. After being defeated in a civil war by the communists, nationalists led by General Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan and established a new government in 1949. Taiwan has been self-governing ever since but has never formally declared independence.
Johnson had also agreed that Britain, unlike, say, Norway and Iceland, would continue with more or less the current fisheries arrangements for at least five-and-a-half years, with British fishermen on their knees from decades of EU plunder receiving only a meagre increase in their quota share, phased in little by little over the course of this new transition.
And by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.
McLane just might have just found his answer.
The CCP, of course, is eager to suppress all discussion of where the virus originated or China's role in making it into a global pandemic, so Chinese media leaped at the opportunity to recycle American media attacks against President Donald Trump and his administration for refusing to stop talking about it.
For instance, Pelosi has promised to hold a vote to repeal the Hyde Amendment during the new congressional term. She said it's long overdue to eliminate the Hyde Amendment.
The question before the court in Pavan v. Smith was whether a state violates the 14th Amendment by denying married same-sex couples the same right afforded to married opposite-sex couples under state law to have the name of the birth mother's spouse entered as the second parent on their child's birth certificate.
Unlike the House vote to impeach Trump, the motion to acquit the president may garner bipartisan support.
Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?
We do not comment on personnel issues. However, we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane's post and we viewed it as her real, personal narrative about what it's like to live in the Bay Area. We agree with her comments about the high costs of living in San Francisco, which is why we announced in December that we are expanding our Eat24 customer support team into our Phoenix office where [we] will pay the same wage.
The Trump administration's action last Saturday only undid a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place.

Our nation is at an historic moment. Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn.

Ebola outbreak spreads more slowly than feared in D.R. Congo
As of Monday morning, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed the federal government had distributed over 15.4 doses. Still, only around 4.5 million people have received their first dose. Both of the vaccines approved in the U.S. require two doses.
Obama's predicament is not manifested only in his kidnapping, but [also] in that he wants to take a neutral stand vis-à-vis the recent Iranian hostility against Saudi Arabia and the entire region. But he himself became a victim of Iran when [Iran] kidnapped him [just] before his final State of the Union address, and wrecked his opportunity to present himself as an accomplished hero when [his accomplishments] are in fact not yet completed.

Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Step up and recognize that there is a political game going on in these organizations, and that in order to fight the politicization of these organizations, you have to be willing to call it out for what it is, and to appoint individuals to U.S. leadership positions inside the U.S. government who are willing to fight to keep these organizations technical and apolitical, by recognizing that other people want to treat them as political, he advised.
A purported field organizer for Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) 2020 White House campaign warned that catering to the transgender community is an election loser for Democrats, according to a newly-released undercover Project Veritas video.
Buttigieg faced criticism this summer for his penchant for flying private from presidential rival Beto O'Rourke, who produced an online ad filmed aboard a commercial jet proclaiming No private planes for this campaign. Buttigieg responded during a CNN climate change town hall by saying, This is a very big country, and I'm running to be president of the whole country. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, dropped out of the race in November.

Saturday on MSNBC's AM Joy, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) weighed in on President Donald Trump's foreign policy decisions, saying it should scare us all.
But he noted a tailing off in the growth of infrastructure investment, which could prove problematic. With property investment slowing, the strength of China's growth this year will depend on whether infrastructure investment is able to offset this decline, he said.
Her views don't represent a lot of my constituents, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said of Ocasio-Cortez to The Hill. Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) agrees with Shaheen, who told The Hill that Ocasio-Cortez becoming the face of the Democratic Party hurts its brand. I think it skews what's really there for the Democratic Party, Jones, the Senate's most vulnerable member, said. He warned that if House Democrats attempt a far-left agenda, its legislative accomplishments will be few and far between. If the House did all the crazy things on the left that the House did on the right for the last two years, that's not going to happen, the Alabama Democrat said.
It is right we give a safe haven to those who are in danger but too often we have been too trusting.

It is an obstacle course, a deadly obstacle course, said John Miano, an immigration lawyer with the Immigration Reform Law Institute.
In bad news for would-be Labour leader Clive Lewis who appears to have decided not to let the crisis go to waste in using the present news cycle to float his anti-monarchy ideas, repeated and frequent polling in the UK shows sustained support and popularity for the Queen and monarchy. 2018 surveys found just 16 per cent of Britons said there should be no monarchs in future after Queen Elizabeth II dies, and seven-in-ten supported having a monarchy in future.
Soon after the incident, the woman posted on the Calais Migrant Solidarity group on Facebook, claiming: No regrets, just shocked I did [it] and having nightmares about it.
We are in a state of war, a war against Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus]. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people, Durante added.
ESAs, the report continues, have been strongly supported by the Arizona Legislature's Republican majority.
The core of improving combat readiness is to maintain and promote combat capability. China can't copy the US' measure to improve combat capability through actual combat overseas since our national defense policy is defensive rather than offensive, he continued. Therefore, military training becomes extremely important for China,
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling against President Trump's immigration order was a disgraceful conclusion, because what they did, is they substituted their judgment, as to what constitutes a threat to American security for the president's.

[For] the other one, I actually loaned him a keyboard because he just had inoperable keys, so he couldn't log in. … The third one was not a complete write-off. It needed some surgery done. and all he wanted was data recovery, so he contracted me to recover the data off of that third machine, which I did and called him the next day when the recovery was complete.

Klein noted at the beginning of 2018 how Trump's effort to stop illegal immigration pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border should be modeled off Israel in five simple points:
Two Notre Dame scholars published an essay in the journal Public Discourse Wednesday arguing that it is time for the Supreme Court to provide some much-needed clarity to the vexed jurisprudence of abortion, especially by confirming the modest proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution—originally aimed at advancing the cause of equality among people—does not forbid states from acting to prevent invidious and lethal forms of discrimination against the disabled.

Belgium's MEP Frédérique Ries, who sits on the European Parliament's health committee, said that while she did not object to her neighbour buying the vaccines rejected by other states, she said the purchase of 30 million Pfizer vaccines showed a total lack of solidarity, according to The Times on Tuesday.
Hurt concluded, It's all about the fact that [Trump] identifies the problems that Republicans have ignored forever, whether it's lawlessness on the border, or China, or trade, or the wars, or, in this case, election fraud. Of course it is true that this is a problem that has been around for a long time. I don't think we've ever seen the problem as bad as what we saw in this last election.
The main advantage of playing around with the marines is that they have a higher concentration of specialists, act well as light infantry, have good esprit de corps, and are nimble enough to be deployed over long distances if needed, he added.
We played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there, she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced.

We're already seeing the negative impacts of the proposed policy changes, said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan.
Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
On the latter point, Bromund scolded the U.S. State Department for doing a poor job of following up on legislation requiring the U.S. government to push hard for Taiwanese inclusion in Interpol.

In a few countries, the remittances paper over the economic damage imposed by the progressives' Hunger Games. For Central American countries, the negative effects of emigration seem to be broadly (or more than) offset by gains from their higher remittance receipts, the IOM reported in 2012. Those remittances are huge: Remittances sent to Guatemala represented 11 percent of GDP and 46 percent of household income in 2017 … [I El Salvador] Remittances reached $5.47 billion in 2018, amounting to roughly 20 percent of the country's GDP, said a 2020 report by the Texas Public Policy Foundation. Who gains? Those remittances consist of wages taken from the hands of blue-collar American workers, including many black and Latino hands. Illegal migrant workers rationally take jobs at low U.S. wages, so exempting U.S. employers from the wage-raising pressure to make fair bargains with the tens of millions of Americans who are disabled, parenting, drugged, isolated, or unemployed. Wealthy Americans also gain from the extraction of foreign labor and consumer demand, said a 2013 article titled Dollars, 'Free Trade,' and Migration: The Combined Forces of Alienation in Postwar El Salvador. It argued that capitalists in the destination countries capture surplus labor and value from migrants by paying substandard wages, [as] capitalists in El Salvador also profit both directly and indirectly, from remittances. Joe Biden's pro-migration allies are pressuring him to maximize migration into the United States, despite the public's deep opposition to cheap-labor migration. https://t.co/0P3Uzj6k5N — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 29, 2020
Here is how it began its snarky put-down:
In February, the peshmerga made public statements questioning whether a battle for Mosul would happen within any reasonable timeframe. Officials from the central government have been talking about the battle for Mosul for a long time, but they [the Iraqi army] are not fully prepared for this battle since their missions are not fully finished in Anbar province,Jabar Yawar, Chief of Staff of the Peshmerga Ministry said then. Less than a month since he aired his concerns, the capture of villages around Mosul has begun.
The broadcaster said that stopping the criminalisation of paying the licence could cost them £200 million a year. However, the government says that doing so would free up Britain's criminal courts and protect vulnerable, poorer members of society. Failure to pay the television licence can result in a £1,000 fine, court attendance, and even imprisonment.

Bromund found it absurd that Taiwan was blocked from Interpol membership while the Palestinian Authority was accepted. For that matter, he argued that China is not truly fit for Interpol membership because it engages in a number of clearly unacceptable activities, such as using politicized corruption investigations to get rid of officials who fall out of favor and threatening the Chinese families of individuals abroad to secure their compliance.
Graham said at the press conference that the question has not yet been examined, and that Trump asking for it to be looked into is right.
I think that's true. She was, she didn't let this on to him, but she was terrified whenever he went out, because she saw just how vulnerable he was, even with all that protection. He was such an important part of her life from a personal point of view. She was very anxious about it. But they got through it. She didn't show that anxiety to the public, and she was greatly relieved when he was able to leave office on his own two feet, as it were. And then, of course, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and wrote that very, very touching letter to the American people, hand written, and then she went on to live with him in that condition. He had to have her at his side, at night, for example, or he would get agitated, and she was there, and never complained. I had quite a strong personal relationship with her by then, and I would not bring that up, and she would not… there was never a hint of a complaint from her about the life she had been reduced to. A lot of her friends were gone by then, so she didn't have a very active social life. She had a harder time getting around. She had friends in New York. She would come here from time to time, but then she lost most of them. She was a very brave woman through it all.
Although they are on opposite sides of the war, pro-Syrian opposition Turkey and dictator Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia reached an agreement late last year to establish a horseshoe-shaped buffer zone in Idlib free of jihadis and their heavy weapons by October, to no avail.

But, in fact, I don't really think there was a change in policy, Bolton continued. I think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons, just as we would respond if it were nuclear weapons or biological weapons. It's a threat to American national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction. So Trump's response – which so far, at least, has been confined to the one strike at the Syrian airbase, although obviously, it took place in Syria – was not a shift in policy on the civil war.
After the 2002 to 2007 housing bubble burst, the Federal Reserve responded to what it called the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression by implementing both a zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP) and quantitative easing (QE) to spread cheap money into the financial markets to rescue plunging real estate prices.

Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.

One of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our 35,000 people.

Google and other search engines shouldn't be forced to apply the European Union's right to be forgotten beyond the bloc's borders, an adviser to the EU's top court argued Thursday. The recommendation—if followed by the EU's Luxembourg-based Court of Justice—would be a major victory for Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., which has for three years been fighting an order from France's privacy regulator to apply the EU principle globally. Maciej Szpunar, an advocate general for the court, argued in Thursday's nonbinding opinion that if the EU ordered removal of content from websites accessed outside the EU, there was a danger that other jurisdictions would use their laws to block information from being accessible within the EU. There is a real risk of reducing freedom of expression to the lowest common denominator across Europe and the world, Mr. Szpunar wrote.

Buchanan argued President Obama's foreign policy legacy is a combination, I — his reluctance to intervene is good, but Libya is a disaster. He shouldn't have put the red line down. And there — so I think, overall, I don't give him high marks. But I do — his fundamental idea that we go in, we go together, and we get out and come home is right, but I think the application of it's been very poor.

To put it simply, the shipping company accidentally mailed it to Havana instead of sending it to Florida.

China is firmly opposed to this, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday, in response to a question from a reporter about the CBP move.

China used to publish the number of mass incidents occurring in the country. The number of mass incidents of unrest recorded by the Chinese government grew from 8,700 in 1993 to about 90,000 in 2010, according to several government-backed studies. The government stopped publishing the figures in 2010, but it is reasonable to believe that the number of mass incidents per year is well into the hundreds of thousands. If even just one of these mass incidents occurred in America or Europe, it would be international news, so the fact that hundreds of such mass incidents occur in China EVERY DAY indicates how socially unstable China is.

We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women, Trump promised, but instead departed to the White House on his own while a small group of those in attendance went to the Capitol and burglarized it, leading to at least four deaths. Photos from inside the Capitol during the raid showed rioters breaking through glass windows, looting items from the historic building, and rushing into the legislative chambers. The riot caused lawmakers, who were in the middle of certifying the electoral college votes for President-elect Joe Biden, to go into hiding. They formalized Biden's election in the early hours of Thursday.

In recent years, China-US relations have run into unprecedented difficulties. Fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of US policymakers about China. Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy based on this misperception is simply wrong. What has happened proves that the US attempt to suppress China and start a new Cold War has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. Such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail. China-US relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening. We hope that the next US administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation.

According to the government, one child in 165 experienced very low food security. One child in 125 went hungry for at least one day because of a lack of money for food. One child in 250 skipped at least one meal because of a lack of food resources. One child in a thousand did not eat for an entire day because there was not enough money for food. Feeding America claims that thirteen million children are food insecure. But in fact the one-in-165 USDA statistic yields a total less than one tenth of that number. And the one child in a thousand who spent a whole day without eating equals about seventy-four thousand kids in the whole country. Even one hungry child is a tragedy. But the anti-hunger lobby is grossly exaggerating the scope of the problem—and proposing the wrong solutions.
In congressional testimony in the summer of 2015, Heritage Foundation hunger and poverty expert Robert Rector said, For Americans to go without food for an entire day represents a social problem, but it is a problem that is limited in scope, and it requires a well-informed policy response.
Taiwan did just that late last year following the election of President Donald Trump in the United States. President Tsai called Trump to congratulate him on his election victory and Trump, in an unprecedented move, accepted the call, implying he understood Tsai to be a fellow head of state. The Chinese communist government condemned Tsai and insisted in assurances from Washington that the Trump administration would not abandon the One China policy, which demands foreign nations also deny Taiwan's sovereignty. Trump reportedly agreed to the One China policy in a February phone call with President Xi Jinping.
The complaint also alleges that assistant coach Dominick Donnie Spataro showed pornographic and nude photographs of himself and others on his mobile photo to Plaintiff and other minor wrestlers.
Hopes that ISIS in the Philippines would collapse with the death of local strongman Isnilon Hapilon were quickly dashed. As far back as November, the many other militia groups in Mindanao, including some Muslim fighters, were bracing themselves for battle with the Islamic State and warning that ISIS recruiters were active in their communities.
Ocasio-Cortez rocketed to national prominence after shocking the political world by ousting 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in New York's 14th congressional district primary in June. The 29-year-old has quickly established a name for herself by pushing radical policies, including Medicare for All, the abolishment of ICE, and perhaps most notably, the Green New Deal — a proposed nationwide shift to non-combustible energy sources financed in (very small) part by a proposed 70% tax on top earners. However, her policy prescriptions and support of grassroots efforts to unseat incumbents within her own party have lawmakers in both chambers of Congress grumbling.
Immigration policy is emerging as the central issue of interest in the upcoming campaign ahead of the May 26th European Parliament elections.
A self-professed Catholic, as vice president, Biden did nothing to interfere with former President Barack Obama's pro-abortion agenda. In fact, his plans to defend abortion rights will undermine the beliefs of the majority of Americans of faith.
During the height of the European Migrant Crisis, eight countries imposed internal border restrictions on travel. The nations of France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have all notified Brussels that they will continue to enforce border checks to combat the threat of terrorism.
The lawsuit inspired a string of posts on social media by blacks outraged by the shelving policy:
Because of this, Zero Hedge asserted a link between the virology institute and the outbreak of the coronavirus.
The site's immigration writer, Dara Lind, described Sessions as the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies, who:
He said that the Vatican may also fear that in the future things will get worse. So, it's better to take this deal, even if it's bad, as a lesser evil, he suggested.
Abrams lauded Trump's ambivalence regarding the two-state solution as being the key to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The four non-EU members of the Schengen visa-free zone — Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein — were also asked to enact travel restrictions.
Bennett said he was flabbergasted by the statistics:
When I go to my monthly meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union, Szijjártó said, they tell me not to mention Christian communities because it is discriminatory.
According to the Cuban Health Ministry, in addition to the positive cases, 954 individuals are currently being held under epidemiological surveillance, 727 are Cubans and 528 are foreign citizens. A further 30,773 people are under regular surveillance in their homes.
Paul Heald, a professor from the University of Illinois, was only one out of more than a dozen who had accepted money from Google, according to the report published in the Wall Street Journal. It is unclear at this time whether the payments had any tangible effect on any of the academic's results. One potential reason for the funding would be to help sway court decisions in Google's favor — with expert analysis to back them up, Google could perhaps try to wriggle its way out of costly legal battles and fines, such as the recent record $2.7 billion fine handed down by the European Union in an anti-trust case.
1. The border issue is about national security, the first priority of government. Americans are used to fights over immigration policy. This is different. The nation faces a crisis at its southern border. The drug cartels are taking advantage of our open border to smuggle drugs, weapons, and people. They are also waging a bloody civil war that bleeds over into our country. Everything else the government does is secondary to protecting the country. There is literally no point to opening the government until politicians are prepared to take care of its first priority.
The status of Taiwan is a potential flashpoint between Beijing and Washington, with Washington opposing reunification by force and maintaining robust informal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Trump administration has stepped up U.S. support of Taiwan rhetorically and materially from the previous administration.
This doesn't solve the problems… this is a stunt that misuses the plight of refugees to send the message 'We want to close the borders'.

Since the 2012 election, Ryan had a number of other chances at good political fortune. He assumed the chairmanship of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in the wake of his and Romney's grand fail of a White House bid. Then, when right wing rebels took out Ryan's predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, on their third and successful coup attempt and then House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could not assemble the votes necessary to rise up as Boehner's successor, Boehner and other elements of the GOP establishment anointed Ryan as the next Speaker of the House.
In February 2020, a U.S. judge struck down the token H-1B curbs set by USCIS managers since Trump's election.
The Consumer Price Index, or CPI, increased 0.5 percent in January, above expectations for a gain of 0.3 percent, according to data from the Department of Labor. The year-over-year increase was 2.1 percent, above expectations for a 1.9 percent gain.
The first indications of a sea change in American policy came against the recent gains made by Russian and Syrian forces in Palmyra, Homs, and other places, during which U.S.-backed opposition groups were forced to abide by the ceasefire, said the official. It is encouraging, but too little and too late. With American backing, the rebels ravaged Syria and exported their ideology to other places, including Turkey and Europe, where we've now seen the results.

By shutting down thousands of terrorism-related accounts, the firm said it has joined the fight against ISIS and other jihadist groups.
One of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a message to former Trump administration officials walking away from President Donald Trump, during a meeting with top Republican lawmakers and senior congressional staffers on Friday evening, Breitbart News learned exclusively.
The memo is a response to Judge Neil Gorsuch's June 2020 vote in the June 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County court decision. Gorsuch joined with the bloc of progressive justices to declare that Congress's 1964 law against workplace sexual discrimination also endorsed the recent claim that each person's gender identity should be more legally important than their biological sex.
As the grandson of immigrants, Mike understands that immigration has been and always will be one of America's greatest strengths. His plan focuses on … tapping into the dedication and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants to grow our economy and enrich our communities.
Hungary shares the conviction of the new alliance that more must be done to protect members of religious minority groups and combat discrimination and persecution based on religion and does not accept that international organizations turn a blind eye to the persecution of Christian communities around the world, Szijjártó said.
Since then, Wall Street analysts have been asking themselves when the next hike is coming and how many hikes there will be before the world gets back to a normal monetary policy (whatever that means).
2. Abraham Accords. Foreign policy experts laughed at Trump when he said he would bring peace to the Middle East, and outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told the world in 2016 that there would never be separate peace agreements between Israel and the Arab world without the Palestinians. Yet in September, Trump brokered peace and normalization agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Deals with Sudan and Morocco followed, with more deals to come.
Frédéric Van Gansbeke, communications manager for the Grand Rally, has said that the plans have not yet been finalised, but promised fireworks. He added in other words, there will be more actions by the collective at various locations in Paris.

After passing through the U.S. House of Representatives, the American Health Care Act sits waiting for a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The bill is designed to roll back much of President Barack Obama's signature health insurance mandate. The bill has been presented as the first of several phases to dismantle Obamacare.
As part of the budget announcement, the EU added a new policy that could see countries not upholding so-called EU values having their funding cut off.
Impeachment rules require a two-thirds Senate majority to convict and remove a president, and Trump's acquittal is widely expected in the Republican-dominated Senate.
U.S. officials at the time dismissed Soleimani's claim as they saw Iran as both an arsonist and a fireman in Iraq, controlling some Shiite militias while simultaneously stirring dissent and launching attacks. U.S. forces would blame the Quds Force for an attack in Karbala that killed five American troops, as well as for training and supplying the bomb makers whose improvised explosive devices made IED — improvised explosive device — a dreaded acronym among soldiers.
This [rules] package honors all gender identities by changing pronouns in the House written rules. So they are gender-neutral. Look, we made this change for the sake of inclusion, not exclusion, McGovern insisted.

In December of last year, a demolition campaign evicted tens of thousands of migrant workers in just one month alone, so these figures seem to be credible.
Michael Gerson, one of Trump's harshest critics, wrote in January at the Washington Post:
Rather than nip the problem in the bud, China has behaved exactly as you would expect a secretive, totalitarian regime to behave: lying about the virility and morbidity of the infection; allowing as many as 5 million people to leave Wuhan before any quarantine was able to take effect; lobbying the World Health Organisation not to declare it a global emergency.
If women go into architecture, shouldn't the government give them a free education too? Xue Rongfang, a student at Fujian Normal University, asked. Why should men get this benefit?
In a separate complaint, attorney Joseph Gioconda wrote to New York's Grievance Committee for the Second Judicial District: At a minimum, Attorney/Senator Schumer's statements appear to be improper conduct that reflects upon his character and fitness to practice law in New York.
Xi clearly appreciates how unhelpful this is because vaccine activists are beginning to disappear, stuffed into unmarked cars by the same type of plainclothes goon squad that makes uppity campus Marxists vanish. Protesting parents have been told it would be best for their children if they muted their criticism of the government. Online forums created by concerned parents have been censored. Activists sardonically note that locking them up is apparently easier than cracking down on corrupt and incompetent officials.

However, these are, at best, recommendations as ultimately it is the 27-member states who can decide who can enter their countries. Further, several countries have already enacted strict border controls, the latest being central European state Hungary and the home nation of von der Leyen, Germany.
Price also said CBO ignored other legislative action.
Bolsonaro has run a campaign largely centered around social conservatism—his campaign slogan includes the phrase God above everyone and he has made opposition to LGBT issues a pillar of his policy—in a nation known as among the world's most socially liberal. Bolsonaro is, however, the only candidate making a significant dent in the polls who has never been accused of corruption.
Despite China's insistence on claiming control of Taiwan, the island has never been under the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. Taiwan possesses its own military and civilian facilities and institutions; no Beijing official has power over any part of the Taiwanese state.
But what about the right to national identity, to national security, to culture — fundamental rights never addressed by the Compact, Szijjártó concluded, eliciting a spontaneous round of applause.
She told Breitbart News, I'm not eligible for unemployment. So I have lived off my savings, and I'm living with my son. I'm still applying for jobs, but they're very few and far between. I can't relocate again because when they cut my contract job, I had to cut my lease off early, so now, my credit is bad. My lease history is bad. I can't go and take the risks that I did before. I was getting ready to go and look for a minimum wage job until this coronavirus came here, you know. Come next month, you know what? I can't pay my bills because I've gone for like eight months on my savings.
Card Charles Maung Bo, Archbishop of Yangon and the country's first cardinal, said, I am completely against any form of sanction or embargo against Myanmar.

While the paramilitary police-style Frontex is the European Union's first uniformed armed service, it seems unlikely to be the last. European leaders frequently discuss the need for a combined European conventional armed forces, with EU Commission boss Ursula von der Leyen — the former German defence secretary before she went to Brussels — calling for credible military capabilities in 2020.

Since then, a revolt has spread throughout Orange County, a traditionally conservative part of California, as local authorities have declared their intention to defy the state's sanctuary laws and join the federal lawsuit. San Diego County is also reported to be among those local government bodies considering defiance over compliance.
Current law requires that all firearm transfers be reported to the California Department of Justice via a mail-in form announcing that the gun has changed hands. The Firearms Policy Coalition reports that the form costs $19, and the new bill, Senate Bill 1037, categorizes the failure to file as a continuing offense. The punishment for this offense can range from a misdemeanor to a felony.
On top of the new migrant crisis, Europe is also grappling with the threat of the China-origin coronavirus. Hungary has changed its already robust asylum rules in light of the spreading virus, with the country's national security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi announcing on Sunday that because of the related risks of uncontrolled movements of people and infection, Hungary has indefinitely suspended access to border transit areas for asylum seekers.
We often hear it said that, with respect to relativism and the flaws of our present world, the situation of migrants, for example, is a lesser issue, Francis wrote. Some Catholics consider it a secondary issue compared to the 'grave' bioethical questions.

Not for the first time, you've misled me by asking me to come in and talk about the referendum but instead wanting to talk about me… If you had told me that I was coming in to discuss me, I would have said there are much bigger issues that the British public are occupied by than six, or however many voxpops you had.

The Framework suggested developing India as a counter to Chinese political, economic, military, and cyberspace influence, and making all necessary investments to hold ASEAN together as an alliance against Chinese aggression. The importance of protecting U.S. and allied technology from Chinese intellectual property theft was heavily stressed.
While Clegg was subsequently proven wrong time and time again with following pronouncements from EU leaders on wanting an independent EU army, he still wanted the last word.

The text of SB 1037 reads:
We applaud the Administration and the Senate for scuttling the nomination of Hanna Skandera due to her past support for Common Core standards and testing. Parents, students, and teachers detest Common Core because it locks children into an inferior education. As President Trump has said, Common Core is a total disaster. We urge the Administration to look for appointees committed to achieving the President's vision that education has to be at a local level. We cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child's education.

What people forget is that he did grow up under very difficult circumstances. He went to Eureka College [in Illinois], played football, and almost instantly became a big radio star in the Midwest. He worked for WHO, the big radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, and he recreated the Chicago Cubs baseball games. He got a great interest in horseback riding. So he was a glamorous figure by those standards. And then he went to the West Coast to cover the Cubs in spring training, and somebody said to him, 'You ought to take a crack at Hollywood.' And he became a contract player for Universal Pictures. This was all before he was 30. So he had a rocket ride to some considerable success at that time. That would have been in those moments that would have been the American dream fulfilled.
Yet in their criticism of the column, and of The Dartmouth for publishing it, many (though not all) Dartmouth organizations escalated the rhetoric further, decrying Spector and his column as hateful, toxic, vicious, privileged, ignorant, patriarchal, white supremacist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, oppressive and endangering lives.
U.N.

I think this administration wants to see them act, and they're going to pressure them to do that. Hopefully China will respond favorably, because we know at the end of the day, the only one that North Korea's really going to respond to is China.

When in October 2016 the Washington Post uncovered the infamous Access Hollywood tape of Trump using vulgar language to describe interactions with women, Ryan held a conference call with members of the House GOP conference urging them to do whatever they wanted with regards to pulling endorsements of Trump.
While much of President Trump's attention has been focused on illegal immigration and the soaring level of border-crossers at the United States-Mexico border, reforms to the country's legal immigration system remain one of the key tenets of his America First agenda.
But on January 11, Trump suggested that a broader immigration deal could be negotiated simultaneously with negotiations over border wall funding. According to the official transcript:
Neither America nor NATO was listed as a security threat in the 2009 security assessment signed by Putin's predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev. The Financial Times notes that a Russian military strategy guide published only a year ago also stopped short of describing America or NATO as threats or enemies.
Schumer declared at a Center for Reproductive Rights rally last Wednesday that the two conservative judges will pay the price if they vote against pro-choice advocates in a case regarding a Louisiana abortion law.
The irony of discussing disclosures and transparency with the Campaign for Accountability is that this group consistently refuses to name its corporate funders.

The one funder the world does know about is Oracle, which is running a well-documented lobbying campaign against us… Oracle is not alone—you can easily find similar activity by companies and organizations funded by our competitors, like AT&T, the MPAA, ICOMP, FairSearch and dozens more; including hundreds of pieces directly targeting Google. We're proud of our programs and their integrity. The Campaign for Accountability and its funders are, clearly, not proud of theirs.
Pritzker donates heavily to business-first establishment Republicans, party committies, and state parties. The strategy is likely intended to encourage party committees to suppress GOP voters' rising concerns about the broad campaign to impose the transgender ideology on communities and families.

Pritzer is a leading donor to the various advocacy groups which are pushing the transgender ideology into U.S. law and civic life.

Cindy Anderson, a member of Doctors for Camp Closure — an association of medical professionals who oppose immigration detention — decried camp conditions in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. I was in Matamoros in January and we were seeing a lot of influenza-like illness at that time. And so any kind of virus, it would spread quickly through a camp like that, just because people are in close proximity with one another, said Anderson. I think the big concern is if someone developed respiratory distress there that very quickly the resources will be overwhelmed.
Remainers and Leaver alike were baffled. The impasse between Britain and the EU had remained fairly constant: the EU wanted Britain to submit to its regulations and state aid rules essentially in perpetuity, via what it called a level playing field, as well as a guarantee that Britain would not escape to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.
Essentially, what we'd like to see is that they continue what the State Department has done, bringing together – I think it's now 32 countries – through a ministerial on religious freedom to set some standards worldwide, Curry noted, referring to the annual conferences founded by the Trump-era State Department to give foreign ministers a venue to discuss how to bolster religious freedom at home. But I also think you look first to those people we have international relationships with, like India. If China wants to be part of the international community – that is a big question mark – but if they do, we have to have some standards of human rights that are agreed upon.

We have to make [an amnesty] happen … Let us acknowledge the dreamers and their optimism, their inspiration to make America more American…
We oppose any forms of official ties between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China, Geng said, according to the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China. China urged those countries to earnestly abide by the one-China principle, refrain from having any official ties or exchanges with Taiwan, deal with Taiwan-related issues properly and with caution, and avoid sending any wrong signals to the 'Taiwan independence' forces, the newspaper quoted Geng as saying.
Klein was speaking during his weekly segment on John Batchelor's popular national radio show.
They were very, very much aware of the importance of symbolism. I think it was helped shaped a little bit by their years, not just in Hollywood, but eight years as Governor of California, Brokaw added.
Last week, Twitter banned President Donald Trump from its platform permanently. It also continues to suspend and expel tens of thousands of Trump supporters. Twitter's main competitor, Parler, was also kicked off Amazon's servers.
With the current pandemic, PSG needs to ensure that they are not themselves [a] threat to the President's health and safety. As such the PSG administered Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccine to its personnel performing close-in security operations to the President, Durante said in a statement. PSG's decision to take the risk is a courageous step that greatly supports its mandate. We did it not for personal agenda but on a greater pursuit that is even way beyond our mission of protecting our President.
I propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending, Carney argued. It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects.
It is not clear if Kolfage, board members, or advisers will be compensated for their work.
The Americans are stationed in Djibouti at the Camp Lemonnier naval base which is the primary base of operations and logistics hub for missions across Africa. It supports approximately 4,000 U.S., joint and allied forces military and civilian personnel and defense contractors.
They are globalists … [They think] their duty is to focus on [poor foreigners], not focus on their fellow countrymen or on making this country better. They have no sense of what an average American's life is like, but they can say, Oh, I'm a good person because I'm helping these [foreign] people, you know, by bringing up illegal aliens from Central America, I'm reuniting families.
I am deeply concerned that a policy document turns out not to be an agreed Government position, he said.
Unsurprisingly, Biden declined to explain how his chaotic extraction of yet more workers and consumers from Central America could not contradict his promised economic development in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. His campaign platform declared:
On the other hand, geopolitics, defence and population pressures overseas are less likely to factor into someone's decision than they might have in the past.
The Grenfell Tower disaster is uncomfortably similar to a fast-moving blaze at another London-area public housing project, Lakanal House, that killed six people, including three children, eight years ago. In that July 2009 fire, smoke and flames quickly engulfed the 14-story building. A coroner's inquest found that a series of failures contributed to the loss of life and made a number of recommendations to help prevent future disasters.
Rutnam — nicknamed Sir Calamity because in his time as a senior civil servant he has presided over so many cock-ups and disasters — is the very embodiment of the kind of remote, arrogant, complacent, intractable and devious Deep State mandarin that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings is trying to purge from the Civil Service.
President Donald Trump downplayed the goal of pro-American immigration reform in his 2020 State of the Union speech, providing only a sketch of a much-touted 2021 reform push.
Yet in the midst of this cascade of geopolitical dominoes, the Carter administration—its diplomacy led by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, the pluperfect guilt-ridden liberal—was not only unconcerned but, sometimes, actually pleased. That's because the Carter administration, having come in preaching about human rights, was determined to hold friends to a far higher standard than enemies. As Kirkpatrick wrote of the administration, It actively collaborated in the replacement of moderate autocrats friendly to American interests with less friendly autocrats of extremist persuasion.
The news comes as separate figures reveal unemployment has risen to nearly half a million in the country whose total population is less than 9 million.
The contradiction between migration and development is not a problem for progressives, said Kirkorian. Ideological libertarians and leftists look at it this way: That any way of getting here, under any circumstances, is better [for migrants] than staying where they are, he said. The development damage done to the home countries is waved away as brain gain or circulation or something like that, he added.
A recent investigation by the counter-extremism think tank Quilliam found that some 84 per cent of groomers convicted in Britain are 'Asian', with an overwhelming majority of their victims being white.
What is most striking about the survey, wrote the Spectator's Douglas Murray, is that there is such extraordinary unanimity around the question of immigration.
Business leaders in Saxony are afraid that the attention PEGIDA has brought, and likely the German media response, is giving many the impression that Dresden is a haven of xenophobic activity. Leaders met with regional vice minister Stefan Brangs to counter the image and make the city have a more welcoming image.

PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat condemned the move, saying it is part of Israel's plan to impose an apartheid regime in occupied Palestine.
Chandler called for the TfL handbook to be rewritten to reflect the changes, as well as the new policy being communicated to staff as an order.
One day, there was a pregnant woman detained at the prison with me and she felt a stomach pain as she was due to deliver a baby. The Khmer Rouge cadre in charge at the prison brought her out of the detention cell, Ms. Him said. After the woman was marched onto the grounds of the prison, in Takeo province's Tram Kak district, Ms. Him said, piercing screams could be heard through the walls of her cell. Then silence. I saw a Khmer Rouge cadre who walked her out come back into the detention cell. Upon his appearance, he raised up his hand with a human liver and heart and shouted, 'Here's the liver and heart from that woman. Let's eat and drink it with alcohol,' she said.
Bolsonaro has previously spoken about how Brazil has an obligation to support and embolden anti-communist movements around the world, although his willingness to do so may be at odds with the interest of Brazil's economy. Despite his apparent hostility, Bolivia's Morales and Chinese Communist Party envoys were present at Tuesday's ceremony.
Co-host Nicole Wallace said, That is something I pick up anecdotally is you want the guy that is going to fight high and low. This is a compliment, not an insult to Democrats. They follow the rules. You can't follow the rules and beat Donald Trump. He cheats at everything. He asked Ukraine to help him. There's a sense that Bloomberg not that he will break any rules, but he'll go high, and he'll go low. He talked about porn and a cheeseburger and a putter being in his brain.
On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News Sunday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said the Obama administration's sanctions against Russia were not enough and too late.
Though smaller than nature's own reservoir, California's system of man-made reservoirs is vast — and complex. The Public Policy Institute of California notes that state and federal agencies manage 240 large reservoirs that account for 60% of the state's storage capacity, with the rest of the state's reservoirs owned and operated by local water agencies, or by private entities for use on private lands.
FDR's decision was intensely controversial at the time, and yet for the sake of American lives, it was absolutely necessary. The Red Army bore the brunt of the fighting in World War Two, and that was the fighting that spared our GIs. In fact, the Russians inflicted 75 percent of the casualties suffered by the Germans in the entire war.
As Washington pursues a policy of encouragement of international anarchy and disregard for organizations and international law, we call upon all diplomatic corps, civil society organizations, and religious authorities to boycott the inauguration ceremony of the US embassy in Jerusalem, lest they lend legitimacy to an illegal decision and to continued Israeli policies of occupation, colonization, and annexation, Erekat said.
But it is clear McConnell does not have the votes needed from his GOP majority to do that.
And so, by refusing to read this question, this specific name, Roberts confirmed the whistleblower is, indeed, one Eric Ciaramella.
The deep state is in a deep state of desperation. With little time left before the Justice Department inspector general's report becomes public, and with special counsel Robert Mueller having failed to bring down Donald Trump after a year of trying, they know a reckoning is coming.

Since the 2012 election, Ryan had a number of other chances at good political fortune. He assumed the chairmanship of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in the wake of his and Romney's grand fail of a White House bid. Then, when right wing rebels took out Ryan's predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, on their third and successful coup attempt and then House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could not assemble the votes necessary to rise up as Boehner's successor, Boehner and other elements of the GOP establishment anointed Ryan as the next Speaker of the House.

The Foreign Desk recalls that ISIS originally said Christians could remain as subjects in its territory, provided they paid the jizya tax Islamic law requires of non-Muslims, or converted to Islam, but later ISIS abandoned those provisions and began cleansing Christians from the caliphate.
Obama's skepticism is perhaps understandable. On the campaign trail in 2012, Obama pledged to create 1 million manufacturing jobs in his second term. Instead, the U.S. economy added only 549,000 jobs in manufacturing over the following four years. In his final year in office, manufacturing employment actually contracted. For an administration staffed by people who regarded themselves as the smartest economics minds on the scene, the failure to revive manufacturing jobs likely made it seem like an impossible task.
Building a wall is kind of an obvious idea for protecting a border. Not only have walls been used from time immemorial to defend borders, but those precise three words have been used to describe what should happen at our specific border thousands of times before Trump used them, according to a quick Nexis search.
Klein was speaking during his weekly segment on John Batchelor's popular national radio show.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), who along with a group of Republicans have proposed bolstering mandatory minimum sentencing for trafficking fentanyl, said in March 2018 that the synthetic opioid is as much a weapon of mass destruction as it is a drug.
The global criticism began almost immediately.
Soleimani's luck ran out after being rumored dead several times in his life. Those incidents included a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of Assad. More recently, rumors circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria's Aleppo.
Twenty-one percent of Democrats — but just four percent of Republicans and ten percent of independents — say the cross-border flow of cheap labor and drug-smuggling is neither a problem nor a crisis.
Sadly, in the field of climate research and climate policy, good data, when not ignored entirely, is increasingly twisted to fit the narrative claiming that humans are causing a climate crisis. Climate action partisans, in pursuit of political power and ever increasing resources, force data to fit their delusion that humans must forego modern, industrial civilization to save humanity and the earth from climate doom.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to make a number of changes in the composition of her cabinet Monday, with movements anticipated to predominantly focus on junior positions.

Paul was particularly critical of Abrams' devotion to nation-building, slamming the practice as both expensive and ineffective. He was concerned that Abrams would be a poor fit not only for Trump but for Secretary of State Tillerson as well, praising Tillerson for foreign policy realism he found utterly lacking in Abrams.
Both registered and unregistered Protestant churches have been individually and collectively penalised for peaceful religious activities, the CSW said.
We passed ESA to promote good education, not illegal immigration, Kavanagh said. I strongly object to someone to try to divert public funding to people who are here illegally.
U.S. small-business optimism unexpectedly slumped in December to a seven-month low as owners grew increasingly concerned about the new economic policy of the incoming Biden administration and the spread of coronavirus infections triggered renewed restrictions.
On August 29, 2016, Strzok forwards a Daily Beast article titled FBI vs. State Department Over Hillary Clinton's Secrets to Page, Moffa and a redacted General Counsel office official, with a note saying, Good job, State… \u-19179? – presumably suggesting that the four of them meet to discuss. The article begins, The FBI and the State Department are at odds over whether Hillary Clinton's personal lawyers had the proper government-issued security clearances that they needed to keep copies of her emails in a Washington, DC law office last year.
Herschmann noted that Obama had also given up on missile defense in Eastern Europe in 2009, and that the request to Medvedev came in 2012. Following that, he pointed out, Russia invaded Crimea, seizing it from Ukraine, convinced that the Obama administration would never respond.
Brain Kolfage, a triple amputee Air Force veteran who raised $20 million to pay for a border wall, announced the launch of a non-profit on Friday, but a GoFundMe spokesperson said it would refund all of the money raised on the website unless donors proactively request to have their money transferred to the new organization.
Cuban officials will suspend tourism to the island from Tuesday, while citizens who return from abroad will be required to enter a two-week quarantine. The lockdown is scheduled to last 30 days but could be extended longer, and will undoubtedly inflict major damage on the country's already struggling economy.
The Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.
The CDC has provided guidelines for prioritizing people for getting inoculated, but ultimately it is up to the states to decide.
Shopify said in a statement: Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence. Based on recent events, we have determined that the actions by President Donald J. Trump violate our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibits promotion or support of organizations, platforms or people that threaten or condone violence to further a cause. As a result, we have terminated stores affiliated with President Trump.

To date, the height of the Times' onslaught against Jews – Israeli and American – who think that actual pro-Israel policies are more meaningful than abstract concepts, and believe that it is antisemitic to argue that Jews are uniquely unworthy of self-determination — came last week. On January 4, the Times' deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman published an essay titled, American Jews and Israeli Jews are headed for a messy breakup.
Holly O'Reilly, one of the main organizers of the anti-Trump protest March For Truth, was blocked by Trump following many critical comments on his statuses. In one tweet, President Trump discussed the British Prime Minister's anger that information relating to the terrorist attacks in Manchester were leaked. YOU ARE THE LEAKER, you bloody idiot. God, you're embarrassing. wrote O'Reilly.
They are saying: enough, enough, enough, Mr Morrison told the 2018 Bradfield Oration in November.
Gartner's numbers are far below the 74.77 million sales of iPhones that Apple, Inc. reported for the three months ending December 26. But Apple employs the controversial accounting policy of reporting shipments into dealer hands as sales for accounting purposes.
In the Republic of Ireland, Lidl and Tesco store managers are also looking out for their community by offering priority shopping for seniors, over 65s, and carers.

The Democrats are not negotiating at all, said Rosemary Jenks of NumbersUSA. They're not at the table, and that is why we are in Day 19 of the shutdown. [For Democrats] this isn't a negotiation — this is 'We're going to slap the face of the entire country and we don't give a damn.' she said.
He hasn't attended key meetings, crucial foreign policy issues have been delegated to senior White House advisers, Tillerson has been largely out of the public eye and the department has not held a news briefing since the inauguration, Rogin said.
Boris Johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. Even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.
So much for Hillary Clinton's famously bungled reset button stunt, President Obama whispering to Putin that he would have more flexibility to accommodate Russian missile demands after he got re-elected, and the spectacle of the Obama team mocking 2012 rival Mitt Romney for warning that Russia represented a major geopolitical threat to the United States.
Nancy Reagan was one of the smartest people you will ever meet, Rosebush said. She basically wanted to know everything that was going on in the president's life. It didn't mean that she necessarily wanted to influence it, but she wanted to be aware of it and be a staunch supporter with him.
Remember those words: peace and prosperity.
Wine leads the NUP, a social-liberal political party that opposes President Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRM) Party. The NRM has ruled Uganda since 1986, when its rebel wing, the National Resistance Army, helped Museveni seize control of the country through guerilla warfare. Museveni was a vocal Marxist when he took power and remains a loyal ally of the world's largest Communist Party, the Communist Party of China.

Iran has promised harsh revenge for the U.S. attack, which shocked Iranians across all political lines. Many saw Soleimani as a pillar of the Islamic Republic at a moment when it is beset by U.S. sanctions and recent anti-government protests.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Perry highlighted programs like the Girls Code Camp and The Och Initiative for Women in Finance, Math and Sciences. He argued that the programs are illegally granting preferential treatment for cis women and illegally discriminating against men and gender non-conforming students, faculty and patients.

Regarding the impeachment more broadly, Sessions said the partisan push by the U.S. House—it's the first time in the history of the United States that an impeachment has been purely partisan in nature with bipartisan opposition—was a colossal failure. In the House, all Republicans were joined by three Democrats in opposing one Article of Impeachment and by two Democrats in opposing the other. A fourth Democrat voted present on both Articles, refusing to vote for either one. One of the two Democrats who voted against both Articles left the Democrat Party over it, joining the GOP. The Senate process has been similarly marred by Democrat partisanship. What's more, Sessions says, the actual allegations don't pass muster.
This may be a trend that continues in future as several wealthy UK born people that we spoke to said they were concerned about the way London and the UK in general had changed over the past decade or so. Australia seems to be their preferred destination.

Although Biden and his running-mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have promised their response to the crises will prioritize equity for all Americans, it appears that not everyone will have a voice in the new administration. Biden's cabinet, in fact, will be the first since President Bill Clinton's initial term to not have a member of the opposing party at the head of an administrative department.
Climate change and abortion are not identical, he said. There are some people, including some bishops, who would like to think that they are, but they're not.

The American people and the people on Taiwan are not just partners — we are members of the same community of democracies, bonded by our shared political, economic, and international values, Pompeo said in a statement congratulating Tsai. We cherish our constitutionally protected rights and freedoms, nurture private sector-led growth and entrepreneurship, and work to be positive forces in the international community.
The dissent between the U.S.-backed groups and IS and Nusra Front … was about the distribution of resources. And the proof is that on the eve of last month's Geneva talks, Saudi Arabia, backed by America, demanded that the areas controlled by Nusra be included in the ceasefire agreement, which Syria and Russia dismissed out of hand. America was subsequently left with no choice but to declare Nusra, Riyadh's ally, a terrorist organization.
They're taking advantage of COVID to restrict people's ability to meet, some of which is, of course, understandable. But we have cases, documented cases, where they're arresting people who are attending Zoom church, where they're monitoring church online, Curry explained. So China is cracking down. It's not related to COVID, but they are certainly using COVID as a justification to intensify the persecution.
We have to allow smart people to stay in our country — if you graduate number one in your class at Harvard [if] you graduate from the Wharton School of Finance, Trump told Fox News. If we tell smart people to get the hell out, that's not America first.
According to Louder with Crowder, this is why the tweet may have violated hateful conduct policies:

Just at a time when people are finally waking up to the dangers of the CCP, after a year in which the whole world has suffered a global pandemic caused, at least in part, by the CCP's mendacity and repression, and at a time when increasingly experts are accusing the CCP of committing genocide against the Uyghurs, now is not the time to be doing such deals, especially without any human rights safeguards in them, Rogers said.
Despite the sunny outlook for jihad offered by bin Laden in many of these letters, Reuters notes that other correspondence painted al-Qaeda's fugitive leader as paranoid and under intense pressure.
3. The border crisis has nothing to do with legal immigration, which we embrace. Corporal Ronil Singh, a Newman, California police officer — and legal immigrant — was murdered the day after Christmas by an alleged illegal alien. Many Americans want less immigration — a debate for another day. Regardless, Americans respect legal immigrants. We should reform our immigration laws, including those that allow foreigners to claim amnesty as soon as they touch American soil. Corporal Singh gave his life to defend the rule of law. That is what is at stake.
The Catholic Bishops of England and Wales have registered their displeasure with the law, which they claim unfairly targets Catholic schools.
Greenblatt, Trump's longtime business attorney, will be an observer at the summit, but plans to use his visit to discuss the type of regional approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Netanyahu and Trump have floated.

Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers considered high-skilled are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. This program gives hundreds of thousands of good white-collar jobs to foreigners instead of young American scientists, software developers, engineers, chemists, graphic designers, investment analysts, and accountants.

While analysts interpreted Thursday's report as a signal that the central bank's next move will be to raise interest rates, they also said that move is likely to be a long way off.
Hopes that ISIS in the Philippines would collapse with the death of local strongman Isnilon Hapilon were quickly dashed. As far back as November, the many other militia groups in Mindanao, including some Muslim fighters, were bracing themselves for battle with the Islamic State and warning that ISIS recruiters were active in their communities.
2) Notwithstanding the vast number of illegal alien valedictorians, there are also criminals, drunk drivers, drug cartel members and desperately poor people consuming government services meant for the least among us and driving down the wages of our working class.
Indeed, the Telegraph reports that the Cabinet did not agree to an indefinite 'transition', during which Britain would effectively remain inside the European Union but lose it's voting powers in the European Parliament and Council.
The New York Times reports that users that have been blocked by President Trump on Twitter have taken legal issue with their ban, arguing that the Constitution bars the President from blocking people on the social media service.

[B]ased on controlling authorities, we must give effect to the ordinary public meaning at the time of enactment and construe the term 'sex' in Title IX to mean biological sex, male or female, says the memo, which was signed by Reed Rubinstein, the department's principal deputy general counsel. Congress has the authority to rewrite Title IX and redefine its terms at any time [and] To date, however, Congress has chosen not to do so,  said the memo, which was sent to Kimberley Richey, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights.
This kind of major demographic policy change can only put strain on China's economy, which is already running on a huge debt bubble and a huge real estate bubble.
We watched eight years of the foreign policy of the previous administration that was fantasy. Fantasy. They would enter into agreements and arrangements that weren't based on anything with the potential to be lasting, and if America First in foreign policy means anything, it means being realistic. He added:
With each presidential election, Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free, democratic way of life, and how much we cherish our nation: the Republic of China, Tsai said, using the official name of the island nation. This election has shown that the Taiwanese people hope the international community will witness our commitment to democratic values and will respect our national identity. We also hope that Taiwan will be given a fair opportunity to participate in international affairs, she said. Tsai also demanded an end to China's violent threats.
The SBU stands for Sensitive But Unclassified, a designation used on documents that are not technically secret but also not supposed to be shared, Rogin wrote. The memo itself is marked SBU and begins with detailed explanation of how and when Tillerson has the privilege of protecting certain types of information from public disclosure, such as anything that has to do with internal State Department deliberations.
Our faith and beliefs on marriage and hosting weddings at our home and in our backyard of our farm have nothing to do with the city of East Lansing, Tennes said at a press conference.

The League has topped opinion polls for months, but the FdI has seen rapid growth in popularity over the last two years, rising from the 6 per cent at the European Parliament elections in 2019.
The Trump administration would do well to listen. Constructing the wall was the single most important campaign promise made by the President. Build the wall was the trademark chant at every Trump election rally in 2016. This issue arguably won the election for President Trump.
Corporate earnings are being propped up by rolling (refinancing) their debts into lower and lower rates, and borrowing to buy back outstanding shares. If a firm can purchase 10% of their outstanding stock, then earnings get a nice boost without them ever having to increase sales. This buyback strategy has buoyed some of the largest firms all over the world, as they are the ones able to borrow at the most favorable rates.
I think it was a mistake to certify compliance, but as I say, it's exactly what the State Department did in the early Bush administration with the agreed framework with North Korea. Despite mounting evidence of North Korean violations, they kept wanting to certify that North Korea was in compliance. Eventually, we broke that. This game isn't over yet, but that first certification was a disappointment, he said.
When asked how that would affect the U.S. economic model, Mnuchin took a swipe at Thunberg.
The Federal Reserve's ZIRP and QE policies created artificially low interest rates that have been the secret sauce that reflated real estate.
Thanks to New York's newest bail reform measures, signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), all six of the accused drug dealers were released from jail without bail roughly a day after their arrests and will not spend any time in prison before the criminal trials against them begin.
She has to satisfy the open borders wing of her caucus [and] not veer too far in the direction of the progressives … I think the Democrats in Congress are more extreme on immigration than most Democratic voters are, but they can't afford to be associated with Abolish ICE! and pro-caravan demands.
Other major U.S. sports leagues could soon follow suit. The National Football League announced that it is evaluating its political contributions, but has not yet committed to stopping or suspending them.
Well, you just look at the numbers. There are 8-9 million people who are on the exchange currently. I'm not sure how they are going to get 14 million people uninsured, if that's what they say, with only eight million people on the exchange. They are individuals, I guess that they assume that are on Medicaid who aren't paying anything in the Medicaid system who are not going to take the Medicaid policy just because the mandate ended or something happened. It's just not believable is what we would suggest. We'll look at the numbers and see.
The proposal was nearly unanimously rejected, however, receiving only 4.91% of shares voting in favor of the policy and 95.09 shares voting against it. Silicon Beat states that Apple did not respond to a request for comment but did previously urge investors to vote against the proposal in the proxy statement sent to investors in January.
NOAA violated its own rules when it undertook a similar adjustment process for recording ocean temperatures, beginning in 2015. As David Rose wrote for the Daily Mail, [NOAA scientists] took reliable readings from [ocean] buoys but then 'adjusted' them upwards—using readings from seawater intakes on ships … even though readings from the ships have long been known to be too hot. When you mix bad data with good, you no more produce reliable results than you do by adding muddy river water to purified bottle water to produce safe drinking water.
The peace plan made absolutely no sense whatsoever for reasons I gave at the time — Russia and Syria will continue bombing what they claim are terrorist groups, which are pretty much all Sunnis in Syria, and the plan would not apply to the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh) and the al-Qaeda linked Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Nusra Front). And sure enough, the cessation of hostilities collapsed in less than a week. In fact, the peace plan actually worsened the hostilities, since it provided cover for substantially increased bombing and fighting from all groups.
I support affirmative action-style policies, Spector added. But I do not support the extreme application of a diversity policy. And I do not support a directorate that is unrecognizable as representatives of Dartmouth's student body.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the Senate on Tuesday scoffing at what he called the bizarro world of Pelosi's impeachment strategy that delayed transmitting the charges for weeks.

According to the report, two former co-workers said they overheard Ciaramella and Misko, close friends and Democrats, discussing how to take out, or remove, the new president from office within days of Trump's inauguration.
When you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule.
Since Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, its citizens have been able to work and reside wherever they want within the bloc, with all the restrictions lifted in 2014.
The huge 2019 inflow was largely allowed by legal rules established by progressives under Obama, and it ended in early 2020 when Trump and his populists blocked the catch and release of economic migrants into the U.S. labor market.
It doesn't have to be done in a chunk, but we we do need to cut rates, we need to, I think 100% expensing is important, he said, re-emphasizing the importance of not placing an added burden on taxpayers.

Greening has been replaced as Secretary of State for Education by Damian Hinds, who was Work and Pensions minister.
Oddly enough, Powell was asked if he would resign if Trump demanded it. He said he would not. But after Friday's comments and the market's reaction, that scenario now seems even less likely than it ever did.
He lamented the failure of mainstream parties to make a policy that appears at least halfway sensible and said this failure had triggered panic in many people.
Sackett wants the legislation to go in the opposite way and require a permit for open carry as well.
This is an attempt to distract the American people away from his failed policies, Cox explained. So did we participate in CNN's event tonight? No, we didn't. We were offered one pre-screened question. Megyn, I know that you don't send your questions over to the White House so I would rather have a conversation with you that's intellectually honest than sit through a lecture and get one opportunity to ask a pre-screened question.

An average of some 21 thousand people visited the landmark each day with a peak attendance recorded during the months of March and June, the ministry noted.
If this is good for real estate agents, why not attorneys, why not doctors? Föehl told Murawski. They're going to be pressured to do what NAR has done. And that pressure is going to be very real, because what organization wants to argue they should allow hate speech by their members?
Durov described Telegram as the largest refuge for people seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security. He wrote in a post to his platform:
I have defended Italy. I have full and total faith in the justice system, Salvini said after the vote.
The last of the DACA work-permits granted by Obama to illegals will expire in in 2019, but the expirations will open up to 300,000 jobs — perhaps at decent wages — before November to some of the nine million working-age American men who have been sidelined by post-1990s wage-freeze.

The question that I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating? We made the position of the President very clear, not only in terms of what our proposal is; we've integrated some of their proposals … We stand ready to sit down with the Democratic leadership.
Combine that with what they want to do with open borders, sanctuary cities, and defunding the police, Perdue said. Explain to me how that makes our cities safer. If you want to see what Georgia would look like, and you've said this before, under a Democratic regime in Washington, just go to California. Look at the anarchy in the streets of Portland, Oregon, today. Atlanta is now tied with Chicago as the murder capital of the world on a per capita basis. This is not something Democrats will own up to, that they do not want to talk about, so he is pandering to that Latino community and my question is the same thing I would ask the African American community: What have they done for you lately? President [Donald] Trump has just passed tremendous things that help both communities. We passed opportunity zones, which brings millions of dollars into these economically challenged areas in both the Latino and the African American communities. We've funded HBCUs, our historically black colleges and universities, and we passed a criminal justice reform act that we've been trying to do forever to correct the Joe Biden bill from 1994. The Latino community is smarter than these Democrats think. We did very well with them in the general election and we're going to do well with them on Tuesday. We've just got to get all Republican voters out on Tuesday. It is absolutely essential that every person who's concerned about the future of America must hold the line here.
Iran's best hope for weathering sanctions might lie with India, which is generally supportive of U.S. policy but has not disguised its hunger for more Iranian oil. India's finance ministry kicked off the new year by announcing a massive retroactive tax break for crude oil imports from Iran. The move was a major step toward creating a durable financial infrastructure for working around U.S. sanctions to keep Iranian oil flowing into India, and will give Iran a trove of Indian currency to spend on imports and investment.
Of the total migrants detained at the border, 95 were arrested on various charges, including 29 who were arrested and charged with aiding people-smuggling efforts.

Then on Tuesday pro-Iranian militia members marched on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, leading to diplomats holing up in the sprawling compound as protesters burning the embassy's reception.
The only notable decreases were on the (confusing) questions of the quality of the environment — a six point drop from 52 to 46 percent; the level of immigration, a drop from 41 to 35 percent (which might mean people agree with Trump that there's too much immigration, or disagree); and the country's abortion policies, where satisfaction dropped seven points, from 39 to 32 percent. Again, though, we don't know if that means people think abortion policy is too restrictive or liberal.
The U.S., Mnuchin said, has been a leader in reducing carbon emissions. What the president objects to is the Paris agreement, because he thought it was an unfair agreement for the United States.
NASA and NOAA's new report is another instance of garbage in, garbage out, in which their use of bad data produces flawed results, which, based on experience, will be used to push bad policies.
Tlaib had already voiced her support for what the left-wing magazine The Nation approvingly called immediate action to impeach Trump.
Trump has made a similar point for the opposite reason, poking fun at Democratic environmental plans.
China ranked 17 among the world's persecutors of Christians, lower than several nominal democracies such as India and Nigeria due largely to a lack of civil-society-driven mob attacks on Christian communities. The ranking this year, nonetheless, represented a six-spot rise for China between 2020, when it ranked 23, and 2021.

Like many new fathers, Clerfe was overwhelmed by the event. You can't explain, but inside of you is just jumping for joy, he said. Clerfe will enjoy a month at home with his new daughter, thanks to a policy in his battalion. And while 2018 has gotten off to a rocky start for many in the United States, the soldier's daughter brought something else along with her sudden arrival: Hope. That moment, having a first kid into the world [on] the very first day of the New Year, I think that it's going to be a very good year, Clerfe said.

The agreement will see the US slash import duties on Chinese goods worth billions of dollars, though levies remain in place on two-thirds of more than $500 billion of products.
There is no reason to criticise, since it is already the case that if you as a Dane have valuables for more than 10,000 kroner ($1,450, 1,340 euros) it may be required that this is sold before you can receive unemployment benefits.
The Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization specializing in religious liberty cases, is representing Tennes.

Hopefully these Trumpist tricks do not have implications beyond the borders of the U.S. and the threats from Trump, [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo, and others in the fundamentalist select group, who insist on possible acts of war, do not become reality, the propaganda outlet declared.
What kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel stood firm Monday on her refugee policy, despite a drubbing in regional elections described as a debacle in which disgruntled voters turned to the anti-migrant AfD.

Critics, however, say that state authorities allocated just enough money to the project to make it appear as if they are spending money on water storage, while not quite enough to allow the reservoir to be built.
In her piece, Kirkpatrick focused on the foreign-policy failings of President Jimmy Carter, who had so badly mishandled the Cold War against the Soviets. The immediate issue, back then, was that the Carter administration was more critical of non-democratic allies than of actively anti-democratic enemies. Hence the double standard in Kirkpatrick's title; our non-democratic allies were scorned, while our anti-democratic enemies were sometimes even praised. Indeed, the Carterites seemed determined actually to depose pro-American autocratic regimes, thus paving the way for pro-Soviet totalitarian regimes.
The COVID-19 response should not be linked to immigration enforcement in any manner. It will undermine individual and collective health if individuals do not feel safe to utilize care and respond to inquiries from public health officials, for example during contact tracing. Similar enforcement-free zones have been declared during hurricanes and other emergencies, including after the September 11 terrorist attacks. These policies should be clearly and unequivocally articulated to the public by the federal, state, and local governments.
As part of this, the government proposes to raise the issue of freedom of speech, with a view to ensuring that a principle underscoring the importance of free speech in higher education is given due consideration, Johnson wrote.

The 2008 crash was caused by government organizations like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac doling out mortgages to people of every color who could not afford them. Moreso, the crash was caused by a lot of middle class white people who purchased homes they could not afford and then used risky loans on their already over-extended home as a means to turn that home into a credit card.
George Soros has an army of shadows working in Hungary. We want to unmask it. We want to show that migration is not a human rights issue but a national security issue, he said.
Pence described meeting Julie Champine on a recent trip to Wisconsin. He recalled her story of losing health insurance and her doctor while she faced health issues. She was forced to sign up for an Obamacare plan which in 2016 cost more than $9,000 in premiums for her family and carries a $13,000 deductible. Champine's plan premium increased another $2,600 this year, said Pence. Julie told me that her Obamacare health insurance plan costs more than her mortgage and she can't even afford to use it, said Pence. A few months back she dropped her plan for a few months in order to afford Christmas presents for her kids.

These are five legal immigration reforms that Trump can readily follow through on in 2019 to fulfill his campaign promises ahead of 2020.
President Trump has called the family of 33-year-old Newman, California police officer Ronil Singh to offer his condolences after the officer was allegedly murdered on the job by an illegal alien.

Some of the water that will be produced from the project will be dedicated for environmental projects, he said, nothing that some water would help fish, and some would supply existing refuges that support waterfowl species.
2. The first victims of the Mexican cartels are the migrants and the countries from which they come. Cartels are brutal. They slaughter innocent civilians. They rape the women and girls they are trafficking to criminals in the U.S. The drugs they sneak into the U.S. kill thousands of Americans each year. And the developing countries that migrants leave behind become poorer. Democrats who, like Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), say [t]here is no national emergency on our southern border, are encouraging the cartels. There is nothing humane about an open border.
He pointed out that he defended former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. I made sure that Mueller could look at the Trumps. My Democratic friends seem to have no interest in looking at something that screams to reek, he said.

To date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support. And—it is my duty as speaker to say this—nearly 750 bills that the House has passed remain stuck in the United States Senate. But the rest made it into law. We have taken on some of the biggest challenges of our time, and made a great and lasting difference in the trajectory of this country. We began a historic rebuilding of our military and national defense. We enacted new and tough sanctions on some of our biggest foes. We ushered in a new career and technical education system. Record regulatory reform to help small businesses. A long-sought expansion of domestic energy production, to be followed by America's new energy dominance. To stem the tide of opioid addiction, the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. Criminal justice reform to give more people a chance at redemption. A landmark crackdown on human trafficking that is already yielding results and saving lives. A VA with real accountability, and finally, better care for veterans. And, after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years. Think about it. We went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive.
D.R. Congo delays releasing election results again

We have not given the [illegals] the opportunity or [the] certainty to be able to fully contribute to the country, said Jorge Lima, the senior vice president of policy at the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group. That is not just hurting them, but that's hurting us.
Now Trump and the Israeli leader are both speaking vaguely of a broader Middle East package. Israel's Arab neighbors, who traditionally opposed Israel but have realigned because of common concerns about Iran — would serve as guarantors.
AfD's double-digit score in all three states indicates that the public outrage fuelling far-right movements such as France's National Front and Austria's Freedom Party has also gained a firm foothold in Germany.

Granma not only fails to tie Haza's father to Frank País's death and mention that País did not support communism, it also leaves the pertinent detail unsaid that Haza's father initially supported Castro before it became clear that he was a communist. According to Town Hall:
And yet even with the Soviets gone, today, another empire, China, threatens us. Indeed, the Chinese, at the rate they're going, could prove to be more of a threat to us as than the Soviets at their worst.
Dr Ramsay said that while there may be extremely rare occasions when the second dose of a vaccine is unavailable or if it is unknown what vaccine the patient initially received, it might be better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all.
Of the total migrants detained at the border, 95 were arrested on various charges, including 29 who were arrested and charged with aiding people-smuggling efforts.

I've noticed the dangerous trend against free speech in recent years, responded Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who denounced the language rules and also the Democrats' decision in the rules package to prevent extended debates on bills by filing a Motion to Recommit during a floor debate:
It would take only 118 pounds of fentanyl to kill 25 million people. That's how much of the powerful opioid painkiller that Nebraska State Trooper Sam Mortensen found in April when he stopped a truck marked 'U.S. Mail' swerving onto the shoulder along Interstate 80.
Video emerged recently, which showed two black men getting arrested in a Starbucks. A white patron can be seen, and heard, sarcastically questioning police over why they were taking the men into custody:

In the UK, the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 85. The situation is worse in Italy, where some 2,260 people have contracted coronavirus and there have been 80 deaths. On Wednesday, the Italian government announced that schools will be closed in an attempt to halt the spread of the deadly virus.
Experts argue that the most efficient way to reduce the wage gap would be to encourage employers to put less emphasis on asking their employees to work long hours and to allow them to work remotely. Progressive economists, like Kerr, also argue that government-subsidized childcare could lift women out of the self-reinforcing cycle of the wage gap.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has intensified an assault on all human rights against every group and individual in China, Britain's Conservative Party Human Rights Commission has alleged in a report, which claims to show evidence that the actions carried out by the regime are indicative of the crime of genocide.
That'll be because the conservatives generally get their facts right while the liberals hide behind junk science mumbo jumbo, appeals to authority and sneery, and mocking articles like the one published by E & E.
Citizens of nations with whom their relations had been hostile, such as the Ammonites and Moabites, were never to be admitted to citizenship, he observed.
Nazim Zinal, a Peshmerga military source, tells Kurdish outlet Rudaw that the Iraqi army is simply not a potent enough force to keep the fight going, hence the slow start to the recapture of Mosul. With all the ammunition they [the Iraqis] have ultimately they are too weak, he argued, noting that if the Peshmerga were armed as well as the Iraqi army We would have been near Mosul by now.
There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It's time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they're worth. Joe will start by strengthening unions and helping workers bargain successfully for what they deserve. His plan will check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws. He will also encourage and incentivize unionization and collective bargaining.
The troops of Frontex in their own European uniforms comes less than seven years after Brexiteers were told they believed a dangerous fantasy for saying the European Union was moving towards having its own armed forces — of which the paramilitary Frontex is the first phase.

Missionary Father Bernardo Cervellera says that the Vatican is yielding way too much in its forthcoming diplomatic deal with the ruling Communist Party in China, which risks being limp.
But just like Joe Biden, no one has to take Bloomberg out of context, no one has to misquote or lie about the racist things he's said.
America's Founding Fathers denied entirely any right of Caesar… Caesarism, which became the ultimate origin of the divine right of kings, was accordingly anathema to Americans. The American Founders looked toward and empire of freedom unprecedented in human history. They meant to combine power greater than that of the Rome of the Caesars with freedom greater than that of the roman republic or any other republic of antiquity.

Still, Carney said the improved growth outlook compared with last November was underpinned by four factors, chiefly looser budgetary policy by the government, announced last November.
ICE is fortunate that the threat [to migrants' health] posed by these detention centers can be mitigated rather easily. By releasing from custody the thousands of detainees who pose no threat to public safety and do not constitute an unmanageable flight risk, ICE can reduce the overcrowding of its detention centers, and thus make them safer, while also putting fewer people at risk.

Shoot em like yall shoot us, said rapper Snow Tha Product, stage name of Claudia Alexandra Madriz Meza.
We need people. We have to have people because we have all these companies coming in. We need great people. But we want them to come in on a merit basis. They have to come in on a merit basis. They can't come in the way they've been coming in for years. I get calls from the great tech companies and they're saying we don't allow people at the top of their class at the best schools in the country, we don't allow them to stay in our country. So they end up going back to China and Japan and so many other countries all over the world, and we don't keep them. They get educated at our finest schools and then we don't allow them to – through a various set of circumstances — to have any guarantees of staying. So we lose out on great minds. We can't do that. We have companies, if we don't change that, and we're working on that and we discussed that with the Democrats and I think they agree. We're working on that. But we don't want to lose our great companies because we have a ridiculous policy that we won't accept smart people. So call it politically correct or not, but we have to let these great, brilliant companies have the smartest people in the world.
I'd rather see us as citizens than subjects in the 21st century. Let's talk about what a modern state looks like, and what the role of the Royal family would be, if it had one.
Tom Van Flein, current chief of staff for Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and former personal and PAC attorney for Gov. Sarah Palin, will discuss the report published today by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology regarding Russian attempts to influence U.S. energy policy.

A Politico investigation last year revealed that Afghan heroin has contributed to the growing drug overdose epidemic in the United States. However, DEA has reported that heroin primarily originates from Latin America and fentanyl is smuggled into the United States from China. DEA officials have conceded that Afghanistan is the top supplier of heroin in neighboring Canada, which borders many of the U.S. states impacted by the overdose epidemic.
At the top of the list is the risk of a powerful and modern China filling a void left by the US in for the position of global leader.
Some analysts believe, contrary to Ilan Berman's gloomy forecast, that Russia's birth rates have rebounded well enough to defuse the demographic crisis. A Reuters piece in March argued that Russia's private health care industry is booming due to rising fertility rates, driven by the desire of new parents to obtain better maternity care than the state provides.

The H-1B visa, however, is just one part of a huge pyramid of imported labor that is used by U.S. investors to spike stock values and to corral their control over the technology sector.
As far back as November, shortly after Ma was summoned to a meeting with Chinese regulators, state media began describing him as an irresponsible renegade who no longer had the best interests of the people at heart. Another high-flying billionaire, Liu Qiangdong of JD.com, has been subjected to similar treatment and subsequently welcomed enhanced supervision from the CCP.
This is the time to revitalise US global health leadership, after a ruinous retreat from global solidarity under the Trump administration, the article concludes. International cooperation on the compound crises of COVID-19 could become a model for tackling other existential global hazards.
WHISTLEBLOWER: If I hired a framer to do a small addition [in 1988], his wage would have been $45 an hour. That was the minimum for a framing contractor, a good carpenter. [Emphasis added] … Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. [Emphasis added]
States such as Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia are projected to lose congressional seats if the illegal alien population is included in congressional apportioning.
But with inflation very low despite extremely low levels of unemployment and stronger-than-expected growth, many now think the Fed should rethink its model. The economy appears to be able to grow at a faster rate and unemployment to fall further than Fed economists thought was possible without inflation getting out of control. This suggests potential growth may be greater than the Fed believed.
The Americans weren't interested in the Yemeni war in the first place, but since they were so adamant to move ahead with the Iranian nuclear deal they lent their support to the Saudis to minimize Tehran's reach in the region, he said. That policy drove two opponents of Al-Qaeda against each other, which was exploited by the group to assassinate government officials and consolidate its foothold around the capital Aden, as well as key regions like Taaz, Hadramout, and others.
We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, health care, and education, Ocasio-Cortez said. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force, for all of these ambitious policies.
TRUMP: We're going to have Americans staying home instead of going and spending the money in other countries. And maybe that's one of the reasons the job numbers are so good. — remarks to the press Friday.
The government made the same announcement following previous U.S. sanctions without taking action.
The 2506 Brigade – the Bay of Pigs Veterans – are a group of Cuban-American patriots who attempted to liberate the island from the yoke of the Castro regime in the 1960s. President John F. Kennedy doomed the operation by first promising the Cubans air support in their operation, then denying it after encouraging the fighters to land on the island.
The total number of overnight stays in the German city of Dresden have decreased in 2015 according to Die Zeit. The Saxony capital has seen a three per cent decline in hotel bookings though they were still able to attract 4.3 million visitors.
Circuit Judge Holly Meyer replaced McSpadden in January.
Images of American presidents being feted on the world stage stand in contrast to those of their rivals in the opposing party slogging through diners in early-voting states and clashing in debate. This trip, in particular, reflects a Trump campaign strategy to showcase him in his presidential role during short, carefully managed trips that provide counter-programming to the Democrats' primary contest and produce the kinds of visuals his campaign can use in future ads. His aides also believe the visit could help the president woo tens of thousands of Indian-American voters before the November election.
Reacting to a question about German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ms. Le Pen said simply: The German migration policy is crazy.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
She's the epitome of meritocracy. I mean, first-generation wealth, Wellesley, Yale Law School, always prepared, always does her homework, articulate, perfectly spoken — but also perceived as cold and calculating, Brill said.
Chinese state media, like much of the U.S. media, linked the Kung Flu comment with all references to the coronavirus as Chinese or from Wuhan as racist slurs. The state-run Xinhua news service launched such an attack on Thursday:
What we're trying to ensure is that all countries, no matter size or strength, can pursue their interests based on the law of the sea and not have that endangered by some of these actions. It's up to those countries, but I think it's in our best interests to make sure that those sea lines remain open, I'll leave it at that.
Bhattacharya also pointed out the obvious—giving full healthcare coverage to illegal immigrant adults will make California, which is already an official sanctuary state, even a greater magnet for illegal immigrants.
Mr. King, in the interview, said he was not a racist. He pointed to his Twitter timeline showing him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. (The same office once displayed a Confederate flag on his desk.) At the same time, he said, he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is the culture of America based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? Mr. King said. Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?
Granma was not the only Cuban government outlet to make this accusation. CubaDebate, for example, blamed Haza's father directly for País's death while calling his violin performance horrendous and off-key.
Japan may take some comfort from the Pentagon's report this week that American defenses against potential North Korean missile attack have improved. The report's optimism was buoyed by what it described as a nearly flawless test intercept in May of the most realistic ICBM target missile employed to date. However, critics still believe testing has not adequately simulated the difficulty of taking out a live weapon employing defensive countermeasures.
52 percent of the websites audited qualified for the Honor Roll, a 5% improvement on scores from 2016. However, despite the overall improvement, only 27% of the 100 largest banks in the country met the Honor Rolls standards.

At @ProjectLincoln we are constructing a database of Trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration & track where they are now, he wrote. No personal info, only professional. But they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved.
In recent years, some U.S. lawmakers have also suggested that bad actors could weaponize fentanyl.
A few days after international media noticed that not only did Chinese tech tycoon Jack Ma lose much of his corporate empire and $12 billion of his net worth after criticizing the Communist Party in late October, but he also appears to have vanished from the face of the Earth, Hong Kong's Asia Times Financial (ATF) reported Chinese state media are claiming Ma has embraced supervision, while Beijing's army of Internet trolls denounces him as a greedy traitor.
Progressives also insist they can select deserving Central American migrants with such care and justice that rejected migrants will somehow give up their illegal efforts to get themselves into U.S. jobs and their children into U.S. schools. For example, Biden's 2020 platform says Trump's policies are actually encouraging people to cross irregularly, rather than applying in a legal, safe, and orderly manner at the ports, and continues:
Acton, who cofounded WhatsApp before selling it to Facebook, said recent changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy are driving people to Signal. He told TechCrunch that Signal's user base exploded in recent weeks.

Trump delivered his warning to Turkey in a pair of tweets discussing his Syria policy on Sunday. Trump encouraged both Turkey and the Syrian Kurdish militia to back away from a confrontation:
Hopefully they shoot them, said Andrew Therriault, the former director of data science for the Democratic National Committee, who also worked as data science manager for Facebook.
Six-nation negotiations on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for aid fell apart in early 2009.
The lead author of the 2018 document was then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster. The decision to declassify the document early came from current National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, who said he was releasing the United States Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific to communicate to the American people and to our allies and partners, the enduring commitment of the United States to keeping the Indo-Pacific region free and open long into the future.
It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts, the company added.
In a securities filing, Berkshire Hathaway said:
We wanted to make sure that these six countries … mitigate the risk, he told reporters on Friday. We want to send a signal that we're very serious about this but not cripple all of their various visas, so there's a number of visas they're still able to use.
Former Whigs and Democrats who had fought politically their whole lives—yet were nonetheless united in defense of the Constitution—joined forces in this new Republican coalition. They were united in the belief that the ideas of the founding were fundamentally good and just. America could be great only if it embraced the philosophy that brought it into being.
Karaganov's contribution to the article was, as he would later tell Zakaria, the assertion that Russian foreign policy was a success, and it should stay the course rather than making compromises to cultivate a better relationship with Washington.
Only 12 percent of those surveyed say that it is the responsibility of individual states in whose territorial waters the migrant ships have arrived to resolve the situation. The survey commissioned by the Italian daily Corriere della Sera revealed that 60 percent said that in these cases it is the responsibility of the European Union (EU), while 13 percent said the duty lies with the NGO vessels that took the migrants aboard in the first place.
She thinks there is no other priority that we should be focused on and supports the sunrise movements call for Democrats to create a plan to transition the economy to a zero-carbon economy so we have that ready to go when we take back the Presidency in 2020.
What is on their agenda? Well, pack the Supreme Court, Barbour explained. Add three more Supreme Court justices, to make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico states — by a simple majority vote. They want to do that. Their agenda for energy is very plainly stated. They want a carbon-free economy. You know, a carbon-free economy — not gasoline cars, not natural gas cars. They want electricity to be generated in some way, through solar and that sort of stuff. If you look where it is actually happening in the United States — the volume is nowhere near what it takes in this country for energy generation.
My question is not about a whistleblower as I have no independent information on his identity. My question is about the actions of known Obama partisans within the NSC and House staff and how they are reported to have conspired before impeachment proceedings had even begun. [A]nd are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal house impeachment proceedings.
2) We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage Again, this is a fake claim. According to a NASA study in 2015, the land ice is actually growing in Antarctica: A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses And the science is not even that controversial. Put simply, the warming of the climate since the Ice Age has led to increased snowfall over the Antarctic.
The illegal immigrant who murdered Kate Steinle, for instance, told authorities that he came to San Francisco after being previously deported five times because he knew San Francisco was proudly a sanctuary city.
It was fun and exciting at the same time, you know the thrill of thinking the 'what-ifs,' Clerfe joked. Over the course of 48 hours, Clerfe had traveled from his Iraq deployment, all the way to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, in Monterey, California. He joined his wife, Natalia Svistunova, on New Year's Day. Kuwait, to Turkey, to Turkey to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Baltimore, Baltimore to Atlanta, he recounted. Seven connections, and more than 1000 miles worth of flying time later, he was home.
Authorities arrested him on May 12, 2014, and have kept him behind bars since. They denied him access to a lawyer while in solitary confinement. The Specialized Criminal Court (SCC), Saudi Arabia's counter-terrorism court, convicted Brinji on these charges: insulting the rulers of the country, inciting public opinion, accusing security officers of killing protestors in Awamiyya, ridiculing Islamic religious figures, and violating Article 6 of the Anti-Cyber Crime Law.
Last year on the campaign trail, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had questioned whether it was right to continuing forcing consumers to sustain the BBC, saying: How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of channels?
A spokesman for Zero Hedge strongly rejected Twitter's allegation.
Like other rogue states and human rights abusers around the world, Cuba's state media covered the violence as indicative of the decline of the United States in its entirety. Granma claimed the incident was the gravest in the history of the [Capitol] building, symbol of American power, since the British, on August 24, 1814, burned it down along with the White House and other government institutions.
We disagree strenuously with the report that was put out, Price told reporters at the White House after the CBO score was released.
Here's why, even though the House Democrats have shown no immediate interest in pursuing it, the Green New Deal remains a clear and present danger.
The network is also limiting non-essential travel and asking its employees to limit large meetings and not bring visitors into the New York office, according to a memo sent Wednesday by NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the Senate on Tuesday scoffing at what he called the bizarro world of Pelosi's impeachment strategy that delayed transmitting the charges for weeks.
Worse, It is clear that Iran used its American prisoners as a bargaining chip–first to ensure that the U.S. dropped sanctions as the Iran nuclear deal went through; second, to expand its ballistic missile program in violation of the U.N. resolution giving effect to that deal; and third, to humiliate the U.S., most recently in the arrest of ten sailors.
The Massachusetts senator plans to move fast and is committing to announce her Cabinet choices by December 1, 2020 — less than a month after the election.

California's temperate climate supports over 50,000 outdoor marijuana farms in almost every area of the state, but it is mostly concentrated in the three Northwestern California counties Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity that are known as the Emerald Triangle.
The video did not mention that companies are free to hire employees away from other companies by offering higher wages and benefits.
The astonishing number of contributions that this project has received from ordinary Americans demonstrates just how important the wall is to the American people. Citizens see the crime, wage depression, and other negative consequences of illegal immigration, and they want something done about it.
According to the latest Farm Journal Pulse Poll, which featured responses from 1,286 farmers, President Trump received an approval rating of 83 percent, a point higher than the previous poll. Only 18 percent disapprove of President Trump. Since Farm Journal's tracking of Trump's support from farmers in recent months, the latest poll marks his highest approval.

Rep. Francis Rooney (R-FL) served as the U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See during George W. Bush's second term. Rooney said that when he organized a meeting for Bush with Sant' Egidio in 2007, he ran into some pushback from the Vatican.
Murawski noted in his report the scope of the new policy:
Essentially, for the price of five Americans, Iran gained the ability to threaten millions of people with missiles that will one day carry the nuclear warheads the Iran deal enables the regime to develop–legally–once it expires.

The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
At roughly the same time, CNN was running another article from James Griffiths which noted Tillerson might have been doing the right thing by ignoring the airborne middle finger from Pyongyang ahead of the summit between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, and it doesn't much matter what Western powers say about North Korea's behavior anyway:
World leaders fly around in airplanes — this is the modern era, Stokes said. They can't just hop a speedy train to Iowa, she said.
After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us, he concluded.
But the migration-caused economic damage is widely recognized by left-wingers outside the progressive parish in Washington D.C.
He also called his language from the video regrettable.
Many polls show that the public — white, brown, or black — personally welcomes legal migrants but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first.
Though it's unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq.
Today, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus, as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S., the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan.

The Prime Minister of Israel – @bnetanyahu (Note that such verified accounts typically show a blue check mark in your chat list and search results.) We are honored that political leaders, as well as numerous public organizations, rely on Telegram to combat misinformation and spread awareness about important issues in their societies. Unlike other networks, Telegram doesn't use nontransparent algorithms to decide whether a subscriber will see content they subscribed to or not. As a result, Telegram channels are the only direct way for opinion leaders to reliably connect with their audiences. By removing the manipulative algorithms that have become synonymous with 2010s technology platforms, Telegram channels restore transparency and integrity to public one-to-many communication.
The suspect, also know as Juan Razo, was arrested last July and accused of the murder of Margaret Peggy Kostelnik. But that isn't all he was accused of. In fact, Ramirez is accused of going on a crime spree that included the sexual assaulting of his own 14-year-old niece as well as the shooting and wounding of a woman walking on the street.
We're not going to endorse a political candidate, said Local 226 Secretary-General Geoconda Argüello-Kline.

Christian Solidarity Worldwide also told the Commission that so-called unregistered churches have been forcibly shut by the government, with their property confiscated by the state and their leaders have been subject to detention and even sentenced to prison terms.
McClintock's office was well-apprised of the state of talks between the various parties, including outgoing Governor Jerry Brown and incoming governor Gavin Newsom. The two liberal Democrats asked the SWRCB to postpone its decision, originally scheduled for November, to Dec. 12 to leave time for voluntary agreements with local water authorities. (The day following my meeting with McClintock, the SWRCB voted to approve the Bay-Delta Plan, despite some agreements being reached.)

The U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan is slated to go down to zero by May if the Taliban adheres to a peace agreement brokered by the U.S., but the agreement's future is unclear under the incoming Biden administration.
The Obama administration is celebrating the exchange as a confirmation of its foreign policy. The Washington Post, overjoyed at the return of its reporter, Jason Rezaian, agrees, saying that the U.S. and Iran had moved into a new era of international relations. Perhaps–not friendship, but rather a new balance in which Iran holds the upper hand.
The Federal Reserve closed 2015 by doing something it hadn't done since 2006: It hiked interest rates, initiating a phase of tighter monetary policy.
By forcing Catholic schools to turn away Catholic school children on the basis of their faith, the very principle of a Catholic parent's right to choose a Catholic education is under threat, the bishops said in their petition.

Give illegal aliens incentives to self-deport
In a recent article titled Facebook, Twitter Solicit Outside Groups, Often on the Right, to Referee Political Speech, the Wall Street Journal notes that social media firms such as Facebook and Twitter consult with outside groups in order to develop their policies surrounding political speech on their platforms. Although it appears the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have begun reaching out to some conservative groups for at least some semblance of ideological balance, the articles most illuminating revelation is about Twitter's blacklisting of Laura Loomer.
Eliason joined Ole Miss faculty in 2013, teaching subjects such as International Trade Law, International Investment Law, Contracts, EU Law, the Law of Armed Conflict, as well as Law and Science Fiction, according to the university's website.
1. The Geneva Convention applies even if there is no formal war. Article 2 of the Geneva Convention states that at least some of its provisions apply in peacetime, and that they apply in armed conflicts falling short of war, even if one side of the conflict does not recognize that a state of war exists between the two countries in question.

Yahoo was reportedly aware of the first large hack, which led to over 500 million account details being stolen, in 2014. However, they failed to announce the incident to the public until late 2016.
Legendary NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw says former First Lady Nancy Reagan, who died Sunday at the age of 94, will be remembered as a very skilled and powerful First Lady who didn't let the seams show.
Yet decades of data and experiences have persuaded the vast majority of Americans — and many elite economists, lobbyists, and legislators — that migration moves money out of employees' pockets and into the stock-market wealth of investors and their progressive supporters. The recognition comes amid perpetual insistence from business lobbies — and reporters — that supply and demand in the labor market are unrelated.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that prices of masks have surged six-fold and the cost of ventilators has tripled.
7. Obama is required by his Oath of Office to defend our troops abroad. By that oath, Obama should be arguing that our troops are protected by the Geneva Convention–not looking for loopholes that allow them to be abused. In arguing that Iran did nothing wrong by parading U.S. sailors in front of the cameras, and forcing a female sailor to wear a hijab (head covering), Obama is inviting more abuses of American troops' rights and dignity in the future.
It should be clear that though children are usually trotted out as at most risk of hunger, it is really adults who are most exposed to food insecurity. Only 4 percent of the food insecure are kids. About 7 percent are elderly, and a whopping 89 percent are non-elderly adults.
The statement warned the new House Democrat majority of President Trump's intention to veto the bills, noting that the administration cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation's urgent border security needs.
Trump was widely lambasted for publicly addressing and criticizing Fed policy. Ever since Clinton, most presidents had kept any disagreements with the Fed away from the public. Trump returned to the earlier practice of presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, who felt free to speak up on monetary policy.
CSP President and CEO Frank Gaffney leads this panel of national security experts, composed also of Former Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral James Ace Lyons, and 20 year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, and VP for Research and Analysis at CSP Clare Lopez.

The new treaty, styled on the 1963 Élysée Treaty of post-war reconciliation, will also encourage the formation of border town Eurodistricts where French and German towns will merge public transport networks and utilities.
Former Whigs and Democrats who had fought politically their whole lives—yet were nonetheless united in defense of the Constitution—joined forces in this new Republican coalition. They were united in the belief that the ideas of the founding were fundamentally good and just. America could be great only if it embraced the philosophy that brought it into being.
This [rules] package honors all gender identities by changing pronouns in the House written rules. So they are gender-neutral. Look, we made this change for the sake of inclusion, not exclusion, McGovern insisted.
Dr Zenz said that between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates fell by 84 per cent in the two largest Uyghur Muslim prefectures, with birth rates continuing to fall. He said that in 2020, one Uyghur region saw an unprecedented near-zero population growth.
It really was striking for a number of reasons, Wolf. One of these, while we are used to since the days of Ronald Reagan, a president going to the people in the first lady's box to illustrate some sort of policy point or some sort of American note, whether it's honor troops or talking about education, we've never seen … a scholarship given, which is what the president did with the young girl from Philadelphia. We've seen the type of thing where a war hero like Tuskegee Airman Gen. McGee. That was a lovely moment. To have a 100-year-old Tuskegee Airman there with his grandson, who wants to be in the Space Force. President Trump telling a little girl that she's going to get a scholarship, President Trump announcing that there is a solider coming home and reuniting with his wife and children, we've never seen anything like that before.
Asked if he expected to see a gap of time between when rates are first cut and when a potential plan would begin to pay for itself, Williams said, I'm sure you might have a dip 'til everybody can begin to believe what we're doing is really true, but it will eventually catch, it will catch up with itself.
Johnson claimed that all institutions will be expected to have an explicit statement expressing their commitment to free speech principles. They are crucial in demonstrating to students that free speech should be at the heart of a higher education community, Johnson finished.
Powell's comments hinted that he may be moving toward that idea–or at least to being patient and letting more evidence come in.
The O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics … … To qualify for an O-1 visa, the beneficiary must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.
Armed with the false 1 in 5 statistic, however, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement its policy.
That is our flag, which will never be red. It will only be red if it is necessary for our blood to keep her green and yellow, he concluded. We cannot allow nefarious ideologies to come and divide Brazilians – ideologies that destroy our values and traditions, destroy our families, the foundations of our society.
Marek's pitch to progressives is the latest example of employers trying to globalize the American labor market so they can hire anybody they want from abroad and break the bargaining position of American workers, said Krikorian. He continued:
Incoming Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) published an op-ed on Tuesday, criticizing President Donald Trump.
It's not just one thing, Ruane said. It's multiple issues.
Musse Hossein is an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who tries to help his fellow countrymen. He said of the underage migrants he has met, they feel lonely, have mental problems, and when their asylum petition is rejected, the situation is, of course, serious.
Both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.
I am convinced that Britain should leave. So is Boris Johnson for his own reasons, so is Nigel Farage for his own reasons… Because I believe in democracy.
Bolton advised that the first job of the President who cleans up after Barack Obama would be to re-establish that America is going to protect itself and its friends around the world, much as Ronald Reagan did after Jimmy Carter.
Karaganov agreed with that characterization of his essay, adding that Russia was even more concerned with the clique of neo-conservatives and liberal interventionists surrounding Clinton, deeming them dangerous because they would have tried to restore the international order that died under Barack Obama.
Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut.
Rosemary Gibson, the author of China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine, recently told Breitbart News Tonight host Rebecca Mansour that the United States should pursue an industrial policy to renew domestic manufacturing of medicines and medical products in the homeland.

The Florida woman is seeking damages for allegedly violating the Anti-Terrorism Act by providing material support to terrorists, adds the report. Her civil suit was filed in federal court in Oakland, Calif. Though national security lawyers say her case is unlikely to succeed, it has increased the pressure on social media companies to remove posts linked to terrorism.

I am no stranger to robust political and policy disagreements, Cruz said. But we are in the midst of a global pandemic.
The New York Times article is a case in point. What is striking — and indeed horrifying to anyone who doesn't share the author's eco-loon mindset — is the degree to which the piece appears to see economic shutdowns as a net positive for the planet.
To critics of dams, especially among environmentalists, the events at Oroville Dam were further proof of the dangers of dams and reservoirs — which, they argued, stored water only at great cost to nature and great risk to human life.
Both confirmed that the Great Reset — world domination by a technocratic elite in which ordinary folk will own no property and will be subject to CCP-style social credit controls on their freedoms — is closely allied with the environmental movement's concept of 'sustainability' and living within the planet's means. In this view of the world, humans are considered a verminous plague on the planet rather than, as Christians prefer to see it, God's greatest creation made in His image.
Just 554,366 of the 1.9 million Central Americans have been deported, even though only 147,333 have been allowed to stay, said the DHS report, which does not offer numbers for people who successfully sneaked across the border.
That delay has now cost Cologne's police chief his job. But the German government still seems more concerned about policing restless natives — most recently through a deal with Facebook and Google to restrict anti-immigrant postings — than with policing migration. Just last week Merkel rejected a proposal to cap refugee admissions (which topped one million last year) at 200,000 in 2016.

DeLisle had some concrete suggestions for Taiwan to fight back against China's campaign of isolation, such as insisting on the principle of universality, which stated simply means pointing out the absurdity of arbitrarily excluding 22 million people from organizations dedicated to world health or global environmental issues.
This should be seen as China crossing an important threshold. Missile platforms present a clear offensive threat. [The missile deployment] is a pretty clear threat to the other claimants and furthers China's goal of establishing complete control over the water and airspace of the South China Sea.
Trump's crisis argument is backed by 72 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of independents, and 19 percent of Democrats.
The Times reported that of the 92 facing prosecution on this one day, 65 had a previous criminal history. Ten of those in court were parents who saw their children removed from them after they crossed. The Trump Administration implemented a policy to remove the children from the parent's custody when they are arrested at the border.
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, Stenger said, commanding senators to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment.
Boris Johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. Even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.
Still, Sanders' campaign says the senator's comment to Colbert wasn't realistic. Even if several senators were looking to decamp from Washington to Iowa quickly after the impeachment trial concludes each day, they would be headed to different parts of the state.
Carlson has indeed faced vicious tactics from the left before. In November, his home, where his wife was home alone, was targeted by Antifa, a group notorious for its tactics of violence and intimidation.
Democrats are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence, said Feinstein of the Secure Fence Act of 2006.
Now, many of Iraq's tanks are immobilized for want of maintenance, potentially jeopardizing the country's ongoing campaign against Islamic State militants. … Iraq bought 140 of the 63-ton M1s for $2 billion starting in 2008 in order to re-equip some armored units that previously operated Soviet-made vehicles—many of which the U.S.-led coalition destroyed when it invaded Iraq in 2003.
According to an extensive report in the Japan Times, the mission lasted ten hours and was launched out of U.S. territory in Guam. The goal of the operation was to improve coordination between the ship and the bombers by refining joint tactics, techniques and procedures while simultaneously strengthening their ability to seamlessly integrate their operations, Pacific Command said. The statement explicitly did not refer to the operation as an FONOP.
French President Emmanuel Macron used his New Year's televised address to lash out at the populist Yellow Vest protestors who have taken to the streets through November and December to oppose his globalist policies, accusing them of anti-Semitism and other defects.
I ask Republicans to prioritize policies that improve our country for all Americans. When the GOP asks me to deliver six- or seven-figure contributions for the 2020 elections, my first response will be: Why should I contribute to my own destruction?
Olsen said, Mitt Romney had a great chance to be President of the United States, and he blew it. He blew it because he didn't talk about the things that were making people insecure. He wasn't talking about an economy in a way that made them think that he cared about them. He didn't talk about immigration in a way that made them think that he was serious about it. He didn't talk about trade in a way that made them think that he cared more about American jobs than investors' profits.
Democrats have offered nothing in exchange, said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at Numbers USA.
Trump concluded that America as you know it will be over if Ossoff and Warnock win.
Research suggests that women are also likely to earn less due to women being more likely to either move or stay in a certain area due to the greater importance the couple places on the husband's job. Sari Kerr, an economist at Wellesley College, argues that because the spouse who earns is likely to do more of the household work, the gender pay gap is self-reinforcing.
The 40-billion-plus euro divorce bill, and suggestions it might not be paid if the EU did not negotiate in good faith, rapidly disappeared from the public discourse. It would be paid in full.
Stella Parton, the sister of country music icon Dolly Parton, has slammed politicians over the rollout of the vaccine for the coronavirus, pointing out that many Americans have waited for financial stimulus, some starving and dying, while the same politicians receiving the vaccine didn't help fund it in the same way that her sister, Dolly, did.
The media go to extremely biased sources; they know nothing, so they're not in a position to challenge them; and even if they were, they wouldn't, because they're on the same team.
AP is also stopping all non-essential travel, and told employees to avoid work dinners or conferences without approval.
Asserting that there's a broad mood in favour of the proposal, Hussaini told the public broadcaster he's confident that other parties will back the option for Norwegians to legally 'become' a third gender.
The spike in inflation over the past year has caused concern among some rate-setters at the Bank of England. Last month, three of the eight members of the bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to increase the benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point from the record low of 0.25 percent. The rest, though, while acknowledging the inflation spike, thought a rate hike could be counterproductive for the British economy, which grew by less than any other Group of Seven country in the first quarter of the year.

Currently, It can take up to two to three years to fire employees that have engaged in misconduct, including misconduct that led to the deaths of veterans who use the VA for their health care, Caldwell told Marlow.
The fighter jet purchases are part of a greater proposed defense spending increase in the year's budget. The South China Morning Post reports that Taiwan is looking to increase its defense spending from two to three percent of its GDP in 2018, a high not seen since 1999. This would mean spending up to $11.4 billion on defense. Tsai's predecessor, the Kuomintang Party's Ma Jing-yeou, took a conciliatory approach to relations with Beijing.
The idea that the Chinese Communist Party will live up to the goal of abolishing slave labour appears to stand in direct contradiction to actual CCP policy, however, as the country has been accused of building factories in at least 135 concentration camps in the Xinjiang region, alone.
It was an extraordinary suggestion, but one being proposed by Trump allies with support from some GOP senators, including McConnell.
Despite concerns about the prospective deal – which includes amnesty and a path to citizenship for potentially millions of illegal aliens, just like previous amnesty pushes – Sessions heartily approved of the rationale behind the Trump administration's agenda behind the concessions they are demanding in exchange for amnesty: a merit based system to replace chain migration and visa lotteries and building a wall on the southern border. There is nothing wrong, nothing immoral to develop a policy of immigration we believe strengthens America and makes us a greater country, he told the audience.
We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, Bolton said. He said in meetings with Turkish counterparts, he will seek to find out what their objectives and capabilities are and that remains uncertain.

The law mandates that public colleges and universities in Tennessee adopt free speech policies consistent with the University of Chicago's 2015 Stone Report. Chaired by Chicago Law Professor Geoffrey Stone, the report's findings were adopted last year to great fanfare. Despite his emphasis on campus free speech, Professor Stone is hardly a right-wing ideologue. He clerked with archliberal Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, chaired the Board of the American Constitution Society, a leading lefty-leaning lawyers' association, and served on the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.
It was Frank who was in front of the [anti-Batista] organization throughout the island, a Miami Herald column on their relationship explained, while Castro ran the incipient guerrilla that, for many months, depended on País for its survival. Had País survived, many Cuban historians have speculated, Fidel Castro – who never won an election in his life – would not have had a clear path to totalitarian rule on the island.
I have a terrible regret … I have a regret that the entire discussion about this article ignores its purpose, which was to try to contribute to this discussion about the policy in the War on Drugs. Let's go to the big picture of what we all want. We all want this drug problem to stop. We all want them — the killings in Chicago to stop. We are the consumer. Whether you agree with Sean Penn or not, there is a complicity there. And if you are in the moral right, or on the far left, just as many of your children are doing these drugs, just as many. And how much time have they spent in the last week since this article come out, talking about that? One percent? I think that'd be generous. My article has failed. Let me be clear, my article has failed.
That policy, often followed in high-rise hotels, may be effective in lesser fires. In this case, however, the fire seemed to climb the exterior of the tower so quickly that it overwhelmed protective systems like fire doors. People who initially remained in place may have been unable to escape later because the hallways and fire escapes were filled with heavy smoke and flames.
Local 226, which represents 60,000 workers, including many in hotels and casinos, also sees itself as an immigration activist organization, is thought to be among the most influential political forces in the city.

Nazim Zinal, a Peshmerga military source, tells Kurdish outlet Rudaw that the Iraqi army is simply not a potent enough force to keep the fight going, hence the slow start to the recapture of Mosul. With all the ammunition they [the Iraqis] have ultimately they are too weak, he argued, noting that if the Peshmerga were armed as well as the Iraqi army We would have been near Mosul by now.
This next two chart show how the Keynesian shell game has worked since we adopted the fiat money system on August 15, 1971. Debt has grown at more than twice the rate of GDP. This is nothing short of a debt-based Ponzi scheme that has entered the terminal stages. Everything has its limits, even debt. The recent adoption of negative interest rates by over 20 advanced countries as some solution to this failure is akin to financial chemotherapy that will likely damage or kill, rather than provide the needed cure.
For example, he continued, individuals responsible for the deadly wait list in Arizona where I'm from: it took seven hundred days to fire these individuals, and most of that time, they were on paid leave sitting at home.
What do we know, in fact, about Iranian cooperation with North Korea? Bolton asked. How much of the Iranian program is really being conducted in North Korea, where our intelligence is, unfortunately, even worse than it is inside Iran? There are a lot of questions here.
In a few weeks, we'll also be adding a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program.

Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules.
In other letters, bin Laden said the U.S. was stuck in a quagmire in Afghanistan, much like the Soviet Union before it, and viewed the overthrow of dictator Moammar Qaddafi as a great opportunity for jihad in Libya.
One of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.

She has to satisfy the open borders wing of her caucus [and] not veer too far in the direction of the progressives … I think the Democrats in Congress are more extreme on immigration than most Democratic voters are, but they can't afford to be associated with Abolish ICE! and pro-caravan demands.

… hemorrhage, the immediate possibility of infection, and the possibility of failure, where the pregnancy doesn't fully pass from the medication and then leading to sometimes the requirement for emergent surgery for that woman because of either ongoing bleeding or the risk of infection.
The labor pyramid includes H-1Bs hired by the companies and by their subcontracting companies. The categories of workers also include J-1s, TNs, OPTs, B-1/B-2s, and foreign graduates who overstay their visas.

The Washington Post reported January 4: Government funding may depend on a deal with Democrats on dreamers, said Stan Collender, a nonpartisan budget expert and Forbes columnist. 3. Delay helps the economy improve, not merely expand. The government has a duty to help create a labor market where Americans' ability to fairly earn higher wages is balanced with pressure on investors to buy American-made, labor-saving machinery instead of just relying on government-imported cheap labor. But any DACA or a bigger 'Dreamer' amnesty would subsidize investors by giving them more welfare-funded immigrant-customers, so enlarging the consumer economy while damaging the nation's productivity-based economic growth. Any focus on the core economic issue of productivity means that a delay is the high-minded, good-government policy favored by statesmen, in contrast to the crony-capitalist deals favored by billionaires and donation-seeking politicians. 4. Delay is good for the public fisc. The proposed amnesty is far larger and more expensive than its supporters now admit. For example, the bipartisan DREAM Act amnesty would reach 3.25 million initially, while chain-migration would add millions more. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the 10-year cost to be $26 billion, but that estimate ignored DREAM Act loopholes which would sharply boost the numbers and costs. So a delay would allow officials to better grasp the cost and scale of the proposed amnesty. 5. Delay makes for honest government. Obama's DACA policy offered temporary work-permits — not permanent work-permits — pending a solution by Congress.
In an email sent on April 10, 2012, Clinton forwards to her then-Deputy Chief of Staff Jacob Sullivan a memo on the Egyptian election campaign that includes information on the Muslim Brotherhood that she received from Sidney Blumenthal.

But these figures do not reflect the full extent of the phenomenon. Some choose to take an illegal path, providing a market for forged passports.
Scornfully mocking those who suggest waiting for facts, should tell you all you need to know about journalists like Jemele Hill. However, had she waited for the facts, she would have learned some interesting things about the case from Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who is black.

By Pelosi's logic, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) could just as easily claim that he is equal to the president in power — and his claim would arguably hold more weight, given the pre-eminence of the Senate.
There's a lot at stake here, he concluded. A real leader could explain that, could explain to the American people how it could affect their daily lives – and why we have to take actions such as a substantial naval rebuilding program, so that our Navy doesn't sink to levels we haven't seen since World War I, and so that we can protect our freedoms here, and our way of life.

In a September 8, 2016, email from New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt to Kortan, Schmidt gives the DOJ an early heads up on something we're planning on reporting today, which was about Clinton's email server technician, Paul Combetta, deleting Hillary's subpoenaed emails, and saying The fact that Combetta was given immunity takes much of the air out of the idea that DOJ needs to investigate the deletions.
Simply finishing the Shasta Dam to its design height [of 800 feet] could add nine million acre-feet to the system, McClintock says. Indeed, the Trump administration, is proposing to raise the dam by 18.5 feet, increasing the capacity of the dam by 7 percent (630,000 acre-feet) — if tiny salamander species that environmentalists wish to have declared endangered do not stop plans for expansion.
The security policy denies most travel and immigration visas to the targeted countries until they can upgrade their often chaotic and ramshackle domestic security and identification policies.

3. The border crisis has nothing to do with legal immigration, which we embrace. Corporal Ronil Singh, a Newman, California police officer — and legal immigrant — was murdered the day after Christmas by an alleged illegal alien. Many Americans want less immigration — a debate for another day. Regardless, Americans respect legal immigrants. We should reform our immigration laws, including those that allow foreigners to claim amnesty as soon as they touch American soil. Corporal Singh gave his life to defend the rule of law. That is what is at stake.

The hack also presents one more problem: toothpaste is hard to come by regularly in Venezuela—easier to find than pregnancy kits, birth control, or any pharmaceutical supply, but not guaranteed. In January 2016, the nation's health minister told Venezuelans to become accustomed to brushing their teeth once a day, a sign the product had already been hard to find.
Visiting American officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east Jerusalem, which is contested between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump himself, however, also toured the area in a previous visit.
Abrams, who also served as deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush, added, Other governments also pay attention. I've always believed that most governments, particularly in Europe, base their relationship [with Israel] on ours. They don't want to be quite as close to Israel. So if we're distant, they're more distant. If we're close, then they get closer.
For some reason, Xinhua – and most of the American media apparatus – forgot to mention that President Trump began making a point of calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus after Chinese officials began floating insane conspiracy theories that the virus originated in the United States, possibly as a deliberate bio-weapons attack against China.

That means agriculture will continue to be a key topic in the president's re-election campaign.

Marek's DACA refers to President Barack Obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The DACA work-permit giveaway has not been approved by Congress, partly because many millions of Americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. It's not amnesty, Marek wrote in 2014. It is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the United States. That's the kind of border security we need.
As American lives and our economic sovereignty continue to be risked to ensure a free flow of oil for countries that do not share our interests, the time for action is now. The President has rightly prioritized energy security in his America First Energy Plan, stating that his administration wants to, Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.

The Fed also announced detailed plans for how it will unwind the large balance sheet it built up by buying bonds during the financial crisis and in the years that followed. Questions over how and when the Fed would shrink its balance sheet have been foremost in the minds of investors and monetary policy mavens for some time. The Fed said it would reduce its holdings later this year by not reinvesting some of the funds received when bonds it holds mature. Currently, the Fed reinvests all of the proceeds from maturing bonds.
After spending about 24 hours in jail, the accused drug dealers are expected to show up for their court date on February 27, and if they do, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office will provide them with gifts such as Mets tickets, movie passes, and gift cards to go shopping.

Last year's gathering of the G-20 finance ministers issued a statement opposing all forms of protectionism.

NOAA violated its own rules when it undertook a similar adjustment process for recording ocean temperatures, beginning in 2015. As David Rose wrote for the Daily Mail, [NOAA scientists] took reliable readings from [ocean] buoys but then 'adjusted' them upwards—using readings from seawater intakes on ships … even though readings from the ships have long been known to be too hot. When you mix bad data with good, you no more produce reliable results than you do by adding muddy river water to purified bottle water to produce safe drinking water.

Everything started to change when we became less of a community; and when we put a value on things like legal engineering and financial engineering; and when we did things in the name of democracy such as reforming the primary selection system so that everyone now has a direct primary, so therefore they tend to run to favor the people who are giving them money and to favor the political base. That just pushes people apart, he said.
High profile users, individuals, and organizations are classified as hate groups based on strong, medium, and weak signals, according to another slide.

The caskets then moved slowly through streets choked with mourners wearing black, beating their chests and carrying posters with Soleimani's portrait. Demonstrators also carried red Shiite flags, which traditionally both symbolize the spilled blood of someone unjustly killed and call for their deaths to be avenged.

If I am to be killed, pray for me a lot and give continuous charities in my name, as I will be in great need for support to reach the permanent home, he wrote to his father in the same letter, according to the Associated Press.
One of the effects of emigration is erosion of human capital, which can have a negative impact on the economic and social development of the countries of origin, said a 2005 report by the United Nations. A 2020 report by a reporter for the Guardian for the Texas Public Policy Foundation spotlighted one example:
The tragic fact is that as a credentialed scientist—a biologist lecturing at Stanford University—Ehrlich's proclamation of the end times as well as the means to confront them struck many as the plausible theory of an expert.
The move comes after weeks of tensions between Renzi and Conte over various disagreements on policy — primarily relating to how to spend coronavirus bailout cash — along with many threats made by Renzi in the past to leave the government.

To convey a sense of its tenor, the first line in the article was: The champagne toasts that some Russian officials quaffed just a few short months ago to celebrate the victory of Donald J. Trump have gone a bit flat. The implication is that Flynn was, at the very least, highly sympathetic to the Russians, so they must be crestfallen by his ouster.
But his greatest notoriety would arise from the Syrian civil war and the rapid expansion of the Islamic State group. Iran, a major backer of Assad, sent Soleimani into Syria several times to lead attacks against IS and others opposing Assad's rule. While a U.S.-led coalition focused on airstrikes, several ground victories for Iraqi forces came with photographs emerging of Soleimani leading, never wearing a flak jacket.

The children of migrants are our future workforce, said Marek, as the video shows migrants working in jobs needed by Americans such as cleaning hotel rooms, driving, construction, and laying bricks. The video also shows many jobs where employers prefer to use cheap migrant labor instead of investing in labor-saving machinery. So the video shows migrants cutting weeds with prehistoric tools, milking cows, picking fruit by hand, and delivering food by bicycle.
Pence is right, Ashford wrote. No matter what you think of his politics, his views on public policy issues, or his performance in elective office, he should not be criticized for his Christian beliefs.

Also, the California-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the release of a migrant on March 23 because of the claimed threat posed by the coronavirus. The published order allows judges in the circuit's lower courts to order the release of other migrants.
Trump was widely lambasted for publicly addressing and criticizing Fed policy. Ever since Clinton, most presidents had kept any disagreements with the Fed away from the public. Trump returned to the earlier practice of presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, who felt free to speak up on monetary policy.

The Washington Post reported January 4: Government funding may depend on a deal with Democrats on dreamers, said Stan Collender, a nonpartisan budget expert and Forbes columnist. 3. Delay helps the economy improve, not merely expand. The government has a duty to help create a labor market where Americans' ability to fairly earn higher wages is balanced with pressure on investors to buy American-made, labor-saving machinery instead of just relying on government-imported cheap labor. But any DACA or a bigger 'Dreamer' amnesty would subsidize investors by giving them more welfare-funded immigrant-customers, so enlarging the consumer economy while damaging the nation's productivity-based economic growth. Any focus on the core economic issue of productivity means that a delay is the high-minded, good-government policy favored by statesmen, in contrast to the crony-capitalist deals favored by billionaires and donation-seeking politicians. 4. Delay is good for the public fisc. The proposed amnesty is far larger and more expensive than its supporters now admit. For example, the bipartisan DREAM Act amnesty would reach 3.25 million initially, while chain-migration would add millions more. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the 10-year cost to be $26 billion, but that estimate ignored DREAM Act loopholes which would sharply boost the numbers and costs. So a delay would allow officials to better grasp the cost and scale of the proposed amnesty. 5. Delay makes for honest government. Obama's DACA policy offered temporary work-permits — not permanent work-permits — pending a solution by Congress.
Australian supermarket chain Woolworths has introduced a special elderly hour for its senior customers whilst another chain, Coles, is set to introduce a similar scheme. Many older Aussies had told the BBC that they found it difficult to get supplies, with Australians similarly stockpiling.

That created a housing boom for the middle class because mortgage interest rates went down and more money was available. That was an unalloyed good thing until it got taken way, way too far and became these crazy financial instruments that farmed out the risks to people all over the world who had no idea what these securities were, or what the risks were. That's how we got the crash, he said.

The reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. If I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. Now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.

Another bill redirects defense spending – something Omar refers to as military intimidation and coercion – and gives it to the State Department.
On November 4, 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act which, according to The Weekly Standard, would enact [350.org founder Bill] McKibben's vision in toto. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced a companion bill in the House a few months later. But soon after, the #NoDAPL protests at Standing Rock—which were supposed to galvanize public support behind the Keep It in the Ground movement and usher in the dawn of the post-fossil fuel era—turned violent. Recognizing that extreme activism was not generating the public support they needed to upend U.S. energy policy, the leaders of the KIITG movement made a deliberate decision to change their tactics. Almost overnight, orchestrated militant actions were replaced with promises of guaranteed green jobs for all. Since then, Sanders and Rep. Huffman have abandoned the Keep It in the Ground campaign entirely and instead now publicly and enthusiastically endorse the Green New Deal.
The reason for this was that if foreigners were allowed to meddle with the affairs of a nation as soon as they settled down in its midst, Aquinas argued, many dangers might occur, since the foreigners not yet having the common good firmly at heart might attempt something hurtful to the people.
That means that if possible you should not go out, even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise and in that case at a safe distance from others, the prime minister said.

After months of pressure from rights groups, the E.U. is considering punishing Myanmar for the blatant violation of human rights referring to ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas and the failure of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to resolve the crisis.

The six bills provided for under H.R. 21 provide funding at levels nearly 20 percent higher than the President's FY 2019 Budget. For instance, H.R. 21 provides $12 billion more for international affairs programs, 29 percent higher than the President's request. This includes $2.9 billion more than the request for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review. It includes $700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restoring funding for the United Nations Population Fund. The bill would also undermine the President's Mexico City Policy (Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017), which prohibits the funding of foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform abortions. Further, H.R. 21 includes approximately $2 billion in excessive Environmental Protection Agency funding, providing funds beyond the Agency's core mission and including funding for programs that can and should be executed at the local level. The bill also includes substantial unrequested funding for HUD programs, including $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for HUD rental assistance programs. These and other excessive spending items makes the lack of adequate border funding in the combined package all the more unacceptable.
What I want to say today and what I want my countrymen to hear is that as an intellectual I have never wanted anything other than social justice for my country, declared Khieu Samphan at the court last week.

Another proposal that was brought to us by the Democratic leadership and that, frankly, I've heard about in my meetings with leaders of Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. And that is, they made a request that we consider allowing children to apply for asylum at our embassy in those countries, as opposed to only being able to apply for asylum by making the long and dangerous journey north.
Pritzker's demand for top-level GOP rejection of GOP voters echoes similar threats from other business-first GOP donors. In June 2018, for example, Breitbart reported on donors' demands for more imported workers and consumers:

Macron has become personally invested in the vote, even though he is not standing to be a Member of the European Parliament, as he has portrayed himself as a leader of a globalist alliance standing against populist and nationalist parties expecting to see major gains in the vote.
Yet decades of data and experiences have persuaded the vast majority of Americans — and many elite economists, lobbyists, and legislators — that migration moves money out of employees' pockets and into the stock-market wealth of investors and their progressive supporters.

To save themselves universities must overcome their obsession with identity politics. There are too many classes focused on narrow topics: too few on transcendent works of genius. Students complain, I don't see myself in the curriculum. You are not supposed to. The purpose of education is to take you outside yourself into a larger world. Conservative scholars can't do much to turn things around. They have all but disappeared from campus. So it's up to liberal academics to restore sanity. Will they do it? I'm not so sure. Anyone who challenges the identitarians will face a lot of hostility and be told the check their privilege. Who wants that? But there is one hopeful development. The University of Chicago has indicated that it will not be going the way of safe-space, trigger warnings and censorship. Some have suggested that universities need to be clear about their primary mission: They can pursue truth, at the expense of identity validation and emotional comfort–or they can choose comfort, and admit that they sometimes do so at the expense of truth. Either is fine, but at least students will have a choice.

Of these, 80 percent want the government to stand by its absolute ban on new migrant landings even in the case of the vessels Sea Watch and Sea Eye, while the other 20 percent think an exception should be made for these 49 migrants.
Instead of taking a stand against this agitation and fighting for the diversity of viewpoints in their institutions, universities in recent years have imposed politically correct speech codes on students and faculty, restricted controversial speech to free speech zones, and actively torpedoed primarily right-leaning student groups and invited speakers.
With compound health crises worldwide, UN humanitarian appeals face record shortfalls, the essay declares. The Biden administration could build on the tradition of US humanitarian leadership by funding at least 40% — the USA's share of high-income country gross national income — of UN and WFP appeals.
White House officials rolled out a list of 15 visa-lottery jihadis and chain-migration terrorists to pressure Democrats towards a compromise on the president's framework amnesty-and-immigration plan.

The situation for the Social Democrats, however, has continued to decline, and while the party won the European Elections, it saw its worst EU Parliament vote in history.
Nothing Trump has ever said can be construed as racist, and the Very Fine People Hoax proves Trump's no racist, because if he really was racist, his enemies would not have to manufacture something so desperately fake, so easy to disprove.
A recent analysis by a senior economist at Deutsche Bank, for example, says that the way the European Union is selling its 'Green Deal' is 'dishonest' and poses massive risks for prosperity, the economic system and democracy itself.
Russia is unusual among demographically-challenged countries in having an official blueprint for dealing with the problem, but it is evidently a rather vague blueprint that has yet to produce much in the way of effective policy. Berman suggests the Kremlin knock off its extensive military spending and foreign adventurism in places like Ukraine and Syria, and spend more on health care and education. The Kremlin is not very likely to heed that advice.
Moreover, the danger of Rome reconciling with all illicitly ordained bishops, he said, is that some in fact are not loyal to the Church.

When constitutional crisis emerged, such as in the National Bank debate authorization conflict, Washington did not simply mock the idea of following the founding document as some modern politicians have. Washington consulted the greatest legal minds of his generation and settled on policy he believed was in the scope of the the Constitution's original intention.
The U.S. has the largest and wealthiest middle class in the history of the world. You could even say, in fact, that capitalism created the middle class, so we want to highlight the benefits of capitalism, and we want to show what socialism does in other countries where it depresses the economy, it takes away choice, and it prevents people from having the opportunities that we have in America, she explained.
They've already walked back what they promised they were going to do. Mr. Biden himself, in a recent set of questions said he is not going to do what he promised on Day One because he knew that it would create a crisis. That was very good to hear … [but] that doesn't alleviate the concerns that I have. It's simply kicking the crisis can down the road. There's got to be real reform to what their open border strategies are.
Until either the federal workers' unions — which have a lot of sway — put more pressure on them, until the American people start getting in touch with Democratic politicians, I think the Democrats will refuse to move, despite the fact that what they are doing is against the interests of the American people and of America.
Public figures who identify as 'Catholic' give scandal to the faithful when receiving Communion by creating the impression that the moral laws of the Church are optional, the former archbishop of Philadelphia said. And bishops give similar scandal by not speaking up publicly about the issue and danger of sacrilege.
In December 2020, Archbishop Charles Chaput responded to Cardinal Gregory by criticizing bishops who indicate their willingness to give Holy Communion to Joe Biden despite his overt support for abortion.
On August 29, 2016, Strzok forwards a Daily Beast article titled FBI vs. State Department Over Hillary Clinton's Secrets to Page, Moffa and a redacted General Counsel office official, with a note saying, Good job, State… \u-19179? – presumably suggesting that the four of them meet to discuss.

From technology to the weather, the factors affecting the price of oil are frequent and varied. One key constant, however, is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC), a cartel that uses its significant reserves of crude and concentrated political power structures to exert undue influence on the world price, affecting the U.S. economy as a result. This influence was felt most prominently and recently in our own energy industry. Amid the rising oil prices of the previous decade, a small group of innovative American producers used new technology to unlock the oil held in U.S. shale formations, long considered to be too expensive and limited to produce. This new production rewrote the energy rulebook, and our oil imports were halved.

The six bills provided for under H.R. 21 provide funding at levels nearly 20 percent higher than the President's FY 2019 Budget. For instance, H.R. 21 provides $12 billion more for international affairs programs, 29 percent higher than the President's request. This includes $2.9 billion more than the request for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review. It includes $700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restoring funding for the United Nations Population Fund. The bill would also undermine the President's Mexico City Policy (Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017), which prohibits the funding of foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform abortions. Further, H.R. 21 includes approximately $2 billion in excessive Environmental Protection Agency funding, providing funds beyond the Agency's core mission and including funding for programs that can and should be executed at the local level. The bill also includes substantial unrequested funding for HUD programs, including $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for HUD rental assistance programs. These and other excessive spending items makes the lack of adequate border funding in the combined package all the more unacceptable.
Chanel Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld is threatening to renounce his German citizenship if Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy of open borders continues.
I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree, the archbishop said.
HARRIS: No. You know, I think she's challenging the status quo. I think that's fantastic. I think that. You know, I used to teach, before, especially before, the last few years. And the thing I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it's good for the party. I frankly think it's good for the country. Let's look at the bold ideas. And I'm eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend the status quo, then do it. If there's not merit, let's explore new ideas.

Despite Turkey's talk of peace and olive branches, it has repeatedly made clear it intends to attack the Kurds if they do not withdraw from the envisioned buffer zone, which is considerably larger than what U.S. planners and the Kurds are comfortable with. Turkey's determination to push east of the Euphrates River is especially worrisome.

If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary, and that in particular refers to Iran, Trump said.
The president's policy differs from that of his predecessor. During former President Barack Obama's tenure in the White House, the number of displaced persons being resettled in the U.S. increased drastically. Between 2008 and 2017, more than 67,000 refugees on average were admitted into the country. The total would have been larger if Republicans had not stymied Obama's efforts to admit 110,000 displaced persons, most notably from Syria, during his final year in office.
He went on to contend that there is evidence that major technology companies are systematically eliminating certain types of content to fit their own political agenda.

The law is there. The policy is real, he said, lamenting that so little has been done to effectively implement it. He also critiqued the law for being drafted too vaguely and referring to an observer limited membership for Taiwan that might not actually exist under Interpol's constitution.
While the various militias are expected to work together to surround Mosul, tensions between Kurdish forces and those controlled by Baghdad have endured for years. The Peshmerga have often complained of Washington's policy to only arm the Iraqi army and send weapons to the Kurdish forces through Baghdad, rather than directly through the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) headquarters in Erbil.
In November, a federal appeals court upheld Harvard University's affirmative action policy that had been challenged by a group that alleged the Ivy League school discriminates against Asian-Americans.

In other words, this was a clandestine agreement cooked up by the administrative state with no public consultation.
The Supreme Court said, yeah, you're right, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. That then got extended to every form of speech and every restriction on speech. Why would you want to limit political contributions if that just creates more speech about political debates and political candidates? he said.
Personally, regarding the political field, I think that if he could participate in elections and eventually be defeated, that would be the best for the country, Temer told reporters in an interview in January.

Schumer's remarks prompted a rare rebuke by Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, who called the New York Democrats' threat both inappropriate and dangerous.
I do not see why that should have suddenly changed, Sir Paul said.
Crucially, the Sites Reservoir appears to have some startup funding. As much as half of the money will come from a special water bond passed by voters in Proposition 1 of 2014, which set aside $2.7 billion (of $7.5 billion) for water storage projects. The rest of the project would theoretically be funded by long-term contracts for water not reserved for public use.
Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms.

Yonhap News reports that Hayden also quoted former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's assessment that Pyongyang would be crazy to halt its nuclear program after the effort already devoted to it, and China regards North Korea as a bad toothache it can generally ignore.

The abortion lobby's misuse of the COVID crisis to force distribution of chemical abortion pill online by running to court shows how little they care about what happens to women taking the deadly drugs. Women have died taking these deadly drugs, and the Supreme Court made the right decision in restoring health and safety standards.

Plenty of people on 'my side' [of the labor and migration debate] lament the fact that the lack of adequate pathways to channel immigration through the system rather than around it has predictably led to immigration outside the law, Jawetz told Breitbart News December 29.

I would be negligent, as a professor who is running a class about the human condition and the assumptions we make about being 'human,' if I did not also raise this issue of gendered language and ask my students to respect the need for gender-neutral language, Scott wrote in an email to the student about her grade. The words we use matter very much, or else teachers would not be making an issue of this at all, and the MLA would not be making recommendations for gender-neutral language at the national level.
Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology's claim that a person's legal sex is determined by their feeling of gender identity, not by their biology.
Currently, $13.3 billion in the Pentagon budget may be available, according to a congressional aide, enough to cover the $5 billion that Mr. Trump is seeking for the border wall. That would have to be diverted from projects such as military housing that Congress previously authorized. … Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that without a statutory definition of emergency, courts are unlikely to second-guess the president's judgment on that. The National Emergencies Act envisions that political checks, rather than litigation, will prevent abuse of executive authority, Mr. Vladeck said.
The government had promised not to accept any new-arrivals from safe countries such as France, but campaigners took advantage of a new loophole in migration law aimed at children known as the Dubs amendment.

Durov added, In 2019 alone, Facebook spent almost 10 billion dollars on marketing (I guess this includes paid bots on Wikipedia and other sites). Unlike Facebook, Telegram doesn't spend any money, let alone billions of dollars, on marketing. We believe that people are smart enough to choose what is best for them. And, judging by the half a billion people using Telegram, this belief is justified.

Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin Asset Management and co-sponsor of the proposal, said, We're at a critical juncture in the life of Apple – where it needs to pivot from the iPhone and the Mac to captivate consumers again.

Operating the [aircraft] carrier in the face of increasingly lethal and precise munitions will thus require the United States to expose a multi-billion dollar asset to high levels of risk in the event of a conflict. An adversary with A2/AD [anti-access/area denial] capabilities would likely launch a saturation attack against the carrier from a variety of platforms and directions. Such an attack would be difficult – if not impossible – to defend against.

The newspaper offered insight into a larger funeral home in Hankou, a Wuhan neighborhood, which it estimated had the capacity to burn 576 people per day. You Hu told the Epoch Times that the backlog of people waiting to be cremated was not due to lack of space in the burners, but lack of sufficient transportation and collapsing staff numbers, as few were sleeping or taking breaks. Due to transportation and staff limits, the Epoch Times estimated that the Hankou crematorium was burning 225 corpses a day.

China's Spratly Islands outpost expansion effort is currently focused on building out the land-based capabilities of its three largest outposts–Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs–after completion of its four smaller outposts early in 2016, the report read, according to the South China Morning Post. Once all these facilities are complete, China will have the capacity to house up to three regiments of fighters in the Spratly Islands.

After World War II, Congress included the Air Force as subject to the Act, but strangely it did not include the Navy or Marine Corps, although a subsequent Department of Defense Regulation applies it to them.

The PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, is a violent Kurdish separatist organization in Turkey that the U.S. State Department indeed lists as a foreign terrorist organization. The PYD (Democratic Union Party) is the largest Syrian Kurdish political party, while the YPG (People's Protection Units) is effectively its armed wing. The YPG militia was one of the most effective battlefield allies of the United States in the war against the Islamic State.

Millennials have lived with the harsh realities of abortion all their lives and understand more than their parents' generation that we must address the human rights issue of our day and make changes in defense of mothers and their preborn infants, said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America (SFLA). Millennials may reject labels in general, but when it comes to the specifics of abortion policy, they are anti-abortion.
An education consultant said on Sunday that a crisis is brewing in New York public schools where the number of eighth graders failing math exams has tripled since the state started administering Common Core tests.
The perpetrators acted as abhorrent testosterone bombs. When I used the word testosterone bomb in a parliamentary debate on September 17th last year, I was rebuked by the Prime Minister. He said that it was a terrible word. But it is not the term that is terrible; it is the reality that is terrible. And this reality is the responsibility of politicians, such as Mrs Merkel in Germany and our Mark Rutte, who leave our borders open.
The report came after the Fed announced in September 2012 its plans to attempt to boost economic growth by buying $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities each month.
Saxony has become the epicentre of the latest media controversy in Germany after a video went viral showing bus full of migrants who were stopped by local protesters in the small town of Clausnitz.

But the Cameron/Osborne era, you might have hoped, was a period of embarrassing, faux-Conservative sclerosis, incompetence and managed decline from which a forward-looking Conservative PM like Boris Johnson would hope to distance himself.
I think that the approach is correct, she told journalists, reiterating her strategy of a common European policy to bolster the security of the EU's external borders and cooperate with Turkey to stem refugee flows.

What we're talking about is a new blacklist, Volokh said. One of the things that's troubling about the National Association of Realtors' position is that it is trying to deploy the organized economic power of this group in order to suppress dissenting political views among members.
Late last year, Germany called on France to give up its seat to the EU so the bloc could speak with one voice — a request France rejected. Germany began her two-year stint in the Security Council as one of ten non-permanent members in January, with Mrs Merkel telling her country in her New Year's address that she would keep pushing for global solutions to the world's problems, including mass migration and climate change.
Stuart Stevens revealed in a tweet Saturday that the group is building what appears to be a blacklist.
Mr. President, I'll leave it to others to compare the bipartisan Sunday bill to the final version we will pass today and determine whether the last few changes really required or merited three days of delay — three days of delay in the face of this worsening crisis, he emphasized.

She added, To be honest with you, I have given up on American companies. I have given up on being able to be hired by America because I'm American, and Americans don't matter. And I'm sorry I'm going to get a little bit emotional here. … Americans don't matter. I hear politicians, you know, saying, Okay, you know what? We're going to open our borders, and you can have free health…I don't have health insurance. You know, Americans don't matter. All that matters is foreign workers. All that matters is if the foreign individuals…I mean, it's like we don't matter. America doesn't matter.
So much for Hillary Clinton's famously bungled reset button stunt, President Obama whispering to Putin that he would have more flexibility to accommodate Russian missile demands after he got re-elected, and the spectacle of the Obama team mocking 2012 rival Mitt Romney for warning that Russia represented a major geopolitical threat to the United States.
Rutnam, in other words, was ripe for the chop. But by jumping before he was pushed, he was able to present his departure as a case of high moral principle – while sticking the knife into Patel.
O'Reilly is one of many verified Twitter users that comment on Trump's tweets, often criticizing the president or pushing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. In another of President Trump's tweets criticizing the mainstream media, United Press International writer Ben Hooper continued to push the conspiracy theory that Russia somehow spread fake news in order to benefit Trump.
But our movement has spoken clearly. We believe a Bernie Sanders Presidency would provide the best political terrain in which to engage in and ultimately win that struggle for the world we deserve, it continued.
President-elect Joe Biden has said he favors keeping a small footprint in Afghanistan of several thousand people. The poll shows he will have to make an argument as to why he wants a continued U.S. presence.

Officials from the City of Laredo have warned the Cubans not to be loitering in town.
Breitbart Texas reported on Saturday that thousands of Cubans who have been stranded in Costa Rica since Nicaragua closed its border to the refugees are now being flown directly to Nueva Laredo, Mexico. At that point they can easily cross into Texas and apply for adjustment to their alien status. Once this happens, they are free to travel across the United States and are immediately eligible for government benefits.
The third problem was that Pelosi and Schumer failed to talk about the problems Trump raised in emotive terms: the murders, the drugs, the sexual assaults — not just targeting Americans, but targeting the migrants themselves. The victims of the cartels were totally absent from their address. Instead, they wrung their hands about turmoil in the administration. They looked and sounded as if they did not care about the human suffering at the border.
Tai praised the USMCA as notable for incorporating groundbreaking labor and environmental provisions, including enforcement mechanisms that address longstanding wounds and grievances suffered by regular working people, and said the rules of the agreement now must be rigorously enforced.
But with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday's violence in DC, we're taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration, continued Facebook.
Polls will be open for the runoffs statewide in Georgia from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Tuesday, and most polling for both races has indicated the outcome will be a toss-up.
Pollak suggested that Trump's election can also be seen as a revolt against the lavish idealism of the 60s and the enormous government, attended by an equally large managerial class, that resulted from it.
A Washington, D.C., circuit court ruled in October that the CFPB is, by design, unconstitutional. Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion, The director of the CFPB possesses more unilateral authority – that is, authority to take action on one's own, subject to no check – than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U.S. government.
The mission appears to be going slowly, as the Islamic State left the villages it abandoned full of mines and other traps designed to kill civilians returning to their homes and opposing soldiers.

The Missouri senator said Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak has proved that America needs to stop relying on China for our critical medical supply chains.
Our faith teaches us that respect for people of every race, religion, gender, ethnicity and background are requirements of fundamental human dignity and basic decency, Gregory said, seeming to imply that Trump's words were motivated by racism. This include newcomers to our country, people who have differing political views and people who may be different from us.
The SEC's investigation looks into whether Yahoo disclosed information about the data breaches in timely enough fashion, wrote USA Today on the subject. SEC rules require companies to disclose data breaches and cyberattacks as soon as it is determined the incidents could have an effect on investors.
Discrimination is pernicious, Khurana wrote. Stereotypes and bias take hold, normalizing bias in a community, which should be unacceptable. In this case, the discriminatory membership policies of these organizations have led to the perpetuation of spaces that are rife with power imbalances. The most entrenched of these spaces send an unambiguous message that they are the exclusive preserves of men.
She also asked why such an anti-republican politician had been allowed to speak for two hours on television, implying the right wing should be silenced in the media.
Assad rules over a country in ruins, with close to half a million people killed and half the population displaced. Major fighting may still lie ahead. But many see the war nearing its end, and the 53-year-old leader is sitting more comfortably than he has in the past eight years.
Panel 1: Obama's Dangerous National Security Legacy and How it Must Be Reversed
Let me give you another example: the Veterans Administration, Brill responded. Remember the scandals in 2013 and 14 about the waiting lists? The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has been writing reports — if you can believe it — since the 1980s saying that the Veterans Administration was in shambles, the waiting lists were a huge problem, the computer technology didn't work, and people were covering up how long it was taking for people to get their treatment at VA hospitals. That's since the 1980s.
$700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restored funding for the United Nation's Population Fund, which would undermine the administration's Mexico City Policy that bars the use of taxpayer dollars for foreign organizations that promote or perform abortions.

Far-left Times columnist Michele Goldberg has a prolific record of anti-Israel writing. So it wasn't much of a surprise when, on December 8, she published an article arguing that it isn't antisemitic to reject the Jewish people's right to self-determination and political freedom in their homeland.
In Germany, attacks on women in several cities on New Year's Eve have prompted hundreds of complaints, with police suspicion resting on asylum seekers, putting pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel and her open-door migrant policy.
When some U.S. politicians insist on finding scapegoats to cover up their own incompetence in responding to COVID-19, the threat to public health will only worsen. Faced with domestic criticism and deepened public fears, some White House politicians sharpened their rhetoric against China this week, referring to the widespread coronavirus as the Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, or the kung-flu, blaming China for the epidemic, and arousing virus-related hatred. But putting the blame on China is not an easy or quick way out of the twin health and economic crises faced by the U.S. administration. The tactic can only hurt China-U.S. relations and dampen the confidence in fighting the coronavirus, domestically and internationally. When the U.S. public sees that their government has sunk so low as to scapegoat China, fears will only deepen, as shown in the continuous slide in the U.S. stock market despite increasing policy efforts.
Approximately $2 billion more than requested for the Environmental Protection Agency
There is some evidence that the increasing use of visa workers is reducing U.S. technological capability, even as Chinese companies take the lead from investor-driven U.S. companies.
I think Trump's victory was an extraordinary one, and he did it by being, frankly, different, not being a run-of-the-mill establishment Republican. I don't think there's an appetite for a Romney run in the Republican party, nor do I think Mitt Romney-style big government establishment Republicanism is frankly popular enough to win in a general election, Paul continued.
California's 46th District, already a Democrat-held congressional seat, has a foreign-born population that is now reaching 40 percent with four-out-of-ten residents being born outside the United States.
Announced in September of 2017, the new Amazon building will be called HQ2 and will cost approximately $5 billion to develop and operate. Amazon estimates that the building could create up to 50,000 high-paying jobs in the city they choose to construct it in. Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy commented on Amazon's decision to cut down their list of 238 cities to only 20 saying, Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity. Through this process, we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni told reporters following a cabinet meeting Thursday that Bolsonaro intends to fire any communists who work for the government currently, contending that those holding opposing ideological views to the new government cannot properly execute its goals.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the nearly 2 million Americans who have dropped Obamacare this year in a Tuesday speech to employees at U.S. Health and Human Services ahead of meetings with lawmakers at the White House and on Capitol Hill.
[S]ince these identities are inborn characteristics people cannot change, the only way to change it is via violent revolution. Growing up in China, I had learned it many times.

Just taking a brief glance at these requirements, it would seem that Hill is, at the very least, in violation of the prohibition against discussing issues that have no relation to sports. The Starbucks arrest had no sports connection whatsoever. Perhaps Hill's work on the Undefeated, a site which covers racial issues, gives her the freedom to address issues without a direct sports connection, but that seems like a debatable point.
Public support in the licence fee is already eroded, however, with a YouGov poll from December showing that half of Britons want the TV tax scrapped and the BBC to earn its own money, rather than simply be entitled to it.
Update: The Democrat spending bills passed the House on Thursday night. The first bill, a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8, passed by 239-192.

The second bill to fund the other six agencies through September passed by 241-190.

Part of the reason why Democrats like Jones are going through with this, Sessions said, is because of how effective President Trump has been on his agenda. Sessions, whose interview came before Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night, said the president's speech would be a positive message for America.

Both states will deepen their cooperation in foreign affairs, defence, external and internal security and development and at the same time work on strengthening the ability of Europe to act independently, says the text of the treaty, as seen by Reuters.
It began in our schools on college campuses where our students are taught the absurd notion that free speech is about privilege and power, and not open debate and rational deliberation. For our constituents, taking away means freedom of speech is silent and good ideas are stifled. … The resolution strips all mentioned the words of father, mother, son, daughter, brother, mother in law, daughter in law. I'm a proud father. I'm an extremely proud son. But we're going strike them from the rules. First we take your speech away. Then we take what you can say.

Williams said that he has not seen any official plan being worked on by House Republican Leadership or the White House, but he has offered his input to the Trump Administration.

Those investor groups want Trump to endorse migration increases before the 2020 election.
From an off-key violin come the notes of the United States anthem. An erratic Donald Trump dusts off the rhetoric of the Cold War, the author writes, describing the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association as the old terrorist guard that killed in the name of the CIA and was left waiting for the American boat that would take them back to Cuba.
Despite not giving any specifics on how she would pay for the expansive government programs she had proposed, Ocasio-Cortez suggested at another point during the interview that the government should raise the tax rate to as high as 70 percent to fund climate change programs.

Burgess' comments are a sharp contrast from statements by business-first Republicans who argue that immigration policy should be built around the investors' preference for plentiful, cheap labor, or the desire of myriad foreigners to get American jobs.
After the Iraq-Iran war, Soleimani largely disappeared from public view for several years, something analysts attribute to his wartime disagreements with Hashemi Rafsanjani, who would serve as Iran's president from 1989 to 1997. But after Rafsanjani, Soleimani became head of the Quds force. He also grew so close to Khamenei that the Supreme Leader officiated the wedding of the general's daughter.
But what did Boris Johnson, the man who had derided the EU's colonial demands, and now the first prime minister since Gordon Brown or arguably Tony Blair with a strong and reliable Commons majority, do with new power?
Tareq Al-Homayed, former editor of Al-Sharq Al-Awsa, estimated that the international incident proved Iran does not intent to moderate its positions ahead of next week's expected lifting of a decade of sanctions imposed on the Iranian regime.

The support for Webb may come as somewhat of a surprise, since he is a Democrat and has been largely out of the headlines since the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, when he launched a bid for president.

According to the government, one child in 165 experienced very low food security. One child in 125 went hungry for at least one day because of a lack of money for food. One child in 250 skipped at least one meal because of a lack of food resources. One child in a thousand did not eat for an entire day because there was not enough money for food. Feeding America claims that thirteen million children are food insecure. But in fact the one-in-165 USDA statistic yields a total less than one tenth of that number. And the one child in a thousand who spent a whole day without eating equals about seventy-four thousand kids in the whole country. Even one hungry child is a tragedy. But the anti-hunger lobby is grossly exaggerating the scope of the problem—and proposing the wrong solutions.
One of the signs says, ATTENTION: Please be aware that certain staff members at Okay Public Schools can be legally armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students.
Because of this, Zero Hedge asserted a link between the virology institute and the outbreak of the coronavirus.
O'Keefe, who becomes visibly angrier over the course of the debate, also claims that the U.S. is following Israeli policy to advance the Jewish state's plan for a Greater Israel.
China has been annexing regions in the South China Sea that have historically belonged to other countries, and continues to use belligerent military operations to enforce its seizures. China has claimed the entire South China Sea, including regions historically belonging to Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. China's claims are rejected by almost everyone outside of China, and China refuses to submit them to the United Nations court deciding such matters, apparently knowing their claims are groundless and that they would lose.
Fourth, Pelosi and Schumer failed to bring out their best argument: the supposed cruelty of the family separation policy. The images of children in cages provoked national outrage last summer, and brought the administration to its lowest point. Somehow they failed to bring out that point, which would at least have provided a contrary image to the victims that Trump described. Perhaps they were afraid it would support his claim of a crisis at the border.
Herschmann recalled that when then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney — sitting in the Senate as one of Utah's two delegates — made Russia the focus of his foreign policy in 2012, Obama mocked him.
These are Christ's representatives on Earth, former student Peter Alrutz said. You're taught to do whatever they tell you. And then all of a sudden the people who are supposed to be protecting you are abusing you.
While the Ugandan army has not responded to Wine's allegations that its soldiers raided his residence, the Uganda National Police said on January 12, they have credible information that … Bobi Wine plans to stage his own abduction after casting his vote on Thursday [January 14], Uganda's Daily Monitor reported.
If citizens struggling to cover their own health care nurture resentments against any group perceived to be getting help to which they themselves are not entitled — or worse, if they grow xenophobic and subscribe to the notion that immigrants carry diseases — they might be compelled to endorse policies even more draconian than those already in play. That would create more anxiety among noncitizen communities, which would lead to fewer people seeking medical care when they need it. From there, the epidemic would only get worse.
As well as live music and comedy shows, Yondr also advertises itself to schools, courts, and private events such as weddings.
The U.S., Mnuchin said, has been a leader in reducing carbon emissions. What the president objects to is the Paris agreement, because he thought it was an unfair agreement for the United States.
However, the attorney general appears to be having a difficult time enforcing his new policy. DOJ prosecutors and at least one federal judge appear to not be executing Sessions' new policy of zero tolerance for illegal border crossers, Breitbart Texas reported on Tuesday.
Panelist will argue free speech is the indispensable tool in confronting jihad and Islamic shariah law. Author and historian Lars Hedegaard of Denmark founded the Danish Free Press Society and International Free Press Society, and has been a fierce critic of the encroachment of shariah law on freedom of expression in the West. He has faced persecution by his own government and survived an assassination attempt in 2013. The UK's Paul Weston leads the Liberty GB party, and is a strong voice against creeping sharia in his homeland. In 2014, he was arrested on suspicion of racial harrassment after quoting verbatim a passage about Islam written by Winston Churchill. CSP Executive Vice President Jim Hanson will outline a new initiative against these and related threats, the Counterjihad Campaign.
Still, Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, told AFP that Beijing considers the slowdown part of a new normal and that major easing is unlikely, given the improving global outlook and the US trade deal.

Greece was the main entry point into Europe for Middle Eastern migrants and asylum seekers during the 2015 migrant crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands march along what became known as the Balkan route, through Hungary, and onwards to wealthy, northern-European countries like Germany and Sweden that have generous welfare packages.
Well, on Monday John Kerry consulted with the Russians and announced a new peace plan — and it contained exactly the same elements as the old peace plan. What the hell do these people think they're doing?
Personally, I would have loved that Russians would have interfered like that, Karaganov added. Our American partners should be educated that they live in the crystal palace and they should stop interfering into internal affairs of other countries, they should stop regime changes, et cetera. I mean if we do that, that would be a great lesson for Americans. I am not sure whether we were able to do that.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said members of the Philippines' Presidential Security Group (PSG) obtained early samples of the vaccine candidate in development by the Chinese company Sinopharm at least three months ago without government authorization. He said the president's security guards received the inoculations in September and October without his knowledge.
Strzok then forwards the exchange to Page, who replies Bowdich sent separately as well.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley slammed a UN report documenting 206 companies with ties to Israeli settlements as evidence of an anti-Israeli obsession in the organization.
Every year Gallup does a survey of the American people's overall satisfaction with the country, and on a number of specific issues. This year, Gallup polled 1,014 adults between January 2-15 and found that overall satisfaction with the country is at its highest level since 2005, and on a number of key issues, Americans are much more satisfied today than when Obama left office — in many cases, by double digits.
Indeed, we must also ask: If anything were to happen to the current government in Riyadh, who would take power? Al Qaeda? ISIS? Iran? Pompeo's answer is, in effect, that for the foreseeable future, we must stick with the current regime, and one would bet that Kirkpatrick, who died in 2006, would agree.
Speaking at a special meeting he convened with officials including Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron, he said Israel is formulating special procedures to contain the crisis and prepare for from an economic point-of-view.
In 2010, the German Chancellor gave a speech in which she criticised the multikulti concept, telling members of her party: We kidded ourselves a while, we said: 'They won't stay, sometime they will be gone', but this isn't reality. She added that the attempt to build a multicultural society has failed, utterly failed.
This is our last chance to veto this government policy, which is ruining us, Pitoń has said — and, perhaps slightly cheekily, invited Polish president Andrzej Duda to come down to the Tatra mountains for a skiing trip himself, saying he could become a modern-day Casimir — a legendary Polish ruler remembered as the Restorer for returning from exile to reunite much of his realm a thousand years ago.
The Office of The Commissioner of Major League Baseball Political Action Committee has donated $669,375 to Senate and House candidates since the 2016 election cycle, with 52.4% of that money going to Republican candidates, according to The Center for Responsive Politics, the AP reported.
The strategy that they're rolling out, the way they're scoring Christian behavior, attendance of church, not allowing young people under the age of 18 to go, monitoring online behavior, they're just very sophisticated how they're cracking down on religious practice, Curry said. I have to point out, it's not just against Christians. The Uyghur Muslims – religious and ethnic Muslims in the northwest of the country – have faced enormous hardships and human rights abuses at the hands of China.
The Fire Brigade issued a similar notice for another KCTMO-managed building, Hazelwood Tower. The upgrades were scheduled to be completed by 2016, the report said.
What kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.

The report cited a 2020 study from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which found that Uyghurs have been used as slave labour in factories that supply at least 83 well-known global brands. The ASPI estimated that between 2017 and 2019, alone, over 80,000 Uyghurs were shipped out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China.
Klein warned Russia has nearly taken over in Syria and explained that traditional U.S. allies in the Gulf, spurned by President Obama's successful efforts to sign an international nuclear deal with Iran, are now forging fresh alliances with Russia, creating a new Moscow-aligned axis in the Middle East.
Poblete argues it is improbable that Congress would not have known about the missile and, in fact, claims congressional sources who assured him several key members and their staffers were in the loop. He argues that it was hypocritical for knowledgeable members to sit on the Hellfire story while opposing Obama's Cuba policy on other grounds… or possibly collusion with the administration to keep the story secret until now.

He also said if there were witnesses to be called during the Senate impeachment trial, Joe and Hunter Biden should be called in.
And she really shouldn't be underestimated. She has youth on her side: imagine the damage she's capable of doing between now and the time she's Nancy Pelosi's age! And, as Laura Perrins notes here, she knows how to exploit her beautiful woman privilege to the max:
He has been unusually outspoken for an ambassador in criticizing the country where he serves, including warning German companies over Twitter to comply with Trump's orders not to do business in Iran.
Schaeuble's meeting with Mnuchin comes after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration criticized Germany's trade surplus. Members of the Group of 20, a gathering of the world's most powerful economies, will debate whether to confirm their rejection of trade barriers when they meet Friday and Saturday in southern Germany.
2. Iran's arrest of the sailors and seizure of the boats was hostile. As former POW Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) noted, Under international law, sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Iran's actions were hostile and fall under the Convention.
Gov. Jerry Brown countered by insisting that what Hutchens did was actually compliant with state law. Becerra's new guidance aims to make that clear — and take the sting out of the federal lawsuit.
Indeed, the Roosevelt administration made some notably hard-nosed choices about working with sons-of-bitches—and worse. For instance, during World War Two, FDR made the wise decision to actively aid the Soviet Union in its fight against Nazi Germany. Roosevelt's logic was as simple as it was impeccable: The Soviets were bad, but the Nazis were much worse. After all, it was Hitler who declared war on the U.S.
While the Tribunal stopped short of accusing the regime of genocide, the report said the Tribunal has no doubt whatsoever that physical acts have been carried out that are indicative of the crime of genocide, specifically in the case of Falun Gong practitioners and the Uyghurs.

Meanwhile, the European Commission's investigation of Facebook is providing an excellent window into just how insidious Facebook's business model has become.

Last month, Castro and Sanchez joined a number of other House Democrats to introduce legislation that would permanently add millions of foreign workers to the U.S. labor market every year. Those foreign workers, here on temporary visas, would otherwise be asked to return to their native countries.
Were President Trump to actually send troops to the southern border, it would not be unprecedented. In 2006, President George W. Bush deployed roughly 6,000 troops to the border to support domestic law enforcement activities. And in 2010, President Obama took similar action. Notably, while those actions might have been unpopular, no one seriously questioned whether Presidents Bush and Obama violated the Posse Comitatus Act.

There's not that many unions, generally speaking, but American workers in a tight labor market have bargaining power, even as just individuals. But if the labor market is expanded to include in effect the entire world, then there can never be a tight labor market. It becomes effectively impossible. That puts employers in the driver's seat and takes away any [marketplace] bargaining power that American workers would have, even those who aren't in unions or have any kind of formal organization.

Survey: 78 Percent of Europeans Want Tighter Control of Borders https://t.co/1Ynx8em6Te — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2018
Conservative Jewish activist Laura Loomer says she didn't know until recently that outside groups and individuals had privately lobbied Twitter executives to remove her from the site in late November. In an email to Ms. Loomer, Twitter said she had violated its hateful conduct policy for a tweet calling Ilhan Omar, the Muslim congresswoman from Minnesota, anti-Jewish and supportive of Shariah law. In an interview, Ms. Loomer says she was referring to a 2012 tweet from Ms. Omar in which the congresswoman wrote, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Among the groups that had complained to Twitter was the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization. The council doesn't often step in to advocate against other users, says Executive Director Zahra Billoo, but did so in the case of Ms. Loomer based on her previous comments about Muslims. In 2017, Ms. Loomer tweeted after a terror attack in New York City, Leave it to Muslims to ruin everything. People can't even enjoy #Halloween without those savages f**king everything up for everyone. Other organizations, including the civil-rights organization Muslim Advocates, voiced similar complaints.

However, if people do not need our protection they are expected to leave the UK and we may remove them if they do not go voluntarily.
Moreover, she derided another Twitter user for merely suggesting that she wait for all the facts before making a judgment:
We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by 'our fathers who framed the Government under which we live;' while you with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new, Lincoln said. True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be. You are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers.
The testimonies of the victims are terrible. Women and girls were attacked, robbed and subjected to disgusting and extremely traumatizing behavior. A victim said: They surrounded us and began to grope us. Their hands were everywhere. I had fingers in every bodily orifice.
Even though she admitted that Balkan states had done Germany a favour by closing their borders to migrants — a move that led to a significant drop in new arrivals — Merkel insisted just days ahead of an EU summit that we can see from pictures out of Greece that that is not a sustainable solution.
Pelosi also has to manage her raucous caucus, which includes moderates from swing-districts and progressives who back the Abolish ICE! slogan, Vaughan said.
Turning to North Korea, Bolton said the communist nation's latest threats to unleash a super-mighty preemptive strike on the United States were standard rhetoric.
But, Sessions warned, while President Trump clearly gets this broader coalition message, several Republicans do not—and that is why he is running for his old seat in the U.S. Senate, to help steer the GOP correctly in the era of Trump and beyond.
There is a problem with the Vatican's communication, he said. Instead of saying 'we are making a deal,' snippets come out saying that all bishops will be recognized. Naturally this creates difficulties for the Chinese Church because everyone wants to know whether all the bishops, including the illicit (Chinese government appointed) ones, are included in the deal and if those not recognized by the government are included, meaning all the underground bishops.

President of Kaltbaum Capital Management and Fox News contributor Gary Kaltbaum will present his daily update on the Federal Reserve's policies and stock market fluctuations.
Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) told Breitbart News exclusively that Democrat challenger Jon Ossoff's pledge to grant amnesty to every illegal alien in America is a threat to American workers struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and, as such, would be unfair to American citizens and legal immigrants.
The Syrian regime tried to cheer up its Iranian patrons this week by promising they will make a fortune from postwar reconstruction, a project in which Iranian bids will ostensibly be privileged.

Analysts believe Syria under Assad will likely continue to face conflicts and sputter on in limbo for years to come, with only a partial recovery. But he will likely cling to power and do business with anyone who will do business with him.
Overall last year France lost approximately 3 percent of its total number of millionaires, while it's capital, Paris, lost about six percent of its millionaires. That amounts to some 7,000 people from Paris alone, mostly to the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia and Israel, according to a report by New World Wealth, an agency which compiles data on the global wealth sector.
In a blog post, Leslie Miller, Google's director of public policy, addressed the charges put against the company:
Both states will deepen the integration of their economies towards a German-French economic area with common rules, the document added.
In 1981, Kirkpatrick was named by President Ronald Reagan to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and the rest is history. The decisions made by Reagan in the early 80s, with Kirkpatrick as a key adviser, led, just a few years later, to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Changed the world, indeed.
Five months after the Charlottesville protests, Facebook added slides explaining the social media firms position on white nationalism, supremacy, and separatism. Interestingly, the slides stated that the company does not allow praise, support, or representation of white supremacy as an ideology but does allow positions on white nationalism and separatism to be praised or discussed.
Strzok said Clinton's apology and the convenience discussion were not in the FBI 302 report which summarized the interview.
At issue is DHS' selective immigration enforcement policies — laid out in a Johnson memo offered in conjunction with President Obama's 2014 executive amnesty — in which the Obama administration prioritizes removal for illegal immigrants only if they have been convicted of felonies, are a threat to national security, have multiple misdemeanors, or are recent border crossers.
When the Department of Health declined to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed as parents, respondents filed suit in circuit court seeking a declaration that petitioner's refusal to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed violated their constitutional rights, as well as a declaration that certain statutory provisions were unconstitutional. Respondents also sought to enjoin enforcement of petitioner's policy against naming both spouses on the birth certificate under these circumstances and an order requiring petitioner to issue corrected birth certificates naming both spouses.
Bringing back the gravity and prestige of the presidency was a big deal to the Reagans, according to Rosebush, and it is not just there for the president's aggrandizement. Nancy Reagan had a huge role to play in bringing back that prestige and Rosebush said that when you went to the White House, you felt it.

No one above an elementary school education can deny that it is mathematically impossible to pay down our current debt bubble with sound currency or without using questionable accounting methods. The world's financial system has crossed the Rubicon in its ability to fix this problem without all future growth and productivity gains being consumed by interest rate expenses.
1. Operation Warp Speed. When President Trump demanded a coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible, he was told by the experts and the media fact-checkers that it could not be done until the middle of 2021, at the earliest. But Trump insisted, and the scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and logistics experts responded. As a result, millions have already been vaccinated for a disease that was virtually unknown at the start of 2020, and humanity is entering 2021 with hope for a speedy recovery.
Despite the murky economic picture, Bloomberg is not only promising to accept more refugees, but he's also lashing out at those who disagree. Last month, during a campaign swing through Texas, the former mayor attacked Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) for his decision to halt refugee resettlement.
Every person is religious in this sense of the word, Ashford said, and every person's functional religion will exercise a significant influence on his or her public life.
He said on the threat from China, We not only got it right, and frankly, I think there is some bipartisan basis, I hope, that we can continue to get this right.
The congressman emphasized the importance of tax reform leading to generating cash flow in the private sector. Give them the tax cuts… let them make money, he said.
Miller went on to suggest that perhaps the Campaign for Aaccountability was not the most reliable of sources when it came to analyzing Google's work:
The leaders of Italy's two largest political parties remain in negotiations over the form and direction of a potential coalition government despite assurances made on Sunday that an agreement was just hours away, while European Union leaders in Brussels dictate that Italy should not pursue any radical policy changes.
The bill, sponsored by California Democrat representative Judy Chu, has been endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union, who characterized it as a response to Trump's racism. Three years after the first Muslim ban, President Trump expanded his discriminatory Muslim ban, targeting more Black and brown immigrants and their families, employers, and educational institutions, they said, continuing:
In his talks with the media, Trump has also hinted at broader concessions, including a huge immigration bill that would provide business with more workers and Democrats with more future voters. In his January 19 exchange with reporters, Trump said:
I am not planning to go anywhere. We have wonderful relations inside the team with the president, he told a packed Davos hotel ballroom.
The South China Morning Post recounted the experience of one father whose child had a visible reaction to the expired vaccine:
The North Korean regime, in response to the cancellation, said it is still willing to resolve issues with the United States whenever.
In January 2014, Davis admitted she lied about important life events, including her divorce, and, one year later, also admitted she was faking her support for gun rights to boost her chances in her gubernatorial bid.
The only way we're going to get to four percent growth and to lower unemployment is to allow people to hire people and… hire people when they make money, so you know you gotta begin by cutting the rates, said Williams. He pointed out the use of the term revenue neutral as one that isn't used in the private sector.
It is easy to see why the administration would want to keep the missing missile, and the Castro regime's obstinate refusal to return it, out of the public eye while relations with the island gulag were being normalized, but one would think members of Congress opposed to President Obama's policy would have spoken up.
A day after concerns about China's economic slowdown rocked the global stock market, American Enterprise Institute scholar Nicholas Eberstadt said that the financial markets—and even the CIA—have for too long been unrealistically optimistic about China's economic potential even when China's demographics suggested otherwise.
The incoming Congress and the executive administration are going to have to make some significant decisions that will also carry significant implications, not just for the veteran community but for the whole country and that's why it's important to look at these opinions, because these are the people who are most deeply affected by these issues and that's a good indicator for policy makers as they make decisions, Anderson said.
The implication that China is also not properly documenting cause of death on people's birth certificates is also not new. Shortly after China revealed the outbreak to the world on January 20, Radio Free Asia (RFA) highlighted the strange death of Xu Dapeng, the founder of the oldest environmentalist group in the country. Xu and his wife lived in Wuhan and both died of pneumonia in January. Neither they nor anyone who was exposed to them were tested for the novel coronavirus, and their cause of death was simply declared pneumonia.
Half of the 3.5M blue-collar migrants who crossed from 2014-2019 are still in the U.S., says DHS data.
Although Biden and his running-mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have promised their response to the crises will prioritize equity for all Americans, it appears that not everyone will have a voice in the new administration. Biden's cabinet, in fact, will be the first since President Bill Clinton's initial term to not have a member of the opposing party at the head of an administrative department.
The meetings typically take place on Tuesday or Thursday, but since it was Shanahan's first full workday as acting defense secretary after taking over from former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, he decided to hold it on Wednesday, the official said.
In the week prior to the election, Kabila's election commission said that the election will still be held, but will be delayed until March in three cities: Beni, Butembo, and Yumbi. The reasons given for Beni and Butembo are that there are Ebola outbreaks in those cities and that voting would be dangerous. However, voting has not been delayed in other cities with Ebola outbreaks. What these three cities have in common is that they are strongholds for anti-Kabila opposition. On election day, the local government of Beni held its own elections, just to prove that voting was not dangerous.
ATF mentioned Ma's complete scrubbing from a Chinese reality show he once hosted and enthusiastically represented as the detail that seems to have awakened the world to the flamboyant billionaire's disappearance, then described how the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) media machine is turning against the man who was once hailed as a model citizen:
Planned Parenthood has been touting an increase in at-home abortions since its tele-abortion services began nationwide, though many pro-life advocates have concerns about the practice.
That a politician looking for votes might say such a thing is understandable, but not a Christian, for whom the only proper attitude is to stand in the shoes of those brothers and sisters of ours who risk their lives to offer a future to their children, he continued.
He continued, The problem with using government as a lever, as a tool and taking hostages—not only the 800,000 federal employees but taking all the millions and millions of people who are served by government every day hostage is—that is very, very debilitating to our country — essentially taking our country hostage. So what we're saying is, Mr. President, we need to negotiate. It could be hard; you can veto some of our bills, but don't shut down government in the process. So this is a bigger issue than just the wall or education or the Affordable Care Act, it's an issue of whether or not we're going to use as a continuing policy shutting down the government of the United States and undermining the confidence of our employees, the confidence of people who deal with the government, and the confidence of the international community looking to see whether the United States of America can act in a rational, responsible way.
Sessions has generally kept his attention on doing his job — even at the cost of his relationship with the president. He's pulled every available lever to redirect the considerable resources of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to fight the crimes he considers most serious: violent crimes, drug crime, and, most notably, violations of immigration law. …

How can Buffett possibly be spending $50,000 on postage or phone calls? A very expensive wireless plan, with unlimited data on multiple devices, could run you something like $300 per month or $3,600 a year.

The spending bills proposed by House Democrats to end the partial government shutdown offer no funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, but provide over $12 billion more in foreign aid than the Trump administration requested, according to a statement on Thursday from the White House Office of Management and Budget.
Moreover, House Democrats' accusations rest on the false and dangerous premise that Vice President Biden somehow immunized his conduct (and his son's) from any scrutiny by declaring his run for the presidency. There is no such rule of law. It certainly was not a rule applied when President Trump was a candidate. His political opponents called for investigations against him and his children almost daily. Nothing in the law requires the government to turn a blind eye to potential wrongdoing based on a person's status as a candidate for President of the United States. If anything, the possibility that Vice President Biden may ascend to the highest office in the country provides a compelling reason for ensuring that, when he forced Ukraine to fire its Prosecutor General, his family was not corruptly benefitting from his actions.

The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment came following seven years of negotiations. Two factors are said to have played a critical role in the signing of the deal, namely China's desire to ink a deal before President-Elect Joe Biden assumes the White House and a push from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to secure a deal prior to the end of Germany's term as the head of the EU presidency in December.

There was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.
Datafolha found that, without Lula on the ballot, conservative legislator and military veteran Jair Bolsonaro would likely win the first round of voting, but without the majority necessary to keep a run-off vote from happening.

Six weeks later, on February 8, the regulators imposed the type of net neutrality Facebook aggressively lobbied for and won in the U.S. to prevent telecommunications companies from charge discriminatory pricing for different Web services.

The Conservative Party has complacently taken many thousands of pounds in donations to its coffers from Huawei. The Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, joined the Huawei 'advisory board'. (She was accompanied in this enterprise by such luminaries as the former senior civil servant Sir Andrew Cahn, the former BP chief executive Lord Browne, and the late former head of the Confederation of British Industry, Dame Helen Alexander.) Huawei's meticulous ingratiation into the heart of the British Establishment went to the very top: it donated half a million pounds to the Prince's Trust. It was only a year ago that Prince Charles's most treasured public enterprise declared it would 'not be accepting new donations from Huawei' because of 'public concerns'.

Krauthammer said, I thought the whole story of this presidency, and its foreign policy, was seen in the split screen. On one side, you had the video footage of the attack in Belgium. This is the real world, and on the other side was Obama, in the fantasy world he inhabits, where Cuba is of some geopolitical significance, in his mind, but none in the real world. If Cuba disappeared tomorrow, in a volcanic eruption…nobody would notice, geopolitically. But Obama had to go, because this is legacy. This is settling the Cold War arguments, of the academic left, of Obama's Columbia University days, the people who worship the Cuban Revolution, the Sandinistas. Obama had his picture taken in front of a relief of Che Guevara, which sort of stated his worldview of his adolescent days, and now he does it as president. And the one hand, is the real threat to the world…this is hair-raising stuff, that the Belgians are completely outmanned. The Europeans have no way of tracking, and that we are completely in the blind. We don't know what we don't know. That's the real world. Obama calls it the JV team. He pretends it's contained and controlled, it is not. Instead, he does this sort of ideological holiday trip in Cuba, while the world burns.
It is hard to know how influential the Times' ever-escalating campaign against Jews will be on the American Jewish community.

Academics Rebecca Steinfeld, 35, and Charles Keidan, 40, wanted to secure legal recognition of their seven-year relationship by entering into a civil partnership, rejecting marriage as they claim it carries patriarchal baggage.

The next month the Pentagon announced it was deploying 3,000 U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia. (The Pentagon on Friday announced following Soleimani's killing that it would boost its presence in the region with an additional 3,500 U.S. troops.)
North Korea launched another ballistic missile on Wednesday morning – or at least they tried to, since the Pentagon is now judging the test a failure, because the missile did not reach Japanese waters. Fox News quotes a U.S. official saying the missile might have pinwheeled in flight.

To achieve greater pay equality, social scientists say — other than women avoiding marriage and children — changes would have to take place in workplaces and public policy that applied to both men and women. Examples could be companies putting less priority on long hours and face time, and the government providing subsidized child care and moderate-length parental leave.
However, mobility for seniors has recently become more difficult after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that in order to protect seniors, who are more at risk from coronavirus, they should self-isolate for 12 weeks as a precautionary measure.

Backed by an array of free-speech advocates, the tech company has argued that expanding the territorial scope of the right to be forgotten would infringe on other countries' sovereignty and encourage dictators and tyrants to assert control over content published beyond their countries' borders. The EU's executive arm also argued in September that the right shouldn't be extended overseas. At issue in the case is the right, established by the court in 2014, for EU residents to demand that search engines remove links containing personal information—such as a home address—from searches for their own names. Under the 2014 ruling, search engines must then balance those requests against the public's right to associate the information in the link with that individual, taking into account, for instance, whether the person is a public figure. Since that decision, Google has removed 1.1 million links from search results in the EU. But it left those links intact for the same searches conducted outside Europe.

And whatever marginally positive effect these policies may have had on Israel's international position pales in comparison to the damage Trump has allegedlycaused Israel through his failure to support what Stephens refers to as the liberal international order against totalitarian states, and his preference for a purely transactional foreign policy based on the needs of the moment or the whims of the president.

Cindy Anderson, a member of Doctors for Camp Closure — an association of medical professionals who oppose immigration detention — decried camp conditions in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. I was in Matamoros in January and we were seeing a lot of influenza-like illness at that time.

Krauthammer said, I think this is a disgraceful conclusion, because what they did, is they substituted their judgment, as to what constitutes a threat to American security for the president's. Now we were all interested in what they think, but that is irrelevant to the case. The case was, does the president have the authority to do it? And if he does, it's his judgment to make. And that's the plain reading of the law. It's he plain understanding of the Constitution. I think the policy was unwise, but that's irrelevant. I think it's very clearly legal.

For instance, FIRE believes students should have access to the active assistance of counsel in most disciplinary cases, as opposed to only those with a potential penalty of greater than 30 days' suspension or those involving expressive conduct. The bill draft also addresses a few items about which FIRE does not take a position, and which FIRE would therefore not address through its own efforts. But there is little doubt that passage of this model legislation would represent a real improvement in free speech protections in states that do not already include such protections in state law.

Employers are increasingly adopting so-called implicit bias training, which targets employees by race or gender. Not only are the tests associated with unconscious bias well short of meeting scientific standards, but because they purport to aid employers in targeting employees primarily based on their race or ethnicity and/or their gender they potentially allow employees to be assessed, disciplined or promoted on the basis of race or gender activity which Title VII specifically bars. Whether based on good intentions or not, an employer's plan to hire, promote or advance employees who are minority and/or female using implicit bias as a motive disadvantages non-minority and male employees.

But the answer the massive food lobby favors is quite different: more and more money. They lobby for ever-more government spending, and they work feverishly to convince Americans to kick in yet more private donations as well. Lobbying and fundraising is where they spend a sizable chunk of their vast fortune. They also spend some of their lucre on food pantries and food banks, of which there are something like thirty thousand in this country. Rector, though, calculates that only a third of very low food secure families avail themselves of food banks or pantries. Two-thirds say they don't have access to them.
The FWD.us lobby group was formed by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and other West Coast investors to help push the Gang of Eight amnesty bill through Congress.

This was a colossal failure of the Democratic House, first and foremost, Sessions said. This was nowhere close to an impeachment. I've been saying that for weeks. It's not an offense. It's nowhere close to being an impeachable offense. They should not have done this. They have abused the great impeachment article in the Constitution more than it's ever been abused in its history and they deserve to be criticized for it. It's become more and more clear, I think, to the American people as time went on that this is not—the evidence did not justify removal from office. It's nowhere close to what's required. I'm glad the Republicans said listen and went through a process, but they're correct to bring this to a close. It's just not there. I thought Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz made the case in a compelling fashion.

On the other hand, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, and Germany all have either outlawed birthright citizenship or never had such a policy to begin with.
The most dramatic thing I can tell your listeners is if we lose these two seats in Georgia, then [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-VT] would be chairman of the Budget Committee, Perdue said. It doesn't get much further left than that. But the Senate, if we hold these seats, we can be the balance of power in Washington that keeps the Democrats from perpetrating this leftwing leftist agenda that's too dangerous for our country. We get to advise and consent on all nominees. That's Justice nominees, that's cabinet members, a lot of people that go into an administration have to come through the Senate to get confirmed. So we can control and get some of the more radical people out of the government. That's why you have checks and balances. It's worked in our country extremely well for 230 years. Democrats now just believe that America is wrong. Obama apologized for America all during his administration. So what is at stake here is if they get these two seats they will perpetrate the agenda and load up the cabinet with very liberal people who have no idea how this economy works and want to perpetrate their own agenda and then the courts will be absolutely decimated. They will stack the courts and not just the Supreme Court but the appellate courts and federal judges and they want to increase the number of seats until they get the balance that they want. We won't ever get that back.

In fact, he credited al-Qaeda with defeating Qaddafi, who bin Laden described as a truly vile hallucinating individual who troubles us in front of the world. As it turned out, bin Laden was right about post-Qaddafi Libya presenting great opportunities for jihad, thanks to Obama foreign policy, but it would be ISIS that exploited those opportunities, not their progenitors in al-Qaeda.

The president ought to be able to keep potential terrorists from coming into our country, but now with this outbreak of coronavirus, the president also needs to have all the tools available to limit, people coming in from countries with a high propensity of coronavirus. You wouldn't want legislation that would make it more difficult. Hopefully, that bill gets pulled this week, but in the meantime, we need to continue to do all that we can to ensure that the administration has the tools they need, and we're working together to inform the public, of the various precautions that they can take as we're trying to find a vaccine.

He also wants to see businesses to be able to interest expense.

A local community organization, the Grenfell Action Group, had warned about fire dangers at the building since 2013. In a series of blog posts, the group raised concerns about testing and maintenance of fire-fighting equipment and blocked emergency access to the site.
The Polish government began logging in May last year, saying it was clearing dead trees to prevent damage caused by the spruce bark beetle, and insisting the policy was entirely legal.
I am proud of what we've accomplished — not just in the national security, foreign policy space, which I've worked with, but the things that we've done with families, the pro-life work that we have done. These are things that will truly be historic. I think history will remember us very well for these things when the books are written, he said in remarks.
I've been working to make sure that we will have a process that we can take a vote on whether or not we need additional information, and yes, that would include witnesses, Murkowski told reporters.
There is a problem with the Vatican's communication, he said. Instead of saying 'we are making a deal,' snippets come out saying that all bishops will be recognized. Naturally this creates difficulties for the Chinese Church because everyone wants to know whether all the bishops, including the illicit (Chinese government appointed) ones, are included in the deal and if those not recognized by the government are included, meaning all the underground bishops.
Congress created the National Security Council to assist presidents in managing the complexities of this expansion of the federal government. The 1947 law establishing the NSC, which originally consisted of the president, vice president, and the secretaries of state and defense, stated: 'The function of the Council shall be to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security.' The word 'advise' is fundamentally important. While the statutory members of the NSC, in some cases, run departments that execute foreign policy, the NSC staff at the White House was intended to coordinate policy rather than run it. My job as the national security adviser is to distill and present to the president the views and options that come from the various departments and agencies. The NSC then ensures that those agencies actually execute the president's decisions. This is the 'honest broker' model of the national security adviser, best personified by Brent Scowcroft, who held the post during both the Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush administrations. During the Obama administration, the NSC ballooned to well over 200 policy staffers. By comparison, a mere 12 NSC policy staffers helped President John F. Kennedy deal with the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. As President Jimmy Carter handled multiple crises in the late 1970s, the NSC staff totaled just 35 professionals. During the first term of the George W. Bush administration, with two major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underway, the policy staff was about 100 people.
He blamed the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that make dams more difficult, and more expensive, to build. Until we change the environmental laws, construction is cost prohibitive, he told me.
She concluded, There were all sorts of folks that put him over the edge. That were not excited or enthusiastic about Donald Trump building the wall and being mean, frankly, and saying absurd things on Twitter and calling people names.

We have to protect all of our people, and it works all the way through the system, the senator vowed. One of the things we have to think about as a nation—we have to stop putting trans women who are incarcerated into prisons with men where they are at risk. It is our responsibility.
It says Russia has managed to heighten its role in solving global problems and international conflicts. That heightened role has caused a reaction by the West, it says. The strengthening of Russia happens against the background of new threats to the national security, which has complex and interrelated nature, the document says. Conducting an independent policy, both international and domestic has caused counteraction from the USA and its allies, which are striving to retain their dominance in global affairs. That in turn is likely to lead to political, economical, military and informational pressure on Russia, the document says.
Thanks to 9/11 and the terrible wars that followed, thanks to Obama's failed economic policies in the wake of the Great Recession, this country has not enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity in nearly 20 years.
The emails also suggest that Strzok had information on an intelligence briefing for then-candidate Trump that may have been a ruse to spy on Trump.

It's not the liberals who started these programs, and in fact, a lot of these programs have been cut back, he asserted. For example, housing assistance to the poor and lower middle class, that's about a fourth of our housing assistance budget in the federal government. The other three-fourths is involved with giving interest deductions to the upper middle class and the rich on their mortgages. That's the biggest housing subsidy we do. That's just not fair.

One of the offshoots of that is when it came to globalization, which is another sign of progress in the world — or it would seem to be — they basically didn't pay any attention to all the people who were the victims of globalization.

In Havana, the President will meet with Cuban entrepreneurs, or cuentapropistas, to hear their experiences. The event will include American entrepreneurs who will share their own experiences with their Cuban counterparts and look for opportunities to build long-term relationships.
The U.S. has the largest and wealthiest middle class in the history of the world.

Lumping the blame for the mass migration at the feet of EU member states is likely to cause consternation – especially from Eurosceptic governments like those in Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia – though those countries – which have been stricter on immigration and related crime, are the ones who have suffered less from migrant crime in the past few weeks.

In the U.S., the biggest worry is access to that health care. If fear of the cost of health care is a deterrent, that could create a bad situation where people stay at home, potentially infecting others, she said.
Studies show: Black Americans are NOT hurt by illegal immigration.
The poll, which surveyed 3,500 likely voters across geographic regions, ethnicity, sex, and political affiliation, showed how unpopular such policies are in America, despite activist and media attempts to normalize them. Even liberal voters, according to the poll, disapprove of efforts to undermine biological sex with gender ideology. Overall, results found 66.93 percent of those polled say they strongly disagree with gender identity policies, including a majority of liberal voters.

The BBC's Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, remarked, Russian TV may be trumpeting it as Operation Return with live coverage of bombers leaving Syria and emotional homecomings for the Russian pilots. But Moscow is not pulling out all its forces.
If HTS acts as a spoiler to the [Russia-Turkey] agreement on the ground, this will probably lead to one of two scenarios: either Turkey and the NLF launch military action against HTS, or Russia will seize the opportunity with the support of the [Assad] regime and its allies to enter Idlib, Nawar Oliver, an analyst for the Turkey-based Omran Center predicted in October, according to Al Jazeera.
I happen to think that things like NAFTA are good if, and only if, you take care of the victims of NAFTA, he said.

This morning a White House official referred to #Coronavirus as the Kung-Flu to my face. Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back. — Weijia Jiang (@weijia) March 17, 2020
Populist movements against ruling elites have been the big political story of the past five years. But at the very moment when elites appear to be winning political battles again, a new threat to their power emerges — this time aimed at Wall Street rather than Washington.
… directly flows from the requirement to not deny equal professional services or be parties to a plan to discriminate. Specifically, bias against protected classes revealed through the public posting of hate speech could result in REALTORS® not taking clients from certain protected classes or not treating them equally, which would lead to violations of the Fair Housing Act due to overt discrimination or disparate impact.
Page replies, Yup, I knew the same. Just hadn't shared yet.
This is somebody who — upon whose interview could I begin a conversation about the policy of the war on drugs. That was my simple idea, Penn said. 'We're going to put all our focus — forget about blame — we're going to put all our focus, all our energy, all our billions of dollars on the 'bad guy,' and what happens? You get another death the next day the same way.
U.S. military troops have also fallen victim to fatal opiate overdoses while serving in Afghanistan. However, since the opioid problem reached historic proportions, the Pentagon has refused to release new figures among American forces in Afghanistan, prompting Judicial Watch to sue the government for access to the data beyond 2012.
Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.
California Democrats are reportedly pushing to give full healthcare benefits to illegal immigrant adults, which would mean that the Golden State not only may have to raise taxes but will also be a magnet for even more illegal immigrants.
Breitbart News reported today that police are bracing themselves for a possible protest at Twitter HQ following the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account last week. A San Francisco Police Department spokesman stated that the department is aware of a possible demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street.

North Korean rocket and nuclear tests are seen as crucial steps toward the North's ultimate goal of a nuclear armed long-range missile arsenal. North Korea under leader Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse Kim's government.

The poll also showed there was a plurality of support from veterans, military families, and the general population for a more diplomatic versus a military approach to Iran. That could be good news for the Biden administration, which wants to reduce tensions with Iran.
Already, the big business lobby and corporate interests are looking for a return to Washington, D.C.'s free trade consensus that reigned for about three decades before Trump's election on a fierce economic nationalist agenda.
The chart below shows how fund flows have been negative for five quarters now, and that even when they have been positive, they are dwarfed by corporate purchases. The largest buyers of stocks have been and continue to be corporations. This is what has been fueling the Fed's wealth effect manipulations. This begs the question: What would happen if this buyback bonanza significantly slowed or stopped?

Of course, the article notes that there is no guarantee that all these people died after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus. It notes that, of the 127 remains You Hu received on February 3 (116 were cremated that day), eight were confirmed coronavirus patients and 48 were suspected carriers. The newspaper also identified another funeral home that took in 22 sets of remains and three were confirmed coronavirus cases.

So now to the present day. As we have seen, Secretary Pompeo is currently traveling the Middle East, seeking to rally our allies against Iran. As Pompeo declared in Cairo on January 10, in the showcasing policy speech of his Middle East trip, We ask every peace-loving nation of the Middle East to shoulder new responsibilities for defeating Islamist extremism wherever we find it. And in sharp contrast to the liberal apologetics of Obama and others, Pompeo added, The age of self-inflicted American shame is over.

All of the team at Cirque le Soir are really upset by the suggestion that there was anything malicious in our turning away of Mark Ingram and his friends from the club on Monday 27th February. We proudly celebrate diversity, not only as part of our shows, but as part of who we are. We would not dismiss anyone as too urban and we would not turn anyone away on the basis of their ethnicity, sexuality or any other characteristic – other than those expressed in our door policy – as an exclusive members club, we cannot guarantee entry to anyone and full discretion always lies with the door, we particularly discourage casual dress code, intoxicated customers and male heavy entourages. Discretion lies with our door staff and while we sympathise with Mark and his friends we fully support our employees' right to challenge groups that do not adhere to our door policy. Admitting an all-male group goes against our policy and is clearly stated on Facebook and on all reservation confirmation emails.
Countries such as China, Iran and Russia have spent years and a great deal of money developing integrated systems of surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, submarines, surface ships and aircraft whose purpose is to prevent US aircraft carriers from having freedom of movement, whether in the Persian Gulf, the eastern Mediterranean, or the South China Sea.

He added that this reduction was in the works long before NSC staffers Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his twin brother were removed earlier this month. Vindman testified in the House impeachment inquiry that he reported the president's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president to the NSC general counsel, and likely reported his concerns to the whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment effort.

I will introduce an immigration bill immediately and have it sent to the appropriate committees to begin movement, Biden said. I will in fact countermand executive orders that the president has in fact initiated that are contrary to what I think is either his authority and/or even if it's his authority, contrary to the interests of the United States on environmental issues and a range of other things.

The government's failure to enforce immigration laws for many years has created a large population of 10 million to 20 million migrants, who are mixed in the population of roughly 315 million Americans. The resulting flooded labor market keeps many of these illegal or legal migrants — and many Americans — in low-wage careers, in crowded apartments, and in service sector jobs such as restaurants.

Friday's protest was hardly the first incident of public unrest over vaccines. A smaller and less physical group of parents dared to protest in Beijing over the summer, demanding justice for the victims of corruption and incompetence in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. A series of scandalous revelations rocked China over the past year, with each new outrage erupting as soon as the previous one began to subside. This reinforced the public sense of distrust in both medical companies and government regulators, an attitude most unhelpful to Communist Party leader Xi Jinping's effort to rebrand China as a high-tech powerhouse and triumph of centralized economic policy.
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany's finance minister is denouncing trade protectionism ahead of a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and a summit where global finance officials are expected to tussle over how strongly to support free trade.

Democracy Alliance highlighted anti-Trump organizations to donors in a resistance map suggesting which activist groups would be opportune for funding. Already, Indivisible received funds from donors and coalitions associated with Democracy Alliance financiers, the New York Times reported.
For example, DHS data posted December 31 shows that 80,711 Central American family migrants arrived at the border in 2016. By March 2020, just 3,578 (3.3 percent) had been sent home, 3,520 (4.1 percent) were allowed to stay, and 45,768 were still being processed.
A stronger display of military force is said to be part of the policy mix, although probably not direct military action. Interestingly, Reuters suggests expanded cyber warfare and covert action aimed at undermining North Korea's leadership could be an element of the plan.
But what he leaves out of this glowing self-praise is perhaps most important: He failed to repeal Obamacare, he failed to secure the border or do any big picture immigration deal, in large part because his open borders views were out of line with the rest of the conference, he failed to cut spending, he failed to shrink the deficit, he failed to bring the national debt under control, and he failed to do major welfare or entitlement reforms–things he also spent years pitching.
Students Not Suspects slams the chilling effect Prevent could have on radical Islamic preachers' freedom to speak on campus, while at the same the union's 'No Platform' policy barring speakers with racist and fascist views is routinely used to block anyone with socially-conservative views, and even feminists who believe that male-bodied individuals who identify as transgender are not female.
On Tuesday, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Professor Neil Mortensen, said that the NHS will likely be forced to delay possibly life-saving cancer operations, amidst the spike in Chinese virus cases.
Paul said Abrams was untrustworthy due to his role in the Iran-Contra scandal: His conviction for deceiving Congress over secret arms deals, better known as the Iran-Contra scandal, show that his neocon agenda trumps his fidelity to the rule of law. The Constitution directs Congress to approve or disapprove of war. It would be a mistake to appoint anyone to the State Department who was previously convicted for defying Congressional authority.
Alongside the ruined structure, new channels appeared in the earthen emergency overflow spillway, strewn with rip rack rock that had been dropped by helicopter to keep the hillside from collapsing, to save the cities downstream.

We are making significant investments to unite the country and address critical issues that will help people improve their lives, Koch spokesman James Davis told TIME. This starts with a major new initiative to fight poverty in America, and following on the success of the First Step Act in December continuing to build broad-based policy coalitions on issues from education reform to immigration. These will include a significant investment to support policy champions in Senate, House and state races. This is where we can make the biggest difference for millions of Americans. [Emphasis added]
Our position is no, the European Union can only be strong, and Europe as such can only be strong again, if the member-states are themselves strong, and in order to be strong you need to stick to heritage and you need to be proud of your roots, he said.
Breitbart London has previously reported on the nature of Salafism, which contains many radical preachers who see violence as legitimate in pursuance of its aims and which provides the intellectual basis for the Islamic State. A regional director of Germany's constitutional police said of the faith in 2017 that every jihadist terrorist we've seen in Europe in recent years came from the Salafist scene.
Nationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.
For example, the abuse of thousands of predominantly white, working-class girls in towns and cities across the United Kingdom by predominantly Pakistani Muslim abusers was ignored by police, social workers, and other figures of authority — who feared being labelled racist — for years.

As a result, we have terminated stores affiliated with President Trump.
In a sign that hostilities continue to simmer, Qatar protested to the UN Security Council last month that Bahraini fighter jets violated Qatari airspace in early December. Bahrain, meanwhile, has accused the Qatari coast guard of arbitrarily detaining dozens of Bahraini fishing vessels. Ahmed Hafez, the spokesman for Egypt's Foreign Ministry, said last week that Cairo supports efforts to reach a resolution that respects non-interference in internal affairs in an apparent reference to Qatar's backing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The conflict in Libya is also a contentious issue, with Egypt and the UAE supporting militias fighting a Tripoli-based bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar.
Now, how ridiculous–we are the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits? It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous–and it has to end, Trump said at the time of ending birthright citizenship.
The White House and Pompeo have also noted that, while the United States was ready for the meeting, North Korea failed to make adequate preparations for the unprecedented event.
North Korea's latest propaganda video is filled with rocket launchers, jet fighters, military parades, and the money shot of a U.S. aircraft carrier photoshopped to be on fire.

Rather than nip the problem in the bud, China has behaved exactly as you would expect a secretive, totalitarian regime to behave: lying about the virility and morbidity of the infection; allowing as many as 5 million people to leave Wuhan before any quarantine was able to take effect; lobbying the World Health Organisation not to declare it a global emergency.
That is why we will take advantage of leaving the EU by changing the Dublin regulations on returns and we will address the rigidities in our laws that makes this country, I'm afraid, a target and a magnet for those who would exploit vulnerable people in this way, Mr Johnson concluded.
CASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law-abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer.
Over the past 15 years, EU migration has helped to turn around the long term decline in Scotland's population and mitigate the impact of an ageing society. Over the next 25 years, our own projected birth rate will not be sufficient to grow our population.
Paul Heald, a professor from the University of Illinois, was only one out of more than a dozen who had accepted money from Google, according to the report published in the Wall Street Journal. It is unclear at this time whether the payments had any tangible effect on any of the academic's results. One potential reason for the funding would be to help sway court decisions in Google's favor — with expert analysis to back them up, Google could perhaps try to wriggle its way out of costly legal battles and fines, such as the recent record $2.7 billion fine handed down by the European Union in an anti-trust case.
The DOJ's Inspector General report on Crossfire Hurricane describes the FBI's use of a national security briefing to the Trump campaign in August 2016 to try to further its investigation by planting an agent in the room:
Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent — 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.
As Bill McGurn argues in the Wall Street Journal Monday, in his day, Dr. Ehrlich's assertion about the limited 'carrying capacity' of the Earth was settled science. Never mind that it is rooted in an absurdity: that when a calf is born a country's wealth rises, but when a baby is born it goes down.
Hundreds of Israelis have self-quarantined over fears they had been exposed to the virus overseas or because they were in contact with South Korean pilgrims who were visiting Israel and who tested positive after returning home.

She knew that she was not elected, Rosebush said. She was there in a supportive role and she used her own bully pulpit to draw attention and put a spotlight on things she cared about.
I think he's clearly revealed himself to be a part of the Schumer team, the liberal team, that would create a majority in the Senate, that would make every committee chairman a Democrat—some of them radical Democrats—and all of which is contrary to the values of Alabama, Sessions said.

Nobody in your business has spent 15 minutes telling us about what Hunter Biden did, and is it good foreign policy? He's frustrated because of what he believes is a double standard, Graham said. I am telling you now, that I am going to look at this if nobody does, and that doesn't make me a Russian agent.
We are grateful for the president's steadfast commitment to border security, the single most important issue plaguing our country. Rather than subsidizing the federal government, which has betrayed the American people by obstructing President Donald Trump's agenda, 'We Build the Wall' is taking the president's signature campaign promise into our own hands. I personally will not take a penny of compensation from these donations incurred in the furtherance of this mission.
Next, Pelosi flipped Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) with a promise to focus on his priorities of healthcare and infrastructure–things Pelosi already planned to do anyway.

The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
On January 4, for example, Pelosi said that a wall is an immorality — it builds walls in peoples' minds about who should come here.
A New York Times report also claimed that Mayer had denied repeated requests for additional investment in Yahoo's cybersecurity, with the security team allegedly derisively referred to as paranoids inside the company.
Describing the arrival of the Europeans as a 'settlement' is a view of Australian history from the perspective of England rather than Australia, the information pack declared.
D'Souza and Ayers will debate the topic, What's So Exceptional About America?
They're taking advantage of COVID to restrict people's ability to meet, some of which is, of course, understandable. But we have cases, documented cases, where they're arresting people who are attending Zoom church, where they're monitoring church online, Curry explained. So China is cracking down. It's not related to COVID, but they are certainly using COVID as a justification to intensify the persecution.
Obama likely would have had a further Republican in his first term-term cabinet if his initial choice for commerce secretary, former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), had not withdrawn before the confirmation process had begun.

I don't want to disseminate the rumors: The government is not leaving, the government is planning to continue working, we're not planning any resignations, he said. There are so many provocations, manipulations around the government.
But California faces acute problems with homelessness. As Breitbart News reported last month, the state's 16.4% increase in homelessness is entirely responsible for the nation's overall 2.7% increase, according to federal statistics.
Nevertheless, this seems less the result of a harassment campaign than the most obvious result of Alison Rapp being accountable for decisions in her own life, and Nintendo's right to make decisions for their business.
The meeting also included Los Angeles, California Mayor Eric Garcetti, who oversees a sanctuary city policy that frees back into the community hundreds of criminal illegal aliens every week from local jails.
In observance of World Water Day on Tuesday, the White House convened what was billed as a first-of-its-kind summit on water. The meeting, which the Fresno Bee reports was attended by California Democrats including Rep. Jerry McNerney and Rep. Jared Huffman, focused on water conservation — but did not address the fact that the federal government prioritizes the endangered delta smelt fish over the needs of farmers, often flushing out hundreds of thousands of acre-feet to sea.
Carah added that although marijuana cultivation impact on local water sources has been studied on the South Fork of the Eel River in Mendocino and Humboldt counties, to my knowledge, nobody has mapped cannabis cultivation at the state or regional scale yet.
To me this should, if sold right, be an easier sell than healthcare because a lot of people understand this, said Williams, adding it could be made retroactive for the 2017 tax year.
He added, And increasingly, we are hearing from Republicans, Democrats, journalists, citizens, on the basis of real hard information why it may be that a consensus is developing that Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States, because of his actions in obstructing justice because of what we just saw in Syria, because of his ignorance on foreign policy, because of his putting his self-interest and that of his family ahead of the national interest, but above all the lying.
We cannot turn back the clock and reverse globalization… but we can shape it, he told a forum hosted by the Institute of International Finance.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf wants to fund a $32 million budget deficit by grabbing millions in revenue from November's voter-approved soda tax initiative — and critics are accusing her of a bait-and-switch.

In both cases, they defended the principles of meritocracy, individual rights, and equality under the law—and roundly defeated a super-coalition of the states' progressive politicians, activists, universities, media, and corporations, Rufo noted, observing the leftwing mantra of systemic racism and white supremacy has made Asian-Americans an inconvenient minority.
The Times published a list of suggestions for Beijing moving forward to help contain growing international awareness of the Communist Party's belligerence towards Taipei in light of Tsai's commanding victory. Among the suggestions was a call to encourage Tsai to ease her cross-Straits policies and not to further antagonize the Chinese mainland [the land legally within Chinese borders that does not include Beijing's illegally claimed territories].
Listen to the full interview below:
Soon after, Iraq invaded Iran and began the two countries long, bloody eight-year war. The fighting killed more than 1 million people and saw Iran send waves of lightly armed troops into minefields and the fire of Iraqi forces, including teenage soldiers. Solemani's unit and others came under attack by Iraqi chemical weapons as well.

With the fall of Theresa May in June 2019, Tory MPs had at last turned to the Brexiteer king over the water, Boris Johnson, to deliver them from electoral annihilation at the hands of Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.
The Tribunal noted that in 2017, there were only 5,146 eligible registered donors, representing an incomprehensible gap between the number of registered operations and the true number, meaning that it is likely the gap was filled by forced organ transplants.
And then there is the Islamic State, which grabbed a good $700 million worth of fully operational Hellfire missiles when it captured the Iraqi city of Mosul. Remember that ISIS doesn't have much in the way of air power to actually fire said missiles, so we can only assume that the cash-hungry organization at least tried to sell them off, Templeton writes.
In a post celebrating the passage of the bill, FIRE Executive Director Robert Shibley said:
Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Worse, the H-1B system allows U.S. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing U.S. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.
The dollar was weaker prior to the Fed's announcement but following the release of the soft economic data. Yields on long-term Treasuries, which are thought to reflect investor's expectations of the path of future short-term rates, fell. Falling long-term yields indicate that investors are lowering their expectations for future short-term rates. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was down 10 basis points to 2.11 percent earlier Wednesday.
….Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria – natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019
Ed Farm says the Propel Center is a physical and virtual campus imagined and designed … to provide Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with shared services to support their work of preparing leaders who improve our word [sic].
The snowflake idea is true, but incomplete. The snowflake idea addresses that these students have helicopter parents who didn't want to see them get hurt in any way, who coddled them, and didn't get them used to the hard knocks of life. I think there's some real truth in that. So – when they hear someone who disagrees with them – they sort of want to shrivel up and die, which makes them want to silence people. But, I think that this psychological explanation underplays the importance of ideology in all this. If you look at what's happened to the university over the last few decades, they've really been taken over by the studies programs – African-American studies, Latino studies, women's studies, environmental studies, gender studies – and sometimes they literally have studies that teach activism. These studies programs are generally built around political assumptions, and their classes are teaching leftist politics.
The Times of Israel reports: Hamas co-founder Mahmoud al-Zahar clarified Wednesday that his terror group's new political program, which some interpreted as accepting the idea of a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines, would not preclude Hamas from seeking to liberate all of historic Palestine, including Israel.
That's right. Each and every American, from the outspoken Christian to the dyed-in-the-wool atheist, has a religion, whether they use the term or not. Something or somebody sits at the center of the lives of everyone, shaping their identities, organizing their lives, and guiding their views of right and wrong. That something or someone functions as the god of that person's life. In other words, every human being ascribes ultimate worth to something or someone – to some person, ideal or ideology. If it is not God, it may be sex, money or power. Or anything else. Fill in the blank.
Friends of the Eel River Conservation Director Scott Greacen at a California Water Policy Conference at the University of California Davis in March blamed the worst marijuana cultivation water resource damage on unlicensed so-called trespass grows on U.S. National Forest lands that legalization has failed to stop: They are the most damaging per unit and those are the kind we need to get rid of.
Because IS is a terrorist group, the Assad regime attributed more importance to Saudi and U.S.-backed opposition groups, which dragged Washington into the Syrian quagmire, from which it only now tries to be extracted, thanks to Russia.
Nasrallah spoke shortly before the Iraqi parliament voted in favor of a bill to expel the U.S. military from Iraq by canceling the military agreement between the two countries. More than 5,000 U.S. soldiers are in Iraq, based on an invitation by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help fight the Islamic State group.
Obama's skepticism is perhaps understandable. On the campaign trail in 2012, Obama pledged to create 1 million manufacturing jobs in his second term. Instead, the U.S. economy added only 549,000 jobs in manufacturing over the following four years. In his final year in office, manufacturing employment actually contracted. For an administration staffed by people who regarded themselves as the smartest economics minds on the scene, the failure to revive manufacturing jobs likely made it seem like an impossible task.
The Philippines' FDA has yet to approve any coronavirus vaccines for the country's citizens and has not yet set a timeline for when Filipinos will receive the injection.

This incident highlights the need for the League to, at minimum, require head and assistant coaches, as well as franchise scouts, to complete an enhanced training on the League's non-discrimination policy, Schneiderman maintained about the Apple questioning, including sexual orientation non-discrimination, and their responsibilities to abide by and enforce the policy.
President-elect Joe Biden has promised to reenter the nuclear deal, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018, after entering office later this month.
Sessions also took the opportunity to continue his campaign against the policies of sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. These so-called 'sanctuary' policies force police to release criminal aliens back into the community — no matter what their crimes they may have committed in those jurisdictions, he said. And we're not going – and cannot – continue giving federal grants to cities that actively undermine the safety of federal law officers and intentionally frustrate our efforts to reduce crime in America.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters:
Cutoff scores have been manipulated to produce politically desirable results in many jurisdictions, Bob Schaeffer, public education director for the national watchdog FairTest, told the Post.
I would be negligent, as a professor who is running a class about the human condition and the assumptions we make about being 'human,' if I did not also raise this issue of gendered language and ask my students to respect the need for gender-neutral language, Scott wrote in an email to the student about her grade. The words we use matter very much, or else teachers would not be making an issue of this at all, and the MLA would not be making recommendations for gender-neutral language at the national level.
As Kirkpatrick wrote, It is this belief which induces the Carter administration to participate actively in the toppling of non-Communist autocracies while remaining passive in the face of Communist expansion.
The 74,000 migrants who arrived in December you could argue are crisis-level numbers, but the reason why it doesn't feel like a crisis is because we have [President Donald Trump's] authority, statutes, and policies to deal with the numbers, he said.
Douglas Melton, co-chair of the implementation committee, claimed that the policy was proposed to enact social change at Harvard.
Democrats and the media both share the conviction that President Trump is illegitimate, and therefore not entitled to address the nation without being fact-checked. Their hubris led them into a political trap that will shape the outcome of this debate.
Just days after satellite imagery showed that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is rapidly militarizing the South China Sea by deploying advanced surface-to-air missile systems, new imagery shows that China appears to be building a an advanced radar system potentially giving China control of the entire South China Sea.

Biden, likewise, has tapped other Democrat elected officials with little direct policy experience for top cabinet posts. One of the most notable of such appointments has been California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human services. Becerra, a former long serving congressman and ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has raised concerns from many over his lack of expertise on health-related topics.
This move by the Times is more dangerous because it is more difficult to criticize. It is easy to spot apologetics for terrorism. It is harder, and more controversial, to call the Times out for manipulating American Jews in the service of left-wing antisemites.
Dear Madam Speaker: United States Armed Forces personnel have deployed to Libreville, Gabon, to be in position to support the security of United States citizens, personnel, and diplomatic facilities in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. This deployment of approximately 80 personnel is in response to the possibility that violent demonstrations may occur in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in reaction to the December 30, 2018, elections there. The first of these personnel arrived in Gabon on January 2, 2019, with appropriate combat equipment and supported by military aircraft. Additional forces may deploy to Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the Republic of the Congo, if necessary for these purposes. These deployed personnel will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes such that their presence is no longer needed. This action was taken consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct United States foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions.

However, the beneficial reform may be trashed before it reshapes the huge H-1B graduate outsourcing program because it faces fierce opposition from Democrat-allied immigration lawyers, as well as many of President-elect Joe Biden's allies in the Fortune 500, on Wall Street, and in the university sector.

Marawi City police supplied an additional detail to the ISIS looting spree: the occupation began shortly before the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, so the largely Muslim residents of the city had more money on hand than they usually would because gifts of money are a local Ramadan tradition.

There are other concerns in Europe over Brussels' handling of the vaccine distribution, with senior Czech conservative MEP Jan Zahradil demanding transparency on distribution across the bloc and price, following rumours and contradictory speculation.
Every year, the United States spends $67.5 billion to ensure the worldwide free flow of oil. Often produced in unstable parts of the world and shipped through insecure chokepoints, the U.S. military works to make sure crude oil from other countries makes it safely onto the global market. Yet while this global oil market benefits some nations, its volatility threatens the American economy and undermines U.S. national security.

Companies also crimp and slow technological domestic competition by hiring visa workers instead of American graduates. In the early 2000s, the federal government broke up an illegal no-poaching cartel by tech companies who were trying to prevent their American workers from changing jobs and so sharing their expertise with rival companies. This strategy is legal if the workforce consists of H-1B workers who cannot change jobs without their managers' permission.

The chaos has become the immigration system because Congress has proven unable to restore order, said Miano. Congress is involved in so many things now; it can't deal with the things that it is supposed to do … Each time Congress touches immigration now, they make things worse. What we have done is set up a system of incentives for people to come here illegally.
This is patently, painfully untrue, and in any event, it is not ISIS cleansing Christian communities from Baghdad: it is Shiite militias linked to Iran, which the Obama Administration just handed billions of dollars to finance its operations across the Middle East. Those militias are also America's nominal allies against the Islamic State, and will be crucial to the upcoming battle for Mosul, even though militia leaders make little pretense of being happy to fight alongside the American troops they were murdering just a few years ago.
The immigration process is going to be about shortening the time by creating more and greater efficiencies, allowing people who have Temporary Protected Status — and in particular dreamers and TPS holders — to automatically get green cards.

He continued, Well, we have both a covert counter-terrorism operation in Turkey to try to — there is an active plot underway I should say, this is imminent threat. We had six operatives taken into custody. ISIS operatives from the caliphate who basically have been talking about this imminent threat and plotting it. So right now in Turkey what is underway is an attempt to stop this plot. This gives you insight into what the president is talking about—the sort of sinister nature of ISIS and terrorists and Taliban—they would go after little children and kill them in the name of their religion. I think it really shows you what we're at war with right now. And why we need to win this war.

And they're going to make the necessary adjustments that we need to protect our country.

Asylum applications in the UK have hit an all-time high, sailing past 5,000 in the month of October alone – more than double the number arriving per month at the beginning of 2015. Critics have called the figure another nail in the coffin of the government's migration targets.

In the February audit prepared for Congress, the IG points out:
When you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule.
He continued, The CFPB's concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable, unchecked director not only departs from settled historical practice, but also poses a far greater risk of arbitrary decision-making and abuse of power, and a far greater threat to individual liberty, than does a multi-member independent agency.
The NRA-ILA's Chris Cox was allowed to respond with his own letter, which WaPo published on June 5. However, WaPo editors deleted this line: If the editorial board had accepted NRA's invitation to a suppressor shoot last week, they would have heard for themselves that the Hearing Protection Act is exactly what its title claims: An act that protects hearing.
Georgetown University students who recently held a community dialogue event on a new proposal to arm campus police told their white peers that they weren't permitted to attend.

That's what political appointees and presidential appointees are designed to do, to pierce through that bureaucratic inertia and get to the truth that the Iranians are violating it on the ballistic missile side, they've violated it on the heavy water side, they've violated it on the enriched uranium limits – and that's just what's been reported publicly, he noted.

Iranian media meanwhile focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash, with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign.
One Islamic-themed advocacy group, Muslim Advocates, said the updated list expands the so-called Muslim Ban:
On Fleur-de-Lis' new website, the organization claims that they will not deny membership to any student interested in joining on the basis of gender. Being a gender-neutral club means that we will never deny membership to our organization to anyone on the basis of gender, the organization's website reads. Our mission is to create a safe, empowering space for female-identifying individuals on campus.

We're going to work purposely diligently and responsibly to roll back Trump's [migration] restrictions starting on day one. We will institute humane and orderly responses. That means rebuilding the [legal] capacity we need to safely and quickly process asylum seekers without creating near term crisis in the midst of this deadly pandemic.
Joe Biden should be very careful what he's asking for because, you know, we can have a situation where, if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people – right the day after he would be elected – would be saying, 'Well, we're going to impeach him,' Ernst said.
This might suit Johnson and his green crony capitalist chums in the Westminster bubble, but as Paul Homewood notes, metropolitan greenies will largely insulated from the disastrous effects of their eco-fascist policies in the country at large.

Companies use various visa worker programs to keep roughly 1.5 million non-immigrant foreign graduates in the United States. Many of those foreign workers are employed by small contracting firms to fill a series of short-term contracts, so minimizing the major companies' payroll costs.
American cites a lack of machinery as the reason for the discontinuation of service. According to Pro Football Talk, the charter suspension issue, …extends beyond American Airlines. Delta is believed to be doing the same thing, and United could be next.

In classes with female students, we might not dare speak out, he said. When it's just boys, we feel much freer.
With the president's reelection reckoning just ten months away, barring some unforeseen turn of events, Trump will have an easy time asking Americans the classic reelection question: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? And if former Vice President Joe Biden is the 2020 Democrat nominee, that question will help to clarify an even starker choice. After all, it is the failed Obama-Biden administration Trump has improved upon.
But as with almost everything about Britain, Brexit will remain the driver.
To single out redlining is obscene and illogical. The idea that a bunch of inner-city homes, with mortgages worth about half the size of suburban homes, could tank the entire American economy is outright stupid.
The solution to all of this is to stop the manipulation of interest rates and begin the painful reversal by beginning to live within ones means. Stagnation is the best we can hope for going forward. The longer this game of manipulating interest rates go on, the larger the future problems we will have to face. No one likes pain. No one likes change. Nevertheless, those days of whistling past the graveyard have passed. If we act now, the hope of living through this, rather than it crumbling all around us, increases exponentially. We must face reality and own up to our obligations by paying our debts. We must accept responsibility for our misguided collective mindset of choosing to have our cake and eat it too—the philosophy that has led us to this point and that we can no longer afford to indulge.
Such actions appear to point toward an increase in settlement activity and demonstrate that Israel is continuing to push forward in the consolidation of its control of the West Bank, Ban said in a statement.
I'm pleased the Fifth Circuit recognized that Senate Bill 4 is lawful, constitutional and protects the safety of law enforcement officers and all Texans, Paxton said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. Enforcing immigration law prevents the release of individuals from custody who have been charged with serious crimes. Dangerous criminals shouldn't be allowed back into our communities to possibly commit more crimes.

Our legal immigration system has failed for years to keep up with the demand of our economy, said Ali Noorani, the president of the National Immigration Forum.Since there are very few legal pathways for people to enter the country, [migrants] make a decision to overstay a visa, to enter without inspection and hence, we're faced with this population of unauthorized immigrants.

Over the intervening years camps a cycle has emerged of camps springing up only to be demolished by the authorities. But in the last year, with migration across the continent at an all-time high, the Jungle has grown out of all proportion and is now home to a reported 7,000 migrants – local groups put the figure much higher.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
LONDON (AP) — Virgin Trains will once again sell the Daily Mail newspaper after complaints about its decision to stop offering passengers the popular tabloid.

And it's good for national politics if you want people to feel more engaged in the healthy part of the economy and go out and vote to keep it that way. If you look the other side of your question: 'Are decreasing wages good for national politics?' Hell, no. … If you have ten people for every job, you're not gonna have a drive [up] in wages. [But] if you have five people for every ten jobs, wages are going to go up.

As it happens, his rush home was exceptionally fortunate: His daughter Julia was also in a hurry, arriving at 9:53 a.m. on the day of his arrival, more than a week earlier than her January 9 due date. I'm glad baby Julia waited for me, he said. But Julia's mother was never in doubt. You know I had the feeling that he would make it because he really wanted to be here, next to us, she told WCVB.

The Pritzker family strongly supports Democratic politicians and advocacy groups. That policy is rational because the family's real-estate holdings rise as the federal government imports more immigrants who will need to rent or buy the families' apartments and real-estate.
Trump has been saying for several months that he does not think the Fed should be raising rates. Trump and Fed officials have often appeared to disagree on how fast the economy should be growing. Trump wants it to grow at 3 percent or more for several years. Many Fed officials think the economy has been growing faster than its long-term potential and see their role as creating conditions for a soft-landing in which growth falls back toward 2 percent.

In each instance, we might add, the Soviets were active on the other side—sometimes in a big way, sometimes in a lesser way. And just a few years earlier, Moscow had helped to engineer communist victories in Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola, and Mozambique. This was the reality of the Cold War—the Russians were playing for keeps.
Eliminating smokes and Cokes would put almost $200 more in the family food budget every month—just from cutting one person's wasteful habits. Double that for a couple.

The agreement will see the US slash import duties on Chinese goods worth billions of dollars, though levies remain in place on two-thirds of more than $500 billion of products.
Under the direction of President Trump, the Department of Defense remains focused on safeguarding our nation.

Controversy surrounds the BBC's plans to charge the country's 3.7 million over-75s, with exemptions for those on pension credit, the tax to watch television. MPs expressed concern last year that so-called outreach officers visiting the elderly to remind them that they have to pay the £157.50 a year could be frightening. The BBC had agreed to take on the responsibility to pay the fees from the government in 2015, but later claimed that it could not afford to do so.

Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.

Pelosi defended the president and his usurpation of power — when that president was a Democrat.
We need more legal immigration. … I don't want green cards just for computer engineers. If you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, I want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, I want them to have a chance to get a green card. I just don't want to be a country in the future of just computer engineers or high-tech people.
The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) President Thomas Glessner applauded the Supreme Court for acknowledging the health and safety concerns associated with abortion-inducing drugs:
The UNFPA whitewashed China's crimes for decades and continues to do so today, Smith added, noting that on its website UNFPA justifies its history in China, saying it was 'tasked by the Executive Committee' to help China and had to 'engage with China as a sovereign nation.'

Inflation has risen sharply from last June's 0.5 percent, largely because the country's vote to leave the European Union triggered a 15 percent drop in the value of the pound. Though a lower pound may help exporters sell their wares in international markets, all other things being equal, it makes imported goods such as food and energy more expensive.

The California Department of Water Resources notes: On average, California receives about 200 million acre-feet of water per year in the form of rain and snow. (It adds that the state rarely experiences an average year.) The state's reservoirs can capture about 42 million acre-feet of that — roughly one-fifth. The rest seeps into underground aquifers, or flows out to the sea.
In June, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone, Trump said he gave top Pentagon officials permission to carry out military strikes against Iran before changing his mind 10 minutes before the operation was to be carried out.
They were always prepared to help deliver that, not just on a substantive point of view, but also in a kind of metaphorical way. So when they went out in public, they had a patina, more than a patina, of glamour about them, and she kept that up after we lost the President. At the [Reagan] Library, for example, she would be always introduced as the former First Lady of the United States. They had ruffles and flourishes played. The whole setting at the library, I think, is a real tribute to their personal tastes, but also to the place of the Presidency in our lives, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or a Tea Party member or whatever. You go in there and you have a sense of the majesty of the office, if you will, and I mean that in a pragmatic sense, not in the royal sense.
One thing at Yahoo is likely to remain safe even if its users' info and emails weren't: CEO Marissa Mayer's enormous nearly $141 million merger payday, declared Fortune in its report.

The Missouri senator said Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak has proved that America needs to stop relying on China for our critical medical supply chains.
Public health officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently have limited resources for assessing supply chain vulnerabilities. The FDA recently asked Congress for more statutory authority to require that manufacturers notify the agency when they discover circumstances that may lead to shortages in essential medical devices. Giving the FDA more authority would allow the agency to ensure that they can take the necessary steps to mitigate potential shortages of life-saving drugs and medical devices.

If SCOTUS removes Blaine amendments from the arsenal of anti-school choice advocates, what will the unions and their cohorts have left? Claims that school choice drains public school funding have been disproven many times over, and parents who want to send their child to a better school—one that is not decided for them based on their ZIP code—can hardly be expected to care about financing the failed school they've chosen to abandon.

Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.

The article went on to state that Hubei province has eight municipal funeral homes. Similarly judging from their capacity for bodies and the amount of time the furnaces are running, the article adds another 135 patients a day to the tally from five of these. The other three, it concludes, burned 476 people a day. While less confident in these numbers since the journalists were unable to speak to their managers, these numbers reveal a rough estimate of nearly 1,000 people incinerated per day.

In Kopits' most recent report on illegal immigration, he notes that California's farm wages for Americans have increased because of slower illegal immigration throughout 2017 and increased enforcement, with the caveat, However, the more enforcement succeeds, the higher wages will go, and the greater the incentive to evade the ban. In California, for example, tougher border enforcement has raised farm wages to $16 / hour, up perhaps $5 / hour over earlier times.

I think the Democrats are terrified. I think it goes beyond just hostility to President Trump, Sessions said. I think they believe he's assembling a majority coalition in America that could govern this country for a decade or more. The loser will be the radical, socialist, secular left who are going to be left out in the cold. They are a minority in America. President Trump has shown he knows how to appeal across party lines and draw in the extra voters that you need to win elections. So they went after him personally because they feared him, and they feared they were losing the support of the American people. It's not just that they didn't like him personally but he and his agenda—that I've believed in for a long time—his agenda assembles a working majority of Americans. They support that. He will now have this impeachment behind and he'll be even more effective driving his policies, and the American people will continue to respond and the economy is growing at a very, very positive rate. I think we have a window of opportunity in the next year or two to make some changes that will be historic for America, to build on the good judges and to build on the tax reductions and regulation reductions and to defend people of faith and reduce our involvement in endless war and to protect our borders and protect American jobs and manufacturing. That can be a matter of great historic importance. I'm just really excited about it.

Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.

Just taking a brief glance at these requirements, it would seem that Hill is, at the very least, in violation of the prohibition against discussing issues that have no relation to sports.

Corporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.
There was a steady decrease in white voters in the seven congressional districts that are in and around Orange County between 1980 and 2017, according to census data. In 1980, whites made up 75 percent of the population in the district where Mr. Cisneros won. By 2017, that number dropped to 30 percent. [Emphasis added] The county's immigrant population grew five times as fast as the general population between 1980 and 2000, and while the pace of immigration has slowed, the Latino and Asian populations continues to increase, driven by the children of immigrant families born in the United States. [Emphasis added] … You went from a solid Republican county to one in which Republicans were just barely the majority, and it fell pretty quickly in the past two years, said Ms. Godwin. You have had continued demographic changes. This is a county that went from majority-white to having a majority that are Latino and Asian-American. So that has gone hand-in-hand — particularly with the rising Asian-American population — to voting more Democratic. [Emphasis added]

Recently, Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) declared it would be illegal for President Trump to declare a national emergency and send troops to the southern border, stating it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Congressman Lieu, who claims to have studied this issue as a military attorney, is incorrect, and to understand why, it's important to understand how both issues are connected.
The strategy that they're rolling out, the way they're scoring Christian behavior, attendance of church, not allowing young people under the age of 18 to go, monitoring online behavior, they're just very sophisticated how they're cracking down on religious practice, Curry said. I have to point out, it's not just against Christians. The Uyghur Muslims – religious and ethnic Muslims in the northwest of the country – have faced enormous hardships and human rights abuses at the hands of China.
5. Radical left-wing ballot initiatives defeated. Though Democrats managed to defeat President Trump at the polls, voters rejected almost all of the left's most radical ballot initiatives. Tax hikes failed even in deep-blue California and Illinois, and California voters also rejected an effort (Proposition 16) to allow racial discrimination (affirmative action) in state-run institutions. These were major victories, and a sign that even Democratic voters were pushing back against the radical left.

Without that mandate to buy coverage, wouldn't you concede there will be millions of uninsured? a reporter asked.
On Tuesday, the three-judge appellate panel unanimously ruled the State can move forward with enforcing most provisions of the law, the Texas Tribune reported. The only part of the law that remains unenforceable at this point is the provision that provides punishment to local officials who are adopting, enforcing or endorsing policies that block or limit enforcement of immigration laws. Specifically, the judges said the injunction only applies to the word endorse.
The reshuffle comes after the disappointing result for Mrs May in the June 2017 general election, in which she and her party defied expectations to consolidate their position in parliament to actually lose seats.
And, of course, once the U.S. economy is flooded with rent-raising, wage-cutting legal (or illegal) immigrants, then blue-collar Americans are denied the right to a tight labor market where employees and employers can bargain as equals as they trade work for wages. Jawetz and other progressives would join with CEOs to steal that bargaining power and decide which jobs need to be filled by low-wage, compliant, and grateful migrants instead of well-paid, free-speaking, indepndent American citizens.
The State uses those certificates to give married parents a form of legal recognition that is not available to unmarried parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not, consistent with Obergefell, deny married same-sex couples that recognition.

The emergency triage document was first published in the Journal for Medical Ethics in November but is now being sent to National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across the country.
After several months of meeting at the North Branch library, on Wednesday (2/19), the Nashville Chapter of Black Lives Matter was contacted through email and by phone that library administrators received complaints regarding BLM's policy of general meetings being open to black and non-black people of color only. Although meeting rooms are available to local organizations for use of a cultural nature, we were informed that due to the library policy of open meetings for meeting room use, all future meetings held at the library would be cancelled. Ironically, all cancelled dates were in February during Black History Month. The Nashville Chapter of BLM has this policy in place to center the voices and experiences of people of color that have historically been excluded or segregated within supposedly public spaces. Black and/or people of color only spaces are often questioned and viewed with suspicion, though there is seldom any interrogation of white-only board rooms and staffs. However, we view these spaces as integral to healing and community building, particularly to those who have experienced racialized violence and ardently maintain this policy as imperative to the work and mission of BLM.
According to Fox News, Okay Superintendent Charles McMahan noted that the town's police force was dissolved in 2014, and the district had to make a decision. McMahan said, We don't want to be a soft target.

While a Cornwall woman has created a postcard template — which can be printed and filled out — for neighbours and volunteers to use to reach out to those who are self-isolating in their homes. The heading of the postcard reads, Hello!

The figures come just days after a think tank called on Prime Minister David Cameron to admit that his target to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands was effectively dead. It urged Mr Cameron to be honest with the British public and admit that even if he achieves reform to migrant benefits as hoped, numbers are unlikely to be significantly affected.

However, Facebook notes that the difference between nationalism and supremacy expressed by some users can be hard to distinguish. Overlaps with white nationalism/separatism, even orgs and individuals define themselves inconsistently, says one slide in a section titled challenges for white supremacy. Another slide asks: Can you say you're a racist on Facebook? Facebook's official response to this is No. By definition, as a racist, you hate on at least one of our characteristics that are protected.
[The Tennessee law] is the most comprehensive state legislation protecting free speech on college campuses that we've seen be passed anywhere in the country. It is gratifying to see the Tennessee legislature take decisive action to protect the expressive rights of students and faculty, especially in light of the number of restrictive speech codes across the country and the recent controversies over speech on campus.
Trump did not link his immigration policy to the rising level of blue-collar wages:
The secretary said he made U.S. expectations on human rights clear to the Saudis, including women's rights and accountability for those involved in the October murder of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. He said the Saudi government's assurances that justice will be done in the Khashoggi killing remain constant, asking the press to give the Kingdom time to work through its fact-finding process.

As a country, we simply do not have the capability or capacity to implement or comply with or enforce a blanket WRO [Withhold Release Order], Stephen Lamar, head of the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA), told Congress in September 2020, objecting to Congress's Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would ban imports from Xinjiang generally with exceptions only for those who can prove their products were not made with forced labor.
Some conservative critics of the state's sanctuary policy interpreted Brown and Becerra's new guidance as a concession to the federal government.
The takeover is a result of a Turkish court ordering that a court-appointed board of trustees run the Feza Media Group, which owns Zaman. Erdogan's government has accused the writers at Zaman of having ties to the cleric Gulen, formerly a Justice and Development Party (AKP) ally now considered a terrorist by Erdogan's government. Turkey announced an in-absentia trial against Gulen in October for terrorism charges, as Gulen is currently exiled in the United States. He has also faced legal troubles in America, accused of running a corrupt charter school system feeding into an Islamist cult. The FBI raided a number of Gulenist charter schools in 2014.

Finally, looming over all pro-American countries—and, in fact, over just about every country in the world—is the threat of China. China, of course, is a human rights-violator second to none: Even if we put its Maoist mass-murderous past aside, today, we see that it is defiantly anti-democratic; it routinely suppresses Christians, as well as Tibetans and other minorities and dissidents, including the Falun Gong. Indeed, it's reliably reported to have preemptively locked up as many as one million Muslims, without even the pretense of a legal trial.
Eberstadt added that people in politics usually do not pay attention to demographics and are obsessed with what happens in the next 24 hours. But demographic change creeps up on you on little cat feet and it doesn't become clear that things have changed for half a generation… but at that point the door's closed.
Iran downed the Ukrainian flight as it braced for retaliation after firing ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces. The ballistic missile attack, which caused no casualties, was a response to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran's top general, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad.

More than halfway through the interview Mr. Galloway was exasperated to note that he still had not been asked his opinion of the EU, at which point Ms. Coburn returned to the personal line of questioning. He said:
I can't guarantee that it's not been/being discussed in the cabinets of other institutions – as there is virtually no cross institutional information flow, coordination or cooperation on these things.
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened the program by reacting to Sen-elect Mitt Romney's (R-UT) public critique of President Donald Trump.
But the bulk of the memo is devoted to arguments for clamping down on unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information, also known as leaking, Rogin wrote.
It seemed like a good idea at the time, Brill remarked. What Ralph Nader and his lawyers did was, there were some discount pharmacies in Virginia who wanted to advertise their discount prices. To us consumers, that's a good thing. We'd see that you could buy the drugs at a discount price somewhere.
As an example, the reading states that a white, cisgender man, who is able-bodied, heterosexual, considered handsome and speaks English has more privilege than a Black transgender woman. In some cases, because of the principle of intersectionality, there are parts of us that hold some power and other parts that are oppressed, even within a single individual.
Acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to focus on the National Defense Strategy and to keep this effort moving forward. While we're focused on ongoing operations, Acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to remember China, China, China, the official said.

It was a transparently partisan performance from beginning to end, McConnell said of the House impeachment. But it's not what this process will be going forward.
The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai told the Arabic news outlet AlHurra that the Israeli genius along with the Jewish brain have come up with a solution to all of the terrorists' tunnels.
This is not coincidental. The idea of 'degrowth' as a virtuous goal is a key tenet not only of hard-left environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion but also of the Great Reset, which sees the economic destruction wrought by Covid-19 not as a crisis but as an opportunity for a 'new normal.'

On Wednesday, there is little doubt the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to acquit Trump, now the third impeached president in American history.
Manning does not offer any policy proposals in the ominous video but appears to be more of a call to action.
It ensures that students will be informed of the official policy on free expression.
Our sons are still marching en masse to become cannon fodder in civil wars and [to serve as] criminal murderers in the ranks of ISIS in every war or terrorist crime around the world, he wrote. [Saudi youths] form the majority in every arena of so-called jihad. The wellsprings of extremism and fanaticism still [exist] everywhere in our country, to the extent that some boys and girls in our schools accuse other boys and girls of heresy or of straying from the right path just for mentioning some pictures [they liked] or some movies they saw.
Hurt remarked, I was talking to a guy from Georgia the other day he was saying, 'I don't care. I just want divided and government. [sic] It's all I want.' Okay, if you want divided government, you have to crawl over broken glass to vote in this election, because that's what this is all about.
Beijing's promise to 'work towards' enforcing international conventions on labour standards are also laughably weak, he added.
Populist movements against ruling elites have been the big political story of the past five years. But at the very moment when elites appear to be winning political battles again, a new threat to their power emerges — this time aimed at Wall Street rather than Washington.
Policies like the one in question at USC have unfortunately become increasingly common at universities around the country. True liberals should take issue with the reality that students now have to get permission if they want to stand in a campus courtyard with poster boards promoting their political positions. These types of demonstrations have been an integral part of American academic culture, specifically as a result of our country's emphasis on First Amendment principles.
Rutnam, in other words, was ripe for the chop. But by jumping before he was pushed, he was able to present his departure as a case of high moral principle – while sticking the knife into Patel.
The American public didn't put us in a $20 trillion dollar debt — the federal government did, he said.
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) said a covert counter-terrorism operation is underway to stop a Islamic State (ISIS) attack in Turkey on Jewish children.
That is a stark contrast to the priorities of voters elsewhere in the country. According to a Gallup poll released earlier this week, Democrats nationwide consider health care the most important issue, followed closely by gun control and climate change. Overall, healthcare, national security, gun policy, education and the economy were cited as extremely important by over 30% of adults in the poll.
The organization fails to mention that Trump's proposed barrier seeks to stop the humanitarian crisis of illegal aliens, including children, attempting the dangerous trek to cross the porous U.S.-Mexico border.
That has the same problem as the AP U.S. History curriculum. It focuses on group conflict – exactly the sort of thing that you find in the studies departments. And there's even a neo-Marxist element to the AP U.S. History standards – they're very materialist. The AP European History standards imply that the original liberals, like John Locke and Hobbs, and the Parliaments that brought modern democracy to England, were somehow motivated by class interest, and the implication is there's something inauthentic and not very believable about classical liberalism. So, there's no doubt that the curriculum the College Board has put in place has been adding to and exacerbating the underlying problem that we're experiencing on free speech.
The former Anglican vicar of Baghdad, Canon Andrew White, who was forced out of his parish in November 2014, also spoke recently about a terrible onslaught of Islamic jihadism that killed or drove off most of his congregation, and warned of ethnic cleansing in Iraq and Syria. White has spent years trying to draw attention to the persecution of Christians, which includes forced conversion to Islam, and beheading for those who resist.

The GoFundMe campaign shows that people are not only willing to cast their votes for this cause; they are also willing to give their hard-earned money to it. The President cannot afford to back down on his promise to build the wall. The American people want it. They know that it will work. And if the politicians in Washington won't do it, patriotic Americans will try to do it themselves. They are doing so at https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall.
And it's good for national politics if you want people to feel more engaged in the healthy part of the economy and go out and vote to keep it that way. If you look the other side of your question: 'Are decreasing wages good for national politics?' Hell, no. … If you have ten people for every job, you're not gonna have a drive [up] in wages. [But] if you have five people for every ten jobs, wages are going to go up.

China has conducted a number of military exercises over the past year, which include exercises on the Korean Peninsula as well as drills in and around Taiwan, increasing fears that they are planning to colonize the self-ruled island by force.
The foreign minister said Turkey has proposed a buffer zone along the Turkey-Syria border that seems compatible with Trump's demand for a safe zone around the Kurds, presuming the Kurds agree to fall back outside the buffer zone. He criticized the administration of Trump's predecessor, former President Barack Obama, for refusing to consider this proposal due to various excuses and said the Trump administration is only entertaining it now due to Turkey's determination.
Frontex, the European Union's combined border force and coastguard, revealed the new uniform in a social media post on Monday, showing off the navy uniform complete with EU-flag identification patches and military side cap.

In light of the unprecedented events last week at the U.S. Capitol, MLB is suspending contributions from its Political Action Committee pending a review of our political contribution policy going forward, the league told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The divisive tone that has recently so dominated our national conversations must change, Cardinal Gregory said, in apparent reference to Trump. Those who resort to inflammatory rhetoric must accept some responsibility for inciting the increasing violence in our nation.
It is such a disgrace how my friend Jose who never qualified DACA because he had to drop out, in order to support his single mother. came to this office and spoke with Senator Rubio's immigration staffer, and they looked him in the eye and said they would vote for Bridge [an amnesty act which provides work-permits, but no green cards]. And I remember how angry Jose was when he told me this, and I was so angry I was ready to slug somebody in the head because I could not believe that somebody had disrespected my friend like that, had looked him in the eye and told him he is not worthy of protection, of living a life with dignity on this world, and this country.
In December 2018, foreign-born workers unemployment rate fell 13 percent compared to the same time the year before. Native-born Americans, meanwhile, fell only 2.6 percent year-to-year.
While costs are soaring…choices are plummeting. Insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right, said Pence. A chart displayed above Pence read, Only 10 million enrolled, 28 million still uninsured.
In a leaked email obtained by Time Magazine, the Koch brothers' network of organizations — which includes Americans for Prosperity, the LIBRE Initiative, and Freedom Partners — have their sights set on an amnesty for the at least 3.5 million illegal aliens who are enrolled and eligible for President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
The capital city Kinshasa is very tense right now. There were almost full-scale riots in December 2016, but the Catholic Church intervened and quieted the situation. If CENI continues to delay announcing the election results, or if it announces that Shadary is the winner, there may be widespread riots again.
I'm giving people the chance to opt out of this and get their money back if they don't want to move forward in building the wall to protect the American people, Kolfage said, adding that 100 percent of the money collected on the GoFundMe site or through the non-profit would go for construction of the wall.
On the national emergency, let me say, the President said in front of all you, just the other day, that it's something that he's considering looking into. He's made no decision on that. I will say that one of the [alternative] ways that Congress can find the resources for this is through an emergency [funding] supplement. And we did indicate to them, over the course of this weekend, that we would be willing to work with them on forming an emergency supplemental for some of the resources — the additional resources we're asking for.
Sir Paul, who previously worked as director of the Development Research Group at the World Bank, told the paper: Inviting all refugees to Germany was a colossal mistake by Angela Merkel, especially since she had obviously made no preparations for the resulting influx.
Lynch elaborated on the new policies during a subcommittee hearing Wednesday when questioned by Culberson and Rogers:
Richard Cordray directs the CFPB. Dodd-Frank legislation tasked the CFPB with regulating mortgages and other consumer loans from predatory practices.
Speaking at the launch of a Scottish government paper which argues for continuing open borders with Europe after Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), the SNP leader claimed a population that is ever-expanding as a result of mass migration is essential to our economic prosperity.
The COVID-19 response should not be linked to immigration enforcement in any manner. It will undermine individual and collective health if individuals do not feel safe to utilize care and respond to inquiries from public health officials, for example during contact tracing. Similar enforcement-free zones have been declared during hurricanes and other emergencies, including after the September 11 terrorist attacks. These policies should be clearly and unequivocally articulated to the public by the federal, state, and local governments.
Even in the 49th District, where the foreign-born population remains below 20 percent, Democrat Mike Levin beat out Republican Diane Harkey. The district has anywhere between an 18 to 19 percent foreign-born population with about 55 percent of foreign-born residents arriving from Latin America and nearly 30 percent coming from Asia.
In February, the KRG admitted it had begun accepting munitions from Iran, describing it as the first country to provide us with weapons and ammunition directly. Kurdistan Region Security Council head Masrour Barzani, son of President Masoud Barzani, complained then of U.S. support for the Iraqi army over the Kurdish forces. 90 percent of the burden for this war is on the shoulder of the Peshmerga, 90 percent of the work is done by the Peshmerga, but we are only getting 10 percent of the armaments, he argued. The shipments received in the last months of 2015, he protested, were not even close to what we were asking for.
Although most dictionaries define mankind as the human race, which is gender inclusive, Northern Arizona University Professor Anne Scott is sending a message to a student who dared to use the word that Scott believes is sexist, in a recent essay.
What started out as a good thing became much too much of a good thing, he said. There are a lot of parallels like that. There are a lot of boomerangs. The Citizens United case, whatever you think of it, it was started, the legal road to Citizens United, was started by guess who? Ralph Nader.
I believe that he could lead the United States toward becoming a more powerful nation if and when he's allowed to do that, Karaganov said of Trump. Whether that is good for Russia, I'm not sure, because we will be competitors even if we understand each other and even if we cooperate at margins.
In the report, titled Climate Neutrality: Are We Ready for an Honest Discussion?, Eric Heymann warns that the EU's green ambitions of 'Net Zero' Carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.
As Davidson points out, China has repeatedly lied and hid its true intentions. Originally, the artificial islands were going to be for tourists and scientists, which was a lie. Then the military installations would be purely defensive, which was another lie. And now they're part of a massive militarization in anticipation, when preparation has been completed, to launch a full-scale war on America and its allies.
The Death of Schengen: Denmark Proposes to Make Border Controls Permanent https://t.co/OnOd8CorGs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 22, 2019
The big reason that the City of Oakland is willing to anger voters is that the union wage and pension costs from the city council's July 2014 passage of a $15 minimum wage are jumping. With the latest spike to $12.86 an hour on January 1, the mayor and her 5 council allies are desperate to find new cash.
Pompeo endorsed Trump's demand for a safe zone around the Syrian Kurds. If we can get the space and the security arrangements right it would be a good thing for everyone in the region, he said.
Many people say that a home is an individual's best protection against inflation. But with inflation up only 2.2 percent last year, and 17.8 percent since the 2012 low, home prices are jumping twice as fast as inflation.
Olsen continued, The biggest problem I see in Washington is that most Republican elected officials and most Republican elites still wish that this was the party where the argument was between Romney and Cruz, and it's not.
Furthermore, the Civil Service has clearly already decided at the most senior levels to push through the Huawei deal, come what may.
National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien announced last year in an op-ed that he planned to reduce the size of the NSC's policy staff to under 120 positions by early 2020 — a size more in line with previous administrations before more than doubling under the Obama administration to over 200 staffers.
In fact, Obama claimed in June 2012 that this is a temporary stopgap measure. By allowing Obama's temporary work permit to remain temporary, Trump is simply implementing the claimed spirit of Obama's promise — even if Obama intended to make his temporary deal into a permanent fixture. 6. Delay keeps Trump's political opponents fixated on their unpoular pro-illegal-immigrant rhetoric throughout 2018, while an amnesty deal instead would give Democrats a morale-boost before the 2018 election — plus the time to shift towards more popular rhetoric, such as stoking fears about government medical care. By refusing an amnesty, Trump helps makes the 2018 election all about the Democrats' noisy and unpopular demands for limitless amnesty. 7. Delay helps Trump's 2018 election turnout. Under Trump's Buy American, Hire American policies, wages are now rising in some cities, perhaps marking the arrival of a wage-boom in the run-up to the 2018 election. The scheduled expiration of DACA will nudge many illegals out of the labor market before November, likely boosting wages for American voters and encouraging the roughly nine million sidelined working-age American men to take jobs. But Trump's support for an amnesty would show that the establishment's cheap-labor policies are King, so deflating pressure on employers to pay higher wages to workers in the run-up to the 2018 election. 8. Delay gives time to Democrats to gradually accept the nation's desire to shift from a high immigration/low-wage economy to a low-immigration/high-wage economy.

Despite his conviction—the result of years of investigations in what is now known as Operation Car Wash, Lula remains the frontrunner. Operation Car Wash is a sprawling prosecutorial probe into Petrobras, the state-run oil company, that found politicians from nearly all of Brazil's dozens of political parties participating in a scheme in which politicians would secure overpriced infrastructure contracts to private corporations who would then kick some of the excess profits back to the politicians involved. The plan peaked during Lula's tenure; two courts have found that he personally profited to the tune of millions from the operation.
That's like Russian roulette: find a people smuggler and hope that your boat does not sink. What is there to defend?
The final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. DHS previously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on Nov. 2, 2020, and carefully considered the public comments received before deciding to publish the proposed regulations as a final rule.

And it suits Bulgaria to claim these people as their own.
We recognize that they are a blessing to America … the dreamers are all over our country, Mr. Speaker, they are a blessing so across the board … These are the best of the best. They are so fabulous … I was impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on their country. Each of them with their individual contribution to the greatness of America. So exciting, so proud of them … [They have] great humility about conveying their stories because when you see them and they tell their stories and the passion and the pride — the patriotism, passion, pride, patriotism, that they demonstrate, you will see why anyone who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our dreamers, understand why they have had such a high reputation among the American people. some of whom have met them, some of whom have heard about them, some of whom have just catch the spark, catch the spark. Recognize, recognize again the hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of America. It's a beautiful thing … Am I not lucky to be able to become so familiar with so many of these beautiful dreamers? We want to send these people back? This talent, this rich talent, this achievement, this determination, this faith in the future, this patriotism for America? I don't think so.
As the Facebook conversastion, now deleted, continued, people accused the woman of being a fake who may have catfished members of the group.
While I think we all think the violence that took place in the place where you all work in the Capitol was tragic, I've watched people walk away from this president already. And they are not listening to the American people. Not remotely, he said.
On Saturday, Castro announced he is running for president in 2020.

I propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending, Carney argued. It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Breitbart's Matt Boyle, veteran pollster Pat Caddell, and Rick Unger, the co-host of Unger and Steele on SiriusXM POTUS 124, will analyze the results of the special election in Georgia's 6th congressional district.
Mustafa Edib Yılmaz, a journalist who returned to work on Sunday, describes his office as being run under close police surveillance. He tells France24 the protesters have returned with him, too. Outside of my office window, I can see at least 500 and 600 people, chanting and singing slogans. … I can see conservative women in headscarves out there protesting with five or six-year-old children. He laments that he does not believe the international community will protest the takeover. There have been some statements from the European commission, saying something along the lines of 'we note with high concern,' which is like the dictionary definition of 'we are not going to do anything.'
Google and other search engines shouldn't be forced to apply the European Union's right to be forgotten beyond the bloc's borders, an adviser to the EU's top court argued Thursday. The recommendation—if followed by the EU's Luxembourg-based Court of Justice—would be a major victory for Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., which has for three years been fighting an order from France's privacy regulator to apply the EU principle globally. Maciej Szpunar, an advocate general for the court, argued in Thursday's nonbinding opinion that if the EU ordered removal of content from websites accessed outside the EU, there was a danger that other jurisdictions would use their laws to block information from being accessible within the EU. There is a real risk of reducing freedom of expression to the lowest common denominator across Europe and the world, Mr. Szpunar wrote.
In addition to salary concerns, however, some young men express concern about perceptions that male teachers are not trustworthy and that the choice to become a teacher is an indication of homosexuality.
The main advantage of playing around with the marines is that they have a higher concentration of specialists, act well as light infantry, have good esprit de corps, and are nimble enough to be deployed over long distances if needed, he added.

The Gang of Six amnesty in the Senate would offer residency or citizenship to roughly 8 million illegals, plus chain-migration relatives, according to the White House. The illegals would likely have won that prize if Rubio's Gang of Eight amnesty had not been rejected by voters in 2014.

They continue to lose territory, we've seen a growing number of defections and a rise in the number of alleged internal spies – many of whom they have killed mercilessly without demonstrating significant evidence of internal espionage, said Clint Watts, Fox fellow of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, adding:
The Washington Post reported that Democrats are objecting to the emergency construction — but are not arguing that the policy is clearly illegal:
And, of course, once the U.S. economy is flooded with rent-raising, wage-cutting legal (or illegal) immigrants, then blue-collar Americans are denied the right to a tight labor market where employees and employers can bargain as equals as they trade work for wages. Jawetz and other progressives would join with CEOs to steal that bargaining power and decide which jobs need to be filled by low-wage, compliant, and grateful migrants instead of well-paid, free-speaking, indepndent American citizens.
The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and temporarily closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters had recently staged two days of violent protests in which they breached the compound. Britain and France have warned their citizens to avoid or strictly limit travel in Iraq, as London said it would begin escorting ships through the Strait of Hormuz. Oman, long an interlocutor between Iran and the West, urged Tehran and Washington on Sunday to pursue dialogue.
But I have to say what they're doing is falling prey to criminal gangs and they are breaking the law. They're also undermining the legitimate claims of others who would seek asylum in this country.
This avalanche of demands came on the heels of determinations by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which sent recommendations to the film industry to shut down production in the face of rising coronavirus numbers.
The numbers will become a border crisis if Biden follows through on his campaign promise to remove Trump's border reforms, Morgan added. You take that ability away and that 2,500 [arrivals] a day becomes a crisis overnight. That's what concerns us.
It is such a disgrace how my friend Jose who never qualified DACA because he had to drop out, in order to support his single mother. came to this office and spoke with Senator Rubio's immigration staffer, and they looked him in the eye and said they would vote for Bridge [an amnesty act which provides work-permits, but no green cards]. And I remember how angry Jose was when he told me this, and I was so angry I was ready to slug somebody in the head because I could not believe that somebody had disrespected my friend like that, had looked him in the eye and told him he is not worthy of protection, of living a life with dignity on this world, and this country.
Red Lobster is the latest company to pull ads from Carlson's show. He faced an ad boycott last month over comments criticizing American immigration policy, and he is once again in the crosshairs of the far-left over comments he made about many women who do not want to marry men who earn less than them.
McLane had recently criticized the Eagles front office. According to Philly.com, McLane has occasionally criticized the Eagles in his coverage. Last week, he wrote an article questioning whether executive vice president Howie Roseman had made wise investments in players. In another article, he wrote that the jury is certainly still in deliberation about the prospects for head coach Doug Pederson, though he did say Pederson deserved to return next season.
Corporate interests and the big business lobby have the most to gain from granting an amensty to DACA illegal aliens, as legalizing millions of low-skilled foreign workers would drag down wages for Americans, drive up profit margins for corporations, and leave U.S. taxpayers with the costs.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Cut tax rates, create cash flow, You've got to allow people to make money, Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX) told Breitbart News this week in an exclusive interview on tax reform.

In 2016, I think the way to understand what happened was, there were really three party primaries, judged Olsen. There was a Democratic primary between Clinton and Sanders. There was a Republican primary between 17 people, and there was a working class primary between Sanders and Trump, and the working class voters who heard both of those people — and in most states could've gone either way because they don't have party registration — overwhelmingly chose Trump, and a lot of the people who chose Sanders did so knowing that they would vote for Trump if their guy lost. There is no appeal to the AOC-type of policy among the actual working class voters.

Obama's conduct, Herschmann said, met all of the Democrats' elements of abuse of power: 1. The president exercises his official power … 2. To obtain a corrupt personal benefit … 3. While ignoring or injuring our national interest.
Museveni dismissed interference by foreign partners saying they didn't understand that Uganda's strength came from the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), the army and the economy, Reuters reported of the president's speech.
A new social order has emerged across Honduras. Many of the markers of status that defined life before the migration boom — such as land ownership, advanced age, education, and political connections—are being replaced by knowledge of how to migrate successfully to the United States and remit earnings to family members in Honduras. Migrants and returnees have become the very models of success for young people in rural areas. At the same time, new forms of social differentiation are emerging. The meaning and value of education, lawful citizenship, and family responsibility have been redefined in the context of the migration phenomenon.
A number of users on the independent pro-Trump forum TheDonald.win have called for supporters to gather outside Twitter's HQ on Monday morning to protest the company's permanent ban of President Trump.

The rocket, fired from North Korea's west coast and tracked by the governments in South Korea and Japan, came about two hours after an eight-day launch window opened Sunday morning. It follows North Korea's widely disputed claim last month to have tested a hydrogen bomb. Washington, Seoul and their allies will consider it a further provocation and will push for more tough sanctions in the United Nations.
The Twilight Zone economy we are currently experiencing could implode if interest rates were to ever normalize.

Sunday's elections were the biggest since Germany registered a record influx of asylum seekers that reached 1.1 million in 2015, and the vote was largely regarded as a referendum on Merkel's decision to open the doors to people fleeing war.
Strategic competition between the United States and China will persist, owing to the divergent nature and goals of international rules and norms to gain an advantage. China will circumvent international rules and norms to gain an advantage, the 2017 strategy framework warned.
This [speech] turned this thing on its head, people have this so backwards. You hear this all the time, oh, all the money spent on law enforcement all the prisons are filled with these low-level drug users. Not true! Smoke a joint and the odds you're going to prison are virtually the same as if you don't smoke a joint. It's just a huge myth out that there.
The notion that women are somehow unable to obtain contraception with the new rule in place is, however, fake news. Taxpayer funds that would go to abortion facilities that refuse to abide by the new regulations – and some may choose not to – are slated to go to other federally qualified health centers that do not perform abortions and that provide more comprehensive health care. Any individual who would have chosen a Title X abortion facility for regular health care and family planning services can find another center at getyourcare.org.
WHAT WAS THE FIRE PROCEDURE AT THE BUILDING?
Doug Jones has made clear whose side he's on, Sessions said. He has supported Speaker Pelosi's gambit to withhold the Articles of Impeachment for purely political timing reasons, not for substantive reasons. He's supported that. He's supported only the witnesses Chuck Schumer has called for. He's supported Sen. Schumer's call for only Democratic witnesses. He's supported Speaker Pelosi's idea that she can hold back the articles for political reasons and political timing. He's also called the case presented by the House impeachment managers 'compelling.' Fourthly, I would say, with regard to Alabama, he's not once defended President Trump from all the unfair attacks he's been subjected to throughout this process, even though President Trump carried Alabama by a super large margin. He's ignored the wishes and beliefs of the people of Alabama.
Three years ago, the concept of a local agency taking on such a project, that had been on the board since the 1950s, seemed pretty remote, he said. We have now become the state's lead agency for complying with environmental requirements.
Echoing the Trump administration, a top spokesman for the Japanese government vowed that Tokyo would maintain pressure on North Korea, which has proved to threaten the island nation directly.
The immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.
Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined, the Fed said in its analysis of current economic conditions. It noted that inflation has recently declined.

The amnesty pitch was wrapped in a soft-focus video, which portrayed the illegals as the victims, even though the illegals voluntarily enter the United States, break laws, and extract wages away from Americans' labor market. For example, Marek offered sympathy for the poor migrants who accept low wage jobs from construction executives:
Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news.
That's right. Each and every American, from the outspoken Christian to the dyed-in-the-wool atheist, has a religion, whether they use the term or not. Something or somebody sits at the center of the lives of everyone, shaping their identities, organizing their lives, and guiding their views of right and wrong. That something or someone functions as the god of that person's life. In other words, every human being ascribes ultimate worth to something or someone – to some person, ideal or ideology. If it is not God, it may be sex, money or power. Or anything else. Fill in the blank.

Morgan said his deputies are talking with Biden's deputies.
I'll take whatever Israel has because it's working 100 percent. … They have a huge problem with illegal aliens and they're fantastic. I mean, I have a whole chapter in 'Adios, America' about 'Why can't we have Israel's plan on immigration?' … They take illegal aliens and just fly them to other countries and drop them off in the desert.

Co-host Nicole Wallace said, That is something I pick up anecdotally is you want the guy that is going to fight high and low. This is a compliment, not an insult to Democrats. They follow the rules. You can't follow the rules and beat Donald Trump. He cheats at everything. He asked Ukraine to help him. There's a sense that Bloomberg not that he will break any rules, but he'll go high, and he'll go low. He talked about porn and a cheeseburger and a putter being in his brain.
For Sical, the USA is always on his mind – and in my heart. But, he said, you're left with feelings of resentment. The families who have someone in the United States, every eight days, they go to the bank for the remittance. And us just watching, because there is nothing else we can do.

The memo will help Americans block the efforts by pro-transgender activist groups to remove government recognition of the two sexes. For example, these groups have persuaded Democrats in Congress to adopt sex-less gender terminology in place of traditional terms such as father and mother.
For decades, policymakers have debated whether to build new reservoirs. One project, the Auburn Dam, was authorized by Congress in 1965 for flood control, but later abandoned over structural and environmental concerns. Numerous other proposals have been studied for decades, with little progress at the state or federal level — though local authorities have built their own projects, such as the Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the East San Francisco Bay, one of the few projects environmentalists have not opposed (though many have since opposed its expansion.)

If HTS acts as a spoiler to the [Russia-Turkey] agreement on the ground, this will probably lead to one of two scenarios: either Turkey and the NLF launch military action against HTS, or Russia will seize the opportunity with the support of the [Assad] regime and its allies to enter Idlib, Nawar Oliver, an analyst for the Turkey-based Omran Center predicted in October, according to Al Jazeera.

It is important that member states fully respect the advice given from WHO and of course from ECDC, but such decisions concerning travel restrictions will always be member states' competence and member states' decisions, Kyriakides added.
I would say this. Many of our Republicans don't fully grasp that, Sessions said. They don't fully understand the opportunity we have right now. This is a major historical redirection of American policy from the left to mainstream American values—that's the choice we'll face in this next election.

These visa worker programs are little recognized by most voters but are very unpopular among white-c0llar professionals who have seen their colleges get replaces by foreign workers.

THE FACTS: That is not one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.
The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks. The most significant reductions last year were around transportation, which remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, said Kate Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group, a research and consulting firm. But as vaccines become more prevalent, and depending on how quickly people feel comfortable enough to drive and fly again, we'd expect emissions to rebound unless there are major policy changes put in place.

You're going to show up at the polls in record numbers. You've gotta swamp 'em, Trump said.
For someone to win the vote, they need to win a majority of those members who voted for a candidate. Voting present technically is a thrown-away vote, as it does not count toward the number of votes cast for candidates, and thereby lowers the total threshold. Assuming all 435 members of the House are present and vote for a candidate, that would mean the winner needs 218 votes. If anyone is absent or votes present and not for a candidate, that lowers the number of votes a winner needs one member for each two members voting present or absent from the vote.

In addition to concerns regarding the preparation of Iraqi troops and equipment used by peshmerga, the participation of Shiite militias may also cause discord. Baghdad has friendly relations with rogue Shiite militias in Iraq, many with ties to Iran, but the peshmerga do not. On Thursday, the same day the operation to retake Mosul began, peshmerga clashed with Shiite forces in Salahaddin province, preventing them from entering a Kurdish-controlled town.
His campaign is making payments to NativeEnergy, based in Burlington, Vermont, which is the same company that Clinton used for them during her presidential bid in 2016. That's also the same firm Warren uses, with her campaign paying a little more than $10,000 to it in September.
In a series of charts, Times reporters Robert Gebeloff and Jasmine C. Lee. reveal that while Orange County has become less and less Republican, the foreign-born population has grown significantly, the share of college graduates has peaked, and the white American population has fallen drastically.
He added, I don't think a president should cut short his trip, because it is sort of handing over a victory to the terrorists. Moreover, the trip to Argentina is important. … But he should never have been on the trip in the first place, and he needs to make a speech, about world terrorism, and what he's going to do.
The paper remembered Adelson as a visionary and philanthropist in an obituary written by his wife, Miriam, a psychologist:
Despite Facebook already having 132 million of the 252 million Indian monthly active users in late 2015, Board member Mark Andreessen was so angry over having the government tell him what he could or could not do, he tweeted sarcastically, Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?

Sessions isn't alone in opposing this push to soften sentencing for drug crimes. Recently Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined his Senate colleague in condemning the move.
One of the effects of emigration is erosion of human capital, which can have a negative impact on the economic and social development of the countries of origin, said a 2005 report by the United Nations. A 2020 report by a reporter for the Guardian for the Texas Public Policy Foundation spotlighted one example:
If this sounds familiar, it is because it is basically the monetary policy advocated by Donald Trump in the years when he was regularly criticizing the Fed for raising rates.
So the people need to be louder.
At the Seoul Western District Court on Tuesday, 203 gym owners belonging to the Pilates and Fitness Business Association filed for 5 million won (US$4,549) each for about 1 billion won [about $913,000] in total, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday.
Tlaib also published an op-ed in a Detroit-area newspaper Thursday titled, Now is the time to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump. She declared: There is no requirement whatsoever that a president be charged with or be convicted of a crime before Congress can impeach him.
Under First Amendment standards, universities may put in place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on where and when demonstrations can take place on campus in order to limit disruptions to regular college activities and functions. However, forcing students to apply for a permit two weeks in advance in order to conduct all sorts of demonstrations — whether involving a group of three people or one of three hundred — is nowhere near reasonable. Promising students that they'll have the right to hold a demonstration is meaningless and misleading when students are prevented from actually reacting to current and still-unfolding events in the moment. USC must revise this policy so that students are not discouraged from protesting altogether by a burdensome permit application process, and so that students can instead conduct spontaneous expressive activities on campus.
A two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is vital to the defeat of the Islamic State, King Abdullah of Jordan argued Friday, saying that the decades-long dispute only served to benefit the jihadist group.
The figures mark the latest success for Salvini, who made it a campaign promise to greatly reduce the number of illegal crossings into Italy. Reports revealed that following his policy to turn away migrant transport NGO vessels the number of illegal migrants entering the country was reduced by up to 80 percent by July of last year.
I don't want to disseminate the rumors: The government is not leaving, the government is planning to continue working, we're not planning any resignations, he said. There are so many provocations, manipulations around the government.
The car wash attendant chased the 23-year-old woman down the street brandishing a knife after she had interrupted a conversation that he was having with her husband whilst they were waiting at a bus stop.
Jeh C. Johnson, who served in the Obama administration as secretary of homeland security and general counsel of the Defense Department, said the laws Trump could invoke with his national emergency declaration are designed to authorize military construction projects during wartime. He said using them for a border wall could curtail presidential powers in the years to come as lawmakers react to Trump and work to constrain him. The danger of using an authority like this and stretching it beyond its intended use is that Congress could then take it away, and it could not be used in situations where it's really needed, Johnson said. Robert F. Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama, said Trump would be poorly positioned to defend such an action in federal courts, in part because his statements about the wall have been contradictory and have contained provable falsehoods.

By contrast, under their own theory of the case, for the House Managers to carry their burden of proving that merely raising the matter was illegitimate, they would have to prove that raising the issue could have no legitimate purpose whatsoever. Their theory is obviously false. And especially on this record, the House Managers cannot possibly carry that burden, because no such definitive proof exists. Nobody, not even House Democrats' own witnesses, could testify that the Bidens' conduct did not at least facially raise an appearance of a conflict of interest. And while House Democrats repeatedly insist that any suggestions that Vice President Biden or his son did anything wrong are debunked conspiracy theories and without merit, they lack any evidence to support those bald assertions, because they have steadfastly cut off any real inquiry into the Bidens' conduct. For example, they have refused to call Hunter Biden to testify. Instead, they have been adamant that Americans must simply accept the diktat that the Bidens' conduct could not possibly have been part of a course of conduct in which the Office of the Vice President was misused to protect the financial interests of a family member.
The Friday strike that killed the most prominent Iranian general may have ended any chance that he would get the United States out of the endless wars in the Middle East that he has railed against since taking office.

The crisis of the American sailors [detained by] Iran ended [just] a few hours after their arrest, but it was Obama's speech that was hijacked, since the Iranians deprived Obama of the opportunity to appear as the strong man who had forced Iran to capitulate on the nuclear dossier.
The short and bland statement gives Trump room to zig-zag between the competing demands of his voters and his donors during the hugely expensive election.
Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.
Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, will share the latest developments in the story of an illegal alien appointed to state office in California; Kate Steinle's illegal alien killer's lawsuit against the federal government; and the Oakland mayor's warning to businesses with illegal alien employees before the recent ICE raids in California.
Roberts asked if they swore to deliver impartial justice according to the US Constitution, and 99 lawmakers — one was absent — responded in unison: I do.
The fundamental problem is that Biden and his progressives see large-scale, wage-cutting migration as a core value… the highest values of our nation — and they view migration as far more important than economic development in Central America, Africa, Latin America — or in central Los Angeles, central Detroit, or anywhere else in Americans' home country.
Since 2001, U.S. free trade with China has eliminated at least 3.4 million American jobs. In 1985, before China entered the WTO, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $6 billion. In 2019, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled more than $345 billion.
CASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law-abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer.
It creates an official university policy that strongly affirms the importance of free expression, nullifying any existing restrictive speech codes in the process.
With the departure from the EU, the United Kingdom should be able to begin rejecting asylum claims from migrants intercepted at sea — although time will tell whether a more robust policy is actually implemented, as the Tory government has promised.
We have increased the size of the teams that review reports [of terrorist activity], reducing our response time significantly. We also look into other accounts similar to those reported and leverage proprietary spam-fighting tools to surface other potentially violating accounts for review by our agents, said the company. We have already seen results, including an increase in account suspensions and this type of activity shifting off of Twitter.
Ted Kennedy was talking about single payer in the 1970s, and Nixon proposed a plan that was almost exactly like Obamacare: you subsidize people to get insurance, you require them to get insurance, the whole nine yards — except it was more liberal than Obamacare. That was the Nixon answer to Ted Kennedy, he recalled.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far refrained from declaring a pandemic, but fear of the virus' spread has already prompted panic buying, hoarding and theft, along with warnings over shortages of protective gear.
So we think — what the Secretary described, is that pull-factor. We think that — by allowing children to apply for asylum in those countries [via the CAM program] and by making it clear that those that are not eligible for asylum will be returned to the countries, we think that we will take part of the incentive that human traffickers use to take thousands of dollars cash to take children on a long and dangerous journey, oftentimes facing physical and sexual abuse along the way north, to attempt to come into our country to take advantage of loopholes in our laws.

One of President Obama's taunts at Romney during the 2012 campaign said that the 1980s called and wanted their foreign policy back. It looks like the 80s called the Kremlin, too, and Vladimir Putin picked up the phone.
President Donald Trump, for instance, upon taking office in 2017, named two Democrats, Gary Cohn and Peter Navarro, to his staff. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Democrat donor, was tapped by Trump as director of the national economic council, a position with wide purview over economic decision making. Navarro, an economist who had previously run for local office in San Diego, California, as a Democrat, was appointed to serve as the White House's trade and manufacturing czar—a post he holds to this day.

It is hard to know how influential the Times' ever-escalating campaign against Jews will be on the American Jewish community. Survey results and other data indicate that the vast majority of American Jews are not buying the claim that Israel is morally infirm, incapable of discerning its national interest, and deserving of hatred and destruction.
In October 2020, Biden said he plans to allow U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere to decide whether his administration should keep tariffs on China or not. Lighthizer said this strategy did nothing in the past and called it a waste of time.

In a farewell address and tour on his way out of office at the end of last year, Ryan again spun all these big picture policy and political failures that have marked his tenure in federal office–and his entire time on the national stage–by listing a number of pieces of legislation that saw their way to passage during his time as Speaker. Ryan said in the speech:
The reciprocal reform, he said, would cut the economic incentive for the cartels to smuggle children and youths into the United States:
As an example, the presentation included a short paragraph about transgenderism and nonbinary sexuality, he wrote.
Whether the British people will ultimately notice any difference between Johnson's Brexit and no Brexit remains to be seen. One thing he has secured is an end to the Free Movement of People — but as his government is presiding over massive increases in non-EU immigration and record levels of effectively unchecked illegal immigration, it is likely that the overall net inflow of people will continue to rise.

Here we are in the tenth year of the war, and America and its allies are still chasing a mirage, lost at sea without a beach, he wrote, evidently about a year before U.S. special forces raided his compound, shot him, and dumped his body at sea, far away from any beaches.
Finally, Pelosi did something inexcusable: she accused President Trump of malice. Not only is it unseemly to accuse any president of bad motives, but the word malice has deep connotations in American oratory. At the height of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln urged Americans to have malice toward none. Pelosi implied the opposite.

Former RNC Chair and Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele will discuss President Obama's legacy.
Economists remain split as to how inflation will pan out over the coming months, largely because there's uncertainty surrounding the value of the pound. However, if the currency stabilizes then the impact of last year's depreciation will start to drop out of the annual comparison and that could see inflation fall back toward target and help support the economy.
The Framework recognizes that a free and open Indo-Pacific depends on robust American leadership. The United States has a long history of fighting back against repressive regimes on behalf of those who value freedom and openness.

In 1776, John Adams wrote, There is no good government but what is republican…[T]he true idea of a republic is 'an empire of laws, and not of men.' That, as a republic is the best of governments, so that particular arrangement of the powers of society, or in other words, that form of government which is best contrived to secure an impartial and exact execution of the law, is the best of republics.
Most tourists to the city come from neighbouring countries Switzerland and Austria but also many come from the United States.

Wang said the sudden onslaught of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] has accelerated the once-in-a-century transformation in an increasingly fluid and changing world, presenting the Chinese system as a model for the world to follow:
Biden views Mohammed bin Salman as a destabilizing force in the region and Saudi Arabia is desperate to shed this negative image. Ending the blockade against Qatar suggests that Saudi Arabia is interested in contributing to regional stability, Ramani said.
Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan in the 1980s returned to the motherland with an addiction rate than also approached 20 percent. This heroin bomb then does collateral damage back home.

He continued, The CFPB's concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable, unchecked director not only departs from settled historical practice, but also poses a far greater risk of arbitrary decision-making and abuse of power, and a far greater threat to individual liberty, than does a multi-member independent agency.

Schiff refused to answer any part of the question, claiming it was an attempt to smear his staff and out the whistleblower — whose identity he also claims he does not know.
We've put out what I think is the most comprehensive and toughest bill on campus free speech. What this bill does is ban so-called free speech codes, and free speech zones, as it also discourages administrators from disinviting controversial speakers who have already been invited by students and faculty members. That's what most of the other model bills do. But, what the Goldwater model adds to all that is insistence on punishment for students who shout down visiting speakers, or rip down posters for the talk that a speaker is going to give, or in any way interfere with the free speech rights of others. Right now, that's really the heart and soul of the free speech crisis. Even though I think it's absolutely essential that we ban these free speech zones and these restrictive speech codes, if you were to do all of that today, and still let these shout-downs take place, I think we'd still have a campus free speech crisis.
But as with almost everything about Britain, Brexit will remain the driver.
Cotton said, It's not enough, and it's certainly too late. Vladimir Putin is KGB. He always has been, he always will be. President Obama has consistently looked the other way from Russia's provocations and aggression. The DNC hack last year was just one minor item in what Russia has done over the last eight years, to include things like invading and occupying Crimea and supporting rebels in Eastern Ukraine as well as threatening NATO air ships — aircraft and ships and so forth.

They were legally free to live anywhere in Germany but now had to find apartments, which would be tough in prosperous Landshut, the district said in a statement.
And if we have any barriers to that, it's not that it's bad for them — it might be bad for them — but it's also bad for the entire public, said Jayapal, a former Indian migrant who argues that the nation needs a large inflow of immigrants to perform manual farm labor. Jayapal's Seattle district has had a rash of coronavirus cases, partly because the district is home to many Chinese visa workers and legal immigrants.
Demand Justice's formation was encouraged by former Obama White House counselor John Podesta, who served as chairman of Clinton's latest presidential campaign. We have ignored this field of battle for too long, Podesta told the New York Times regarding Demand Justice.
Coulter said the U.S. should model its illegal immigration policies on Israel's successful effort that has ended all illegal immigration into the country, as noted by Breitbart Israel Bureau Chief Aaron Klein. Coulter said:
Migrant workers built modern China, and are now being discarded
In November, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced the proposed new rule and opened it to public comment.
Krauthammer said, I think this is a disgraceful conclusion, because what they did, is they substituted their judgment, as to what constitutes a threat to American security for the president's. Now we were all interested in what they think, but that is irrelevant to the case. The case was, does the president have the authority to do it? And if he does, it's his judgment to make. And that's the plain reading of the law. It's he plain understanding of the Constitution. I think the policy was unwise, but that's irrelevant. I think it's very clearly legal.
If you don't think it's illegal, you're not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it, added the senator.
End all government funding for illegal aliens
Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opposes growing Chinese pressure to abandon Taiwan's sovereignty and promotes the use of diplomacy to encourage the world to defend Taiwan's democratic values. Tsai particularly opposes One Country, Two Systems, a policy in which China would acquire sovereignty over Taiwan, but be legally barred from imposing communism. One Country, Two Systems is the current policy in Hong Kong, where millions have taken to the streets protesting China's routine attempts to impose communist laws.
Pelosi's focus on a technological wall of sensors and drones helps the Democrats hide their push for more migration, despite its impact on Americans' wages, productivity, tax spending, crime, and civic peace, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.
The Vietnam War really changed when we got rid of deferments for college students because suddenly middle-class and upper-class kids were subject to a draft, he added. The people who run things don't care about the teachers' unions who are protected because they're either politicians in cities where the Democrats dominate and the teachers' unions dominate the primaries on those cities or because they're sending their kids to private schools anyway.
Hoyer said, Our position is we have to stop using the shutdown of the people's government as a strategy to obtain our objectives.
On January 4, for example, Pelosi said that a wall is an immorality — it builds walls in peoples' minds about who should come here.
Huawei has been at the centre of an increasingly tense diplomatic spat between Britain and the communist regime in Beijing after the UK announced that it would be banning all Huawei tech from its telecommunications networks by 2027.

In the first 100 days, Pence said that Trump picked a world-class cabinet filled with business leaders who know what it takes to succeed in a competitive marketplace.
In a separate complaint, attorney Joseph Gioconda wrote to New York's Grievance Committee for the Second Judicial District: At a minimum, Attorney/Senator Schumer's statements appear to be improper conduct that reflects upon his character and fitness to practice law in New York.
Holly O'Reilly, one of the main organizers of the anti-Trump protest March For Truth, was blocked by Trump following many critical comments on his statuses. In one tweet, President Trump discussed the British Prime Minister's anger that information relating to the terrorist attacks in Manchester were leaked. YOU ARE THE LEAKER, you bloody idiot. God, you're embarrassing. wrote O'Reilly.
If any nation should be disarming it should be the United States, says O'Keefe. [The U.S.] is destroying lives and is blowing apart women and children on a daily basis.
Cervellera, who is also director of AsiaNews.it, criticized the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Paolo Parolin, for suggesting that although we know that this is a bad deal, better a bad deal than no deal at all.
One former engineer claimed there is no way to protect private user information should it fall into the wrong hands, while a senior engineer called the company creepy Big Brother and said it disturbs him.
As Breitbart News reported in October, Catholic League President Bill Donohue noted the Democrat Party's hostility toward Americans of faith.
Monti was appointed a life senator by the Italian president in order to make him eligible to be the prime minister, the office normally being held by an elected politician. The change was made days after a similar coup in Greece, where a former chairman of the European Central Bank was installed as prime minister.
The new poll comes just over a month after the Sweden Democrats topped another poll taken by Demoskop in which they garnered the support from nearly one in four Swedish voters.
There is little doubt that Bolsonaro's control over Latin America's largest country will be received well in Washington, as his administration is planning to align Brazil's foreign policy closely with that of the White House on issues such as pushback against China the and recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Some migrants in need of urgent medical care were taken from the coastguard vessel but 116 of them remained on board for almost a week.
I really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane rights, of 'Let's hop a train to California,' Trump said during a rally last February.
Folks he's just getting started, Pence said of his boss President Trump, turning to the administration's agenda going forward.
Albania, as a whole, is a nation of mass emigration, spurred by an average wage of 340 euros ($388) and an unemployment rate affecting nearly one in three young people.
Andrzejewski asked, Can public figures, can public governments, violate federal law with no consequences and no penalties?
Second were those who came to dwell in their land as newcomers, seemingly corresponding to resident aliens, living in the land but without the full benefits of citizenship.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been calling immigration system broken for some time, and you were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?
Those four senators could force votes. Republicans control the chamber, 53-47, and are all but certain to acquit Trump. But it takes just 51 votes during the trial to approve rules or call witnesses. It also would take only 51 senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Trump.
In the meantime, wage growth for American workers is at risk as illegal immigration is set to majorly increase this year.
According to the paper, senior ministers, including Boris Johnson, learned of the position paper less than a day before it was published, and a number of them were furious about the new negotiating position.

Six weeks later, on February 8, the regulators imposed the type of net neutrality Facebook aggressively lobbied for and won in the U.S. to prevent telecommunications companies from charge discriminatory pricing for different Web services. The move essentially killed Free Basics' business model, which was all about creating a monopoly.
He also warned that poorer Germans had tangible existential fears as jobs become harder to find and the rich seem to care less about their concerns.
While Apple works to prop up other businesses, the company has provided obstacles for others. Last week, Apple banned Parler, an alternative to Twitter, from its app store, effectively excluding the Parler app from all iPhones, after President Donald Trump was banned from Twitter.
This president can talk about background checks all day long. But that's nothing more than a distraction away from the fact that he can't keep us safe and he supported every gun control proposal that's ever been made, he added. He doesn't support the individual right to own a firearm. That's been the position of his Supreme Court nominees. That's been the position of his administration. So what are we going to talk about, basketball? I'm not really interested in going over and talking to the president who doesn't have a basic level of respect or understanding of the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners in this country.
At this point, there is little doubt that the highest echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department broke their own rules to end the Hillary Clinton matter, but we can expect the inspector general to document what was done or, more pointedly, not done. It is hard to see how a year-long investigation of this won't come down hard on former FBI Director James Comey and perhaps even former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who definitely wasn't playing mahjong in a secret no aides allowed meeting with former President Clinton on a Phoenix airport tarmac.

The move comes as Democratic Party (PD) Chamber leader Graziano Delrio announced that the government would be looking at reintroducing the protection system for asylum seekers and refugees (Sprar) that had seen its centres closed and defunded by the security decree of former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.
The resolution expressed longstanding and international policy and we stand by those positions, English told reporters, according to the New Zealand Herald. Whether we agree with a country or don't disagree with them, we certainly prefer to have diplomatic connection and it's good that Israel has seen fit to restore their post in New Zealand.

The governor quickly stripped Travis County of state law enforcement grants. Travis County currently receives $125 million in state and federal grants that flow through the Office of the Governor, Governor Abbott's spokesman John Wittman told Breitbart Texas at the time. The governor's office is currently evaluating how much of that $125 million could be taken away under SB4.
Culturally, we are not telling them that they need to learn and they need to aspire.
However, a series of lawyers admitted to establishment media outlets that existing laws provide Trump with the legal authority to build a wall after declaring a national emergency.
Despite claims to the contrary, the Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit President Trump from sending military forces to the U.S.-Mexico border. Just as President Trump has the authority to declare a state of national emergency, he also has the authority to send troops to our southern border under certain circumstances.
From tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do, he added, and further advised Britons against attending large scale public events.
President Trump clearly has the authority to declare a state of national emergency. Less clear is is whether a declared state of emergency qualifies as one of the circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress under which Posse Comitatus applies. Resolving that question through months, or years, of litigation is probably less-than desirable for a President. Fortunately, Congress has already taken specific actions that obviate the need for litigation.
So, we hope that by reminding folks of the expectations – look, at the end of the day, it serves no one's interest to fire teachers, so I'm not going to lead with that, Jackson said, continuing:

But analysts note that China's slowdown is structural, as it becomes a more developed economy and faces demographic challenges such as a shrinking number of people of working age.
In a farewell address and tour on his way out of office at the end of last year, Ryan again spun all these big picture policy and political failures that have marked his tenure in federal office–and his entire time on the national stage–by listing a number of pieces of legislation that saw their way to passage during his time as Speaker. Ryan said in the speech:
Kris Kobach — Secretary Kobach served as the Secretary of State of the State of Kansas from 2011-2019. A leader in the national effort to stop voter fraud, he drafted and pushed for the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act of 2011, which made Kansas the first state in the Union to combine photo ID requirements at the polls, equivalent ID requirements for mail-in ballots, and proof of citizenship at the time of registration. John Daniel Moran Jr. — Mr. Moran is an American businessman, entrepreneur, and industrialist best known for his role as President and CEO of Moran Industries, Inc., a warehousing, logistics, and transportation company based in Pennsylvania that was founded in 1975. Erik Prince — Mr. Prince is an American businessman and Navy SEAL best known as the founder of the security firm Blackwater. He serves as Chairman of Frontier Resource Group, a private equity fund investing in natural resource opportunities in frontier markets. Dr. Robert S. Spalding III, Brig Gen, USAF (Ret.) — General Spalding is an accomplished innovator in government and a national security policy strategist. He was the chief architect of the framework for national competition in the Trump Administration's widely praised National Security Strategy (NSS), and the Senior Director for Strategy to the President. Angel Dad Steve Ronnebeck — Mr. Ronnebeck lost his 21-year-old son Grant, who was brutally executed by a criminal illegal immigrant over for a pack of cigarettes while working at a convenience store in 2015.
The Brexit journey is really just beginning, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in his opening remarks. While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way.

There is no getting around the simple reality that population growth demands a sizable number of couples having three or more children, which generally requires getting started on family life at a relatively young age. Financial incentives to defray the cost of having and raising children may be helpful, but Russia's experience offers the latest evidence that it takes more than money for populations to flourish.
The Times' influence operation against American Jews and American Jewish supporters of Israel is being carried out – conveniently enough — by its Jewish columnists. These writers run the gamut from far-leftists to neo-liberal former conservatives in the Never Trump camp.
I'm a practicing Catholic, Biden states in his vision for Catholic Americans, and adds, I believe faith is a gift. And the first obligation we all have is, 'Love your God,' the second one is, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' … 'Treat people with dignity.'

The present state of affairs has induced advocates and scholars to begin acknowledging the negative message that these selective abortions send about the value and equality of individuals with disabilities already living and working in the world, the article states.
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah, she went to shake his hand. Whether he snubbed her or didn't see, he didn't recuperate. Normally, the speaker of the House will say, To the member of Congress, to the joint session, it is my high honor and distinct pleasure to introduce the president of the United States. Speaker Pelosi just said, Members of Congress, I introduce the President of the United States. She did not include the high honor and distinct pleasure, which was also rather notable.

Sical sees himself as a failure compared to his peers who got through the obstacle course to win jobs in the United States:
In addition to banning the radical interpretation of Islam, a majority of French surveyed also supported deporting terrorists, too. Le Figaro reports 83 per cent supported deporting foreigners on French soil who have so-called 'S' (security) case files on them held by the security services — the French term demonstrating that an individual is considered a potentially dangerous radical by the French state.
The Islamic State forced out Iraqi forces in Ramadi in mid-May 2015. The militants stole weapons and captured the military headquarters. They then murdered anyone loyal to the government.
Our Cuba policy is focused on helping the Cuban people improve their lives, wrote White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes last week. Since charting a new Cuba policy, the United States has made regulatory changes to open up commercial ties between our countries at a time when a growing number of Cubans are self-employed. In Havana, the President will meet with Cuban entrepreneurs, or cuentapropistas, to hear their experiences. The event will include American entrepreneurs who will share their own experiences with their Cuban counterparts and look for opportunities to build long-term relationships.
Clare got a later boat back to [the] UK and we drove [the lady] to Clare's house where her husband and five kids were waiting. My husband drove.

The administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the Nation's borders and get the federal government back to work for the American people as soon as possible, the statement concluded.
[B]y its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.
The Times of Israel reports: A day after officials in Jerusalem said Israel and New Zealand agreed to end their diplomatic spat surrounding Wellington's co-sponsoring of an anti-settlements resolution at the United Nations, the country's leader rejected any suggestion that patching the rift equaled pulling support for the measure.
The case was brought by aggrieved members of Verified Liberal Twitter, a bottom-feeding group of Twitter users that cultivates likes, retweets, and followers on the platform by piggybacking on the President's tweets.
Their migration strategy is cruelty to ordinary Americans too,' she added.
Manchin added the work of the USCIRF is unique in the world.
Dear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump, I truly appreciate your words of encouragement, Bolsonaro responded shortly after. Together, under God's protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people.
Last year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he intended to cut Australia's permanent migration intake by about 30,000 people, citing public concern about congested cities.
You've got to think it has more to do with who is going to be in office come January 20th, CNBC anchor Becky Quick said on Squawk Box Tuesday.
If we liberate Palestine though the resistance until the 1967 borders, we will go directly to liberate the rest of Palestine and the territories of 1948, and there will be no negotiations, Zahar said at a conference in Gaza addressing international reactions to the new policy document, according to the Hamas-linked al-Resalah news site.
Regardless of the circumstances, I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives. On this occasion the Taliban chose to hide amongst civilians and then attacked Afghan and U.S. forces, said General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. I wish to assure President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan that we will take all possible measures to protect Afghan civilians. We will continue to assist the Afghan security forces in their efforts to defend their country.
In point of fact, the city introduced a modification to the city's farmers market vendor agreement just this year requiring sellers to comply with East Lansing's Human Relations Ordinance. Among other things, the ordinance prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.
3) Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet This is the biggest BS of the lot. The cooling of the Earth's climate between 1940 and the 1970s, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, was well known by climate scientists at the time. For instance, HH Lamb wrote this piece for the UNESCO's Courier magazine in 1973:
Speaking at China's 19th Communist Party Congress in October, Xi vowed to invest heavily in the nation's armed forces through the next several decades. The People's Liberation Army, he promised, would reach full modernization capacity in 2035 and become a world-class military by 2050 that can fight and win wars across all theaters.
McConnell prefers to model Trump's trial partly on the process used for Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. It, too, contained motions for dismissal or calling new witnesses.
After a New York Times reporter tracked me down for a quote about the wall, I gave him the following, but he chose not to run it. Why should the Newspaper of Record present the opposition's side honestly?

Thanks to Europe's open door 'refugee' policy and free movement within Europe, the attackers traveled unhindered, back and forth between Syria and France. Three of the terrorists who attacked had taken the migrant route, explained Ms. Le Pen.
I pointed this out in June last year in a piece titled Britain Unleashes a Green New Deal to Kill What's Left of the Economy.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Third, Pelosi never argued that Republican speakers John Boehner or Paul Ryan were equal to President Barack Obama. In fact, she made a point Thursday of defending Obama's controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy — even though DACA was implemented in defiance of Congress.
In a comment posted publicly on his Facebook page, MILO stated: The Washington D.C. Metro — the public transportation system of the swamp itself — has banned ads for my book. You already knew the mainstream media doesn't want you to read DANGEROUS. Now you can add the government to that list. What leftists fail to realize is that every banned ad, every negative review, and every nasty article about me is a ringing endorsement to the people that really matter — real Americans.
The ideological caucuses are looking to be a larger source of power in the majority since the groups' central purpose is to develop and debate policy. In the minority, much of the power has been delegated to the Congressional Tri-Caucus — composed of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
China seeks to dominate cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and bio-genetics, and harness them in the service of authoritarianism. Chinese dominance in these technologies would pose profound challenges to free societies. China's proliferation of its digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations will damage U.S. efforts to promote our values and national interests in the Indo-Pacific region and, increasingly, in the Western hemisphere and at home.
If the E.U. decides not to extend the right to be forgotten policy worldwide, it has been suggested that geolocation technology be used to block certain search results for those inside the E.U. but not for those outside of it:
President Donald Trump essentially blocked southern migration in 2020 — three years after his inauguration — by making the obstacle course almost impossible to get through. But that win only came after he declared a national emergency and imposed an incomplete but wide variety of border reforms.
But Trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if Britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the Huawei deal.
Unsurprisingly, Biden's pro-migration, cheap-labor policies are very unpopular, especially among legal immigrants whose wages, jobs, and neighborhoods are at most risk.
Recent reporting described two NSC staff holdovers from the Obama administration attending an all-hands meeting of NSC staff held about two weeks into the Trump administration and talking loudly enough to be overheard, saying, 'We need to do everything we can to take out the president. On July 26, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee hired one of those individuals, Sean Misko. The report further describes relationships between Misko, Lt. Col. Vindman, and an individual alleged as the whistleblower. Why did your committee hire Sean Misko the day after the phone call between President Trump and Zelensky, and what role has he played throughout your committee's investigation?
Jennifer Sexton, the director of fitness and wellness at Stanford, explained that the new program allows female students to feel comfortable while exercising at the Stanford gym. We created it to make a place where women and trans women at any level would feel comfortable working out, Sexton said.
The figures were compiled using data collected from investor visa programme statistics of each country; annual interviews with around 800 global high net worth individuals and with intermediaries like migration experts, second citizenship platforms, wealth managers and property agents; data from property registers and property sales statistics in each country; and by tracking millionaire movements in the media, the International Business Times has reported.
This is such an urgent objective for China that it shuts Taiwan out even when Taiwanese membership would clearly benefit the safety and security of Chinese citizens, as with health, environmental, and law enforcement agencies.
Trump has repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. needs a tougher approach to trade that would put American workers and companies first. He has already pulled the U.S. out of a proposed trade deal with Pacific Rim countries and has started the process to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.
Project 21 is asking the federal government to look into whether blanket assumptions by an employer in such situations constitute a violation of employees' civil rights.
In November 2017, the Catholic bishops initiated a petition drive, urging the Conservative government to make good on its campaign promise to remove the cap while noting that the Secretary of State has acknowledged that the rule adversely affects Catholic families. In its election manifesto, the Party had called the regulation unfair and ineffective and recognized that it kept the Catholic Church from opening new schools.
The newspaper had accused Virgin Trains of censorship because it was no longer selling the title. Some legislators also criticized the decision and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called the ban pompous.
President Donald Trump, for instance, upon taking office in 2017, named two Democrats, Gary Cohn and Peter Navarro, to his staff. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Democrat donor, was tapped by Trump as director of the national economic council, a position with wide purview over economic decision making. Navarro, an economist who had previously run for local office in San Diego, California, as a Democrat, was appointed to serve as the White House's trade and manufacturing czar—a post he holds to this day.

Trump has ridiculed the impeachment process for months, and he responded to the opening of the trial by once more branding it a hoax.
Nationwide, roughly 1.5 million U.S. white-collar jobs are being held by foreign temporary workers, ensuring lower salaries for American graduates. This massive white-collar outsourcing industry exists because the federal H-1B, L-1, J-1, TN, OPT, and CPT visa programs allow U.S. companies to import temporary foreign workers and also provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign employees each year.
Berman cites Rosstat figures that Russia had 70,000 fewer births in the first four months of 2017 than it did over the same period in 2016, suggesting an overall population decline of 300,000 by 2018. Russia's current population is just over 143 million, but President Vladimir Putin has predicted it could shrink to 107 million by 2050.
Second were those who came to dwell in their land as newcomers, seemingly corresponding to resident aliens, living in the land but without the full benefits of citizenship.
This huge economic change will impose a huge psychological shift among Democrats, plus their billionaire and media allies, who have persuaded themselves that voters really want business groups to get an unending stream of cheap-labor in the hope that the cheap-labor will also vote Democratic. Many Democrats have already started their journey with shock on November 8, 2016, but it just takes time for people to work their way through denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, and eventually, acceptance and renewed hope. A DACA delay will help Democrats get through the bargaining stage, prior to guilt in summer, anger in November, then depression in Christmas and acceptance in the Spring of 2019. 9. Delays are not a primary problem because the 3.25 million 'dreamers,' including the 700,000 'DACA' illegals are foreigners and their interests are simply less important than Americans' interests, regardless of any deadline. Few of the illegals will be deported in 2018, partly because enforcement officers are chasing the many criminals protected under Obama's deputies. But if Trump's American First policy is to make any progress, he must first start by helping Americans get higher wages before offering the huge benefit of citizenship to foreigners who have jumped the line at the nation's large and generous immigration offices.
Biden said, I think there's a 2nd Amendment. I think the 2nd Amendment is being very badly interpreted. It's not consistent with what they're — our founders intended, in my view. You saw Justice John Paul Stevens say that we should — because it's been so prostituted, we should repeal the 2nd Amendment. It was about a standing militia. It's a long story. I won't go into all the legal side of that having taught it in law school. But there's rational or irrational policy.

In the Saudi editor's analysis, the sailors' arrest deprived Obama of the chance to boast of the legitimacy of the nuclear agreement and to tell America, which is divided on the Iranian issue, as is the entire world, that Iran has changed and will once again become an active member of the international community [a country] that renounces violence and respects international treaties and agreements.
Firmly in control of British politics, it now seems unbelievable that they changed their minds on giving Johnson his election — possibly their long string of parliamentary victories and the anti-Brexit mood among street activists in multicultural London had persuaded them they were fighting from a position of strength.
Today Netflix is worth £50bn, 1,300 times its offer to Blockbuster — which has gone from 3,000 stores to a museum in Oregon, for people who want to remember what video cassettes look like.

If citizens struggling to cover their own health care nurture resentments against any group perceived to be getting help to which they themselves are not entitled — or worse, if they grow xenophobic and subscribe to the notion that immigrants carry diseases — they might be compelled to endorse policies even more draconian than those already in play. That would create more anxiety among noncitizen communities, which would lead to fewer people seeking medical care when they need it. From there, the epidemic would only get worse.
This is why reaching a two-state solution should remain a priority for us all, he said.
The U.S. and the United Nations put Soleimani on sanctions lists in 2007, though his travels continued. In 2011, U.S. officials also named him as a defendant in an outlandish Quds Force plot to allegedly hire a purported Mexican drug cartel assassin to kill a Saudi diplomat.
The UK Telegraph reports the clip was released over the weekend, in coordination with North Korea testing a new high-thrust rocket engine. South Korean analysts believe this test represented a significant step toward accurate multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missiles, although North Korea is still thought to be several years away from delivering nuclear warheads with such weapons.
The main sticking point between the two countries has long been the role of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in any political transition, and there was no indication that they had reached agreement on that, adds the Times.

It invited the media, and all Democratic candidates, to attend a protest outside the Palms Hotel before the Democrat debate next Wednesday.
Pelosi seems to suggest the legislature is the most important because it comes first under Article I, but the president has some leeway to act independently, especially in national security and foreign policy, and the courts can overturn legislation.
The lawyers representing the mother of a child fathered by Hunter Biden recently filed a motion seeking to have the former vice president's son held in contempt of court for repeatedly refusing to obey a paternity and child support suit-linked order to provide financial documents, including his 2017 and 2018 personal tax returns.

Despite concerns about the prospective deal – which includes amnesty and a path to citizenship for potentially millions of illegal aliens, just like previous amnesty pushes – Sessions heartily approved of the rationale behind the Trump administration's agenda behind the concessions they are demanding in exchange for amnesty: a merit based system to replace chain migration and visa lotteries and building a wall on the southern border. There is nothing wrong, nothing immoral to develop a policy of immigration we believe strengthens America and makes us a greater country, he told the audience.

When the Department of Health declined to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed as parents, respondents filed suit in circuit court seeking a declaration that petitioner's refusal to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed violated their constitutional rights, as well as a declaration that certain statutory provisions were unconstitutional. Respondents also sought to enjoin enforcement of petitioner's policy against naming both spouses on the birth certificate under these circumstances and an order requiring petitioner to issue corrected birth certificates naming both spouses.
It is easy to see why the administration would want to keep the missing missile, and the Castro regime's obstinate refusal to return it, out of the public eye while relations with the island gulag were being normalized, but one would think members of Congress opposed to President Obama's policy would have spoken up.
Tlaib is one of several Democrats involved in the Justice Democrats, a group associated with newly-installed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), which seeks to advance a left-wing policy agenda and to replace white, male Democratic incumbents with more diverse candidates.

I'm campaigning amongst my one million followers on social media, on the radio, on television, on platforms, on the streets, for Britain to leave for a series of important reasons to which you have not yet turned.
The focus on the President's emergency powers comes after GOP and Democratic leaders jointly blocked the President's campaign promise to build a border wall. So far, the President has managed to get just $3.2 billion for wall construction, and most of that spending is limited by rules governing the types and location of wall construction.
While some political analysts say they expect little change in policy under Biden, many on Wall Street and in Beijing expect a warming of relations between with the U.S. and China despite widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.

On Tuesday evening, Sheriff Hernandez responded to the courts ruling, stating:
HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price said before introducing Pence, that the work of HHS goes beyond the border of the United States and recalled a recent trip to Liberia. He lauded U.S. efforts to beat back Ebola in Africa. Price remarked of the challenges Americans face when it comes to obtaining quality health care. He voiced the goal of getting us to a healthcare system where Americans can afford health care and health coverage. He spoke of stabilizing markets, opening up enrollment options and … with the goal of installing a more patient-centered healthcare system.
When you put that over making sure people have decent jobs and healthcare, like, it's a fucking no-brainer why we're going to God damn lose an election, he adds.

Last month, the Supreme Court threw out a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the state of New York to Trump's order in a 6-3 decision. The unsigned majority opinion said the challenge was premature because the impact of the order is not known.
For instance, FIRE believes students should have access to the active assistance of counsel in most disciplinary cases, as opposed to only those with a potential penalty of greater than 30 days' suspension or those involving expressive conduct. The bill draft also addresses a few items about which FIRE does not take a position, and which FIRE would therefore not address through its own efforts. But there is little doubt that passage of this model legislation would represent a real improvement in free speech protections in states that do not already include such protections in state law.

His voters support the lower-migration policy because it raises wages by reducing the inflow of government-supplied immigrant workers. Rising wages are good for national politics if you're a politician, for sure, Tom Donohue, the long-standing chief of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in early January. He added:
It is a moral failing and a national shame when a father and his baby daughter drown seeking our shores. When children are locked away in overcrowded detention centers … When President Trump uses family separation as a weapon against desperate mothers, fathers, and children seeking safety and a better life … When children die while in custody due to lack of adequate care.
Young Americans for Freedom is excited to host this very high profile event at the University, said Grant Strobl, chairman of Young Americans for Freedom at the University of Michigan.

He has also announced his opposition to Trump's Pentagon rules. Trump's rule does not bar people who claim to be transgender but do require each service member's recorded gender market to match the bright line' of their biology. A 2018 Pentagon report set the policy, saying:
The agencies are also deporting new border crossers back to Mexico — and flying others back to their distant homelands — without putting them in the ICE detention centers.
As I wrote last week, there is no question there's a growing optimism in the country, an increase in overall satisfaction, a growing belief we are on the right track. Like I said, I've been following these numbers for going on a decade now, and on the right track/wrong track question, this country has been upside down by 20,30, and even 40 point margins going back to 2006, the last two years of the George W. Bush administration — and except for a few momentary blips, straight through the Obama administration.
CBP had previously limited imports into the United States of Xinjiang cotton products by specific companies believed to benefit from slave labor, but has now expanded that to all Xinjiang cotton. It has not limited shipments from other parts of China, where evidence suggests Uyghurs have been bussed in to engage in forced labor.
Demand Justice, which formed last year, took center stage when it helped lead opposition to Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Breitbart News reported that less than one hour after Trump announced Kavanagh as his nominee, Demand Justice had already put up the website stopkavanaugh.com, exclaiming: We need to demand that the Senate defeat the Brett Kavanaugh nomination.
[W]e learned during the course of our review that in August 2016, the supervisor of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, SSA 1, participated on behalf of the FBI in a strategic intelligence briefing given by Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to candidate Trump and his national security advisors, including Michael Flynn, and in a separate strategic intelligence briefing given to candidate Clinton and her national security advisors. The stated purpose of the FBI portion of the briefing was to provide the recipients a baseline on the presence and threat posed by foreign intelligence services to the National Security of the U.S. However, we found that SSA 1 was selected to provide the FBI briefings, in part, because Flynn, who was a subject in the ongoing Crossfire Hurricane investigation, would be attending the Trump campaign briefing.
In fact, very few of the roughly 3.25 million illegals — perhaps as little as 1.7 percent — hold four-year college degrees. Data provided by the Migration Policy Institute shows that roughly 90 percent work in unskilled jobs and would rely on welfare and aid for most of their lives.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
1. Delays help Trump pressure Democrats to accept his popular pro-American policies. Many Democrats don't believe Trump will allow the DACA work-permits to continue expiring in March, so feel little pressure to trade their policy priorities for continuing work-permits. So if Trump declines to negotiate a deal until after the expirations accelerate in March, Democrats will recognize that Trump is playing hardball. They [now] think they have the upper hand, they don't really believe he will pull the trigger and let [DACA] expire, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. It is important to not just wait until March but to wait until [more illegals] lose their work permits to ensure the Democrats come back to the table and stop saying 'My way or the high way.' 2. Delays help Democrats make mistakes. In December, Trump called the Democrats' bluff when they suggested they would shut down the government spending unless the GOP gave them an amnesty. That was a bluff in December, and it will be a bluff in January or March or November 2018 because polls show that Americans strongly oppose any government shutdown to help illegals. But Democratic leaders are under pressure from angry illegals — many of whom believed the Democrats' shutdown-or-amnesty threats — and that grassroots pressure may cause the Democrats leaders to make concessions or make further mistakes, such as blocking the next budget deal which is due by January 19.
Student activists at Yale University who believe that fraternities contribute to discrimination, harassment, and sexual assault are campaigning to institute a major policy change that would allow fraternities to accept females.

Presidents Day 2015 comes in the midst of an upheaval about the state of U.S. foreign policy, and particularly regarding the State of Israel, whose Prime Minister will arrive in two weeks to deliver what will amount to a rebuke of President Obama's negotiating stance on Iran. As this particular holiday lends itself to ranking the presidents from best to worst, it is worth considering how they compare on relations with Israel, which has been–despite ups and downs–a staunch ally since 1948.
–Hungary suspends admission of illegals to transit area due to threat of coronavirus —
The Trump administration prioritized foreign policy initiatives that made it more difficult for the Cuban communist regime to oppress its people, in contrast with the appeasement strategy of predecessor Barack Obama. Among the policies implemented against the Castro regime were the conclusion of people to people tours to Cuba – an exception to the embargo under Obama – and the outlawing of American cruises to Cuba. While tourism to Cuba is technically not legal under the longstanding embargo, Obama legalized tourism via cruise ships, netting the Castro regime millions of dollars.
They included in their letter a request for government assistance, including building a secure accommodation facility for the migrants, a commitment to projects in the area designed to boost the economy, and the suspension of business taxes in the area for the next ten years.

Government sources say Mr Johnson has 'buckled' under pressure from Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill to let Huawei help to build the system. They claim that Sir Mark, the powerful head of the Civil Service, has 'manipulated' Mr Johnson into agreeing the deal by presenting it as a 'fait accompli' – and by 'nobbling' the British security services into dropping their objections. A source said: 'There is a massive row brewing over all this. 'Sedwill is telling people not to 'worry their little heads about it', and manipulating Boris into appeasement by saying that as the deal was already given the green light by Theresa May, to cancel it would require him to actively reverse the decision of a predecessor.' Sir Mark has told the Prime Minister that a ban on Huawei equipment would delay the widespread introduction of 5G for at least two years after the 2025 deadline in the Tory manifesto – and would also delay the availability of super-fast broadband.

DeLisle suggested Taiwan can play the values card by arguing that it plays by the rules of global agencies much better than China does, and if all else fails, Taipei can get some diplomatic mileage out of simply acting like a full member of international regimes, even when Beijing blocks formal membership.
Speaking at China's 19th Communist Party Congress in October, Xi vowed to invest heavily in the nation's armed forces through the next several decades. The People's Liberation Army, he promised, would reach full modernization capacity in 2035 and become a world-class military by 2050 that can fight and win wars across all theaters.
We want (the government) to bring us scientific data or prove our analysis wrong, he added.

7. Obama is required by his Oath of Office to defend our troops abroad. By that oath, Obama should be arguing that our troops are protected by the Geneva Convention–not looking for loopholes that allow them to be abused. In arguing that Iran did nothing wrong by parading U.S. sailors in front of the cameras, and forcing a female sailor to wear a hijab (head covering), Obama is inviting more abuses of American troops' rights and dignity in the future.

The stinging result for the conservative CDU was accompanied by a surge in backing for the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), which had sparked outrage by suggesting police may have to shoot at migrants to stop them entering the country.
7. Let the engineers design a barrier that works. The wall should not be a Democratic or Republican issue. Nor should it be a budget issue: Democrats are fighting over a mere $5 billion, when their own budget bill spends tens of billions more in excess of White House requests on other items, including foreign aid. The wall — or fence — is little more than an engineering problem. We should let experts make their recommendations about what kind of physical barriers to build at each point along the border. Let the engineers do their job — and let's put America first.
Biden's deputies are promising to delay some of their campaign promises, he said. But this isn't good enough, not by a long shot, Morgan said.

On Monday, China's Foreign Ministry extended its invitation to visit the centers to any party who abides by China's laws and regulations and does not interfere with its internal affairs, Global Times noted in a separate article, echoing other news outlets.
Redlining, if you remember, was the term where banks took whole neighborhoods and said, 'People in these neighborhoods are poor, they're not going to be able to pay off their mortgages, tell your salesmen don't go into those areas.' And then Congress got involved — local elected officials, as well — and said, `Oh that's not fair, these people should be able to get credit.' And once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn't as good as you would like.
The shadowy general who was in command of Iran's proxy forces was responsible, according to the Pentagon, for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq during the height of the war there. White House officials said Trump decided to take action because Soleimani was plotting unspecified future attacks targeting Americans as tensions between the U.S. and Iran have reached a boil.

The listicle was published by the BBC before poisonous bitter yuca killed dozens of Venezuelans relying on the vegetable to survive. By March 2017, at least 28 had died of consuming bitter yuca, a species of yuca that is inedible and causes a complete deterioration of the digestive system and vital organs. The tragic deaths triggered a wave of helpful life hack-style articles on how to identify bitter yuca. El Nacional suggested biting into a tiny raw piece at marketplaces to ensure it had no raw flavor (edible raw yuca should taste essentially like flour) and not eating yuca that is difficult to peel or takes too long to soften while boiling.

She said at Davos: There is a European way to foreign policy and foreign security policy where hard power is an important tool. In 2019, she boasted that Europe's army is already taking shape. Indeed, in 2019 the EU already had 47 joint defence projects underway, including a joint fleet of warships, electronic warfare systems, and airborne refuelling aircraft.
But his greatest notoriety would arise from the Syrian civil war and the rapid expansion of the Islamic State group. Iran, a major backer of Assad, sent Soleimani into Syria several times to lead attacks against IS and others opposing Assad's rule. While a U.S.-led coalition focused on airstrikes, several ground victories for Iraqi forces came with photographs emerging of Soleimani leading, never wearing a flak jacket.

The Cuban government responded with a screed condemning the United States for alleged human rights violations and claiming that the Cuban people enjoy fundamental rights and liberties.
Still, Sanders' campaign says the senator's comment to Colbert wasn't realistic. Even if several senators were looking to decamp from Washington to Iowa quickly after the impeachment trial concludes each day, they would be headed to different parts of the state.

In order to avoid risk, a carrier would have to operate so far away from the battlefield that the battlefield would be out of the range that the aircraft could travel without refueling. The report concludes that the United States can either operate its carriers at ever-increasing ranges… or assume high levels of risk in both blood and treasure, and suggests that the days of the aircraft carrier may be ending.

Subsequent to Ferg-Cadima's letter, Obama's Justice Department and Education Department issued a joint Dear Colleague letter as an official policy, declaring that both Title IX and Title VII—which generally prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex—require all schools and employers to embrace transgender policies, and that anyone declining to do so can be sanctioned for violating federal law.
Although they are on opposite sides of the war, pro-Syrian opposition Turkey and dictator Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia reached an agreement late last year to establish a horseshoe-shaped buffer zone in Idlib free of jihadis and their heavy weapons by October, to no avail. The Russia-Turkey pact is part of mutual efforts to end the war in Syria — raging since March 2011.
These are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.
The same goes for so many of the influential figures in government and the Civil Service and industry who have been pushing for Huawei (and also for the similarly counterproductive and pointless HS2): this is the Remoaner resistance doing its damnedest to ruin post-Brexit Britain.

It should be clear that though children are usually trotted out as at most risk of hunger, it is really adults who are most exposed to food insecurity. Only 4 percent of the food insecure are kids. About 7 percent are elderly, and a whopping 89 percent are non-elderly adults.
The ruling may well be judicial trolling from an anti-Trump judge, and there's a question mark on whether it would stand on appeal — including eventually a Supreme Court appeal. But the fact remains that a federal judge has said that the First Amendment applies on social media.
The Nature Conservancy senior freshwater ecologist Jennifer Carah told the Water Education Foundation that illegal marijuana cultivation across California imperils fish and human drinking and agricultural water quality and supply: The unpermitted forest clear-cutting and road construction can dramatically increase erosion, which can cause large amounts of sediment to flow down into streams, causing water quality problems.
President Donald Trump needs a strategy … and the strategy has to be to trade something that is not immigration, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.
Reports today suggest that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is 'sticking by' Priti Patel (who, symbolically, sat next to him on the government benches). Boris is not stupid; his chief advisor Dominic Cummings even less so: lose this one and they lose the entire game.

Olsen said, Mitt Romney had a great chance to be President of the United States, and he blew it. He blew it because he didn't talk about the things that were making people insecure. He wasn't talking about an economy in a way that made them think that he cared about them. He didn't talk about immigration in a way that made them think that he was serious about it. He didn't talk about trade in a way that made them think that he cared more about American jobs than investors' profits.

It is incredibly important in President Trump's administration to make the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available and we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world … we will highlight the central nature of religious freedom and its importance to individuals in countries. We believe religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how individuals of all faiths have the right to worship as they choose, or if they choose not to. Every country ought to honor that.

But instead of explaining to the Times' readers why Trump's promise to build a wall shook the political world to its foundation, the newspaper trotted out campaign adviser Sam Nunberg's boast that he invented build the wall because Trump's mind tends to wander. It was only a dumb talking point, you see, not a serious campaign pledge.
I call it a reciprocal tax, Trump said. If a country is charging us a 100 percent tax, and we're charging them nothing for the same product … why didn't these politicians just say reciprocal tax? We're going to be very heavy on the reciprocal tax.

The nuclear weapons program in Iran and the ballistic missile programs are under the control of the IRGC, he said. If we name them as a foreign terrorist organization, all kinds of statutory sanctions kick in. I think it will have a dramatic impact on the Iranian regime. Opponents of naming the IRGC as a terrorist organization include many in the administration who don't want to admit Iran is violating the nuclear weapons deal and who are afraid that if we name the IRGC, that Iran will pull out of the deal.

Olsen went on, It's not [between Romney and Cruz], because Donald Trump picked up the hundred-dollar bill that had been lying in front of them for about a decade, and cashed it. And that's the hundred-dollar bill of dissatisfied blue collar workers who want a government that's limited in its scope but active in the protection of Americans because they are Americans. They think they can put the genie back in the bottle by getting rid of the president. Well, good luck. The fact is, this is what people wanted for years. They've had a taste of the apple. They like it, and they're going to expect the next Republican leader to follow suit, or they're going to abandon the party.
Paul Ryan's jobs giveaway to Irish graduates is prompting Democrats to start throwing about claims of ethnic favoritism. Whatever.
Ocasio-Cortez is a looker and I hazard a guess has had the privilege of turning men into gibbering idiots for most of her adult life. I have little doubt she has been trotting out utter nonsense and yet can make it look convincing and credible because she has hardly ever been challenged on it. This is what happens when beautiful women grow up in Leftist circles and are rarely called out for mixing up a billion with a trillion. This builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then suddenly when she enters Congress and her policies are examined by people on the Right, she thinks this is down to sexism. No. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.
This is not the first time that the leftist media has tried to spin virtue out of the coronavirus crisis. In March last year, you'll remember, the MSM was in ecstasies over the fact that — thanks to the total destruction of its tourist economy — Venice now had cleaner canals.

The letter is not a formal declaration of legal action but does imply that if the users are not unblocked, legal action may follow. Jameel Jaffer, the Executive Director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said in a statement, Though the architects of the Constitution surely didn't contemplate presidential Twitter accounts, they understood that the president must not be allowed to banish views from public discourse simply because he finds them objectionable.
A report by Real Clear Investigations (RCI) suggests Sheriff Scott Israel did not fire Deputy Scot Peterson–aka, the Coward of Broward–following the Parkland school shooting because Peterson covered up a sexual assault incident involving the sheriff's son.

Every year, the United States spends $67.5 billion to ensure the worldwide free flow of oil. Often produced in unstable parts of the world and shipped through insecure chokepoints, the U.S. military works to make sure crude oil from other countries makes it safely onto the global market. Yet while this global oil market benefits some nations, its volatility threatens the American economy and undermines U.S. national security.

Some parts of the Framework are redacted, but the available text makes it clear that containing China without aggressively confronting it, and perhaps sparking a wider regional conflict, was a major strategic goal. Protecting Taiwan, preserving free and open access to the Indo-Pacific region, and containing the nuclear threat posed by China's clients in North Korea were outlined as major goals, even as the strategic document recognized that the balance of powers in the Indo-Pacific is inexorably shifting.
All YouTube channels that Google deems to violate its policy, including President Trump's will receive a strike that temporarily prevents them from uploading new videos.
Trump's foreign visits have typically been light on sightseeing, but this time, the president and first lady Melania Trump are to visit the Taj Mahal.

But that isn't the worst of it. Not only did many workers lose their jobs and others have their take home pay cut, but the study also found that the higher minimum wage cost the city an additional 5,000 jobs that would have been created if businesses could have expanded at the rate seen before the new wage was forced upon them.
In addition, he credited the bank's stimulus package in August, which included a cut in the benchmark interest rate to the record low, as well as a stronger global economy and the continued willingness of U.K. consumers to spend despite a predicted squeeze on incomes.

Countries such as China, Iran and Russia have spent years and a great deal of money developing integrated systems of surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, submarines, surface ships and aircraft whose purpose is to prevent US aircraft carriers from having freedom of movement, whether in the Persian Gulf, the eastern Mediterranean, or the South China Sea.

Trump's motorcade will travel amid cheers from a battery of carefully picked and vetted Modi loyalists and workers from his Bharatiya Janata Party who will stand for hours alongside the neatly manicured 22-kilometer (14-mile) stretch of road to accord the president a grand welcome on his way to the newly constructed stadium. Tens of thousands of police officers will be on hand to keep security tight and a new wall has come up in front of a slum, apparently to hide it from presidential passers-by.
I hear Facebook has an entire department devoted to figuring out why Telegram is so popular. Imagine dozens of employees working on just that full-time.
The context of her remarks was a discussion of the equality of women — but Pelosi's reference to the Constitution made clear that she was also making an argument about actual power as a matter of law.
Strategic partners do not talk via Twitter and social media, Cavusoglu said.
For far too long, thousands of us at Google — and other subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google's parent company — have had our workplace concerns dismissed by executives. Our bosses have collaborated with repressive governments around the world. They have developed artificial intelligence technology for use by the Department of Defense and profited from ads by a hate group. They have failed to make the changes necessary to meaningfully address our retention issues with people of color. Most recently, Timnit Gebru, a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the few Black women in her field, said she was fired over her work to fight bias. Her offense? Conducting research that was critical of large-scale AI models and being critical of existing diversity and inclusion efforts. In response, thousands of our colleagues organized, demanding an explanation. Both of us have heard from colleagues — some new, some with over a decade at the company — who have decided that working at Alphabet is no longer a choice they can make in good conscience. Workers have mobilized against these abuses before. Organized workers at the company forced executives to drop Project Maven, the company's artificial-intelligence program with the Pentagon, and Project Dragonfly, its plan to launch a censored search engine in China. Some of Alphabet's subcontractors won a $15 minimum hourly wage, parental leave, and health insurance after an employee outcry.
New trade deals with non-EU countries the EU did not previously have deals with may provide more tangible benefits — although the most lucrative, with the United States of America, may already have slipped away, as the Tories have squandered pro-Brexit Donald Trump's entire term.

It's my opinion that the reason they don't want you to marry someone local is to stop you getting local residence and getting legal status in Western Europe.
In short, there is ample reason to believe Trump's decision was about more than thin skin, and his skin didn't have to be very thin to think Abrams wouldn't be a good fit for an administration he previously regarded as an improbable catastrophe. Six weeks of non-stop leaking and bureaucratic sabotage might understandably have reduced the president's tolerance for a Number Two official at the State Department who (according to Senator Paul) once declared Donald Trump unfit to occupy the chair where Washington and Lincoln once sat—but evidently had no such reservations about Hillary Clinton.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is back as the most powerful woman in the House of Representatives, but as a more diverse and far left 116th Congress takes shape,it is clear minorities will want to use their newfound status to get appointed to important committees and be at the table on a wide range of policy issues.

Commission President von der Leyen, however, did not call for the halt to the internal movement of people within the bloc. On Sunday, she had said that protecting people's health should not result in blocking goods and the movement of essential staff across the bloc, and that Free Movement must be maintained to keep our internal market going.
If House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi rejects those concessions, she and other Democrats will quickly see how she is martyring her political agenda by opposing a few billion dollars worth of fencing in 2019, Vaughan said.

The baffling mystery is how Ehrlich—despite his utterly failed forecasts—can continue to be hailed today as a serious scientist with something important to say to the world.
The Washington-imposed economic policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.

In addition to the more then 300 sanctuary cities that may find their funding in the balance, the Justice Department also announced a new process for criminal aliens being released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.

Trump reportedly agreed to the One China policy in a February phone call with President Xi Jinping.

4. Illegal immigration hurts all Americans, but especially legal immigrants, minorities, and the poor. With better border enforcement, black and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest ever, and wages are rising for all Americans. Those gains are threatened by illegal aliens who compete with U.S. citizens and legal immigrants for jobs. Illegal immigration also hurts public health care and education, as illegal aliens place additional burdens on services that are already struggling. We can have a generous welfare state, or open borders, but not both.

Doug Jones has made clear whose side he's on, Sessions said. He has supported Speaker Pelosi's gambit to withhold the Articles of Impeachment for purely political timing reasons, not for substantive reasons. He's supported that.

Dear Madam Speaker: United States Armed Forces personnel have deployed to Libreville, Gabon, to be in position to support the security of United States citizens, personnel, and diplomatic facilities in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. This deployment of approximately 80 personnel is in response to the possibility that violent demonstrations may occur in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in reaction to the December 30, 2018, elections there. The first of these personnel arrived in Gabon on January 2, 2019, with appropriate combat equipment and supported by military aircraft. Additional forces may deploy to Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the Republic of the Congo, if necessary for these purposes. These deployed personnel will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes such that their presence is no longer needed. This action was taken consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct United States foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions.

Struggling Americans are going to go to their mailboxes and find four-figure checks to help with their bills. Why? Because the Senate stepped up. Many American families who poured everything into a restaurant or a shop or a small manufacturer are going to keep making payroll and keep their businesses alive, because this Senate stepped up. Hundreds of thousands of workers in key sectors, who might well have been laid off through no fault of their own, will instead get to keep their job and continue their career, because this Senate stepped up. And for the health care heroes who leave their own sleeping children and drive to the hospital for an all night shift, who spend hour after hour healing the sick, comforting strangers and literally battling this disease, there will be more masks in their supply closets, more funding for their hospitals, and soon more new treatments to administer to their patients, because this senate stepped up.

The incoming House Democrat majority will have 235 members, while Republicans will have 199 members and there will be one vacancy in North Carolina's yet-to-be-resolved ninth congressional district.

In recent years, he had switched to organic methods, planted timber-producing trees to diversify his income, and worked with a cooperative to earn a premium on the world price. Benítez also had a large extended family in the area, who pitched in with harvests and lowered his labor costs.

It was this adherence to ideas and the rule of law that separated Washington from a Napoleon Buonaparte—another great man who helped topple the French Monarchy to established a republic, but eventually drove his nation to an empire of arbitrary rule. And it was the commitment to the Constitution and ultimately the virtue of the American people that allowed America's founding generation to create an empire of liberty.

The comments came from leadership contender Clive Lewis, who said at his campaign launch Friday that he wanted the public to have a discussion about what a modern state looks like, and whether there would be a place for the monarchy in it.
The British fishing industry contributes less than 0.05 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and fisherman have expressed concern that the sector could be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, reported the Financial Times on the 17th of this month, ahead of the announcement the EU would continue to control fishing policy for years after Brexit.
But they have also trafficked in more apocalyptic predictions — fears of a Eurabia, of mass Islamification — that were somewhat harder to credit. Until recently, Europe's assimilation challenge looked unpleasant but not insurmountable, and the likelihood of Yugoslavian-style balkanization relatively remote.
While Sturgeon warned Scots that their public services are at stake should the population not rise, migration-driven GDP growth has been described as a Ponzi scheme which lines bosses' pockets at the expense of the environment and taxpayers' quality of life.

While most companies accused of using Xinjiang slave labor — even those reportedly lobbying Congress to let them continue the practice, like Nike and Coca-Cola — do not promote the fact that they do business in the region, some openly boast about it. In the credits at the end of the Disney film Mulan, the corporation thanks Xinjiang police authorities, responsible for running the concentration camps, for their help in filming the movie. Companies like Japan's Uniqlo advertise that their clothing is superior because it is made from Xinjiang cotton, famous for its superb quality.
Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses As a son of Eritrean refugees, those words mean everything.

But he noted a tailing off in the growth of infrastructure investment, which could prove problematic. With property investment slowing, the strength of China's growth this year will depend on whether infrastructure investment is able to offset this decline, he said.
In their letter to The Telegraph, Rowan Williams, Richard Dawkins and more than 60 other signatories—including Dawkins' fellow atheist crusader Philip Pullman—expressed their view that allowing more than 50 percent of students from a single faith would highlight and entrench the differences and prejudices that so often divide society. Diluting the religious population in a school, on the other hand, serves to emphasise instead the common values that we all share.
The economic crash means the federal government must stop the inflow of H-1B workers so that sidelined American professionals can get jobs, a Florida-based American computer expert told Breibart News March 19.
We are in a state of war, a war against Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus]. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people, Durante added.
The threat comes with Brussels and Warsaw already at loggerheads over changes to Poland's constitutional court which the EU has warned could merit sanctions as a systemic threat to the rule of law.
When, in January 2016, I wrote that despite being a lifelong Republican who worked in the previous three GOP administrations, I would never vote for Donald Trump, even though his administration would align much more with my policy views than a Hillary Clinton presidency would, a lot of my Republican friends were befuddled. How could I not vote for a person who checked far more of my policy boxes than his opponent? What I explained then, and what I have said many times since, is that Trump is fundamentally unfit—intellectually, morally, temperamentally, and psychologically—for office. For me, that is the paramount consideration in electing a president, in part because at some point it's reasonable to expect that a president will face an unexpected crisis—and at that point, the president's judgment and discernment, his character and leadership ability, will really matter.
Demand Justice was founded by Brian Fallon, who served as press secretary for Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The group's digital team is headed by Gabrielle McCaffrey, who was a digital organizer for Clinton's campaign.
Home Secretary Priti Patel is just about the only proper Conservative within the Boris Johnson administration — so naturally, the left-leaning Remainer Deep State is trying to destroy her and claim her scalp.
The group, composed of activists who have pushed the Green New Deal and backed the four far-left members of the Squad — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) — endorsed Sanders for president this week.

D'Souza and Ayers debated famously in a YAF-sponsored event at Dartmouth in 2014 and live on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File that year as well. In previous debates, Ayers has declared that he's not proud to be an American and accused the country of doing horrible things. like committing genocide. The pair's tense exchanges in past debates will come to a head as they confront one another over this controversial topic on which their opinions are diametrically opposed.
The Propel Center was designed by Ed Farm, an education social justice group that works primarily with Birmingham City Schools and adults in the greater Birmingham area. Its key partners are Apple and Alabama Power.
Most likely, the Obama administration also declined to admit Iran had violated the Geneva Convention rights of captive U.S. Navy sailors last week for the same reason.

The Times quoted analysts who labored mightily to blame the travails of the Iranian middle class on President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions, but the very same article makes it clear the Iranian government was already fiddling with the economy in a variety of disastrous ways to conceal the effects of corruption, political repression, foolish policies, and the squandering of Iran's windfall from the nuclear deal on foreign adventures.

He's going to welcome into his coalition Democrats and independents who believe that we've not defended our jobs and our manufacturing sufficiently on international trade, who think that it's long past time to end the massive illegality at our border and defend America's interests at the border and other issues that he's been thinking about that appeal not just to Republicans but to all Americans, Sessions said.
The Tennessee law represents a growing movement by state legislatures to counter these trends in the public institutions over which they have authority. It represents perhaps the broadest combination so far passed into law of the different types of campus free speech protections being supported by advocates nationwide.
A U.S. airstrike killed Soleimani, 62, and others as they traveled from Baghdad's international airport early Friday morning. The Pentagon said President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military to take decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing a man once referred to by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a living martyr of the revolution.

Apple has stated on conference calls that that its plan is to sell 4 million iPhones per week and carry five to seven weeks of inventory. But a 5.3 million increase in channel inventory indicates Apple has a significant shortfall in customer sales. That would more than justify Gartner's call that iPhone customer sales and market share are shriveling.

THE FACTS: That is not one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.
The article, titled, Before Trump, Steve King Set the Agenda for the Wall and Anti-Immigrant Politics, sought to link King's controversial statements with his long-standing support for a tough immigration policy.
To put it bluntly, people burying their kids due to knife crime, fearful about violent extremism, plagued by a collapse of civility and antisocial behaviour, marooned in postcodes where the only visible authority is a parking ticket aren't interested in the bruised feelings of some well-heeled permanent secretaries. They want things done. Their preference will be to back a Home Secretary who is on their side and impatient for results. The political rhymes with the personal. And that constituency dwarfs the Whitehall machine.
Murawski noted in his report the scope of the new policy:
Biden's officials seem to be listening. Morgan said:

All of the team at Cirque le Soir are really upset by the suggestion that there was anything malicious in our turning away of Mark Ingram and his friends from the club on Monday 27th February. We proudly celebrate diversity, not only as part of our shows, but as part of who we are. We would not dismiss anyone as too urban and we would not turn anyone away on the basis of their ethnicity, sexuality or any other characteristic – other than those expressed in our door policy – as an exclusive members club, we cannot guarantee entry to anyone and full discretion always lies with the door, we particularly discourage casual dress code, intoxicated customers and male heavy entourages. Discretion lies with our door staff and while we sympathise with Mark and his friends we fully support our employees' right to challenge groups that do not adhere to our door policy. Admitting an all-male group goes against our policy and is clearly stated on Facebook and on all reservation confirmation emails.

While Poland moved quickly to ban travel from coronavirus hotspots in the early stages of the pandemic and was an early adopter of masking rules, its lockdowns have not been as stringent as in some countries, and the national-conservative government has announced 1 billion złoty (£196 million) in state assistance for highlanders impacted by closures — but Pitoń has dismissed the funding as scraps and akin to bribing the public with their own money.
Despite months of low deaths and infections earlier this year, New York continues to lead all other states in the number of coronavirus fatalities (38,549), data maintained by Worldometer showed Monday evening.
Abolishing the monarchy has long been a pet project of the hard-left in Britain.

The GOP plan has three parts and the CBO based its reports on the first phase.
Besides money wasted on cigarettes, there is the belief, particularly harmful to the poor, that fast food is a cheap way to eat. But fast food is not the poor man's friend. Nothing could be further from the truth. A regular diet of fast food not only makes you fat and can kill you, but it's also far more expensive per calorie than cooking and eating at home.
Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-mass migration populist Lega, and Luigi Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment populist Five Star Alliance, have been locked in round after round of talks about forming a new government which has been claimed would be a nightmare scenario for the EU — but negotiations appear to have stalled.
For his part, Putin was as gracious as a big winner with big plans can afford to be, declaring after his meeting with Kerry, What we have been able to achieve on Syria has been possible only thanks to the position of the U.S. top political leadership, President Obama.
We believe that our plan will cover more individuals at a lower cost and give them the choices that they want for the coverage that they want for themselves and their family, not that the government forces them to buy, Price said.

I had this experience in arms control deals when I was in the Bush 43 State Department, Bolton recalled. I understand what Tillerson's putting up with, but you've got to stand against this because just the inertia of the people who negotiated the deal, the people who supported it, are very reluctant to admit they were wrong and that Iran, in fact, is violating it because it's a way of undercutting all of their efforts.
Meanwhile, agency officials are moving ahead with plans to import 85,000 new H-1B workers in 2020. Breitbart News asked the Department of Homeland Security if the agency is considering curbs on the 2020 award of H-1B visas because of the coronavirus disaster. No changes at this time, a spokesman responded on March 19.

Personally, I would have loved that Russians would have interfered like that, Karaganov added. Our American partners should be educated that they live in the crystal palace and they should stop interfering into internal affairs of other countries, they should stop regime changes, et cetera. I mean if we do that, that would be a great lesson for Americans. I am not sure whether we were able to do that.

He was a bit more optimistic in his take on the first meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Germany last week. I'm sure the outcome of these talks was constructive. And thanks to this, Russian-US relations will gradually start pulling out of the current crisis, he told Russia's TASS news service.
Pitoń, who believes the lockdowns are destroy[ing] Poland and Polishness and will destroy the middle class, small and medium-sized enterprises and kill several hundred people a day if they continue, says the entrepreneurs he represents are this determined because they realise they won't survive another month – so they have no choice.
Speaking to O Globo, Mauro Paulino, Datafolha's director general, said he did not expect Lula to lose votes since 24 percent of people became informed about his conviction, as most were low education, lower-income voters—the same demographic that has traditionally supported the leftist politician. The newspaper notes that most of those who said they were unaware of the appellate trial only had an elementary school education and tended to make barely more than minimum wage.
Compared with these and other Hellfire-related breaches or risks, it seems hard to justify being all that upset about a dummy missile ending up in Cuba, he continues. It's certainly embarrassing, and doubly so because Cuba is refusing to return the thing, but anyone who might credibly buy it from Cuba, and to whom Cuba might credibly sell it, could easily have been a potential Hellfire customer for a long time now through overtures to even less-ethical actors.
For example, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters on January 21 he wants to import more low-wage workers:
Still, these big declines are just minor corrections in the scope of things, Dalio wrote. There is a lot of cash on the side to buy on the break, and what comes next will be most important.
Dr Ramsay said that while there may be extremely rare occasions when the second dose of a vaccine is unavailable or if it is unknown what vaccine the patient initially received, it might be better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all.
Another population expert, Fred Pearce, has more recently noted that birthrates are now below long-term replacement levels nearly everywhere, a trend he examined in his 2010 book, The Coming Population Crash and Our Planet's Surprising Future.
Noting wistfully that because of financial constraints, the terror group ditched its past practice of dispatching a Santa to give out gifts in Christian neighborhoods, the Times lauded Hezbollah, which seeks the annihilation of world Jewry and has seeded terror cells across the globe, because it sent representatives to a Christmas concert sponsored by Iran.
Speaking on a panel in Atlanta, flanked by predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, Powell said the Fed's monetary policy is flexible. He acknowledged the December stock market sell-off, saying central bank officials are listening carefully to financial markets.

On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling against President Trump's immigration order was a disgraceful conclusion, because what they did, is they substituted their judgment, as to what constitutes a threat to American security for the president's.
Singer Pink tweeted, Title X gives women access to contraception and more control over their lives, health, careers & economic security — and a gag rule takes that care away:

New York Post Op-Ed Editor Sohrab Ahmari wrote that GOP-corporate divorce is a necessary step forward in order for the Republican Party to get back to its working and middle class roots — representing the interests of the least connected to the Washington, D.C. political establishments. Ahmari asked:
Let's be clear what this is really about, Cox said. This president is trying to create an illusion that he's doing something to keep people safe. He needs to do that because the truth is his policies have failed miserably. We saw that materialize itself in San Bernardino when we had a terrorist attack. This president didn't use it as an opportunity to unite this country. He didn't use it as an opportunity to lay out a plan to defeat terrorism. He used it as an opportunity to impose more gun control on law-abiding Americans.
Merkel's strident critics in the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, also piled on the pressure after the regional polls, which serve as a key test ahead of general elections in 2017.

We paid lip service to that through something called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which for 40 years running, through the Kennedy administration and the Nixon administration, Carter, all the way on down, has been a total fiasco. No one paid attention because the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of that program were largely in the middle of the country. Over the last 40 years, there have been exactly two articles written in any significant newspaper about how that program was not working, he said.
He is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status … there are about 400,000. They are going to lose their legal status soon. He's willing to extend that. The DACA recipients, they are all tied up in court but I think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable if you could get wall funding.
As the transcript shows, President Zelenskyy recognized precisely the point. He responded to President Trump by noting that [t]he issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty[.]

The Trump concessions include a quiet Christmas request for $2.5 billion instead of the current request $5.7 billion for wall construction in 2019, Trump's decision to drop plans for a concrete wall, and Trump's offer to restart former President Barack Obama's Central American Minors program that was intended to shuttle youths and children from Central America to their illegal migrant parents living in the United States.
But what about the right to national identity, to national security, to culture — fundamental rights never addressed by the Compact, Szijjártó concluded, eliciting a spontaneous round of applause.
Gov. Jerry Brown countered by insisting that what Hutchens did was actually compliant with state law. Becerra's new guidance aims to make that clear — and take the sting out of the federal lawsuit.

That wouldn't be a reason to raise interest rates, unless we start to see inflation or other imbalances that would threaten the achievement of our mandate, he said, referencing the Fed's dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and price stability.
One of the offshoots of that is when it came to globalization, which is another sign of progress in the world — or it would seem to be — they basically didn't pay any attention to all the people who were the victims of globalization. Every other country across the world has job retraining programs so the middle class isn't left out in the cold when we make a trade deal, whether it's with China or anybody else, said Brill.
The Home Secretary has also pledged to reform the United Kingdom's fundamentally broken asylum system, vowing to introduce legislation for the biggest overhaul of the system in decades.

It also said that Fed officials had discussed assuring market actors that the central bank wouldn't consider raising interest rates until unemployment fell below 6.5% or the medium-term outlook for inflation rose above 2.5%. Those numerical triggers weren't formally adopted by the Fed until later that year.
I'm going to have a Secretary of Education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf, and only if this person believes that our Secretary or Secretary of Education nominee is absolutely committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone will that person actually be advanced to be Secretary of Education, the senator told supporters at a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Two weeks prior, Warren vowed to ensure transgender women aren't in the same prisons as men if she is elected president.

If Twitter is a public forum where users have First Amendment rights, that could make Twitter bans unconstitutional as well. It might also have knock-on implications for other social media platforms, like Facebook. That would present a huge problem for Jack Dorsey and other Masters of the Universe, who continue to purge conservative users from their platforms.
First, Pelosi does not lead the legislative branch. She leads only one chamber of that branch — and the House is generally considered the lower chamber relative to the Senate. Moreover, she only leads at the pleasure of her party, and is only one among equals. The Constitution mentions the Speaker but does not give the office special powers.

On the one hand, you have situations on YouTube where they shut down a site or say it is inappropriate, Schweizer explained. That could be somebody at a relatively junior level at YouTube who just decides 'I don't like what Dennis Prager's teaching is on Judeo-Christian values or whatever, it's offensive to me so I'm just going act in my capacity to censor it,' they do that all the time.
Former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino explained in his videos about various abortion procedures that mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, which the mother's body produces to nourish the pregnancy. When progesterone is blocked, the lining of the mother's uterus deteriorates, and blood and nourishment are cut off to the developing baby, who then dies inside the mother's womb.
The New York Times last week dismissed Tehran's happy talk about the economy and lamented the devastating effect of sanctions on the Iranian middle class, which was already suffering from the absurd mismanagement of Rouhani's regime, especially its habit of manipulating the currency to cover up economic shortfalls.
He also called on citizens to practice social distancing, something he said would naturally go against the nature of the Cuban people.
Migration also allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, shortchange labor in the cities, impose tight control and pay cuts on American professionals, corral technological innovation by minimizing the employment of American graduates, undermine labor rights, and even get many progressive journalists to cheerlead for Wall Street's priorities.
I think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach, he said. Paul Ryan, who is supposed to be helping President Trump get through his agenda in the House of Representatives and the congress more generally, should have known better. He either didn't, which justifies removal on the grounds of incompetence, or did – in which case I think the argument is that he's simply not a reliable partner for the president in getting this agenda done.
Alongside the call for automatic renewal of visa workers, the investors' group is also calling for immediate relief … [from] immigration enforcement, the release of many prisoners, and the renewal of work-permits for the roughly 600,000 migrants covered by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals' quasi-amnesty.
But ministers cannot be tried for actions taken while in office unless their parliamentary immunity is revoked.
We have not given the [illegals] the opportunity or [the] certainty to be able to fully contribute to the country, said Jorge Lima, the senior vice president of policy at the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group. That is not just hurting them, but that's hurting us.
The Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the progress of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers free preventive care including contraception by repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.

It was the predetermined end of a partisan crusade that began before President Trump was even nominated, let alone sworn in, he proclaimed.
In other words, this was a clandestine agreement cooked up by the administrative state with no public consultation.
The President went to the negotiating table in good faith. He started with a far smaller [wall funding] number than the original $25 billion and was willing to negotiate further. The [Democratic] response was crickets. At this point, Republicans need to stop negotiating with themselves and wait for the Democrats to come to the table with a offer.
In a quarterly report issued to Congress, the Lead Inspector General for Overseas Contingency Operation (LIG-OCO), which covers activities by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S. Department of State (DoS), and the U.S. Agency for International Development, auditors found:
Statewide, [NY] hospitals so far have only administered approximately 46% of allotted doses, Daily News reported.
Pressed on whether MBS should be chastened over the Khashoggi killing, the Saudi intervention in Yemen, and the abduction of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri in late 2017, Pompeo cited the deep long-standing relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to explain that the Trump administration understands the Saudis will act in their country's interest but has shared with them places we think that the kingdom isn't doing what it is we wish that they would do.
He was a bit more optimistic in his take on the first meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Germany last week. I'm sure the outcome of these talks was constructive. And thanks to this, Russian-US relations will gradually start pulling out of the current crisis, he told Russia's TASS news service.
Despite four years of the establishment media spreading lies about Trump being a racist, satisfaction with race relations jumped 14 points, from 22 percent to 36 percent. What's more, on the position of blacks and other racial minorities, satisfaction rose nine points, from 37 to 46 percent.
Business leaders in Saxony are afraid that the attention PEGIDA has brought, and likely the German media response, is giving many the impression that Dresden is a haven of xenophobic activity. Leaders met with regional vice minister Stefan Brangs to counter the image and make the city have a more welcoming image.
The other 11 Israeli passengers were evacuated from the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship Thursday after spending more than two weeks quarantined off the coast of Japan. They are currently in quarantine in Israel.
In bad news for would-be Labour leader Clive Lewis who appears to have decided not to let the crisis go to waste in using the present news cycle to float his anti-monarchy ideas, repeated and frequent polling in the UK shows sustained support and popularity for the Queen and monarchy. 2018 surveys found just 16 per cent of Britons said there should be no monarchs in future after Queen Elizabeth II dies, and seven-in-ten supported having a monarchy in future.
Bringing back the gravity and prestige of the presidency was a big deal to the Reagans, according to Rosebush, and it is not just there for the president's aggrandizement. Nancy Reagan had a huge role to play in bringing back that prestige and Rosebush said that when you went to the White House, you felt it.
And the public's opinion around our continued involvement after 20 years in Afghanistan is no secret at this point, he added. I can't tell you what's going to happen if they decide that a presence and involvement in Afghanistan or Iraq is going to continue … they have to make a very strong compelling case if they decide if that was the best thing for the administration to pursue.
Parler CEO John Matze said in a recent statement that the site could be offline for up to a week as it searches for a new web hosting provider. Speaking to Fox News early on Sunday, Matze stated:
In the construction industry, wage suppression is significant, with H-2B foreign workers being offered more than 20 percent less than their American counterparts. In the fishing industry, foreign workers were offered more than 30 percent less for their jobs than Americans in the field; and in the meatpacking industry, foreign workers got 23 percent less pay in wages than Americans.
The irony is that, despite being 94 percent nonwhite, Meyerholz Elementary is one of the most privileged schools in America. The median household income in Cupertino is $172,000, and nearly 80 percent of residents have a bachelor's degree or higher. At the school, where the majority of families are Asian-American, the students have exceptionally high rates of academic achievement and the school consistently ranks in the top 1 percent of all elementary schools statewide. In short, nobody at Meyerholz is oppressed, and the school's high-achieving parents know that teaching intersectionality instead of math is a waste of time—and potentially dangerous.
Authorities then took Soleimani's body to Mashhad later Sunday. His remains will go to Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, followed by his hometown of Kerman for burial Tuesday.

A shortage of sanitary products, even in foreign currency stores where there is a far greater selection of products, has led to large queues of people outside the shops that offer them. Last month, Minister of Internal Trade Betsy Díaz Velázquez told the official Granma newspaper that shortages would last until at least April due to economic constraints. The shortages are unrelated to hoarding or coronavirus-related spending. Cubans still use ration cards for many basic goods.

5. Obama claimed the Geneva Convention applies broadly, even to non-parties not officially at war. In a seminal foreign policy speech in 2007, candidate Obama made it clear that he considered terror detainees protected by the Geneva Conventions: As President, I will close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act, and adhere to the Geneva Conventions. Yet terrorists are not parties to the Convention, or officially at war with us.

… directly flows from the requirement to not deny equal professional services or be parties to a plan to discriminate. Specifically, bias against protected classes revealed through the public posting of hate speech could result in REALTORS® not taking clients from certain protected classes or not treating them equally, which would lead to violations of the Fair Housing Act due to overt discrimination or disparate impact.
However, mobility for seniors has recently become more difficult after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that in order to protect seniors, who are more at risk from coronavirus, they should self-isolate for 12 weeks as a precautionary measure. Health minister Matt Hancock had said on Sunday that seniors may be asked to self-isolate for up to four months even if they have no symptoms.
Conte, who has remained prime minister while Salvini provoked his own ousting from government in August last year, says he was not the one to decide whether the migrants should be allowed into port.
How do you try this case, quite frankly if you want more information, and not have Hunter Biden come in? And not ask Joe Biden, 'Mr. Vice President, how could you not know that your son was receiving $3 million from the most corrupt gas company in the Ukraine, and do you think that is good government and good foreign policy?'
Biden has repeatedly said he will support men's claim to female identity and women's claim to male identity.
The woman who was found in Phoenix to have doctored the lists, they tried to fire her, and under civil service rules she was able to appeal, he recalled. She hired a lawyer, there are all kinds of law firms that specialize in protecting civil servants. The appeals judge in what's called the Merit System Protections Board, if you can believe it, ruled that even though she was in charge of the hospital, she wasn't really directly responsible for this, so she couldn't be fired. In fact, she got a merit bonus that year.
What viewers don't understand is how lazy media personalities are. They are merely quoting what someone told them. They don't know. Their expertise consists of memorizing a set of talking points, like ABBA memorizing the syllables to English words without knowing what they meant.
The board of directors of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) has moved to direct both the professional and private speech of its members with a ban on what the board considers to be hate speech and harassing speech.
A Politico investigation last year revealed that Afghan heroin has contributed to the growing drug overdose epidemic in the United States. However, DEA has reported that heroin primarily originates from Latin America and fentanyl is smuggled into the United States from China. DEA officials have conceded that Afghanistan is the top supplier of heroin in neighboring Canada, which borders many of the U.S. states impacted by the overdose epidemic.

The Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees sounded a tone of outrage this week at an Obama administration policy that has allowed for the release of at least three criminal aliens charged with drunk driving and implicated in the murder and severe injury of Americans this year.
That starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function.
In their reports, tweets, and statements, Democrats progressives and executives recognize the obstacle course — but blame everyone else for the human cost of their worldwide invite.

Other complaints: I can't afford to buy groceries. Will you pay my phone bill for me? I haven't even gotten an oil change since I started this job (in August). But maybe I could find someone on Craigslist who won't mind all of that because they'll look at the dark circles under my eyes and realize I need the cash more than they do. Have you ever drank (sic) a liter of water before going to bed so you could fall asleep without waking up a few hours later with stomach pains because the last time you ate was at work?
The U.S. is talking up the prospects of tying up a trade deal with Britain this year and thinks it should be pretty straightforward to accomplish given how similar the two economies are.
When the campaign was created, the campaign organizer specifically stated on the campaign page, 'If we don't reach our goal or come significantly close we will refund every single penny,' GoFundMe spokesperson Bobby Whithorne told The Hill on Friday. He also stated on the campaign page, '100 percent of your donations will go to the Trump Wall. If for ANY reason we don't reach our goal we will refund your donation.' However, that did not happen. This means all donors will receive a refund, Whithorne continued. If a donor does not want a refund, and they want their donation to go to the new organization, they must proactively elect to redirect their donation to that organization. If they do not take that step, they will automatically receive a full refund.
The Chinese Communist Party reacted with ire to the new limitations.
The Fox opinionist insisted that there are two things that Americans must understand in this debate.
Visiting American officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east Jerusalem, which is contested between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump himself, however, also toured the area in a previous visit.
Amnesty International reported that the kingdom also issued an eight-year travel ban for Alaa Brinji and fined him 50,000 riyals ($13,300).
The State Department announced on Monday that Pompeo would cut his Middle East trip short and cancel a planned visit to Kuwait because he must return to the United States to attend a family funeral.

To achieve greater pay equality, social scientists say — other than women avoiding marriage and children — changes would have to take place in workplaces and public policy that applied to both men and women. Examples could be companies putting less priority on long hours and face time, and the government providing subsidized child care and moderate-length parental leave.
We must all take responsibility to reject language that ridicules, condemns, or vilifies another person because of their race, religion, gender, age, culture or ethnic background, the archbishop said.

According to the poll, 41 percent of Millennials supported Roe's reversal, with 33 percent opposed and 27 percent undecided. However, after being informed that Roe allows abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy, 51 percent said they opposed the decision, and 54 percent opposed it when they were informed abortion could be used as a form of contraception or when a mother does not want a baby of a particular sex.
George Soros has an army of shadows working in Hungary. We want to unmask it. We want to show that migration is not a human rights issue but a national security issue, he said.
Later developments changed the game and they had to tell the truth, he said.
Beijing (AFP) – China's economy grew last year at its slowest pace in three decades, hit by weak domestic demand and trade tensions, but while officials warned of further headwinds, separate figures Friday suggest the downward trend is bottoming out.

Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy will discuss the latest Brussels suicide bombing, the death of Otto Warmbier, and the USS Fitzgerald's collision off Tokyo Bay.
The [progressives'] goal is increasing the number of people moving here. If that means that it has to be done in a way that is inconvenient and sometimes even cruel for the migrants, that's okay because the objective is increased immigration at essentially any cost — even the cost to the migrants themselves.
Founded as The Sterilization League of New Jersey, EngenderHealth today focuses on reproductive rights and women's health. The organization was founded by the notorious eugenicist Marian Stephenson Olden, who began to promote compulsory sterilization of persons with traits considered to be undesirable while working for the Princeton League of Women Voters.
Yet in their criticism of the column, and of The Dartmouth for publishing it, many (though not all) Dartmouth organizations escalated the rhetoric further, decrying Spector and his column as hateful, toxic, vicious, privileged, ignorant, patriarchal, white supremacist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, oppressive and endangering lives.
That threat of going to prison is also going to be dropped, with Baroness Morgan set to say at the Policy Exchange think tank: Many people consider it wrong that you can be imprisoned for not paying for your TV licence and that its enforcement punishes the vulnerable.

Meanwhile, online vitriol towards Ma has heated up (or been ramped up) dramatically. Usually known as Uncle Horse – as his Chinese surname 'Ma' means horse – he has recently been damned as a money-grabbing 'vampire' who exploits the poor, in state media outlets strongly criticising him, even the People's Daily. For a tycoon acclaimed around the world for his entrepreneurial brilliance, as well as generosity and flamboyant promotional activities, that is an extraordinary turnaround. Jack Ma is now embracing supervision at an undisclosed location, the CCP mouthpiece has reported. […] A statement in the leading state media outlet said there would be no Jack Ma era, and that reflects the current Chinese slogan that China is entering a 'new era.'
I think it should go very quickly, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Automatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020. This should include DACA recipients who may no longer be able to renew because of the closure of USCIS offices and require an active DACA status to be eligible for protection from deportation and to be able to continue to legally work in the U.S. Many DACA recipients are healthcare workers on the front lines of this crisis.
Between 1995 and 2006, the USDA defined four broad categories of food security: food secure, food insecure without hunger, food insecure with moderate hunger, and food insecure with severe hunger. In 2006, they changed their categories to persons with low food security and those with very low food security. They dropped food insecurity with hunger because not enough respondents reported that they felt hunger at any point during the reporting year. This ought to be a tip-off that something is fishy with government hunger numbers.

Tommy Xie, head of Greater China Research at OCBC Bank, said more supportive state policies such as tax incentives have helped stabilise national growth.
We think over half of the undocumented are uninsured, said Ken Janda, an adjunct professor of healthcare management at Rice University. That's a challenge because if they don't have the cash to pay, those costs are shared by the rest of the community. Either tax dollars pay for them, or … those costs have to be pulled out of insurance premiums and insurance dollars from other sources.

The takeover is a result of a Turkish court ordering that a court-appointed board of trustees run the Feza Media Group, which owns Zaman. Erdogan's government has accused the writers at Zaman of having ties to the cleric Gulen, formerly a Justice and Development Party (AKP) ally now considered a terrorist by Erdogan's government. Turkey announced an in-absentia trial against Gulen in October for terrorism charges, as Gulen is currently exiled in the United States. He has also faced legal troubles in America, accused of running a corrupt charter school system feeding into an Islamist cult. The FBI raided a number of Gulenist charter schools in 2014.

The first indications of a sea change in American policy came against the recent gains made by Russian and Syrian forces in Palmyra, Homs, and other places, during which U.S.-backed opposition groups were forced to abide by the ceasefire, said the official. It is encouraging, but too little and too late. With American backing, the rebels ravaged Syria and exported their ideology to other places, including Turkey and Europe, where we've now seen the results.
But that pablum promise sets no limit on the number of eligible migrants and is no deterrent for migrants who rationally — and decently — hope to walk, climb, talk, and lie their way into good jobs for themselves and good schools for their children.

We can certainly provide assistance and support, but at the end of the day, those countries have to get back together.

China is firmly opposed to this, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday, in response to a question from a reporter about the CBP move. 'Forced labor' is the biggest lie of the century made by persons and agencies in some Western countries including the United States, with an aim to restrict and suppress the relevant Chinese authorities and companies and contain China's development.
He added: Additionally, there is no mention of our having the ability to apply immigration controls. Concern over lost control over migration was a significant issue in the referendum.

Goldberg insisted that the Jewish people's right to self-determination is contingent on Israel's satisfaction of the Palestinians' demands and its appeasement of the left's ever-expanding list of grievances. Israel is guilty of a raft of sins, she alleged — from failing to give the Palestinians a state (despite the fact that the Palestinians have rejected every offer of statehood Israel has put forward); to standing with right-wing European governments – which stand with Israel; to supporting President Donald Trump – who supports Israel; to cultivating good relations with Saudi Arabia – which is supposed to be the point of peace processes Goldberg and her comrades supposedly want to advance.

In the week prior to the election, Kabila's election commission said that the election will still be held, but will be delayed until March in three cities: Beni, Butembo, and Yumbi. The reasons given for Beni and Butembo are that there are Ebola outbreaks in those cities and that voting would be dangerous.

On election day, the local government of Beni held its own elections, just to prove that voting was not dangerous.

Twitter does not have an official policy banning the naming of Ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower, but it has mistakenly taken down accounts for mentioning his name.

He's been in office for almost half a century. I follow this rather carefully and I don't know of a single piece of religious liberty legislation he's ever penned. If he's in favor of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, well, that's rather deceitful because he's now in favor of the Equality Act which, if it were passed … would literally destroy the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed under President Bill Clinton.
With the president's reelection reckoning just ten months away, barring some unforeseen turn of events, Trump will have an easy time asking Americans the classic reelection question: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? And if former Vice President Joe Biden is the 2020 Democrat nominee, that question will help to clarify an even starker choice. After all, it is the failed Obama-Biden administration Trump has improved upon.

How that happened is one for the ages: All of a sudden, when she opposed Pelosi, a letter she wrote seeking a lenient sentence for a Cleveland-area disgraced former judge convicted of beating his wife resurfaced. The timing could not have been better for Pelosi: that same judge had just been arrested on suspicion of brutally stabbing his wife to death after release from prison on the domestic violence charges for which Fudge sought a more lenient sentence for him. The judge has since been formally charged with his wife's murder, and pled not guilty, and Fudge's nascent bid for the speakership ended before it even took off. She dropped out of the running, took a token subcommittee chairmanship, and then endorsed Pelosi for speaker.

Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class.

An adversary with A2/AD [anti-access/area denial] capabilities would likely launch a saturation attack against the carrier from a variety of platforms and directions. Such an attack would be difficult – if not impossible – to defend against.

When you turn the economy over to Main Street America and business, the economy grows, but the way we are going now, we can never catch up with the spending… We gotta quit spending. Quit spending, that's what businesses do, that's what families do, and we need to do that in federal government, the congressman said.

The IRGC, as it's called, is really the principal means by which the ayatollahs are trying to get a hegemony in the Middle East, through a variety of mechanisms. The Quds Force, which is really the tip of the spear, they were responsible in an earlier incarnation for the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon going back to 1983. They've been killing Americans for a long time, he said.

The surprise fall, the first since last October, was largely due to falling gas prices at the pump as lower wholesale crude prices were passed on to drivers. Despite the fall, living standards in Britain are still falling as price increases outpace wage rises.
Biden's meeting included Xavier Becerra, his nominee to lead Health and Human Services (HHS), who as California attorney general has implemented one of the strictest sanctuary state policies in the nation — even going as far as to say the state would prosecute employers who cooperate with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
Several large companies pulled their advertising from Google and its sites, including YouTube, last month, citing their adverts appearing on extremist and offensive content.
Border arrivals in December 2020 jumped by 80 percent above December 2019, partly because the cartels and coyotes are telling their customers that President-elect Joe Biden will end the border curbs, the chief of the Customs and Border Patrol agency said Tuesday.

The fundamental problem is that Biden and his progressives see large-scale, wage-cutting migration as a core value… the highest values of our nation — and they view migration as far more important than economic development in Central America, Africa, Latin America — or in central Los Angeles, central Detroit, or anywhere else in Americans' home country.
In 2006, Senate Democrats — including then-senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, and Joe Biden — voted to secure a fence along the United States southern border.

Since he was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate, an emboldened Trump has been purging the Justice Department, National Security Council and Pentagon of staff he considers disloyal.
The European Union has long operated military forces and organised foreign deployments, although they have been comprised of military units on loan from member states working under EU command, rather than new uniformed personnel in EU uniform and reporting directly to Brussels. EUNAVFOR's Operation Atlanta has seen EU warships and aircraft operating in the Indian Ocean continuously for 12 years, with participating personnel and ships wearing the EU's blue and gold flag.
Congress took a huge step forward today, sending the message to the president and the country that Muslims and other communities of color are welcome here. Now that the bill has passed out of committee, we look forward to its swift passage in the House without any further changes. We must end these bans and prevent presidents from using rank prejudice to discriminate against Black and brown people.
We've talked about campaigns that I've been involved in since 1968, and I will tell you sincerely, and without any hesitation, the stakes of this election are higher than any I've ever worked, including races for the presidency, Barbour said. Why? If you can imagine — 52 years in politics, how many times have I been asked the question: What do you worry about most about government and politics? And it is very simple — I worry my children and grandchildren are not going to inherit the same country I inherited. For the first time, I believe that could be actually happening because if you look at the left's agenda — what they say publicly they want to do. I mean, they want to do away with the rules of the Senate that keep you from just having a simple majority to pass things. And they would pass the rules to end the filibuster and make the Senate like the House.
I will introduce an immigration bill immediately and have it sent to the appropriate committees to begin movement, Biden said. I will in fact countermand executive orders that the president has in fact initiated that are contrary to what I think is either his authority and/or even if it's his authority, contrary to the interests of the United States on environmental issues and a range of other things.
The foreign minister of Kuwait, which has acted as a mediator throughout the dispute, announced on Monday that Saudi Arabia would reopen its land and sea borders to Qatar after closing them in 2017. MBS was filmed embracing Qatari ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani when the latter's plane arrived for the GCC summit:
The statement's full passage regarding the Democrats' additional funding reads:
According to court records, both defendants met with an undercover DEA Agent in Miami on November 28, 2017, with the intention of selling five kilograms of crystal methamphetamine for the agreed price of $14,500 per kilo. The deal and subsequent meeting were set up during an undercover phone call between the DEA agent and the brother of Irepan-Salgado who was identified as Luciano Salgado, a meth-dealer in Georgia and New York. Luciano Salgado negotiated the wholesale price with the undercover DEA agent and then directed him to complete the transaction with Irepan-Salgado.
Aquinas analyzed how the ancient Israelites actually applied in practice God's commandment to welcome the stranger, noting that the Jewish people of Old Testament times did not admit visitors from all nations equally, since those peoples closer to them were more quickly integrated into the population than those who were not as close.
Ashford notes that panelists on The View on ABC TV mocked Vice President Mike Pence for his Christian faith, calling it 'scary' and even saying that his religious beliefs are a kind of 'mental illness,' he wrote. Such comments are an insult to everyone who holds sincere religious beliefs.
The report said no civilians were identified by U.S. special forces during the firefight, the dead and wounded civilians were effectively serving as human shields for the Taliban, and some of the casualties resulted from a Taliban ammo dump exploding.

Controversial addition to the Grassroots Out rally, George Galloway, has ripped into the childish and tabloid BBC for asking him to come into studio to discuss the European Union, but then launching a personal 'gotcha' attack on him demanding he defend his appearance at the event.
As his new national security adviser, I have commenced changes to the National Security Council staff designed to assist the president as he continues to execute his foreign policy vision for the country, O'Brien wrote on October 16, 2019, in the Washington Post. He continued:
They used the Eurotunnel, and she recalls: The worst thing is I was told she was Syrian. She was Tunisian. A mutual friend told us. I don't think it's normal. Most do it for money. So they say.
Bennett played a segment of the Senator's March 7 speech wherein he imparted some extremely important facts that prove lower sentences for federal drug crimes is a major mistake.
4. Teachers' unions exposed. If it was once possible to see public school teachers' unions as benign, the school shutdowns of 2020 revealed that many of them exist solely to promote the interests of their members, and the political fortunes of the Democratic Party, rather than to improve education for American children. In many cities, schools remained closed despite scientific evidence they could be reopened safely. Their political clout may have suffered permanent damage as a result.
Presidents Day 2015 comes in the midst of an upheaval about the state of U.S. foreign policy, and particularly regarding the State of Israel, whose Prime Minister will arrive in two weeks to deliver what will amount to a rebuke of President Obama's negotiating stance on Iran. As this particular holiday lends itself to ranking the presidents from best to worst, it is worth considering how they compare on relations with Israel, which has been–despite ups and downs–a staunch ally since 1948.
Nic Talbott has dreamt of a career in the military for years. He enrolled in a training programme while at university and spent his weekends in camouflage crawling through mud, or strategising in mock battle scenarios. But a tweet by Donald Trump in July 2017 destroyed all of his plans. The president's tweet declared: The United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military. Mr. Talbott said: It was like my entire future had just been taken away in one moment over social media for no good reason.
In addition, Newsom's new budget proposes increasing the size of the subsidies for families who already receive it, and it would make California the first state to make subsidies available to middle income families, his office said.
I can't guarantee that it's not been/being discussed in the cabinets of other institutions – as there is virtually no cross institutional information flow, coordination or cooperation on these things.

While India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamic terrorists in Kashmir, Islamabad blames New Delhi of violently oppressing pro-Pakistan separatists.
China has been annexing regions in the South China Sea that have historically belonged to other countries, and continues to use belligerent military operations to enforce its seizures. China has claimed the entire South China Sea, including regions historically belonging to Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. China's claims are rejected by almost everyone outside of China, and China refuses to submit them to the United Nations court deciding such matters, apparently knowing their claims are groundless and that they would lose.
Step one, apparently, was passing his amended version of the May deal.
The question before us is not whether the requirements for dispensing mifepristone impose an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion as a general matter. The question is instead whether the District Court properly ordered the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to lift those established requirements because of the court's own evaluation of the impact of the COVID–19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic. Here as in related contexts concerning government responses to the pandemic, my view is that courts owe significant deference to the politically accountable entities with the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health. South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in denial of application for injunctive relief) (slip op., at 2). In light of those considerations, I do not see a sufficient basis here for the District Court to compel the FDA to alter the regimen for medical abortion.

The poll also found that veterans and military households see access to health care as their top concern and support being able to use VA health care benefits outside of the VA system, as was allowed under the VA MISSION Act. A large majority — 87 percent — supported being able to do so, even if it cost a little more out of pocket.

But the European Community regulators consider that a violation of privacy rights, since the Facebook user never agreed to allow the company to follow him or her to another site.

The newspaper offered insight into a larger funeral home in Hankou, a Wuhan neighborhood, which it estimated had the capacity to burn 576 people per day. You Hu told the Epoch Times that the backlog of people waiting to be cremated was not due to lack of space in the burners, but lack of sufficient transportation and collapsing staff numbers, as few were sleeping or taking breaks. Due to transportation and staff limits, the Epoch Times estimated that the Hankou crematorium was burning 225 corpses a day.
Bannon also posited that without Nancy Reagan as First Lady, there for the comfort, aid and really protection of him, it might have been a very different Presidency, would it not?
Romney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.

Father Cervellera advanced his conjecture that in the present instance, the Vatican is acting out of fear and that is why it is caving in to Chinese demands.
Well it was, in the truest sense of the word, a deeply emotional relationship, but also very pragmatic. I was just saying on the air a few moments ago that I thought their thespian training, their Hollywood background, helped them in politics, because they were conscious of the fact the country wanted something grand in the Presidency, Brokaw said. He also noted that:
All financial institutions used by him or a business he owns or controls; a list of all companies he currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated; a list of all sources of income for the past five years; a list of all employers for the past five years; tax documents for companies he owns and a copy of deeds to properties that he owns or in which he has an ownership interest.
To complicate matters, the European Union has also made itself known in the formation of the new government, warning the potential coalition partners against pursuing the policies they were elected over. Lega in particular wishes to radically cut taxes, including VAT and excise duties, but EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis spoke out Tuesday morning to tell Italy they must conform with EU demands.
But the ability of homeowners to qualify for more expensive homes has driven up the ratio of home prices to median household income. At the end of 2014, home prices had reached an all-time record ratio of 5.3 times the average U.S. household income. Although official 2015 data is not yet available, the ratio appears to have reached another all-time high of 5.5 times household income.
I spent more time on Western hemisphere issues than any secretary of state in about 60 years.

The chart below shows how fund flows have been negative for five quarters now, and that even when they have been positive, they are dwarfed by corporate purchases.

It's not the liberals who started these programs, and in fact, a lot of these programs have been cut back, he asserted. For example, housing assistance to the poor and lower middle class, that's about a fourth of our housing assistance budget in the federal government. The other three-fourths is involved with giving interest deductions to the upper middle class and the rich on their mortgages. That's the biggest housing subsidy we do. That's just not fair.

Where did the CDC find more than a million and nearly 14 million victims of sexual violence that professional criminologists somehow overlooked? Sommers asked in the video. It found them by using a poorly constructed telephone survey with a low response rate and a non-representative sample of respondents. No one interviewed was asked if they had been raped or sexually assaulted.

Senator Paul is hardly the only observer to see Abrams' possible appointment this way. The Washington Post found it surprising Abrams was ever under consideration, acknowledging his resumé and reputation as a tough negotiator, but finding little in common with Trump's foreign policy vision beyond being fiercely pro-Israel. Fox News host Tucker Carlson said he was baffled while interviewing Senator Paul about his op-ed. Doug Bandow at Forbes said choosing Abrams would be a particularly stunning reversal of candidate Trump's claim to reject his predecessors' failed policies of perpetual war.
He blamed the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that make dams more difficult, and more expensive, to build. Until we change the environmental laws, construction is cost prohibitive, he told me.

Ashford cites several people in the news who have become targets merely because they are Christian.

Thus far, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen decisions get made to propel that process forward, and that's what we continue to want to see. In order to get there, you've got to have leadership on both sides of this be real leaders and make tough decisions and be willing to compromise, Kirby said.
The Bay of Pigs veterans offered President Trump their first-ever presidential endorsement before the general election last year.
China has conducted a number of military exercises over the past year, which include exercises on the Korean Peninsula as well as drills in and around Taiwan, increasing fears that they are planning to colonize the self-ruled island by force.
These claims are based on the utterly unreliable adjusted temperature measurements recorded by surface temperature stations scattered across the globe. These measurements, at least the raw data from them, are usually sufficiently accurate to inform local inhabitants of the temperature and weather anomalies in their area on a particular day, but as measures of actual trends telling us something important about whether humans are causing global warming, most of them are virtually worthless.
Chairman Janet Yellen says the Federal Reserve is delaying hiking interest rates. That could mean the rapidly inflating real-estate bubble is headed toward another crisis.
Sweden, a country of 9.8 million people known for its generous asylum policies, took in an estimated 160,000 asylum seekers last year alone.
The U.N. Human Rights Council is supposed to be about human rights, not Israeli wrongs, so to create a report just about Israel seems to go against its own mission, he said.

It would put anybody out of business. I mean, this — they could destroy anybody. If they did this to any app, any company, it would completely destroy them. And we're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble, because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us, because, if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't.
Embarrassment was apparent even among the White House staff, as manifest in leaks and excuses conveyed by Obama's staff to the U.S. media during the sailors' detention.
Here, for example, is the BBC version (But CNBC and ABC and CNN and the rest were all similarly delighted)
The emails are the latest production from our January 2018 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the DOJ failed to respond to a December 2017 request for all communications between Strzok and Page (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:18-cv-00154)).
As has been hammered home repeatedly over the years by meteorologist Anthony Watts (who is also a Senior Fellow with The Heartland Institute), many of the monitoring stations throughout the United States fail to meet the standards established by the agencies themselves for reliable data measurement. Watts recorded hundreds of stations on pavement, at airports collecting jet exhaust, located next to artificial sources of hot and cold, such as air conditioning systems or commercial grill heat exhausts. Many of these stations were once located in rural areas, but are now surrounded by development, and others are rural stations where data is not recorded or monitored regularly.
But the private planes present unique issues for Warren and Sanders. As the leading progressive voices in a crowded Democratic primary, they often criticize rivals they deem insufficiently loyal to those values. The sudden use of private travel is an example of how ideological rigidity can sometimes collide with White House aspirations.
In August, a survey conducted by the Queen's Nursing Institute (QNI) found that ten per cent of care homes in the United Kingdom were told by NHS managers to introduce do not resuscitate (DNR) orders for elderly coronavirus patients during the first wave.

After Watts' 2014 revelations, the U.S. Office of the Inspector General issued a scathing report, almost entirely ignored by the media, that found lack of oversight, non-compliance, and a lax review process for the climate recording network led it to conclude program data cannot be consistently relied upon by decision-makers. In a panic, during the investigative process that resulted in the Inspector General's report, NOAA closed approximately 600 of its most problematic weather stations.
While Brussels and the bloc's liberal-progressive members have pushed for an EU-wide asylum policy — which seeks to dole out arrivals to member states and fails to increase security — Hungary has said the superstate should instead take her lead and fortify Europe's external borders as well as focusing on supporting refugees in their own countries and regions.

In fact, the nexus between Huawei and the UK began as long ago as 2003, when BT began talks with the Chinese company to provide devices aggregating customer lines and connecting them to the main part of the network. The contract was signed in 2005. Astoundingly, although BT told the Cabinet Office that it was proposing to lock Huawei into UK telecommunications, the civil service 'did not refer the issue to ministers or even inform them until 2006 — a year after the contract between BT and Huawei had been signed', according to the damning words of a 2013 Commons Security and Intelligence Committee report.
Tillerson and his team should do to more to build trust with the State Department workforce and bring them along, rather than worrying about stamping out leaks, Rogin asserts. Most State Department officials would prefer to influence policy through the proper channels, if that is an option.

Warren declares the country cannot assume that everything will be fine once Donald Trump leaves office and lays out her plan to mitigate the damage she believes Trump has caused.

Ambassador Johnson emphasised this in his Brexit Day note of congratulations, writing: President Donald J. Trump has long supported the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union. Now that the UK is back in control of its own trade policy, we look forward to achieving a broad Free Trade Agreement that will increase prosperity and create jobs in both our countries.
The Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.
In September, with French President Emmanuel Macron serving as a go-between, Trump reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Iran President Hassan Rouhani to speak with him by phone from the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
Other publications have shared life hacks that do not necessarily feed any mouths. This week, the aggregation site La Patilla shared an article from October with a hack that allegedly uses toothpaste to reveal whether a woman is pregnant. If the toothpaste creates foam and changes color after being mixed in with a woman's urine, she is pregnant, according to the trick. La Patilla is quick to note, despite the growing popularity of this method, science denies its efficacy. The toothpaste tends not to change color, even if you are pregnant, while the foam appears in most cases due to contact between the acidity of the urine and alkalinity of the toothpaste.
Cook added that Apple is launching the Racial Equity Justice Initiative to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long.
This wouldn't be the first child sexual abuse case at Bergen Catholic. In 2016, the high school paid a $1.9 million settlement to former students who claimed that they had been sexually abused at the school by clergymen in the 60s and 70s when they were between 13 and 17 years old.

The Brazilian newspaper O Globo extracted this detail from a Datafolha survey taken nearly a week after Lula's second conviction, on January 29 and 30. The 24 percent of voters not aware of the appellate court affirming his conviction and extending his sentence by two years represents 35 million people, the newspaper notes. Brazil boasts 146 million eligible voters.
According to leaked internal documents obtained by Motherboard, the 2017 Charlottesville protests were a moment of intense introspective for Facebook, which scrambled to redefine what they consider hate speech and to educate content moderators about American white nationalists. One training document obtained shortly after the protests reads: Recent incidents in the United States (i.e. Charlottesville) have shown that there is potentially confusion about our hate org policies and the specific hate orgs in specific markets.

6. Return to space. In May, the U.S. finally returned to manned space flight on board the SpaceX Dragon, marking the first time a private company had ever taken humans into orbit. The feat inspired the world, and gave hope to a nation struggling with the pandemic and ongoing riots. It also heralded the start of a new era in space exploration, giving new momentum to Elon Musk's dream of bringing humans to Mars, and restoring U.S. dominance in space ahead of China and other rivals.

In her inaugural speech to the House of Representatives on Thursday, Pelosi sounded a similar theme, calling Congress co-equal to the presidency:
If things really are looking up, then Russia is emerging from what Business Insider called a perfect demographic storm that was crippling the nation in 2015. Up to 30 percent of Russian deaths in one study were alcohol-related. Russia has also battled other forms of drug abuse, and a serious HIV/AIDS crisis, contributing to that notoriously high mortality rate for Russian men. It is likely that men embarked upon such tragically short life paths are not settling down to family life and raising children.
If just one person feels less lonely or isolated when faced with this pandemic, then I'll feel better about it (I hope!)
It may be the case Britain ultimately finds itself fighting the same old battles, with politicians saying they can't protect this steel plant or prevent that contract from going abroad not because the EU ties their hands, but because the EU deal does.
Assad rules over a country in ruins, with close to half a million people killed and half the population displaced. Major fighting may still lie ahead. But many see the war nearing its end, and the 53-year-old leader is sitting more comfortably than he has in the past eight years.

[Saudi youths] form the majority in every arena of so-called jihad.

We absolutely should be concerned about this president because I believe that he's making decisions that perhaps should scare us all, she continued. He feels as if he has the power to use this military in ways that should frighten all of us.
Kolfage said in a Business Wire press release:
With President Trump in office, the opportunity to tackle OPEC's outsized influence has presented itself.

There was another change this week by this president, not a change in his policy, but from the previous presidents, Wallace said. He now says that this White House is no longer going to routinely release visitor logs showing who's coming to the White House, who they're meeting with, as President Obama did. And another interesting development this weekend, there were massive marches across the country, people protesting. These were called tax marches.

Let's put it up on the screen. The president apparently not liking those marches. He says, I did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a Republican, easily won the electrical college. Now tax returns are brought up again? Gillian, this president apparently thinks transparency is overrated.

Words just can't express how disappointed I am with this ruling. We are reviewing the Court's opinion to determine any additional steps that need to be taken. We will continue to follow the law as provided to us by the courts in this matter and we will rise to the challenge of keeping Travis County safe, although our ability to overcome fear and foster cooperation within the immigrant community is a greater challenge now.

I believe the president of the United States has been compromised. Whether he made all of these extraordinary policy decisions based on bad policy choices, or they were — he was compromised, must be the subject of the investigation.

Wu Youjin, a Jinhu native who works in Beijing, said his 15-month-old daughter was given polio, leprosy and DPT (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) vaccines when they visited home in May last year. He said his daughter had developed a rash afterwards but they did not connect the symptoms to the vaccine at the time.

He was unable to find any information, which led him to question whether the vaccines were legitimate and safe. He said some of the vaccines that his daughter received did not carry any serial numbers and he had no channel to verify if they have been expired. The government has not provided complete and systematic solutions on what measures we should take and what can we do if we have been given the [expired] shots, and what the consequences are, he said.

rather than going after a chemistry professor who has been in this country for many years and has contributed greatly to his community and sending him back to his native land at time when he was on his way to pick up his child from school, that the first priority—not the only priority— [of immigration enforcement] should be to go after people who have committed felonies, serious misdemeanors, multiple less serious misdemeanors, are a threat to public health or safety. Wouldn't most Americans agree that that is where our resources should be targeted?
Brain Kolfage, a triple amputee Air Force veteran who raised $20 million to pay for a border wall, announced the launch of a non-profit on Friday, but a GoFundMe spokesperson said it would refund all of the money raised on the website unless donors proactively request to have their money transferred to the new organization.

The article claimed that the FBI was aware Mr. Steele was creating these memos as part of work for an opposition research firm connected to Hillary Clinton. The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for President in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI's independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration's use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends. It is additionally troubling that the FBI reportedly agreed to such an arrangement given that, in January of 2017, then-Director Clapper issued a statement stating that the IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. According to the Washington Post, the FBI's arrangement with Mr. Steele fell through when the media published his dossier and revealed his identity.

Al-Houthi's proclamation, for which he added no verifiable information, follows similar claims by Iranian and Chinese officials that the virus, which originated in Wuhan and first began infecting people in November, was somehow manufactured in an American laboratory. Chinese government media outlets have gone as far as to accuse a U.S. Army facility in Maryland of creating the virus, without evidence and no explanation for how the virus traveled across the world without infecting anyone.

The drive to impeach President Trump did not begin with the allegations before us. Here was reporting in April of 2016: 'Donald Trump isn't even the Republican nominee yet… [but] 'Impeachment' is already on the lips of pundits, newspaper editorials, constitutional scholars, and even a few members of Congress.' Here was the Washington Post headline minutes after President Trump's inauguration: 'The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.' … [Democrats'] position was obvious when they openly rooted for the [Robert] Mueller [Russian collusion hoax] investigation to tear our country apart and were disappointed when the facts proved otherwise. It was obvious when they sought to impeach this president over and over.

DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — The Latest on the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland (all times local):
The AOC approach is a non-starter with most of the working class, said Olsen. They don't want a big government, heavy, high-tax, high-benefit state. What they want is what they had. They want their jobs back, and they want to stop being subjected to what they consider to be unfair competition. There's nothing that AOC or her allies would do about that sort of competition [for jobs], particularly from people who come here — whether legally or illegally — and who compete with these people for the jobs.
Sessions has generally preferred a logical, categorical approach: The problem with unauthorized immigration is that it is illegal, and that illegality itself causes real pain to American citizens. Because Sessions doesn't rely on bad unauthorized immigrants to make his point, he doesn't open the door for sympathy toward good ones.

Most Republicans appear willing to go along with McConnell's plan to start the trial first then consider witnesses later, rather than upfront, as Democrats want.
Even mere whispers of this possibility can never be publicly acknowledged by any currently serving central banker; to do so would seriously undermine their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, who have become accustomed to their spoon-fed propaganda. These experts are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the problems we now face. They allow politicians to spend beyond their respective countries' means, then give them blank checks to bail them out whenever they get into too much trouble.
That is a stark contrast to the priorities of voters elsewhere in the country. According to a Gallup poll released earlier this week, Democrats nationwide consider health care the most important issue, followed closely by gun control and climate change.

Now, the government can't create jobs. They've never created a job ever, but they can create the right environment so that small business, which is the engine of this economy, can create jobs, and that's exactly what we've seen under this administration and the policies that have come out of it, she added.

The growth in the groups' membership — in the last Congress, the Tri-Caucus had roughly 90 core House members — reflects the diverse lineup of Democrats who won election in the November midterms. It also signals that their influence will be wide-ranging. Among the Tri-Caucus members will be eight committee chairs, leading panels ranging from environmental issues to homeland security to small business. They will have representatives in the No. 3, 4 and 5 spots in Democratic leadership. Lobbying firms in Washington are hiring staff with connections to the Tri-Caucus, a signal of their importance. More than 100 of 235 Democratic members in the new House, many from California, belong to one of the three affinity groups known collectively as the Tri-Caucus. It will arguably be the most powerful voting bloc for the Democratic majority.

The biggest embarrassment was over Obama's handling of the incident… and [the question of] whether or not he would refer to it in his pre-prepared speech. So what we witnessed was not so much the abduction of the sailors but the abduction of the American president himself. His ransom was the missed opportunity to present himself as a strong president enjoying the legitimacy of achieving the nuclear agreement with Iran.
The president deserves people who do agree with him, Paul said. The president campaigned on the fact that we've been at war for too long in too many places.
In my day, I must have had three or four courses where we read On Liberty, by John Stuart Mill, which taught the basics of free speech and why we need it. It was very common to read John Stuart Mill and other defenses of free speech in the tradition of classical liberalism – such as what the Founders practiced. This is not taught today. Instead, people teach about so-called white privilege and other ideas that, in an indirect way, are ultimately derived from Marxism or what you might call neo-Marxism, where the basic idea is that individual rights are just an illusion, and you really have just a bunch of powerful classes. Instead of an economic class nowadays they talk about it as an ethnic or a gender class. And those powerful classes dominate and they create ideas like free speech that pretend to be neutral and fair to every individual, but they really aren't. They're just disguising the power of the class. That ideology comes from Marx, but it's been spread out and used in this new frame with ethnicity and gender. So, this is the ideology that dominates the ethos of the studies programs.

If the government imposed an assembly ban and other restrictions simply due to the belief that (saliva) sprays more at indoor sports facilities, they must reconsider, Park Joo-hyung, head of Seoul's Pilates and Fitness Business Association said during a press conference outside the Seoul Western District Court on January 12.
This foreign labor force, which is dubbed the Green Card Workforce, is often preferred by executives because the dangled green cards ensure that the foreign workers will work long hours for lower wages. In addition, the workers have no legal protections in the workplace and have no professional authority to disagree with CEOs, who can also gain personally when Wall Street welcomes each outsourcing decision.

The lead author of the 2018 document was then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster. The decision to declassify the document early came from current National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, who said he was releasing the United States Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific to communicate to the American people and to our allies and partners, the enduring commitment of the United States to keeping the Indo-Pacific region free and open long into the future.
He said that if the federal government could cut personal and corporate tax rates and allowed 100% expensing of fixed assets for businesses, that would be a good start.
The migration ended once the would-be migrants realized they could not get U.S. jobs they needed to repay their smuggling debts to the cartel-affiliated coyotes. In January, Trump's deputies released only about 2,000 migrants into the United States, down from 80,000 in May 2019.

This marks the first time Iran honored a single man with a multi-city ceremony. Not even Khomeini received such a processional with his death in 1989. Soleimani on Monday will lie in state at Tehran's famed Musalla mosque as the revolutionary leader did before him.
America's greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry plummeted more than 10 percent in 2020, reaching their lowest levels in at least three decades as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on the nation's economy, according to an estimate published Tuesday by the Rhodium Group. The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks.

The overall goal seems to have been convincing second- and third-tier Indo-Pacific governments that China seeks to dominate them and giving them good reasons to push back while undermining China's efforts to present itself as an irresistible hegemonic power with a superior economic and political system. One of the major strategic objectives outlined in the Framework was promoting U.S. values throughout the region to maintain influence and counterbalance Chinese models of government. Another was investing in capabilities that promote uncensored communication between Chinese people.
Both Gabbard and Perry are veterans of the Iraq War. They are members of the Fourth Amendment Caucus, and co-chair the Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus.

We strongly oppose any steps that accelerate settlement expansion, which raise serious questions about Israel's long-term intentions. And as we've repeatedly made clear, we continue to look to both sides to demonstrate with actions and policies a genuine commitment to a two-state solution. Actions such as these do just the opposite, Kirby said.

The USDA reports that the eating patterns of one or more house- hold members were disrupted and their food intake reduced at least some time during the year because they couldn't afford enough food. Those households reported cutting back on intake—but also eating unbalanced meals or relying on cheaper food. Wait a minute. Is this really hunger? Who hasn't had an unbalanced meal from time to time, or decided to go with the cheaper option on the menu?
Following the money is a far more interesting and revealing option.
Sen. Paul told Breitbart News he thinks there remains no appetite for a Romney presidential campaign in 2020. Paul emphasized that Trump won many traditionally Democrat states, while Romney could not win any of these states.
The pound fell sharply after the inflation data as traders priced in a lower interest rate profile. By late afternoon London time, the pound was 0.2 percent lower at $1.3027. Though that may not seem much, the currency had earlier risen to $1.3126, its highest level since last September, as traders bet that the inflation data would be higher than anticipated and potentially force the hand of the bank to raise interest rates soon.

TRUMP: A lot of people will have this, and it's very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don't even see a doctor … So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. – Fox News interview Wednesday.
And as such, the American people see right through–at least all but 12 percent of them per this latest poll from Civiqs. And it's not just that poll that shows Ryan leaves office as damaged goods: Gallup, out with a new survey on Thursday, finds Ryan down at 34 percent–a massive drop-off and the lowest he has ever been in Gallup.
We are appalled by widespread media reports that President Abbas and other officials of the Palestinian Authority have recently made statements in Palestinian social and other media reaffirming their commitment to continue payments exceeding $300 million annually to reward terrorists and their families for attacking and killing Israelis, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations Chairman Stephen M. Greenberg and Executive Vice Chairman and CEO Malcolm Hoenlein said in a joint statement.
As for why America's financial industry and intelligence agencies have overestimated China's growth potential, Eberstadt said that it's the easy temptation to think that tomorrow is going to be just like today plus two percent. Growing in a straight line. But straight lines don't happen in history when you actually look at it, he said.
One thing that was absolutely clear for Aquinas was that the host nation itself had the right and the duty to legislate immigration in such a way that it was of benefit not only to the strangers seeking admittance, but to the receiving nation as well.
This huge imported workforce ensures that executives rarely have to compete for American graduates by offering higher wages, even when profits are growing. A 2020 report by the Federal Reserve said median salaries for U.S. graduates fell by two percent from 2016 to 2019 as blue-collar salaries rose amid President Donald Trump's border policies.
Controversy surrounds the BBC's plans to charge the country's 3.7 million over-75s, with exemptions for those on pension credit, the tax to watch television. MPs expressed concern last year that so-called outreach officers visiting the elderly to remind them that they have to pay the £157.50 a year could be frightening. The BBC had agreed to take on the responsibility to pay the fees from the government in 2015, but later claimed that it could not afford to do so.
As part of the state-directed changes to higher education, students from a range of disciplines will be meeting with abused women and children during the course of their studies, the government announced on Friday.
The document is strongly supportive of Trump's maximum pressure campaign against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, for example, and it encouraged expanding U.S. intelligence and law enforcement activities that counter Chinese influence operations, a goal the Trump administration unquestionably emphasized.
Kurtz further explains that, today, even courses in the conventional departments – such as history, English, biology, etc., are cross-listed with other studies departments and share the common ideology.
I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future, Ryan said during the October 2016 call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017.
JERUSALEM (AP) — President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Sunday that the U.S. military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State group, and on Turkey assuring the safety of Kurdish fighters allied with the United States.
After World War II, Congress included the Air Force as subject to the Act, but strangely it did not include the Navy or Marine Corps, although a subsequent Department of Defense Regulation applies it to them. And as a maritime law enforcement agency, the Coast Guard is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.
The Senate blocked a motion to cloture to advance the coronavirus package for debate. The motion failed, with 49 senators in favor of the motion and 46 against the measure.
This is a highly significant document. It's extraordinary that it's been released decades early, Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at ANU, said. I think it's a signal about the kind of continuity that the permanent government of America, or if you like the officials, want to see in America's relations with the Indo-Pacific, including in managing China's power. Washington sources familiar with the development of the strategy say Australia had a significant influence on the document, as did Japan.
The Google-owned platform also removed a short clip of President Trump calling on supporters to peacefully disperse, the same video that was taken down by Twitter and Facebook.
Major League Baseball (MLB) has decided to suspend all political donations in the wake of last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol, the Associated Press reports.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Hinkins said, If you have it on your body and it's out in the open, you're OK. But the minute you put it in your scabbard to protect it, you're breaking the law. He said the fact that laws are structured this way means citizens who want to carry concealed instead of openly have to pay a fee to the state—a fee that open carriers can forgo.
He garnered national attention with rebukes of then-President Barack Obama over healthcare, and in 2012 GOP presidential nominee former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney selected him as his running mate. After losing the presidential race in 2012 when Obama and Vice President Joe Biden won re-election, Romney has since left Massachusetts, relocating to Utah, where he ran for the U.S. Senate and won. Romney was sworn into his Senate seat, once held by former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), as Ryan vacated the Speakership of the House for the last time on Thursday.
You say, let's make a deal, but a deal in order to obtain what? he asked. We lose half the Church, we put the nomination of the bishops in the hands of the government.
The Northern Ireland protocol was also agreed, with the British province subordinated to Single Market rules and divided from the rest of the United Kingdom by a partial customs border. Brexit was to get done in January 2020 with the passage of this Withdrawal Agreement — except not really, as it came with a transition period lasting right up to the end of the year.
Under the Green New Deal, Congress must develop a plan for the transition of the United States economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. And to accomplish that, the U.S. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. Some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the U.S. economy to suit their Utopian and unrealistic world view. With hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the Green New Deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. And neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the US a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.
The new rule, which can be read at the website of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), bars recipients of federal Title X family planning funds from referring women for abortions and – for abortion providers that also offer family planning services – also requires completely separate facilities for these services. The rule sends the clear message that abortion is not family planning or health care.

Those four senators could force votes. Republicans control the chamber, 53-47, and are all but certain to acquit Trump. But it takes just 51 votes during the trial to approve rules or call witnesses. It also would take only 51 senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Trump.
Sackett misses the fact that walking around with handguns carried in plain sight without a permit is already legal. Hinkins just wants to level the playing ground for concealed carriers as well.
Thursday's court ruling involved his October 2019 proclamation denying visas to immigrants who did not have health insurance and could not show that they would obtain it within 30 days of entering the country. Immigrants could receive Medicare and be allowed to remain, but those who planned to obtain coverage under the low-income Medicaid program or the government-subsidized Affordable Care Act would not be eligible. Advocates for immigrants say Trump's proclamation would bar entry to nearly two-thirds of all otherwise legal migrants, those who obtain their entry visas from employers, U.S. relatives or an annual lottery. The ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, if it becomes final, would allow Trump's order to take effect for the first time. But attorney Esther Sung of the Justice Action Center, one of the legal organizations challenging the policy, said that under the court's standard timetable, the ruling will not be binding for 52 days. That would be well past President-elect Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden has promised to undo his predecessor's anti-immigration policies as soon as possible. A federal judge in Portland blocked Trump's proclamation from taking effect in December 2019, saying it exceeded the president's legal authority. Panels of the appeals court twice denied emergency orders that would have let Trump enforce the ban during the court proceedings. But a different panel of the court ruled 2-1 Thursday that the president's broad powers over immigration include the authority to limit entry only to those who can afford health insurance.
Culture secretary Nicky Morgan has warned that the BBC could go the way of Blockbuster — becoming a total irrelevancy and going bust — unless it evolves.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled on behalf of the State of Texas and upheld most of the new anti-sanctuary city law that went into effect September 1, 2017. The three-judge panel unanimously overturned most of the lower court's ruling that temporarily blocked some provisions of the law.
ICE has 37,000 people caught in detention, and only a small percentage should be kept in detention, he suggested. In fact, only a small percentage of those in ICE detention have been convicted of a violent crime. Many have never even been charged with a criminal offense. ICE can quickly reduce the detained population without endangering our communities, he wrote.
This is the first time since the founding of the country that instructions on military training have been directly issued by the chairman of the CMC, and it shows that improving combat readiness is now a strategic mission for the Chinese military, Xu Guangyu, a retired major general, told the Times.
The Wall Street Journal reports U.S. and Afghan forces were led into a trap by the Taliban and ambushed on a dead-end street. The Taliban opened fire from within civilian structures, inflicting several casualties and forcing the American and Afghan troops to call for air support. Two U.S. soldiers were killed and four wounded during the battle, while the Afghans lost three commandos and had 11 wounded.
In addition to concerns regarding the preparation of Iraqi troops and equipment used by peshmerga, the participation of Shiite militias may also cause discord. Baghdad has friendly relations with rogue Shiite militias in Iraq, many with ties to Iran, but the peshmerga do not. On Thursday, the same day the operation to retake Mosul began, peshmerga clashed with Shiite forces in Salahaddin province, preventing them from entering a Kurdish-controlled town.

Coincidentally, former CIA director Michael Hayden gave a speech at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on Tuesday in which he warned North Korea could become capable of hitting Seattle with an indigenously produced nuclear weapon aboard an indigenously produced intercontinental ballistic missile before President Trump leaves office.
The highest profile signer of the letter was former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), who had even publicly floated potentially running against Pelosi. But, within a week of Fudge's opposition to Pelosi becoming public and an interview she gave considering a Speakership bid herself, Fudge completely reversed course and actually endorsed Pelosi for Speaker.
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, who was instrumental in the passage of the new Harvard policy that restricts members of single-sex student organizations from obtaining leadership positions elsewhere on campus, praised Fleur-de-Lis' announcement.

Sheldon Adelson, who rose from selling newspapers on Boston street corners at age 12 to one of the most successful luxury resort developers, philanthropists and political influencers of his generation, died Monday night at his home in Malibu, California. He was 87. Adelson founded and served as Chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., the world's largest gaming corporation, from its inception in 1988. He had been on medical leave from the company since Jan. 7 to resume his fight against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which he had battled since 2019. … Under Adelson's leadership, Las Vegas Sands pioneered the integrated resort model that now dominates the Strip, combining luxury hotel-casinos with convention centers. Adelson's concept was so popular and financially successful that he became one of the world's wealthiest people.
Kirkpatrick's point was that the U.S. had to be smart about its friends and its enemies. That is, we had to realize that an imperfect friend was a lot better than an implacable enemy. In a word, it's important to realistic, to deal with the world as it is. And it's also important to deal with the fact that not everyone in the world is going to live up to our standards of purity—and yet if they're friendly to us, well, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. As Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of state, Cordell Hull, reportedly once quipped about one pro-America dictator, He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
The man said that he had never heard of anyone leaving the internment camps, with the exceptions of those who fell ill, saying: Some people were given 'medicine' to change their thinking, 'for their minds'. When this made them mentally ill, only then were they released.

In both cases, they defended the principles of meritocracy, individual rights, and equality under the law—and roundly defeated a super-coalition of the states' progressive politicians, activists, universities, media, and corporations, Rufo noted, observing the leftwing mantra of systemic racism and white supremacy has made Asian-Americans an inconvenient minority.
I believe that Britain should control its own events. Who comes into our country, who can be told to leave our country, what our foreign policy should be, what our economic policy should be, should be decided by the British people in a British parliament.
5. Obama claimed the Geneva Convention applies broadly, even to non-parties not officially at war. In a seminal foreign policy speech in 2007, candidate Obama made it clear that he considered terror detainees protected by the Geneva Conventions: As President, I will close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act, and adhere to the Geneva Conventions. Yet terrorists are not parties to the Convention, or officially at war with us.

Mr. Galloway was invited to appear on today's Daily Politics show on BBC2, but alleges he was misled by producers. He told interviewer Jo Coburn:
They have to make it sound like they are for some kind of enforcement, and so what they say they are in favor of is 'smarter enforcement,' just like the [Barack] Obama administration used to say their ICE strategy of 'prosecutorial prioritization' was really 'smarter enforcement,' she said.
Looking at a real world example, one might wonder what might necessitate a company like Apple to borrow money. The most profitable publically traded company in the whole world, with a pristine balance sheet and billions in cash holdings, is borrowing money and buying back stock. This is NOT a recommendation on the purchase of Apple stock, but instead an observation about that nature of what low-interest rates do to pervert the capitalist system. Historically, firms once borrowed to invest in new equipment and R&D. Today, they are engaging in a buyback orgy that is significantly larger than equity purchases by institutions and retail investors.
Economists have long suspected that Chinese economic data is massaged upward, often noting that full-year gross domestic product hits Beijing's targets with suspicious regularity.
In an August 25, 2016, email thread with the subject line Found him, which was initiated by an unidentified Chicago FBI field office agent and sent to agents in New York, Cleveland and Washington field offices as well as someone in the counterintelligence division, the Chicago agent writes: Address is [redacted]. Photo attached.
In fact, in Obama's entire eight-year term, the economy never added as many manufacturing jobs as it did last year. In Obama's very best year, the economy added 211,000 manufacturing jobs–and that was building from a very low base because so many jobs had been destroyed by the Great Recession.
They tell women that it'll be simple, natural, safe, and private process. They'll recover in a day, maybe two. What they don't tell them is that they might deliver a tiny, perfectly-formed child. Or that they'll experience labor pains, heavy bleeding, vomiting, or lose consciousness. They don't talk about the depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, and substance abuse that follow. Or the weeks to months of recovery time, usually managed alone.
Go bigger: Pass the bill that 54 senators voted for last February, which combined a solution for children brought to the United States illegally (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA) and $25 billion in appropriated funding for border security over 10 years. The bill failed only because of last-minute White House opposition. Go really big: Begin the new Congress by creating a legal immigration system that secures our borders and defines legal status for those already here.

Putin did not offer his rubles-for-rugrats scheme as a crisis measure for dealing with demographic collapse. He flaunted it as a sign of inevitable Russian triumph while taunting European nations for their anemic birth rates. His criticism was not without merit, as Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain, Greece, and Portugal all have lower birth rates than Russia – the latter three nations' birth rates are much lower.
Claims that full control will be returned after this period appear to be misleading, as the text of the deal refers to quotas continuing from mid-2026 onwards — or else the EU is entitled to compensation.

Chinese intellectuals have petitioned the government to halt the evictions, calling them a violation of human rights. Even some state media have criticized the campaign. According to Yi Fuxian, a China population expert, the government has called migrants a low-end population – basically implying that they are inferior quality human beings. China didn't just say this. They actually wrote it into government documents. This is absurd, says Yi. Reuters and Shanghaiist (24-Nov) and BBC and NPR (4-Dec-2017)
Federal officials should quietly ignore migrants' illegal status as they try to detect, isolate, and treat all of the Americans who are infected by the epidemic, he said. The government should make clear that they are not going to be checking legal status when they're trying to protect public health, and it seems perfectly reasonable to say that use of public benefits [by would-be migrants], in this case, will not be factored into public charge rules.
Danish train company DSB has already threatened to levy a supplementary charge on passengers crossing the strait to cover the costs of the checks.
Krauthammer further stated that he thought the government's arguments in front of the court were exceedingly weak. And the administration wasn't prepared to defend the case in court.

Xinjiang is the homeland of the nation's Muslim-majority Uyghur ethnic group, which has faced severe repression by the Chinese Communist Party for decades, culminating in the construction of over 1,000 concentration camps to house members of the group. Survivors of the camps — which at their peak populations were believed to have imprisoned as many as 3 million people — say that Communist Party officials force Uyghurs and other ethnic minority people to endure indoctrination, torture, forced sterilization, forced abortions, rape, and slavery at those camps.

The exchange cited further consultation with regulators but its announcement late Monday gave no other details. Many analysts think the move reflects the expectation of a softening of the stance of U.S. policy toward China when president-elect Joe Biden takes office.
País was an anti-Batista operative largely considered the mastermind of the overthrow of the president.

Left-wing musician and actress Cher, however, appeared to congratulate the change, posting simply, Thanks Qantas.
Remittances sent from the United States prop up households, provide stability to national economies, and spur consumption. Migration has provided some ambitious Central Americans with an escape from poverty. But it has also enabled elites, who see no need to slow migration, as it is a status quo which works for them—and they are content to keep it intact. As a Guatemalan think tank analyst said ruefully after President Trump demanded Guatemala sign an asylum cooperation agreement: We continue doing everything except taking responsibility. …We're not the victims and we need to assume our responsibilities because the United States is no longer going to cover the cost of Guatemala's shortcomings.

Axios reported that the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized the American supply of roughly 150 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, generics, and brand-name drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market.
China has definitely cracked down on religion. They're returning what I call the 'government is God' philosophy that they had when they were connected with the Soviet Union years ago, Curry told Breitbart News. What's unique about China is that they have the capacity and the will to roll out this very sophisticated surveillance system against Christians. And, of course, with COVID [the Chinese coronavirus], people are forced to watch church online.
Perdue faces off against Ossoff on Tuesday, while Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock, in the Georgia Senate runoffs. These seats will determine control of the U.S. Senate, as Republicans currently have at least 50 seats and Democrats currently have at least 48 seats. If the Democrats take both of these seats, then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate — and Democrats would control the Senate floor and all the committees. The importance of these races is highlighted by the fact that both President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden are heading to Georgia on Monday, the day before the election, to give last-minute boosts to their parties' candidates.
She took her oath of office on a Koran owned by President Thomas Jefferson and wore a traditional Palestinian robe (thobe) to the swearing-in and first session in the House.
Despite this clear conflict of interest, our military ensures the free flow of their crude because oil is vital to the U.S. economy, powering 92 percent of our transportation system. The global nature of oil pricing means that no matter how much oil we produce, our economic sovereignty remains jeopardized by OPEC and the supercartel.
One week ago, McConnell said, the Senate GOP laid out a proposal that tackled each of these emergency missions and noted that the proposals remain the central building blocks of the legislation they have today.

What's more, the policies are supposed to discourage that behavior in the first place. Clawbacks still aren't invoked all that much, but they have come up lately. Earlier this year, two Wells Fargo (WFC, +1.42%) executives gave back some of their pay amid the bank's recent phony accounts scandal, the publication continued. Yahoo has a clawback provision, and Mayer's pay is covered by it. But the company's policy only permits Yahoo to recoup executive pay 'in the event of a restatement of incorrect Yahoo financial results' — basically accounting fraud, and that's it. Not covered by a clawback: Allegedly covering up two hacking incidents so you can complete a multi-billion sale of your company's main business.
We are appalled that NHS doctors are now having to draw up their own guidelines as a direct consequence of the Health Secretary's abdication of responsibility, said Dr Qureshi, referring to Tory government minister Matt Hancock.
We've done studies and we've seen studies and if you do away with the inheritance tax you can add hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and the reason being is because some people are saving money each month to pass to their kids or maybe they have an insurance policy they make a premium on. If you do away with the inheritance tax they don't need to save the cash, they don't need to make the insurance premium, they can build their home, they can give to their church, they can build their business and pass net worth onto the next generation. And isn't that what we should do in America instead of passing cold cash down or insurance policy? Let's pass net worth on.

Weisman's January 4 article in the Times was an amplification of the arguments he made in his book. Again he ignored left wing anti-Semitism. He regurgitated Goldberg's allegations of Israeli moral infirmity. He defended Tlaib and Omar and their hatred for Israel. And thne, Weisman insisted that American Jewry should forget its ties to Jewish tradition and to the Jewish people and instead embrace an identity based entirely on leftist ideology and propaganda.

Other stats from the survey do seem alarming at first. One in thirty adults in the United States is said to have experienced very low food security. One in thirty-five was hungry for at least one day because there was not enough money for food in the household. One adult in a hundred did not eat for a whole day because of a lack of money for food. But keep that lack of money for food in the back of your mind—more on it later.

Given Trump's enormous Twitter following, the top reply to his tweets often receives a great deal of attention. As Twitter favors verified users on the platform, while often shadowbanning conservative accounts, liberal and left-leaning responses to the President often appear at the top of his replies.
Eliason, who is reportedly running as a Democratic Socialist, says that she wants to bring new energy to the political landscape of Northeast Mississippi.
Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-mass migration populist Lega, and Luigi Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment populist Five Star Alliance, have been locked in round after round of talks about forming a new government which has been claimed would be a nightmare scenario for the EU — but negotiations appear to have stalled.

The statute in question establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Obergefell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders.
If there are new witnesses to be called, you would have to start with the ones who refuse to be called to start with, he said.
I had this experience in arms control deals when I was in the Bush 43 State Department, Bolton recalled. I understand what Tillerson's putting up with, but you've got to stand against this because just the inertia of the people who negotiated the deal, the people who supported it, are very reluctant to admit they were wrong and that Iran, in fact, is violating it because it's a way of undercutting all of their efforts.

A large group of NeverTrump investors and cheap labor CEO donors are promising to go on strike until House Speaker Paul Ryan schedules passage of a cheap labor amnesty for June 25. The bipartisan group, which is titled the American Business Immigration Council, is led by Mike Fernandez, a healthcare executive in Florida. He wants Ryan to keep the House in session on June 25 so the alliance of 193 Democrats and 25-plus cheap labor Republicans can pass a discharge petition amnesty through the House — despite many polls showing any amnesty is very unpopular among GOP voters.

The original Facebook post was started by a woman who told a story of how she was tricked into smuggling an illegal migrant into the UK. In the post she stated: I have fundraised for the guys in Calais. I have given donations, food, clothes, medicines, and money. I even got talked into smuggling a Syrian woman here who was pregnant. Then found out she was Tunisian. Tunisian women have lots of rights based on French law. The girl and her baby are safe in Norwich and that's good. But I was told it would be a £2,000 fine if we got caught.
The federal government should consider prosecuting state and local officials who implement and enforce sanctuary policies violative of federal law, said Vaughan. Victims of crimes committed by illegal aliens shielded by sanctuary policies should considering suing sanctuary jurisdictions for damages, she added.
For far too long, thousands of us at Google — and other subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google's parent company — have had our workplace concerns dismissed by executives. Our bosses have collaborated with repressive governments around the world. They have developed artificial intelligence technology for use by the Department of Defense and profited from ads by a hate group. They have failed to make the changes necessary to meaningfully address our retention issues with people of color. Most recently, Timnit Gebru, a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the few Black women in her field, said she was fired over her work to fight bias. Her offense? Conducting research that was critical of large-scale AI models and being critical of existing diversity and inclusion efforts. In response, thousands of our colleagues organized, demanding an explanation. Both of us have heard from colleagues — some new, some with over a decade at the company — who have decided that working at Alphabet is no longer a choice they can make in good conscience. Workers have mobilized against these abuses before. Organized workers at the company forced executives to drop Project Maven, the company's artificial-intelligence program with the Pentagon, and Project Dragonfly, its plan to launch a censored search engine in China. Some of Alphabet's subcontractors won a $15 minimum hourly wage, parental leave, and health insurance after an employee outcry.

Then when you look at Korea – look, this is one of the consequences of eight years of Obama's failed foreign policy. He pursued what he called 'strategic patience' vis-a-vis the North Korean nuclear program, which was nothing more than a synonym for doing nothing at all. The consequences are right before us: the North Koreans are now very close to being able to drop a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead on a U.S. target, he said.
What started out as a good thing became much too much of a good thing, he said. There are a lot of parallels like that. There are a lot of boomerangs. The Citizens United case, whatever you think of it, it was started, the legal road to Citizens United, was started by guess who? Ralph Nader.

We are happy that our guests can finally step on safe land, but there is still a lot that needs to be changed: Shady deals with Libya, further ad-hoc agreements, EU-funded human rights abuses, this must stop! Sea-Watch stated on Twitter.
In 2013, a study by the University of Gothenburg found that a larger proportion of men than women had been exposed to domestic violence in their relationships.
Under the administration's gag rule, people who access care through Title X—mostly the uninsured, low income, or people of color—wouldn't be able to get info about all their options, including abortions, she posted. Enough is enough.
Along with the United States, 26 nations have joined the international alliance: Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Gambia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Togo, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.
The professor claims that her campaign will focus on environmental justice, universal health care, and workers' rights.
Overall, this is not a rosy picture for Iran, already suffering from deep economic crisis, compounded by U.S. sanctions, which have impacted the country's banking ties with the world and its non-oil trade, Radio Farda predicted.
The Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S. Code, Section 1385, was first passed in 1878 to resolve concerns that the federal military was being used to enforce domestic laws in former Confederate states. Under its original terms, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibited the use of the Army to act as a posse comitatus (which means to act as domestic law enforcement) except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.
We're not necessarily being singled out by those tech companies, but certainly by the people who have been putting pressure on them and, in fact, we think we're being set up in a lot of ways because in looking at some of the content, these are accounts that have been created two days ago and they have few pieces of content and some of them are parodies of what you would think a right-wing inciter of violence would be.
Trump announced in mid-December that the U.S. will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in Syria. Trump's move has raised fears over clearing the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters in Syria who fought alongside American troops against IS extremists. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.
Omar describes the legislative package, titled Pathway to PEACE (Progressive, Equitable, and Constructive Engagement), as a bold progressive vision to rethink the country's approach to foreign policy by centering human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America's engagement in the world, and making military action a last resort in a press release. I believe in a world where there are no young girls living through war, and no nations that are being destroyed, she declared in the statement.
If women go into architecture, shouldn't the government give them a free education too? Xue Rongfang, a student at Fujian Normal University, asked. Why should men get this benefit?
I and a lot of the other senators, who I've spoken to over the weekend, are worried that we're not doing enough to get cash in the hands of affected workers and families quickly so we're going to be focused this week on how to do just that, the Arkansas Republican continued. We worry that the bill setting up a new and complicated system relying on businesses giving paid sick leave and then getting a refundable tax credit won't move quickly enough and could put pressure on those businesses to lay workers off.
When employees are trained to focus on their differences, the camaraderie necessary to work together is destroyed, Washington said. Mistrust in fellow coworkers is sown, and those the training is intended to help are actually harmed in the long run.
Featuring five Syrian migrants, the event's blurb entices would-be punters with the promise of singing, their talent to the Eastern lute (Oud), the Kanoun [a kind of zither], the violin and the guitar. Entry is €5 on the door — but free for 'refugees', of course — yet any politically uninterested fans of Levantine music won't get away lecture-free.
Romney said he wants to hear from John Bolton, the former national security adviser at the White House, who others have said raised alarms about the alternative foreign policy toward Ukraine being run by Giuliani.
From 2003 to 2008, Sical had worked in Anaheim, California; Tampa, Florida; Washington, D.C.; and many places in between, laying tile and driving trucks for $12 an hour as part of a vast undocumented labor force that fueled the U.S. economic expansion of the mid-2000s.
So today, Pompeo and the Trump administration, operating as Kirkpatrick-type realists, believe that the U.S. has an affirmative duty to look out for itself. And that means, as a matter of strategic necessity, allying with other countries that also fear China's rise. We can worry about the nature of those governments later; the first priority is to make sure that we don't lose the greater geopolitical struggle.
Harris did not suggest that the amnesty be coupled with protection for Americans, so the proposed TPS-to-citizen rule would also invert political power in Wahington, Krikorian added;
He continued to say: So when they talk about Farrakhan, call me a hater, you know they do, call me an antisemite — stop it! I'm anti-termite! I don't know nothing about hating somebody because of their religious preference. Farrakhan was not banned from Twitter for this video.
The wording of the judge's ruling is unambiguous on this point, stating the viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is prescribed by the First Amendment.
Worse, these foreign workers — most of whom are employed as contractors by little-known foreign-0wned staffing companies — usually accept lower wages than Americans because they hope to be paid by winning the hugely valuable deferred bonus of green cards from the U.S. government. Americans cannot get that federal bonus because they are already citizens.
The State Department previously claimed it had produced all responsive Clinton emails, including emails recovered by the FBI that Hillary Clinton tried to destroy or withhold. The State Department initially claimed all responsive emails had been produced in 2018, but then found more emails, which were produced, for the first time, early last year. Then in November 2019, the State Department first disclosed to the court that the FBI had found this latest batch of emails.

According to the governor, a letter his administration sent to hospitals said:
So, in late 2015, as now President Donald Trump was surging past other Republicans toward the GOP nomination he would win the next spring, Ryan swooped in to take the Speaker's gavel. During his time as Speaker, Ryan frequently opposed President Trump, dating as far back as the early days of the campaign–offering a differing worldview from the president's on key core issues, including most especially immigration and trade.
Here are nine reasons why President Donald Trump should ignore the claimed January deadline — and the alternative March deadline — to ensure that American voters get what they want from the establishment:
But analysis of previous suggestions that Scotland's population must increase its economy to prosper has shown such claims to be false, with Migration Watch UK last year noting that immigration as a solution to a pensions problem has been dismissed by all serious studies, pointing out among other factors that immigrants too will grow old and draw pensions.
The sad result of the attempt to create more long weekends is this uninspiring, mishmash holiday that falls between Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's on February 12, and ends up being barely more than a bland, generic February day off to clean house. This is a shame; the Father of Our Country deserves better.
Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, who is chairman of the Parliamentary Flags and Heraldry Committee said: It's a matter of identity. Having the pink European passports has been a source of humiliation. It merged us into one European identity, which isn't what we are.

Nasrallah spoke from an undisclosed location, and his speech was played on large screens for thousands of Shiite followers in southern Beirut, interrupted occasionally by chants of Death to America. The comments were Nasrallah's first since Soleimani's killing.
Another issue central to the conflict — settlements — remains a work in progress for Israel and Trump. The president's softer campaign tone about Israel's construction of Jewish homes in east Jerusalem and the West Bank has been replaced by Trump's suggesting in his first White House meeting with Netanyahu to hold back on settlements for a bit.
That would be perfectly fine with many environmental groups, for whom opposition to dams has become something of an article of faith over the past several decades. Dams were once thought to provide an environmentally-friendly source of renewable energy, through hydroelectric power. But they destroy whatever habitat finds itself submerged by reservoirs; impede fish migration; and — if managed poorly — create new hazards, such as mechanical failure.
After thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general's body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz. An honor guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.
The formation of a non-profit announced on Friday is the next step toward putting the more than $20 million Americans have donated to get the project done to use.
As Washington pursues a policy of encouragement of international anarchy and disregard for organizations and international law, we call upon all diplomatic corps, civil society organizations, and religious authorities to boycott the inauguration ceremony of the US embassy in Jerusalem, lest they lend legitimacy to an illegal decision and to continued Israeli policies of occupation, colonization, and annexation, Erekat said.
One of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.
Breitbart News previously reported that Sarder, a valet supervisor, said he was fired for having the gun with him, although using it allowed him to save the life of 52-year-old stabbing victim Stephanie Kerr.
Days after Kushner left Saudi Arabia last October, bin Salman put many of his political rivals and prominent business executives under house arrest. Three sources who have been in contact with members of the Saudi and Emirati royal families since the crackdown told the Intercept that the Saudi figures named in the President's Daily Brief were among those rounded up and at least one was reportedly tortured.

We do not comment on personnel issues. However, we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane's post and we viewed it as her real, personal narrative about what it's like to live in the Bay Area. We agree with her comments about the high costs of living in San Francisco, which is why we announced in December that we are expanding our Eat24 customer support team into our Phoenix office where [we] will pay the same wage.
Not all restaurant owners are lamenting the new wage policy. Jason Wang, the founder of Xi'an Famous Foods in Manhattan supports the wage increase policy. However, he claims that to offset the increase in the cost of labor, he was forced to raise his prices.
Mustafa Edib Yılmaz, a journalist who returned to work on Sunday, describes his office as being run under close police surveillance. He tells France24 the protesters have returned with him, too. Outside of my office window, I can see at least 500 and 600 people, chanting and singing slogans. … I can see conservative women in headscarves out there protesting with five or six-year-old children. He laments that he does not believe the international community will protest the takeover. There have been some statements from the European commission, saying something along the lines of 'we note with high concern,' which is like the dictionary definition of 'we are not going to do anything.'
Sens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) are facing Democrat candidates Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock in dual runoff races Tuesday, and if both Democrats were to win, their party would take control of Congress's upper chamber.

British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to make a number of changes in the composition of her cabinet Monday, with movements anticipated to predominantly focus on junior positions.
Bannon and Shirley also discussed how the Reagans brought glamor back to the White House. However, Shirley said there was a deeper meaning to this than one might believe because Reagan didn't like the way [Jimmy] Carter had downgraded the White House. Reagan wanted Americans to be proud of their president.
The city was also the residence and burial place of the early medieval ruler Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor dubbed the Father of Europe for having united the western part of the continent by the 9th century.

Some said the Islamic State's defeat in Marawi was less important than the impressive length of time they were able to hold off Philippine government forces, which inspired more feuding Islamist bands to rally under the ISIS banner. Presumably, the militants were even more impressed by vans and trucks overstuffed with money and jewelry rolling out of Marawi during the occupation.
It is right we give a safe haven to those who are in danger but too often we have been too trusting.
In the meantime, the Egyptian strongman is trying to make his country more inclusive to minorities; just on January 6, el-Sisi, himself a Muslim, joined in the inauguration of a new Coptic Christian church in Cairo, signaling to that beleaguered community that he has their back.

The South China Morning Post recounted the experience of one father whose child had a visible reaction to the expired vaccine:
A snap poll taken after a Sunday night television appearance by the Chancellor, in which he again called on his German counterpart Angela Merkel to change course on her migrant strategy, found broad agreement with the new direction of travel for the country. With the statement Austria should continue to set their own migrant policy as long as there is no solution at EU level, 86 per cent agreed, with 62 per cent agreeing strongly.

No reason for the arrest was given, the pop-star-turned-legislator added.
The revival of American manufacturing was a cornerstone of Trump's 2016 campaign promise to Make America Great Again. Many economists derided the idea that manufacturing could boom in the U.S., insisting that a combination of automation and globlization meant that factory jobs were gone for good. Some even accused Trump of attempting to con the American people with promises of manufacturing jobs.
Brill said he disagreed with that premise because you can look across government, whether it's local, state, or federal, and find programs that do work.
Obama's conduct, Herschmann said, met all of the Democrats' elements of abuse of power: 1. The president exercises his official power … 2. To obtain a corrupt personal benefit … 3. While ignoring or injuring our national interest.

The reasons for cancelling the Huawei deal are manifest; the reasons for sticking with it are murky and obscure – but seem to have something to do with what Trump would call the Deep State and what in Britain we might call the 'liberal elite' or the 'corrupt, self-serving Westminster bubble.'
Before even taking office, Biden is being lobbied by corporate interests and factions of House Republicans and Democrats to drop U.S. tariffs on China in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

Let's put this in perspective. Consider the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Tax Check-Off, which is promoted by the IRS through the 1040 tax form and doesn't require a contributor to give any money beyond what he is already paying in taxes. In April of 2016—normally the highest contribution month during a presidential campaign year—it raised $9.9 million. In a typical month, it raises less than a million dollars.
Academics Rebecca Steinfeld, 35, and Charles Keidan, 40, wanted to secure legal recognition of their seven-year relationship by entering into a civil partnership, rejecting marriage as they claim it carries patriarchal baggage. However, they have been prevented from doing so because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 stipulates that only same-sex couples are eligible.
In its first abortion case since Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court, SCOTUS has ruled to protect women from dangerous abortion drugs. This ruling represents a major pro-life victory against an abortion industry that consistently puts profit margins ahead of the welfare of mothers and unborn babies. We hope these federal regulations protecting women will remain in place and that this will be the first of many such rulings to come.
Dr Joanne Smith Finley, Reader in Chinese Studies at Newcastle University, told the Commission of a conversation she had with a Uyghur man in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, on July 18, 2018, who told her that people are taken for small things, not necessarily always because of religious practice.
Pritzker's demand for top-level GOP rejection of GOP voters echoes similar threats from other business-first GOP donors. In June 2018, for example, Breitbart reported on donors' demands for more imported workers and consumers:

Failure to immediately stay implementation of the Rule so that we can take the steps necessary to contain and mitigate the outbreak of the disease puts the public health and safety of our communities at increased risk, said a March 6 letter by 15 Democrat attorneys general. The rule denies green cards to migrants who rely on federal health and welfare programs, and so it is deterring individuals from accessing critical health benefits to which they are legally entitled, said the letter, which claimed that DHS's implementation of the Public Charge Rule during this public health crisis is irresponsible and reckless.
This is a no-brainer. It's not just China any longer. With the rise of cases in Europe & Asia, we need to take additional steps to protect Americans, Hawley tweeted.

In his talks with the media, Trump has also hinted at broader concessions, including a huge immigration bill that would provide business with more workers and Democrats with more future voters. In his January 19 exchange with reporters, Trump said:
The Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates, as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.
Eleven CEO's and business leaders joined the president, with a list that included PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman, Marriott President and CEO Arne Sorenson, Air BnB founder Brian Chesky, and Starfish Media Chairman Soledad O'Brien.

In January, the widow of a military contractor killed in terrorist attack in Amman last November sued Twitter, alleging that Twitter knowingly permitted the terrorist group ISIS to use its social network as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits, reports the Post.
One of the things our campus free speech bill does, in addition to insisting the colleges adopt good statements defending free speech and explaining the meaning of free speech, we insist there be a section of freshman orientation where the students are taught about these statements, and that they're taught about the policy that disciplines people who shut down speakers. So, there is an educational element in our legislation, but ultimately legislation can never be a complete solution. There has to be a change in which we start to really educate students again in the principles of free speech and what classical liberalism of the kind the Founders practiced are all about. If we don't do that, this generation is going to be lost and the country is going to be lost.
Biden's vision for his Catholic agenda continues with the directive Build an economy where everyone comes along and we protect the 'least of these.'
The deal — which was not done in consultation with the United States — is seen as a big diplomatic loss for the incoming Biden administration, which had promised to develop closer ties with the EU to counteract the rise of China as opposed to President Trump's tougher unilateral approach.

Eberstadt added that people in politics usually do not pay attention to demographics and are obsessed with what happens in the next 24 hours. But demographic change creeps up on you on little cat feet and it doesn't become clear that things have changed for half a generation… but at that point the door's closed.
For now, though, Parker said Iowans, particularly at Trump's Thursday rally, were excited about the economy and how it's working for them.
Even in the 49th District, where the foreign-born population remains below 20 percent, Democrat Mike Levin beat out Republican Diane Harkey. The district has anywhere between an 18 to 19 percent foreign-born population with about 55 percent of foreign-born residents arriving from Latin America and nearly 30 percent coming from Asia.
Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported the spike in Cubans heading for Texas appears to be a direct result of the President's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Castro-lead government in Cuba. Cubans fear the special adjustment in immigration afforded to them under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 may soon come to an end and they would then be treated like any other illegal alien.
On Wednesday, there is little doubt the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to acquit Trump, now the third impeached president in American history.

Let's face it: those 11 million [illegal migrants] are not sitting on their duff. They're working somewhere. They may be working under a fake Social [Security Number], they may be working as an independent subcontractor, but they're working and they've got skills. A lot of these workers working in the underground economy, used to work for [construction company] people like me. They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they're 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they're working for cash and not paying taxes.

The migration policy watchdog said: An ageing population is inevitable in Western societies where birth rates are low and health care is extending lives.

It was widely feared – or, among oil executives and the heads of nations whose economies are driven by oil revenue, devoutly hoped – that knocking Iran out of the market with sanctions would cause oil prices to soar and supplies to become tight. That does not appear to be happening, as another Radio Farda report pointed out.

Similarly judging from their capacity for bodies and the amount of time the furnaces are running, the article adds another 135 patients a day to the tally from five of these. The other three, it concludes, burned 476 people a day. While less confident in these numbers since the journalists were unable to speak to their managers, these numbers reveal a rough estimate of nearly 1,000 people incinerated per day.
On Wednesday's broadcast of MSNBC Live, host Katy Tur argued that President Trump is continuing a rhetorical tactic from the campaign where anybody who watched him could take whatever they wanted to from Trump's statements, including, If you were a Donald Trump supporter because you liked the offensive things he said, you were a white nationalist, maybe, you took his subtle queues and his lack of severe condemnations as a cue that, you know, he is accepting of my point of view, and he's going to champion what I want. And you're seeing that with foreign policy.

The test, which sent a missile into the sea off North Korea's east coast Wednesday, occurred ahead of a hugely important meeting between the leaders of the US and China this week and has been described by one analyst as an insult from Pyongyang to US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. It was an airborne middle finger to Trump and Xi before they sit down for their summit, said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at Australia's Lowy Institute. The US response, delivered via Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was short and sharp — The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. It was very different from previous lengthy, threat-laden responses. And while Tillerson's taciturn comments were instantly criticized online, analysts said it was difficult to gauge if his approach would make much of a difference compared to his predecessors'.

As a tool of terror, the drug would work best in a closed space, said Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher at Rand Corp. who served as acting undersecretary in the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate in the Obama administration.

For decades, the federal government has failed miserably in fulfilling that obligation. Now, Americans are making a grassroots effort to solve the problem themselves, while sending a message to Washington. As Kolfage put it, This is giving them an avenue to be heard.

Then when you look at Korea – look, this is one of the consequences of eight years of Obama's failed foreign policy. He pursued what he called 'strategic patience' vis-a-vis the North Korean nuclear program, which was nothing more than a synonym for doing nothing at all.

Said Gaffney in discussing the unmasking controversy, citing the duration of the effort and potential involvement of others, I think that there's unquestionably a political warfare operation being run by their former boss, Barack Obama. And I think there's a lot of evidence that they're still lashed up with him and therefore i think it's a safe assumption that they are probably performing opposition research, if you wish to call it that, for Organizing for Action… and their purpose for it is pretty clear – destroying the Trump presidency.

The Times quoted analysts who labored mightily to blame the travails of the Iranian middle class on President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions, but the very same article makes it clear the Iranian government was already fiddling with the economy in a variety of disastrous ways to conceal the effects of corruption, political repression, foolish policies, and the squandering of Iran's windfall from the nuclear deal on foreign adventures.

Vox is a progressive site, which generally adopts pro-migration policies that subordinate the interests of white-collar and blue-collar Americans to the interests of migrants, investors and cheap-labor CEOs. Like many other sites, Vox's articles reflect the progressive view that Americans have a moral duty to help foreigners migrate to the United States, and it is eager to overlook the resulting civic and economic damage done to ordinary Americans — and also to ignore the huge economic gains that cheap-labor migration delivers to investors and upper-income postgraduate progressives.

Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court in 1937 and failed. Otherwise, the Supreme Court, which by the way — the Constitution doesn't say how many justices there are. It has been just by agreement for decades, and most of us think it ought to stay that way. There are some Democrats, just like Joe Manchin, who say they won't get rid of the filibuster.

Parliament speaker Ali Larijani compared Soleimani's killing to the 1953 CIA-backed coup that cemented the shah's power and to the U.S. Navy's shootdown of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 that killed 290 people.

When Iran's Revolutionary Guards seized two American naval craft in the Gulf on Tuesday evening [January 13, 2016], with ten American sailors on board, it was not the sailors who were the important point, but the fact that the Revolutionary Guards effectively kidnapped U.S. President Barack Obama [himself only] a few hours before he was to deliver his final State of the Union address, towards the end of his second term in office.

The President is determined to finally build a wall at the Southern border.

Gulf Arab nations, once the main backers of rebels trying to oust Assad, are lining up to reopen their embassies in Syria, worried about leaving the country at the heart of the Arab world to regional rivals Iran and Turkey and missing out on lucrative post-war reconstructive projects. Key border crossings with neighbors, shuttered for years by the war, have reopened, and Arab commercial airlines are reportedly considering resuming flights to Damascus.
Currently, $13.3 billion in the Pentagon budget may be available, according to a congressional aide, enough to cover the $5 billion that Mr. Trump is seeking for the border wall. That would have to be diverted from projects such as military housing that Congress previously authorized. … Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that without a statutory definition of emergency, courts are unlikely to second-guess the president's judgment on that. The National Emergencies Act envisions that political checks, rather than litigation, will prevent abuse of executive authority, Mr. Vladeck said.
Iranian media meanwhile focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash, with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign.

I think there are a number of people who could probably command the support of the majority of the House, he said. It wouldn't be for me to pick them. Some have been willing to serve in the past. Daniel Webster comes to mind, he seems to be a very presentable guy. It would be obviously up to him or others in the House to stand for this, if in fact Paul Ryan were to create a vacancy – which I hope he will do.
After Assad led a crackdown on protesters in 2011, Syria was cast out as a pariah by much of the Arab and Western world. It lost its seat at the Arab League and was hit by crippling sanctions by the international community, as the U.S. and European diplomats closed their diplomatic missions.
In a few countries, the remittances paper over the economic damage imposed by the progressives' Hunger Games. For Central American countries, the negative effects of emigration seem to be broadly (or more than) offset by gains from their higher remittance receipts, the IOM reported in 2012. Those remittances are huge: Remittances sent to Guatemala represented 11 percent of GDP and 46 percent of household income in 2017 … [I El Salvador] Remittances reached $5.47 billion in 2018, amounting to roughly 20 percent of the country's GDP, said a 2020 report by the Texas Public Policy Foundation. Who gains? Those remittances consist of wages taken from the hands of blue-collar American workers, including many black and Latino hands. Illegal migrant workers rationally take jobs at low U.S. wages, so exempting U.S. employers from the wage-raising pressure to make fair bargains with the tens of millions of Americans who are disabled, parenting, drugged, isolated, or unemployed. Wealthy Americans also gain from the extraction of foreign labor and consumer demand, said a 2013 article titled Dollars, 'Free Trade,' and Migration: The Combined Forces of Alienation in Postwar El Salvador. It argued that capitalists in the destination countries capture surplus labor and value from migrants by paying substandard wages, [as] capitalists in El Salvador also profit both directly and indirectly, from remittances. Joe Biden's pro-migration allies are pressuring him to maximize migration into the United States, despite the public's deep opposition to cheap-labor migration. https://t.co/0P3Uzj6k5N — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 29, 2020

We are proud that NARAL's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. We know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways. Both candidates need to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to Roe v. Wade and safeguarding abortion access.

We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.

Ninety-five percent of murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16-25. That's true in New York, that's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of people that are getting killed. You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets. Put the cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods. So one of the unintended consequences is people say, 'Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.' Yes, that's true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is. And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them… And then they start, 'Oh I don't want to get caught.' So they don't bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.

ICE is fortunate that the threat [to migrants' health] posed by these detention centers can be mitigated rather easily. By releasing from custody the thousands of detainees who pose no threat to public safety and do not constitute an unmanageable flight risk, ICE can reduce the overcrowding of its detention centers, and thus make them safer, while also putting fewer people at risk.

Two factors are said to have played a critical role in the signing of the deal, namely China's desire to ink a deal before President-Elect Joe Biden assumes the White House and a push from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to secure a deal prior to the end of Germany's term as the head of the EU presidency in December.

The issue is vital to his presidency, in part because Americans' wages are reduced by the annual inflow of 1 million legal immigrants alongside the routine inflow of illegals and temporary visa-workers.

6. We have to act now because both parties failed in the past. Many Democrats want open borders because they see illegal aliens as future voters.

When you have reached the pinnacle of your profession people will do anything to try to tear you and what you build down. These allegations are demonstrably false and Coach Bell eagerly awaits the opportunity to be exonerated.
Despite corporate claims, the vast majority of these foreign workers are lower-skill graduates performing starter jobs that could help Americans launch their careers. In fact, the huge H-1B and OPT programs have created an army of staffing contractors which is used by many Americans companies to lock many American graduates out of starter jobs in software, science, and engineering.

It's certainly not good for the people who are trying to get here, Bloomberg added, before claiming America was too wealthy to deny refugees.
To recap, 5G — which stands for 'fifth generation' — is the next wave of wireless telecoms technology. Insanely, against the advice of allies from the U.S. to Australia, the British government has decided to award the contract for this strategically vital communications system to a country which is not only a major geopolitical rival but which is also infamous for spying on its competitors: China.

Fishing is the acid test of Brexit, he continued. This is the clearest way that we can measure, actually, what is being done, and when it comes to financial services [EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier] has already made it plain he's not going to give us a good deal.

I think there's still hope for the Trump administration on this. Their utterly inexplicable finding that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal – I mean, that's kind of an embarrassment. Fred Fleitz, a former colleague of mine, has an excellent article up on the Fox News opinion website on what's wrong with that finding. I urge people to take a look at that. This has got to be stopped. Otherwise, I think it will risk embarrassing the Trump administration, given the president's very strong stand against this deal in the campaign, Bolton advised.
Olsen went on, It's not [between Romney and Cruz], because Donald Trump picked up the hundred-dollar bill that had been lying in front of them for about a decade, and cashed it. And that's the hundred-dollar bill of dissatisfied blue collar workers who want a government that's limited in its scope but active in the protection of Americans because they are Americans. They think they can put the genie back in the bottle by getting rid of the president. Well, good luck. The fact is, this is what people wanted for years. They've had a taste of the apple. They like it, and they're going to expect the next Republican leader to follow suit, or they're going to abandon the party.
I gave three limbs for this nation and I feel deeply invested, Kolfage said. I want to make sure that my children and my grandchildren have everything that I have today and I'm fighting for that.

CNN reports that only 20 cities are on the shortlist to become home to Amazon's second headquarters.

For several weeks he's played down the consequences of the public health emergency even as his agencies scramble to manage it. Now he's suggesting that a robust jobs report might be explained in part by the prospect that Americans are hunkering down and focusing more of their spending in their own country. There's no evidence that the virus has juiced jobs.
University of Pennsylvania law professor Jacques deLisle noted that China has been able to shut Taiwan out of numerous international bodies it is eminently qualified to join, based on Taiwan's exemplary conduct, its economic significance, and the internationally-recognized definition of a legitimate nation-state.
The word solidarity in the EU has become tainted for Conservatives and populists, owing to it evoking the response of Brussels and Berlin to the 2015 crisis. After German Chancellor Angela Merkel flung open the doors of Europe to unlimited migrants, she then demanded other countries — who had not been party to the decision to suspend asylum rules in the first place — show their 'European solidarity' and take their 'fair share' of migrants. If member states did not, the EU threatened punishment. The ultimatum caused a rift in the EU between Western and Eastern Europe, with countries like Hungary and Poland flatly rejecting asylum seekers.
Trump through his gamble has dragged the U.S. into the most dangerous situation in the region, Hessameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on the social media app Telegram. Whoever put his foot beyond the red line should be ready to face its consequences.
Pelosi served as Speaker from January 2007 until the beginning of January 2011, for two Congresses when Democrats held the majority at the end of the George W.

Angelica Kitchen, long a staple of the East Village, closed their doors after 40 years of operation in response to the increased cost of labor mandated by the new wage policy. I felt like I was being regulated in a way that took certain choices away from me that I felt belonged to me, rightfully, as a business owner, owner Leslie McEachern said. I'm not trying to undercut or underpay anybody, but I also don't know what's coming down the pike.
ICE agents revealed this week that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which enforces a strict sanctuary policy to shield illegal aliens from arrest and deportation, freed Flores from their custody last year despite a long criminal history and their insistance for him to be turned over to their custody.

If Biden is serious about taking on the power of the fossil fuel lobby, why is he going to a fundraiser hosted by the co-founder of a natural gas company? Sunrise Movement founder and executive director Varshini Prakash asked.
That only adds to the mystery of why the Hellfire bungle or theft occurred, why it was kept under wraps for so long, and why it is surfacing now. Maybe some of this story manipulation is intended to make the Hellfire in Cuban hands seem like a bigger deal than it really is, to distract bad actors and give them a distorted impression of where the cutting edge in American missile technology lies.
I understand it, he said of trying to live progressive values at all times, but the reality is, there's a big risk of being perceived as being an ideologue and not a problem-solver.
It is expected that the courts will make a ruling on this issue within coming months, although the court does not always follow the suggestions of outside advisers when it comes to policy and legislation, it is also not uncommon for them to do so. This makes it even more likely that the court will follow the advice of advisers such as Szpunar.

Ask if she would still have taken the woman if she had known she wasn't Syrian, however, the woman told Breitbart London: Maybe I would have.
Turkey insists the PYD and YPG are actively allied with the PKK and are essentially branches of the same Kurdish separatist organization. Turkey's looming strategic nightmare involves Kurds in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey joining together to declare an independent state that would absorb territory from all three nations. Turkey complains that weapons given by Western allies to the YPG to fight ISIS are finding their way across the border into PKK hands.
Many U.S. and Indian employees tell Breitbart News that American graduates are excluded from competing from many Fortune 500 jobs so that the jobs can be traded by hiring managers to foreign workers who want to win green cards.
It´s a state scandal, said Jean Rottner, president of the Grand-Est region of eastern France, where infections are surging and some hospitals are overwhelmed. Getting vaccinated is becoming more complicated than buying a car.
Francis added that because of the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, many women are being influenced by fear right now, and this is being perpetuated by the abortion industry.
According to the Washington Examiner, WaPo admitted editing out the line when asked. WaPo's editors said, We reserve the right to edit letters. As part of our normal process, we share edited letters with letter-writers at least twice in the process (including a final edited version). The problem here is that WaPo did not edit out a superfluous line that ought not to have been there in the first place. Rather, they took out the line that pulled the covers back on the fact that they had rejected the opportunity to go the NRA event and learn how suppressors actually work. And then, after rejecting that opportunity, had railed against pending suppressor regulation and the NRA.
