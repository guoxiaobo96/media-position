claim: sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) claimed during tuesday night's democrat debate that he has opposed authoritarianism all over the world.
it's a combination of china, and europe, and its socialist states and their massive debt, and our country – which has gone from a great, market-based, free market economy into something that is controlled by these big, power-hungry, power-centric maniacs that present a looming crisis for the american taxpayer… which, of course, will also be forced to clean up the wreckage afterward, and pick up the tab for the failures of their political elites.
in comparison, california — the most ambitious state in green energy policy — has merely set itself a goal of 100% renewables by 2045, more than 25 years away.
needless to say, the thought of digging up amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to western environmentalists. yet for their part, brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted bolsonaro into office. as this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.
but afd has arrived on the political scene at a fortuitous moment.
james kirchik, writing in foreign policy, said it is dismaying that the times would collaborate in a business venture with a government currently imprisoning an american reporter.
to see ambassador haley raise this as a potential viable reform effort is unfortunate because she's playing a shell game. she doesn't have the votes, the united states doesn't have the votes. the procedures don't permit those kinds of reforms. there is a complete lack of political will, and it isn't going to happen, bayefsky contended.
much of the reason boils down to war guilt that has made germans determined to never give the so-called brown shirts a chance to rule the nation again.
echoing other democrats, schiff indicated that democrats are trying to impeach and remove trump from office to avoid his winning a second term.
it was a very short speech. you get very little time at the human rights council to speak, so she couldn't say very much of anything, she noted.
johnson: no, i don't think any of us should. and let's face it, i think we probably understand what the courts would rule in this case. i mean, they're going to take it up to the 9th circuit, and we know the result of that, so we still won't get the barrier. so i want the barrier. i want a secure border. and i think the best way to do that is to acknowledge the fact, you know, the president was, came to our lunch yesterday, told everybody to hang together. you know, i'm all for doing that. i'm happy to hang with him. there will be increasing pressure, and legitimate pressure. i mean, there are some people really being harmed by this. there's no doubt about it. so let's address that specifically. don't completely reopen these agencies, but we should be ready with plan b as democrats, as nancy pelosi, chuck schumer continue to dig in, let's give them basically an offer that they simply can't refuse, but still puts an awful lot of pressure on them to negotiate in good faith and provide the barrier funding that we need.
the europe that will be formed in june will guide us all, unlike the one that exists today and is led by bureaucrats, salvini said during his visit to warsaw.

it didn't take long for the candidates to make clear whom they saw as the front-runner. sen. bernie sanders of vermont was piled on by competitors fighting to become the moderate alternative to the self-declared democratic socialist.
she quickly shifted to making a party unity plea and echoing her stump speech lines about big money in politics and corruption.
johnson: well, again, i want to maintain pressure, because i actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. you know, hugh, we do have a crisis. you know, it drives me crazy how democrats are minimizing this problem. you know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? everybody recognized it. the obama administration responded to it. the cbp was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. about 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. in the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. you know, we have the flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. and once they get here, they are home free. and when i hear democrats talk about technology on the border, i mean, that's fine. we can track somebody, we can apprehend them. we process them. and then we disburse them, and they're here to stay, because if we don't detain them, it's almost impossible to remove them. that's the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally and hugh, there's nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, i think that's a low estimate, get sexually assaulted.
numerous russian posts focused on the ongoing debate about climate change by linking catastrophic weather events to climate change and divisively labeling one viewpoint as right and one as left, the report states. one post characterizes americans as ignoring major events that are allegedly signs of climate change. additionally, these posts frame the conservative viewpoint regarding climate change as a 'liberal hoax, all in an effort to generate further domestic controversy surrounding the issue of climate change.
roberts, 82, maneuvered the 2018 farm bill through congress with support from both parties — a move ultimately embraced by president donald trump as a rare bipartisan success. however, some republican critics argue roberts' work across the aisle resulted in a deeply flawed and costly farm bill that represents a betrayal of conservative values. it's a slap in the face to ronald reagan, said robert rector, senior research fellow at the heritage foundation. it's a victory for a massive welfare state without work requirements and an out-of-control budget.
the plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. about $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.
hewitt: i don't think anyone does. that's the right answer. i don't think anyone does. so given that it's an open question, and i know jonathan turley thinks it's an open question, you'll get some ideologues and both sides who will say it's a closed question. it's not. nobody knows what they would do. the key case here is youngstown sheet and tube. given that that is an open question, isn't that preferred to opening the government sort of halfway? or do you think yours is the preferred solution?
a former military intelligence officer, buttigieg seemed comfortable discussing foreign affairs, such as the trump administration's killing of iranian general qassem soleimani. there is no evidence that that made our country safer, he said, adding later, this is not an episode of '24.'
i don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the united states, warren said.
that has until now made german politics unique, compared to austria, switzerland or france, where far-right parties have traditionally had a stronger presence in the political arena.

trade is so brisk, in fact, heathrow is operating at capacity, with holland-kaye claiming that the airport must expand so we can connect all corners of the uk to the growing markets of the world.
blunt said, i think the country is is the right to hold presidents accountable. the president should be very careful over the next 10 days is that his behavior is what you would expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world. my personal view is that the president touched the hot stove on wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again.
really? literacy programs are bad? sanders asked.
for instance, in 2006, then-president bush appointed former secretary of state james baker and former congressman lee hamilton to present him with a strategy for dealing with the insurgency in iraq. the two men said that the u.s. could safely withdraw its forces from iraq if it did so while forcing israel to cut a deal with the plo.
yet in addition, brazil's potential wealth extends far beyond the resources that have already been identified.
until now, right-wing populist or extreme-right parties are considered taboo, considered like aliens in the political sphere, said german political analyst wolfgang merkel in a interview with tagesspiegel daily.
international human rights lawyer anne bayefsky reported on un ambassador nikki haley's latest statement about the un human rights council on tuesday's breitbart news daily. bayefsky expressed disappointment with the mild character of haley's brief remarks, compared to the boldness of her earlier criticism of the council.
girl scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls, sylvia acevedo, ceo of girl scouts of the usa, said in the statement. we are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents who want to provide their girls opportunities to build new skills, explore stem and the outdoors, participate in community projects, and grow into happy, successful, civically engaged adults.
mike bloomberg, who isn't competing in nevada as part of a strategy to skip the first four states voting for a nominee, was on the cusp of qualifying for wednesday's presidential debate in la vegas. the billionaire businessman and former new york mayor has increasingly become a target of the democratic party's far-left wing as national polls show suggest he is on the rise.
mr macron announced via twitter on friday: following my call with donald trump and all g7 leaders, we agreed to organise an extraordinary leaders' summit by videoconference on monday on covid-19.
called the american rescue plan, it would amount to $1.9 trillion in spending. despite the massive cost, the plan does not focus on creating jobs or set aside money for building american infrastructure.
the only thing three successive administrations concerned themselves with regarding the palestinians generally, and the plo specifically, was whether or not they would say from time to time that they were willing to cut a deal – any deal – with israel.
the organization, founded and funded by silicon valley's tech plutocrats, has been demanding an amnesty for daca illegal aliens since at least 2017.
the saudi cyber-crime law states that production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine, according to rights group amnesty international.

on new year's eve, as many as 1,000 drunk men, identified by victims and police as mostly immigrants, filled the plaza outside the train station in cologne and sexually assaulted passing women. a total of 553 police reports have been filed with law enforcement in cologne, germany, based on incidents that took place on new year's eve. the bbc reports 45% of those–about 250 reports–allege sexual assault on women.
the integrity of american citizenship must be protected, a white house official said.
offered a chance early to swing at his two main rivals — sanders and buttigieg — biden opened by basically admitting he was going to lose new hampshire.
the responses were clear signals that they take bloomberg seriously.
the report also reveals that russia wants to disrupt the cutting edge technology that has resulted in an american domestic energy renaissance, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking.
bernie won by 20 points last time, biden said softly. his criticisms of sanders and buttigieg weren't nearly as sharp as those offered by other candidates. biden's had difficulty talking about the gop investigation into his own son that triggered trump's impeachment and that has coincided with the former vice president's slide in the polls.
rep. mark meadows (r-nc), as well as sen. lindsey graham (r-sc), and democrats such as rep. jackie speier (d-ca) and debbie dingell (d-mi) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.
but clinton was happy. he had a deal. he was a statesman. and no matter how much proof surfaced of north korea's continued nuclear activity, he and his advisors — and, later, his successors george w. bush and obama — were unwilling to do a thing about it. the notion that it was possible to cut a deal with north korea was more important than the substance of the deal. the fact that the regime's policies endangered the american people – not to mention all u.s. allies in asia and beyond — was beside the point.
asked about the aggressive remarks on wednesday, chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang claimed to reporters that xi was not speaking for china, but for the world.
the threat of use of force is not new for xi's regime. in october, chinese defense minister wei fenghe said during remarks to the press that if someone tries to separate out taiwan, china's military will take the necessary actions at any cost. two months later, the people's liberation army (pla) reportedly deployed a significantly larger fleet of naval vessels to the taiwan strait, presumably to surround taiwan's military and intimidate u.s. ships in the area. the chinese foreign ministry argued this was necessary because a u.s. navy ship had traveled through the sovereign vietnamese waters in the south china sea, which china has illegally claimed for itself.
and, thanks to the slavish devotion of the previous three administrations to agreements-at-all-cost, achieving the goal of protecting americans has become urgent, dire, and no job for showboaters who want to be loved by europe and msnbc.
the trump doctrine involves a simple concept: u.s. foreign policy must be grounded in reality rather than fantasy, and its aim is to achieve the only goal that matters: securing and enhancing the security of the american people.
as the presidential race shifts into high gear, college students and recent graduates are still being largely ignored, except by one candidate whose promises of rainbows and unicorns are dreams – not reality.
opinion polls suggest that afd might even capture seats in the lower house of parliament in elections in 2017 in what would be an unprecedented success for such a movement.
rights group amnesty international said saudi arabia's censorship of netflix is further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression.
we make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures, he warned.
janet yellen is able to move the purse strings around in ways unimaginable, said kaltbaum. keep in mind, this started with ben bernanke, who decided to go with this grand experiment of zero percent interest rates, and the printing of trillions of dollars, which led to janet yellen.
we are the country that's $20 trillion in debt, he warned. we are the country that has papered over this with $5 trillion in printed money, and zero percent interest rates. we are the country where taxes, and mandates, and regulations are going up, and government is taking over our life.
sanders aggressively denied supporting authoritarian regimes when asked to justify comments made repeatedly this week praising cuban dictator fidel castro's literacy campaigns, indoctrination plans that forced children to read communist propaganda and worship mass murderers like ernesto che guevara. sanders never mentioned in his prior supportive comments that cuba had an extremely high literacy rate before the 1959 communist revolution that did not necessitate the alleged literacy programs.
johnson: well, first of all, i think the president will. he's certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you're talking about the border right now. and from my standpoint, i think one of the things republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. you know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. we should be preparing, and i'm actually working on a piece of legislation, there's already one right now that i'm a co-sponsor of to fund the coast guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. hopefully, mitch mcconnell will bring it up on the floor of the senate. i don't think we should be fully opening these agencies, because democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. and of course, nancy pelosi was very clear in the white house yesterday that when president trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? you know, will i get my barrier funding? and she said no. and so again, the democrats are being hypocritical. they're paying lip service to border security. barriers actually work. they absolutely do. we need them. it's kind of a first step table stakes issue. but they're playing politics. and i hope the president stands strong.
he may not be responsible for it, but he has some accountability, biden charged. he continued: if any of my supporters did that, i'd disown them … flat disown them.
i do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realdonaldtrump from twitter, or how we got here. after a clear warning we'd take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off twitter. was this correct? i believe this was the right decision for twitter. we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.
in response to a statement about having experienced gender or gender identity discrimination in the military, only 11 percent of survey respondents answered yes.
klobuchar pivoted to a las vegas gambling attack on both warren's and sanders' plan for health care.
the group was hosted by graham, who launched the 2013 gang of eight amnesty and cheap-labor bill that was eventually blocked by gop voters.

branden river high school in bradenton, florida, could make bras officially mandatory for female students following a controversy surrounding one of their students who was forced to put band-aids over her nipples after showing up for class without a bra on under her shirt.
the report also highlights how u.s. energy exports reaching the global marketplace is a threat to russia's dominance in some of those markets. for example, according to the report, poland recently signed a five-year agreement with the united states to import liquefied natural gas into the country in an attempt to decrease dependency on russian energy supplies.
the border-crossing adults and the children they arrived at the border with will be released and given a court date for an immigration hearing. the adults will be given ankle monitors, though the dhs official says the process of keeping track of border-crossers via ankle monitors is not effective.
todd said, competency has been her strength but i do believe what benghazi and libya present was this was an example of her being miscalculating, the policy was wrong. i've always believed she's more vulnerable than on the policy than on what happened. you know, why was benghazi a dangerous situation? because of the decision to topple qaddafi. that has always been her real policy vulnerability there. i actually think the incompetent tag, i see what he's trying to do there.
the 21-page report includes russian posts on twitter, facebook, and instagram, some with photographs and slogans.
buttigieg, she said, had a health care plan that was a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. klobuchar, she said, was like a post-it note, that read, insert plan here. and sanders, she said, only fueled online attacks of people who questioned how it would work.
the christian conservative alliance of the cdu and csu has thus far been able to occupy the right of the political spectrum, preventing any party from having any lasting claim further right.
the company also stated it will not give political donations to republicans who voted against certifying the results of the election last week, joining marriot, at&t, and others in taking that stance. airbnb's political action committee donated $866,519 to candidates and political parties in the 2020 election cycle, according to open secrets. joe biden was the biggest recipient of airbnb donations.
the political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. in a joint statement, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer praised biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. but democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of congress, and republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.
all this talk about safe zones does not go through the process of what it really means, kerry said.
the cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
specifically, the group wants the german public to embrace the 1.5 million migrants who arrived in germany in 2015, and to keep welcoming them this year as chancellor merkel's open door policy continues unabated.
kushner's meeting with the pro-amnesty senators was described in tweets from multiple reports.
as klobuchar and buttigieg bickered back and forth, debate moderator chuck todd intervened.
breitbart texas has reported extensively on the unstable political climate created by the mexican drug cartels through its cartel chronicles series. the series utilizes citizen journalists who are willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.
mainstream parties have stridently refused any sort of television debate with afd members.
it's a crisis when this administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on american streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations, he said in the carefully drafted january 11 speech.
and she said it's essential that the council address its anti-israel bias, but again, u.s. ambassadors to the united nations have said that for the last three decades, to no avail. there was no 'or else,' she said.
without modernizing government regulations to encourage new startups, we're likely to see entrepreneurship continue to decline. we'll also have less chances of making money driving an uber or renting out a room on airbnb, as the taxi and hotel industries and regulators crack down on innovation.
sanders continued, attacking bloomberg for a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income, which prompted bloomberg to call sanders a communist.
the greens are expected to occupy four ministerial posts including the environmental ministry and the justice ministry, with the party demanding at least half of the ministers be female.

after ranking the countries based on twelve key performance indicators of inclusive development including poverty, two inequality measures, and carbon intensity, norway came out at the top of the list, followed by luxembourg, switzerland, iceland, denmark, sweden, and the netherlands.
pompeo made several important arguments in the course of his half hour address, in which he set out president donald trump's policy regarding iran in the wake of his may 8 announcement that he is abandoning barack obama's 2015 nuclear deal with iran.
with the backing of congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines. and more are on the way. yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start, with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.
many of those 1.4 million not-deported migrants take jobs from u.s. employers. the imported labor reduces the marketplace pressure on employers to compete for american workers with offers of higher wages, better working conditions, and more investment in labor-saving machinery.
the data also shows that 300,000 migrants have been given a final order to go home — but have not returned home. that number includes roughly 76,000 people who skipped out on their court hearings. many of those illegals hold jobs in democrat-run sanctuary cities, much to the disadvantage of lower-skilled and younger americans.
marjorie dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, said that democrats are already trying to foist a radical pro-abortion agenda on the nation.
he added later, i am for reparations to african americans in this country and anyone who thinks that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality.
smith calls this a new journalism model where the times makes money not on getting new readers, but on selling travel to authoritarian regimes and gaining journalistic access in the bargain.
overall, the poll's margin of error was plus or minus three percent.
the riskless income investor was taken away and was given to the banks, said kaltbaum. it was gifted to the banks, and that's why the banks have done better over the last few years.
following drun's revelation that the icao had blocked her, several others also objecting to taiwan's exclusion reported having the same experience. others criticized the icao for not doing enough to save lives and instead received ill-timed mockery.
in this context, the trump doctrine is brilliant in its simplicity and straightforwardness.
president donald trump continued the decades-long policy that bans transgender individuals from military service, but legal challenges to it continue. on friday, however, federal appellate judges in washington, d.c. vacated one injunction that had blocked the policy, though it continues to be blocked by other courts. the supreme court is considering whether it will review the policy.
as far as all three administrations were concerned, the possibility of mediating a deal — the deal — between israel and the plo was the only u.s. middle east policy that mattered. everything else was secondary. the situation reached a level of absurdity where every issue was viewed as contingent on israel agreeing to make a deal with the palestinians.
we make no promise to renounce the use of force. this does not target compatriots in taiwan, but the interference of external forces and the very small number of 'taiwan independence' separatists and their activities, he added, likely alluding to the united states as an external force against beijing's interests on the matter.
compromise and finding common ground are not void from the conversations that he and i have had, as well as some of the conversations i've had with some of my democratic colleagues, meadows said. [emphasis added] though the freedom caucus has previously opposed extending protections from deportation for the children of undocumented immigrants, meadows suggested he would be open to a deal to preserve such concessions in exchange for wall funding. [emphasis added]
as bloomberg news has reported, bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. one of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual gdp totals barely more than $2 trillion. the metal is already being mined in brazil, but bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.
first founded in 2013 on an anti-euro platform, it found its first supporters through its claims to defend germans against free-spending southern eu nations.
also last month, the washington post published an essay comparing denying election results to denying the holocaust and using that as a pretext to silence opposing voices.
college tuition costs have skyrocketed by over 500 percent since 1985. as long as schools continue to tell young people that a degree will guarantee them a better future, they'll keep footing the bill. the government helps them load up on debt – and leaves them with little to no help after the fact.
$20 billion toward a national vaccine program
as for israel, due to the wreckage of weakened arab allies on the one hand, and empowered enemies left by trump's predecessors on the other, the trump administration cannot follow the old practice of treating israel like a problem. the now-undeniable fact is that when israel strikes iranian installations in syria and iran's proxies in gaza, it is stabilizing the region, not destabilizing the region.
he added, as nancy pelosi just said and jim clyburn said earlier today, this is more about a long-term punishment of the president than trying to remove him from office.
we cannot solve the problems before us by looking back, buttigieg said. we have to be ready to turn the page.
that's because average americans find it difficult to earn money through savings in a zero-interest environment.

french president emmanuel macron has confirmed that he had spoken to u.s. president donald j trump and that members of the g7 will hold an emergency leaders' summit via videoconference on monday to discuss coronavirus.
sanders continued to attack bloomberg for his wealth until the former new york city mayor reminded him that the vermont senator owns three houses.
what i'm hearing is that the middle east right now is entirely disappointed by john kerry, by the united states. there is no leadership. there is almost nothing being done on the american side. america has almost completely abandoned syria to russia; to what russia wants in the ceasefire agreement. … the united states has been largely absent. …
that means one in 12 blue-collar migrants get the colossal prize of u.s. residency and citizenship for themselves and all of their descendants — in exchange for surviving the u.s. government's semi-formal obstacle course of cartels and coyotes, distance and bribes, judges and lawyers, deserts, walls, and border agents.
the democrat bill increases the united nations population fund by $5 million to $37.5 million. pro-life groups contend that the program leads to coercive abortions and involuntary sterilizations.
he leads the european force that backs migration, he's the leader of those parties who back migration to europe, and on the other side there's us who want to stop illegal migration, orbán said.
sanders hit bloomberg for contributing to a corrupt political system that allowed the wealthy to escape high taxes.
with the 'social democratisation' and therefore a shift left of the cdu under the chancellor's mandate, it's more difficult for the christian democrats to cover all bases on the right, said bernhard wessels, political analyst at berlin's humboldt university.
mr kurz, along with green party leader werner kogler presented their new government programme at a joint press conference on thursday, with kurz claiming the new government would be the best of both worlds and that its priorities would be tax reform and fighting illegal immigration, kronen zeitung reports.

as klobuchar tried to make an argument for her experience as the senator of minnesota, buttigieg compared her to failed presidential candidate walter mondale, also from minnesota.
as claudia rosett has noted, north korea was on the ropes back then. its patron, the soviet union, had collapsed three years earlier, and its cash flow had dried up. china was still too poor to pick up the slack, as it had just undergone its first succession. famine was killing north koreans by the tens of thousands.
warren also did little to explicitly come to sanders defense as her vermont rival was attacked by the more moderate candidates over his prized medicare for all policy goal, an idea warren supports.

the concept has proven popular with silicon valley elites, with the hyper-wealthy facebook ceo mark zuckerberg and tesla ceo elon musk, as well as slack ceo and flickr co-founder stewart butterfield joining together to endorse ubi in the united states, with zuckerberg stating giving all citizens tax money would give everyone a cushion to try new things.
biden thanked the volunteers, emphasized the importance of the latino vote and touted his relationships with unions. he later told reporters that he didn't need to win nevada's caucuses to mount a comeback.
breitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. eastern.
the legislation also increases funding for the united nations populations fund, which provides contraception and hopes to reduce childhood deaths. trump ended american financing for the group because pro-life groups oppose its relationship with china, which discourages its citizens from having more than two children.
the parent organization will remain the boy scouts of america, and the cub scouts — its program for 7- to 10-year-olds — will keep its title, as well, ap reported. but the boy scouts — the program for 11- to 17-year-olds — will now be scouts bsa.
he didn't get a whole lot done, biden said about bloomberg. he had stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.
in the 1960s, the npd, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s the republikaner — a splinter party from the csu, the bavarian sister party of merkel's christian democratic union (cdu) — both managed to send deputies to regional parliaments.

instead, following carter's odd intervention, clinton decided to hand the stalinist hermit gulag state a new lease on life. he sent wendy sherman, his special advisor for north korea, to negotiate what became known as the agreed framework.
warren didn't have a plan for breaking through
and he did — with one significant stumble.
that prompted vermont senator bernie sanders to say he too would hold up the bill over his objections to the aid to u.s. businesses.
while the new policy will help cut down on famously long speeches like those from dallas buyers club winner matthew mcconaughey and monster's ball's halle berry, it could also deprive viewers of some of the most memorable oscars moments ever, like cuba gooding, jr.'s acceptance speech at the 1997 oscars:
unless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work, the senators said. we must sadly oppose the fast-tracking of this bill until this text is addressed, or the department of labor issues regulatory guidance that no american would earn more by not working than by working.
there were two lines of attack — sanders' uncompromising liberal positions and, specifically, his proposal to immediately have the federal government take over the entire health care system.
breitbart london reported on march 5th that manufacturing growth is now expected to outpace the rest of the economy, with international firms such as siemens and unilever announcing multi-million-pound plants and research centres, expected to create thousands of new jobs.
as we will discuss, impeachment exists for cases in which the conduct of the president rises beyond mere policy disputes to be decided otherwise and without urgency at the ballot box. instead, we are here today to consider a much more grave matter, and that is an attempt to use the powers of the presidency to cheat in an election. for precisely this reason, the president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won:
and that means greater security during times of pandemic. the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the united states will undoubtedly grow from the six known cases—in california, arizona, washington state, and illinois. but worthy of note is the case in reynosa, mexico, right next to the u.s. border. the international border next to reynosa is wide open. and so is our vulnerability to the coronavirus being carried across it.
according to the manhattan institute, one of the biggest barriers to new business creation among those under 30 is the mountain of federal, state and local regulations.
he also criticized klobuchar for voting to confirm trump's nominee for customs and border protection.
the truce will not apply to zones controlled by the islamic state and the al-qaeda-affiliated nusra front.
every year, as breitbart news reported, the birth tourism industry delivers about 33,000 u.s.-born children, commonly referred to as anchor babies, who secure birthright american citizenship despite their foreign parents having only come to the country on visitor visas. previous research has put the annual estimate for birth tourism anchor babies at 36,000.
kris w. kobach served as the secretary of state of kansas during 2011-2019. an expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the arizona sb-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ice agents who sued to stop obama's 2012 daca executive amnesty. he currently serves as general counsel for we build the wall and is a candidate for the u.s. senate. his website is www.kriskobach.com.

when it comes to setting policy in syria, secretary of state john kerry is not taken seriously and is laughed at in the larger middle east, breitbart jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter aaron klein stated in a radio interview on wednesday.
unlike a transgender athlete bill defeated in the south dakota legislature in 2019, koppelman's bill also applies to collegiate athletics, a difference that skarin said could put north dakota out of step with national governing bodies like the national collegiate athletic association, the tribune reported.
green leader kogler, meanwhile, stressed the importance for austria to combat climate change and said that the pricing of co2 will be implemented into what he called a greening of the tax system. he also proposed a nation-wide public transit ticket that would cost around three euros per day.

while its first successes were concentrated in the former communist east, which has been lagging the west in terms of jobs and opportunities, it is now gaining ground also in prosperous western states.
bannon noted that janet yellen wasn't prepared to say that even a lunatic policy like japan's negative interest rates would be beyond her authority. i've got news for you – even if it's illegal, they'll make it legal anyway, kaltbaum agreed, citing president obama's abuse of executive power as precedent.
the latter remark referred to china's policy of using sharp power, or economic intimidation, to force international corporations to accept its worldview. throughout 2018, companies such as ikea, american airlines, and marriott faced the brunt of sharp power, forced to choose between identifying taiwan as a country in their legal papers, websites, and drop-down menus or losing access to the massive chinese market. three major airlines in the united states ultimately changed their fight booking options to stop identifying taiwan as a country even as the u.s. government dismissed china's bullying as nonsense and urged them not to do so. marriott, in one notable instance, fired a social media manager for liking a twitter post by a group called friends of tibet, which opposes communism.
schiff served as the chief impeachment inquiry inquisitor in the house. now, he is one of seven managers arguing the case for convicting and removing trump in the ongoing senate trial.

proponents of the more generous benefits say that in the current situation, where many businesses have been closed by anti-pandemic efforts and workers are being urged to stay home, this objection is meritless. when people are told not to work for the sake of public health, disincentivizing work is not a serious problem.
the think tank demos calls this generational theft.
president donald trump's administration issued a formal veto threat to democrats in congress, vowing to oppose their government funding bill without border security.
john kerry, by the way, is not taken seriously in the middle east and beyond. he's laughed at. there is no policy. he hasn't presented anything serious.
minnesota sen. amy klobuchar scoffed at sanders' health care proposal. former vice president joe biden noted that sanders says he has no idea how much his proposal could cost, though experts have put it at at least $30 trillion.
sanders attacked bloomberg by reminding democrats that he supported former president george w. bush for president in 2004 and donated to republicans.
and it's very sad to see that our own people, who are immigrants themselves, are attacking these immigrants that are trying to come in, knowing themselves how difficult the situation is in a lot of these latin american countries, she continued. and, you know, they're buying it, and some people, just like some other trump supporters, are saying, well, you know, so what if he tells lies, as long as we have lower unemployment among the latino community.
friday on msnbc's andrea mitchell reports, chuck todd, the moderator of nbc's meet the press, said one of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton's vulnerabilities is the miscalculation to topple libyan dictator muammar gaddafi because it helped to create the dangerous conditions that lead to the 2012 benghazi terror attack.
john holland-kaye, heathrow's chief executive officer, said that the figures proved that britain needs to secure its status as an outward-looking global trading nation — although he stopped short of calling out the eu loyalists in parliament seeking to tie britain to an eu customs deal which could see the bloc continuing to set britain's trade policy.
graham's last-minute objections to the deal agreed to by the white house, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, and democrat leader chuck schumer sent shudders through financial markets. stocks lost about half their gains for the day as it became apparent that the deal was not as sure to pass as it had seemed.
on thursday, kerry cited previously unheard pentagon estimates essentially making public the dim chances of creating any future safe-zone or no-fly-zone in syria.
finance minister wolfgang schaeuble, known for being a straight-talker, simply described afd as a shame for germany.
ap's votecast data from the 2018 midterm elections reportedly found that  32 percent of latinos voted for republicans while other midterm election surveys also found roughly one-third of latinos supporting the gop.
that coyotes' strategy was recently aided by three california judges who directed the agencies to reopen the 1997 flores catch-and-release gateway through the border.
the current situation is that the council is collecting a blacklist of american and other companies doing business with the state of israel, and when we're on it, the american taxpayer is paying for that blacklist. it's shameful. we shouldn't be anywhere granting the kind of legitimacy that the leader of the free world brings to the table at the human rights council, she urged.
it is possible to still go there and give speeches, non-members can still do that, even co-sponsor resolutions, she noted. but to lend our money and our clout, in terms of membership, is completely inexcusable.

similarly, billionaire facebook ceo mark zuckerberg's cheap labor lobbying group fwd.us is asking republicans, democrats, and the trump administration to reach a deal whereby daca illegal aliens are allowed to permanently remain in the u.s.
biden, looking to nevada's diverse electorate to help revive his campaign after weak finishes in iowa and new hampshire, seized on president donald trump's hard-line policy and incendiary rhetoric on immigration as he courted voters.
he continued, i did, the day senator hawley announced he would be contesting those electoral votes, announced that i would not be. when senator cruz said he had a plan to put back in place a commission like the one formed in 1877, i said that wouldn't happen. i wasn't interested then or now in spending a lot of time on things that can't happen just like the impeachment of the president to remove him from office clearly is not going to happen between now and the last day he is in office.
a handful of republican and democrat lawmakers are continuing to tout a plan that gives amnesty to nearly a million illegal aliens in exchange for some amount of funding for president trump's proposed border wall along the u.s.-mexico border.
people will scream and holler and say, 'oh, you denied them being in sports,' she said. yeah, maybe we do. so maybe by making that choice to try to change your gender, you lose some opportunities. but you're not going to take all women and girls' opportunities away just because you wish to do that.
in the last congress, my colleagues pete aguilar of california, a democrat, and will hurd of texas, a republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on. it would have directed homeland security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer congress a strategy for each section of the border. it might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in san diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath. it might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day. it might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor. or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. but if homeland security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.
justin dent is the co-founder and policy and director at genfkd. justin grew up in new york city and studies agricultural resource economics and government at the university of maryland.
many leading conservative scholars argue the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to u.s. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th amendment was ratified.
then came bolsonaro. his campaign platform included a pledge to withdraw from the 2015 paris climate framework, and he has named ernesto araújo, a leading critic of climate activism, his foreign minister. araújo has been unsparing in his critique of foreign influence on his country; as he wrote in october, the tactic of the left essentially consists of the following: to sequester legitimate causes and noble concepts and to pervert them to serve their political project of total domination:
that source is a new fund, the safe and affordable drinking water fund:
we absolutely support a two-state solution, but we are thinking out-of-the-box as well, haley said following a security council meeting on the israeli-palestinian conflict.
the six gop senators included graham, north carolina's thom tillis, tennessee's lamar alexander, ohio's rob portman, alaska's lisa murkowski, and maine's susan collins.
brazil's new president, jair bolsonaro, was sworn in on january 1. he won a landslide election in october on a platform that's pro-business, pro-gun, pro-united states, and pro-israel. at the same time, his platform was also anti-crime, anti-political correctness, anti-cuba, and anti-venezuela.
with iran using the status and wealth it received from obama's nuclear deal to realize its imperialist aspirations in the middle east, while actively engaging in armed attacks against israel and saudi arabia, maintaining faith with the nuclear deal that enabled iran to bring the region to the brink of a massive war was no longer an option.
klein is not the only one mocking kerry's syria diplomacy. shadi hamid, a senior fellow at the brookings institute, was quoted stating, the only one holding out hope is john kerry.
i just simply don't think people look at the guy in the white house and say, 'can we get someone richer?' klobuchar said.
in ordinary circumstances, unemployment benefits are designed to pay workers less than they would earn by working, creating an incentive to seek and accept work. the economic rescue package under consideration by senate provides for bolstered benefits that could, in some circumstances, pay some workers more than they had earned while employed.
some of the key findings of the report include:
some people lose if they mortgaged their little farm or home to pay the smuggler and are turned around immediately (before they can get a u.s. job to repay the loan), or if they're victimized during the trip. that's a real loss. no question about it, a real cost.
the essay is part of a host of calls on the left to shun conservative voices and at a time of unprecedented purges of such voices on various social media platforms.
2.go bigger: pass the bill that 54 sens—including 46 ds—voted for last feb that combined a solution for children brought to the u.s. illegally (daca) & $25b in appropriated funding for border security over 10yrs. the bill failed only because of last-minute white house opposition. — sen. lamar alexander (@senalexander) january 9, 2019
murkowski also backs a daca amnesty for at least 3 million people brought to the united states as children or youths. in december 2017, she declared that american is not a land for americans and their children, but is a land of immigrants — it is who we are, and from our farms to our hospitals to our laboratories, immigrants are helping to move our country forward.
former longtime univision anchor maría elena salinas revealed on tuesday evening that many latinos are buying the arguments president donald trump is making about illegal immigration.
both biden and pete buttigieg have aggressively courted wealthy donors over the past year. buttigieg met with donors behind closed doors in seattle at roughly the same time sanders made the comments.
4. we're kept financially illiterate by a broken education system.
let's get the order straight. and it's not whether he apologized or not, he said. it's the policy. the policy was abhorrent. and it was a fact of violation of every right people have.
the 24th world scout jamboree will be held july 22 to august 2, 2019.
the flores settlement agreement — to which the president trump's administration has demanded an end — requires border-crossing family units to be released after 20 days, even before their immigration hearing. the result is a growing illegal alien population, as less than two percent of border-crossing family units are deported.
warren then attacked buttigieg, klobuchar, and sanders on their health care plans.
the nbc debate moderators took a break, which led to a series of questions on nevada-focused issues before the fight resumed.
coincidentally, the daca amnesty deal is supported by the billionaire donor class that delivers campaign funds every election cycle to republicans and democrats who support the country's mass illegal and legal immigration policy of importing about 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign workers every year to compete against america's working and middle class.
to that end, proponents often exaggerate the threat of climate change and other environmental challenges. aoc herself has warned of cataclysmic climate disaster unless the united states moves to 100% renewable energy sources in the next ten years.
under the decision, huawei will not be permitted to supply equipment to sensitive parts of the network core, but will provide a third of the equipment to what the bbc reports to be the periphery of britain's future 5g network. the report states the permitted equipment will include masts, clearly implying the radio backbone of the network itself which will handle consumer and business data will use huawei technology.
the numbers are clear: there is an economic case for lgbt inclusion, and it's strong, he insists.
the dni listed epidemic criminal activity as one of the key political issues for 2016.
alexander backed graham's 2013 amnesty. on january 9, he reiterated his february support for collins' double-amnesty bill:
tech giant huawei, a company critics claim is controlled by the chinese government and uses its advanced, cheap, and pervasive equipment to commit espionage on foreign powers — claims the company strongly denies — will have a so-called limited role in the rollout of next-generation 5g technology, the british government has decided.
we might pause over that word: contain. that is, the people of brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. and yet now, the sierra club, and other western greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the brazilian standard of living.
the basic insight that there is no intrinsic value to any agreement – or foreign policy initiative of any sort – that does not advance the interests of the united states or protect the american people is striking, because it has been absent from american foreign policy in relation to rogue regimes and entities for better part of the last generation.
in the comments that sanders defended on the stage – offered to anderson cooper on 60 minutes sunday – the socialist senator applauded cuba and condemned those who criticized castro for saying everything is bad.
photos captured over the last couple of weeks reveal the mass release of border-crossing family units by dhs:
he bounced onto the stage without a tie, in stark contrast to his more buttoned-up male rivals.
the white house noted that the house democrat spending bill also undermined the president's mexico city policy, an executive order that trump imposed to bar taxpayer funds from subsidizing overseas abortions. the house bill also included funding for the west bank/gaza strip as well as syria and pakistan and certain united nations funds, which the administration said were frozen or under review during the trump administration.
china has also used its belt and road initiative (bri, or one belt, one road) to offer high-interest loans to nations that maintain friendly relations with taiwan, notably in latin america. nations like the dominican republic and el salvador announced last year they no longer recognized taiwan's sovereignty after lucrative business meetings with beijing's representatives. an enraged tsai warned the world in august that china's increasingly out of control behavior was not only a threat to cross-strait peace … [but] caused high levels of global instability.
about $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by congress. biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.
in his speech on tuesday, xi called taiwanese independence a dead end and warned that, in 2019, china would no longer accept the status quo.
it was never explained because as everyone who was anyone in washington agreed, u.s. foreign policy in the middle east wasn't about securing the american people per se. it was about cutting a deal.
the most notable punch was thrown by buttigieg, who said democrats will have a problem working to unite this country at a moment when we need unification when our nominee is dividing people. asked if he meant sanders, he said yes.
biden then stepped in to warn that sanders' bill cost over $35 trillion and warned that he had no decent answer for how it would get paid for and also attacked bloomberg for calling obamacare a disgrace.
the program for the older boys and girls will largely be divided along gender-lines, with single-sex units pursuing the same types of activities, earning the same array of merit badges and potentially having the same pathway to the coveted eagle scout award, the associated press (ap) reported.
kushner was accompanied by shahira knight, the former banker who now runs trump's outreach to the hill. in august, knight declined to oppose a series of unpopular pro-migration and cheap-labor amendments added to to the draft 2019 homeland security budget by rep. kevin yoder. those giveaway measures were paired with a $5 billion budget for the wall but were blocked when yoder lost his seat in november.
she might have said that unless the council does a, b, c, the united states will remove itself, but she didn't say that. she said that venezuela should voluntarily step down, which of course is completely and utterly unrealistic. she said no human rights violator should be on the council, should be allowed to take a seat. that isn't going to happen because the general assembly and the council itself determines who are its members, and they have no intention of changing their procedures, bayefsky noted.
at the annual oscar nominee luncheon in beverly hills on monday, the academy announced that for the first time, all nominees would submit written lists of those they wish to thank that will then be displayed on screens at the dolby theatre and on viewers' screens at home.
the proposed amnesties-for-wall swap appeared wednesday as trump pressured democrats to reciprocate his compromises on the day after his successful prime-time address to the nation. on thursday, trump will visit the border to call for wall funding.
despite the complete breakdown in public order, the police report published january 1 claimed the previous night had been relaxed and peaceful. it was only a week later that word of what had really happened began to make its way into newspapers.
encounters with these different groups tend to lead to different paths through the enforcement system, both in terms of whether and how quickly encounters are resolved and what resolution is reached: encounters with mexicans tend to lead to repatriations; encounters with central americans tend to remain unresolved; and encounters with nationals from countries other than mexico or the northern triangle tend (on average) to lead to relief. encounters with single adults tend to quickly lead to repatriations, while encounters with fmuas [spouses and children] and non-contiguous uacs [unaccompanied alien children] tend to remain unresolved. encounters with aliens who do not claim a fear of return to their home countries tend to be repatriated, while those who claim fear are more likely to remain in the united states and some eventually get relief.
if it becomes law it would mean that girls or boys could not participate in sports based on their preferred gender, they would have to compete based on their actual sex.
a dhs official confirmed to breitbart news that the u.s. border patrol and the immigration and customs enforcement (ice) agency is releasing more than 2,000 family units caught at the u.s.-mexico border, citing a lack of detention space.
few politicians see political gain in railing against this state of affairs, including the socialists from the ostensible party of the little guy. the democratic party is not for the middle class and poor, said kaltbaum. they're for the middle class and poor's votes. go look at all their policies. just recently, barack obama is proposing a ten percent tax on oil companies, where everybody knows it's gonna be flushed down into the consumer. who gets hit the worst? the poor and the middle class.
commending only a few who maintained their independence and spoke truth to power inside and out of government, the rest of the trump administration officials are to be met with skepticism about the value [they] bring to any mainstream institution.
we will tighten criminal law to make deportation easier, said justice minister heiko maas.
in exchange for padlocking — but preserving — their plutonium reactor at yangbyon, the north koreans received internationally financed light water reactors and some $4.5 billion in fuel and food aid. the regime was saved, empowered and legitimized.
johnson: no, i have no idea. i'm not a lawyer. but let's face it. the administration hasn't been doing really well in court on a lot of these issues, because we still have a lot of very liberal, progressive judges that are not going to really rule based on what the law is. it's going to be based on their policy preference. so let's face it. our courts have become very politicized, and that concerns me.
in december, eleven chinese migrants were caught illegally crossing the border in a rental truck carrying furniture from tijuana to san diego. a month earlier, six chinese migrants had been caught sneaking into the country at the same port of entry using a moving truck. these cases were not isolated instances. they are part of a problem that has been growing for the past two years.
nancy pelosi is pushing the no-wall 'technology wall' alternative to trump's actual wall. the pr scam worked for biz under bush/obama – until the public picked trump to build a real wall. but it now might help provide pr cover for democrats to compromise. https://t.co/hqx024ecty — neil munro (@neilmunrodc) january 11, 2019

once we get this crisis behind us, we shouldn't have policies in place that disincentivize people from returning to the workforce,  the florida senator tweeted.
for example, look at the rio grande valley (rgv) sector, which is the section of border in texas abutting the gulf of mexico. in fy 2019, the number of chinese migrants caught at the southern border in the rgv sector increased 85%, from approximately 700 to over 1,300.
anything is possible at this point in time, he concluded. as the markets go lower, we're going to see more acts of desperation, and they're going to try to come up with things that, in our lifetimes, we would never even dream would occur. and i suspect negative interest rates will probably be a part of it.
johnson: yeah, you know, i hope he doesn't. i think that does open up a pandora's box. i think we'd be far better off, again, with a very bare bones type of budget funding essential personnel, making sure those individuals get paid, funding just essential services of these agencies that are shut down right now. you know, one thing from a conservative standpoint, we could really take a look at, you know, where is the fat in some of these agencies and simply don't fund it. and i think that would provide a fair amount of pressure on democrats to really come to the negotiating table in good faith.
i'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from mayor bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him, she said.
in his oval office address, trump specifically mentioned that illegal immigration hurts african-americans and hispanic americans.
and it had just been caught, red handed, violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, of which it was a signatory, and developing plutonium-based nuclear weapons at its yangbyon nuclear reactor.
in a statement, the aclu declared, a school's dress code cannot make generalizations about what types of clothing or appearance are appropriate for a boy or a girl to wear to school. unfortunately, we often see gender stereotypes and discrimination play a prolific role in the enforcement of school dress codes across the country.
if clinton had confronted the north koreans for their duplicity and malign behavior towards the region and towards their own subjects, he stood a decent chance of bringing an end to the regime.
many americans may not know her name, but gary kaltbaum appeared on breitbart news thursday to explain why federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen is the most important woman in our lives.
also on friday, the world health organization's director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus announced: europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from china. more cases are now being reported every day than were reported in china at the height of its epidemic.
hewitt: now, but do you believe if it got to the supreme court where there is a 5 member conservative majority, that he would win there on his right to protect the border via unilateral action?
the proposal includes an even larger amount of funds for state and local governments, schools, and colleges. biden's plan provides for $350 billion in state and local government aid and another $170 billion for k-12 schools and colleges.
the icao's rejection of taiwan mirrors that of the world health organization, which as openly rejected any information taiwan has to offer or expertise in handling the coronavirus. chinese president tsai ing-wen demanded the country's rightful place at the international body last week as china admitted, nearly a month after privately notifying the who, that it had identified a new strain of virus.
they'll be the drivers and the designers of our industries of the future, filling and creating jobs that don't even exist yet, acevedo said. and at girl scouts, we're preparing them for these opportunities.
that's a good question, bayefsky replied. first of, they didn't 'rejoin' because president bush had never joined. it was created in 2006. obama, it was one of his very first foreign policy moves to join it, to lend it credibility. he left president trump holding the bag because he ran the united states for a three-year term that began only on january 1, 2017, hoping to essentially rule from the grave. so they were faced with an issue of whether to get off it from the get-go at the trump administration, and they didn't.
if that double-amnesty bill — largely drafted by collins and graham — had passed, it would have minimized the marketplace pressures which are now raising americans' wages at more than 3 percent a year, and would also have raised profits for investors and ceos.
biden reminded voters that bloomberg did not support obama for president.
charlie nash is a reporter for breitbart tech. you can follow him on twitter @mrnashington, or like his page at facebook.
yet instead, it seems as though western greens are saddling up for a major confrontation with bolsonaro. on december 27, the sierra club magazine headlined a story, what will it take to rein in the trump of brazil? brazil's president-elect threatens the planet. in that article—which reads exactly like the lefty imperialism that ernesto araújo was railing against—the sierra club declares, bolsonaro has shown a responsiveness to economic and international pressure, which could be one way to contain him.
the ncaa supports athletes competing according to their perceived gender rather than their biological sex.
the director of national intelligence called transnational organized crime a growing threat to the security and health of u.s. citizens. the director said these groups, including mexican drug cartels and ms-13 cliques, contribute to increased social violence and the erosion of governmental authority in many countries.
though latino voters are a key part of the democratic coalition, there is a larger bloc of reliable republican latinos than many think, the associated press explained.
trump has demanded that any bill funding the government include $5.6 billion for border security.
companies with strong lgbt policies tend to innovate the most, to have loyal employees, and to experience significantly less [sic] cases of discrimination lawsuits. in addition to that, they are also positively perceived by their customers. it's a win-win.
the information received from twitter, facebook, and instagram shows that russian agents indeed sought to disrupt u.s. energy markets and influence domestic energy policy by exploiting american social media platforms, the report states.
however, klein said ceasefire efforts may be complicated by the assad regime's insistence on labeling rebel groups as terrorists.

nationwide, the u.s. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. that flood of outside labor spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.

the proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. instead, it provides for what breitbart news estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most americans. biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill president donald trump signed last year.

i would never want my daughter to play in sports and have a guy beat her out in track or out in javelin, where she has no chance, myrdal said.
given this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that western greens would be well advised to work with brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. that is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. after all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.
we need more legal immigration. … i don't want green cards just for computer engineers. if you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, i want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, i want them to have a chance to get a green card. i just don't want to be a country in the future of just computer engineers or high-tech people.
but each time, they have proved to be no more than passing fads.
house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff indicated during his opening remarks at the senate impeachment trial wednesday that lawmakers must remove president donald trump from office to avoid his reelection in november, claiming that we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won.
the briefing shows the gop leaders' contempt for trump's immigration-reform campaign promise, said rosemary jenks, policy director at numbersusa. there is no talk in this about asylum reform, tvpra, detention spaces or sanctuary cities, or any of the enforcement needs — it is about amnesty and cheap labor, and that is exactly what candidate tump campaigned against.
responding tuesday, a white house spokesman said the trump administration was disappointed with the decision, while conservative statesman and former party leader sir iain duncan smith has said the decision beggars belief.

the key line in his speech was, inarguably, as president trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing and able to negotiate a new deal [with iran]. but the deal is not the objective. our goal is to protect the american people.
today, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the u.s. under 18, exceeding the annual roughly four million american babies born every year and costing american taxpayers about $2.4 billion every year to subsidize hospital costs.
trump has his track record, and bolsonaro is starting his. mindful of the high stakes, other economic nationalists, in other countries, should be paying close attention.
one of the most indebted generations in american history is also the least equipped to manage its debt. only 24 percent of millenials qualify as financially literate, according to pwc and half expect that they wouldn't be able to handle an emergency bill of $2,000.
those things will have to wait for a second bill that biden says will be introduced in february, to also include measures, his advisers say, will combat climate change and advance racial equity.

you may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the castro was the worst guy in the world. all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro, sanders said at the time. they had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.
so why haven't brazilians gone west, as we did? part of the answer is that the territory is mostly amazonian rain forest, and as such, for most of brazil's history, it has been inhospitable to settlement, let alone development.
last month, a washington post essay encouraged the media to shun republicans who questioned the election results.
the financial times first reported that netflix yanked the episode from streaming in saudi arabia last week after the government's communications and information technology commission informed the internet streaming service that its content violated cyber-crime laws in the kingdom. the ft says the episode can still be seen on youtube in saudi arabia.

it's not a coincidence; it's a clear policy, he said. the positive trend that has continued for over six months is making a tremendous contribution to israeli employment and the economy, and i'm convinced that if we work correctly, we'll see this trend continue into the coming months.
amid heightened concern over the process, several candidates were making urgent get-out-the-vote pushes with rallies and town halls ahead of a fundraising gala for the las vegas-based clark county democratic party to feature a half-dozen white house hopefuls.
rather, the times uses name reporters like roger cohen, elaine sciolino, and john f. burns, who moonlight as tour guides. smith excoriates the times' man in tehran thomas erdbrink, who has consistently lauded current iranian president hassan rouhani. smith says, selective ignorance seems to be erdbrink's journalistic trademark.
in his inaugural address, bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. for instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words ordem e progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: the national motto is order and progress. no society can develop without respecting these:
occasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about american foreign policy, that includes the fact that america has overthrown governments all over the world, sanders continued, without explaining what his claims of american meddling in iran and chile had to do with fidel castro's childhood indoctrination schemes.
she compared the green new deal to other radical policies like president abraham lincoln signing the emancipation proclamation, and president franklin delano roosevelt launching social security in the new deal.
the budget, titled california for all, declares drinking water a fundamental right, and adds: the budget includes short-term measures to bring immediate relief to communities without safe drinking water and also proposes an ongoing sustainable funding source to address this problem into the future.
we would not allow a holocaust denier to speak on evening news programs or have free rein on social media, the essay's authors write unequivocally. old and new media alike should no longer give a platform to these dissimulations, starting with trump's.

speaking to the hkfp, icao communications director anthony philbin claimed that those individuals blocked on twitter were deemed to be purposefully and publicly misrepresenting our organization in order to draw attention to their own campaign objectives. he added that the icao is allegedly fully bound by the fact that the u.n. general assembly, the organization's largest body, has rejected the reality of taiwanese sovereignty.
the committee will continue its ongoing efforts to identify foreign interference in domestic energy policy, whether from russia or any other country so that the american people can formulate their positions based on facts rather than foreign propaganda.
the survey was conducted by smithsonian in conjunction with both stars and stripes– a publication of the defense department – and the schar school at george mason university.
yet findings by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) may hold some answers to the early end of finland's experiment — after the report showed that basic income paid by the government could actually increase inequality rather than solve it, and would require a 30 per cent income tax rise to pay for the policy.
even worse, the average median earnings for the class of 2013 was the lowest since 1980, adjusting for inflation.

not so fast, the essay declares. elite institutions unthinkingly opening their doors to this crew will facilitate exactly what we must avoid: normalizing the trump years and evading a reckoning for trumpism.
combined with other environmental restrictions on land use, amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. and, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.
it strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages, trump said of illegal immigration. among those hardest hit are african-americans and hispanic americans.
why iran or syria or their terror proxies in al qaeda, hezbollah, and other militias would stand down if israel gave jerusalem to plo chief mahmoud abbas was never explained.

former sen. harry reid, an icon in nevada's democratic politics, told reporters that people should not be counting joe biden out of the race yet, but also offered warm words for sanders' candidacy. when asked he downplayed concerns from some democrats that sanders might hurt other candidates should he become the nominee.
since 2014, fracked wells have 'accounted for most of all new wells drilled and completed,' the report states. the number of fracked wells had climbed 'to an estimated 300,000' by 2015, and were responsible for approximately 67 percent of all u.s. natural gas output.
the business aspect of the arrangement would almost certainly have to be approved by the iranian government, with the regime taking a cut of the new york times action.
in an interconnected global economy, the world's problems become america's problems, too. while the coming financial implosion of china is seen as both a financial and national-security threat by almost every u.s. government agency, kaltbaum said the even worse news is that america's fiscal situation is more troubling than china's.
the icao, like the world health organization (who) and the u.n. itself, refuses to recognize taiwan's sovereignty as part of its relationship with china. china considers taiwan a rogue province under its legitimate control despite the fact that taiwan is fully independent of beijing and the island has never in history formed part of the people's republic. beijing insists that any state seeking diplomatic relations with china, or any international body seeking its cooperation, ignore taiwan's sovereignty and reject any attempts by the taiwanese government to establish ties.
graham has touted an amnesty for daca illegal aliens for months as part of a deal on funding at least a portion of trump's proposed wall.
and part of that problem is that brazil is remarkably undeveloped. if we look at a map showing where the nation's 211 million people are located, we see that they are mostly huddled along the atlantic ocean. we might compare this situation to that of the u.s.; imagine what our prosperity would be like today if we had never pushed across north america, to texas, california—and everywhere else west of the atlantic seaboard.
president-elect joe biden says his border policies will emphasize the need for family reunification. his policy may help more illegal migrants get into the united states by pleading a need to join their spouses, parents, uncles, or aunts.
trump ended up shocking the political and media establishments by doing better among hispanic voters than mitt romney did four years before. and though the media have tried to vilify trump as a racist who hates brown people, trump's support among latinos has remained steady.
mexicans are focused on presidential and legislative elections scheduled for july 2018, in which corruption, high violence, and a tepid economy will be key issues. the mexican government has made slow progress implementing rule-of-law reforms and will continue to rely on the military to lead counternarcotics efforts. mexico's $1.1 trillion economy benefits from strong economic fundamentals, but uncertainty over trade relationships and higher-than-expected inflation could further slow economic growth. president enrique pena nieto is focusing on domestic priorities, including recovery from the september 2017 earthquakes and managing impacts from potential us policy shifts ahead of the elections. in recent years, mexican us-bound migration has been net negative but might increase if economic opportunity at home declined.
in december, bolsonaro himself made the case for more economic growth: environmental politics can't muddle with brazil's development. today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.
i care a great deal about bernie sanders. and he has gotten where he has by having people support him, said the 80-year-old reid. and so i'm not going to be critical of bernie sanders.
the essay itself admitted promoting a radical approach yet stood by it as the only way to safely proceed with live interviews with republicans who may be carrying a dangerous conspiracy theory that spreads on air.

but buttigieg responded by attacking sanders for failing to be transparent about his health but added that he was delighted that the senator was in fighting shape and pivoted back to attacking sanders for failing to explain how he would pay for his healthcare plan.
bloomberg hit sanders for being one of 99 other senators that allowed him to operate in the system.
last thursday, a forbes magazine op-ed warned companies about hiring fabulists from the trump administration.
buttigieg then flattered sanders by saying he was into bernie before it was cool in high school, but then immediately pivoted to attack his healthcare plan and raising taxes to pay for it.
as a result, much of brazil's land became off-limits to development. today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. to put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average brazilian. admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. and yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all brazilians.

this bill pays you more not to work than if you were working, graham said during a press conference wednesday. if this is not a drafting error, then this is the worst idea that i've seen in a long time.
since 2015, we have seen a 169 percent increase in family units crossing the border. there has been a 110 percent increase in males traveling with children over the last two years, waldman said. as long as activist judges continue to set national immigration policy they continue to put family units and innocent children in harm's way.

the same was the case with the palestinians. as clinton, bush and obama all saw it, the only salient question regarding the palestinians was whether or not israel was willing to cut a deal with the palestine liberation organization (plo). they considered plo sponsorship and incitement of terror a mere distraction. the plo's partnership with hamas was said to be a passing phase. plo corruption and embezzlement of billions of dollars in u.s. and international aid dollars was just an irritant.
how could it not, especially once the [joe] biden administration comes and let's even more people in? even if you don't win first prize, the second or third prizes are still pretty good, and with a democratic administration that is going to be more lax in border enforcement, we're practically inviting people to sneak across the border.
graham's comments suggest he did not understand that millions of american workers are being shut out of their workplaces by government policy, minimizing the cost created by alleged incentives not to work. what's more, workers who voluntarily quit their jobs do not receive unemployment benefits.
the house democrat majority plans to vote on a spending bill that will end the partial government spending program. the spending bill includes a provision that repeals a provision instituted by president donald trump that would require foreign non-government organizations (ngos) to assure that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.

despite the majority of millennials and college students indicating that they want to start their own business at some point, the number of actual entrepreneurs is going down. the share of new entrepreneurs between the ages of 20 and 34 declined by 12% when compared to the same demographic in 1996.
the tribune interviewed opponents to the legislation, including libby skarin, a regional campaign director with the american civil liberties union (aclu), who said the bill is an attack on transgender north dakotans.
in february debates over trump's immigration reforms, graham worked with collins to push a daca-amnesty bill which included a hidden paragraph directing enforcement agencies to largely ignore the 8 million-plus illegal migrants who hold jobs in the united states. that double-amnesty bill was narrowly blocked amid strenuous, last-minute opposition from the white house.
bayefsky said the trump administration could play that reform game until the cows come home, and then simply allow membership in the human rights council to lapse when the current term expires.
he further added that he didn't believe that the mass de-platforming of president trump was coordinated, stating: i do not believe this was coordinated. more likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.
are you kidding me? he asked as a discussion of race ensued.
he also denounced the policy of chancellor angela merkel and the attitude of the german media, which are constantly pushing for europe to welcome more and more migrants, in opposition to the will of the hungarian people.

klon kitchen of the heritage foundation said of china's previous bad-faith behaviour on leveraging their tech equipment installed in foreign nations: china has already shown it's perfectly willing and able to exploit others in this way, having siphoned data from the african union headquarters in ethiopia, over networks its state-owned companies constructed earlier this decade. recent history and common sense are united: it would be utterly foolish for britain to give china similar access.

in an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. that is likely to make it harder for low-income americans to find jobs, putting further strains on state budgets funding employment benefits.
the huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything boris johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration. it's also a betrayal of the very thing on which boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful brexit. one of the key elements in boris's vision of a bright, post-brexit future for britain outside the european union is international trade: all those incredible deals britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by eu regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by president trump with the u.s. but trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the huawei deal. if you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the remain-biased civil service — led by arch-remainer mark sedwill — is using the huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage boris's post-brexit deals in order to make the brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the eu more likely. you would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment. we have scotched the remainer snake but we have not killed it. no doubt it will come back to bite us many times hence.
this year's oscar broadcast could be a lot less boring as the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced monday that acceptance speeches can no longer contain the endless lists of thank yous that have become a staple at the awards ceremony.
as breitbart news host stephen k. bannon pointed out, the current fiscal environment punishes people for saving money, and rewards them for piling up huge amounts of debt at low interest rates – precisely the opposite of how we have traditionally been taught to handle our money. the punishment comes from not only failing to reward savers with decent interest on their accounts, but actually reducing the value of the money they have saved over time. not only is the small depositor earning virtually no interest from his savings account, but money-printing federal policies cause the dollars in that account to be worth less when he withdraws them later, like food mysteriously spoiling in a deep-freeze.
acceptance speeches were capped at 45 seconds beginning in 2010. the new move allows the academy to skip past what is traditionally the most boring part of any oscars ceremony, and nominees will be under less pressure to remember every single producer or associate they ever worked with.

biden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. the trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.

indeed, if we want a quick measure of which countries are rich and which aren't, we might view a nighttime map of the world. where we see dark, not light, there's not many people, nor much prosperity. and brazil has plenty of people; the problem is that they lack the wealth to purchase that obvious indicator of economic progress, lights at night.

(see guideline 7.3 on page 10 of the document.) stunningly, the world jamboree guideline 7.3 also has exceptions, allowances and instructions for the consumption of alcohol in confined areas at the 12-day camping event.

former tamaulipas governor eugenio hernandez flores served from 2005 to 2010 and since 2014, is wanted in the southern district of texas on several money laundering and fraud charges. the case against hernandez stems from an ongoing probe by u.s. homeland security investigations and the u.s. drug enforcement administration. … hernandez and his predecessor, tomas yarrington ruvalcaba, both hail from the same political party and both are wanted by u.s. authorities on similar charges tied to moving cartel bribes and embezzled funds into texas. as breitbart texas reported, yarrington is currently in an italian prison fighting extradition; the disgraced politician is facing additional drug trafficking charges in the u.s. related to los zetas, the gulf, and the beltran leyva cartels.

biden, 77, was more energized in the later hours of the debate. he was visibly enraged at trump's dismissive comments on u.s. casualties during the iranian retaliation for the u.s. killing of an iranian general. he sharply attacked sanders over the vermont senator's prior support for gun rights, defended his long record on the supreme court and promoted his historic support from african-americans.

house bill 1298 would prevent publicly funded institutions, like high schools and universities, from allowing any individual who was assigned the opposite sex at birth to participate on an athletic team that is designed exclusively for females or exclusively for males. additionally, the bill would outlaw any state-owned athletic facility from hosting a competition in which an athlete competes against anyone outside of the gender they were assigned at birth. but while lgbtq advocates argued the bill would have far-reaching implications for transgender people in north dakota, its lead sponsor, rep. ben koppelman, r-west fargo, said the legislation has nothing to do with transgender athletes. instead, koppelman said he is pursuing changes to the law out of a concern for fairness in sports and to prevent women from being disadvantaged by having to compete against men. while transgender athletes are not explicitly noted in koppelman's bill, critics argued that it clearly targets the transgender community. house minority leader josh boschee, d-fargo, said he couldn't think of any other reason that this bill would be introduced.

the emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. aides said biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. inflation is below the federal reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.
so to repeat, [obama] is not going to use american resources to defeat isis, o'reilly said. second thing we've learned: europe is in chaos. as you know, millions of mostly islamic refugees are pouring into western europe. nobody knows who they are, nobody knows what they're doing. in belgium where the bombers struck this week intelligence agents cannot tap telephones, they cannot look into computers, and police are restrained from raiding private homes from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. and belgium wonders why it is a terror target? the incredible laxity on immigration and the ultra-liberal policing have made europe the easiest target in the world for isis. and believe me if the far left had its way here, we'd be just like belgium.

there is a humanitarian crisis created by him. it's a crisis when the president threatens to shut down the nation's legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick. it a crisis when the president spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didn't exist, like he did in november, as a political stunt to rally the base. it's a crisis when this administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on american streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.

taiwan operates some of the world's busiest airports and, close to some of the hardest-hit provinces in southern china, is geographically critical to monitoring travelers and containing the virus. yet the icao, which claims to be playing a supporting role in u.n. coronavirus response, rejects any attempts by taipei to join the global conversation on how to contain the outbreak.

it is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. that is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. we might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.

kaltbaum saw little hope of a popular revolt against these exploitative policies until the masses have been properly educated in economics – an education they will never receive from a mass media with the democrat party's political interests at heart, and a natural tendency to revere big, splashy, centrally-planned solutions to the nation's problems.

drun had originally questioned both the icao and the who, writing, want to drive the point home that two orgs, @who & @icao, refuse to share knowledge w/ taiwan authorities. this means civil aviation authorities for one of busiest regional airports do not receive up-to-date info on any potential icao-who efforts. this is how a virus spreads.

citizenship is the first prize in the migration obstacle course, said mark krikorian, director of the center for immigration studies. but, he added, everybody who gets in wins something. he continued:
but his own statements indicate that this is not the case. pompeo rightly explained that all of his demands — from iran ending and dismantling its nuclear program and ballistic missiles program, to ending its sponsorship of terror groups; from withdrawing its forces from syria, to releasing all u.s. and foreign hostages it holds — are basic demands.
on monday, sanders offered a similar defense on cnn.

the new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. and some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of greens around the world.
democracy is not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to get elected. democracy is when working people stand up, fight for justice, sanders declared.

biden is asking americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. he contends it's still the surest way to slow the covid-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on tuesday.
as breitbart news most recently reported, the billionaire koch brothers and their network of organizations have made passing an amnesty for daca illegal aliens their goal for the new year.

if what he wants with regards to migration takes place in europe, that would be bad for hungary, therefore i must fight him, he said.
on twitter, the icao repeatedly referred to support for taiwan as spam:
what is less clear, is why the british government has so willingly entered into a relationship with huawei which appears to sabotage the government's own aims on brexit — namely signing trade deals with close allies after leaving the european union. australia and new zealand have warned the uk against imperilling the five-eyes intelligence sharing agreement — the deepest and most successful of its kind in human history — by admitting huawei into the nation's data architecture, and the united states has explicitly said huawei involvement would imperil a post-brexit trade deal.

only the migrants who get sent home immediately don't get anything, he said:
to date, the u.s. supreme court has never explicitly ruled that the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic american citizenship, and a number of legal scholars dispute the idea.
instead of a border wall – like the triple-layered wall which effectively protects his district from migration out of mexico — peters touted the democrats' promise of a virtual wall of technology and sensors. legislators know the virtual wall does not stop migrants — but it does shield some pro-migration politicians from worried voters.
it would be an error to say the united states is abandoning its decades-old policy of backing a palestinian state as part of a final settlement, she told reporters.

i just have to do well, the former vice president said when asked what he needs out of the state. asked whether he has to win, he replied, no, i don't think i have to, but i think we have a shot at winning.
she hit familiar notes of criticizing medicare for all as she touted her midwestern appeal and legislative success in the senate. klobuchar's plea boiled down to making a case for democratic sensibility as a break from the smash-mouth nature of trump's presidency.
chancellor angela merkel, who has been under pressure since news of the assaults in cologne broke last week, said of the proposal, we must make sure the law can take effect as soon as possible. merkel supported an open border policy that led to over one million new immigrants entering the county, primarily from northern africa and the middle east.
