attacked for his thin resume, buttigieg shot back, if you're looking for the person with the most years of washington, d.c., experience under their belt, that candidate is not me. he promoted his youth compared with the lawmakers onstage talking their achievements from decades ago.
klobuchar was quick with the quips as she tried gain an edge in the primary's moderate lane. she repeatedly made a virtue of her ability to compromise and work with republicans. there was an urgency to her presentation, with good reason: she needs an upset in new hampshire.
in 2016, the report states that drug overdoses accounted for more deaths than suicide, motor vehicle crashes, and all forms of homicide. the number of drug overdoses skyrocketed during the past two years–doubling in 2016 because of the national opioid epidemic.
i just simply don't think people look at the guy in the white house and say, 'can we get someone richer?' klobuchar said.
biden, 77, was more energized in the later hours of the debate. he was visibly enraged at trump's dismissive comments on u.s. casualties during the iranian retaliation for the u.s. killing of an iranian general. he sharply attacked sanders over the vermont senator's prior support for gun rights, defended his long record on the supreme court and promoted his historic support from african-americans.
the elephant not in the room
warren didn't have a plan for breaking through
breitbart texas has reported extensively on the unstable political climate created by the mexican drug cartels through its cartel chronicles series. the series utilizes citizen journalists who are willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.
he added later, i am for reparations to african americans in this country and anyone who thinks that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality.
the birth tourism industry threatens to overburden valuable hospital resources and is rife with criminal activity, as reflected in federal prosecutions. closing this glaring immigration loophole will combat these endemic abuses and ultimately protect the united states from the national security risks created by this practice. it will also defend american taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism. [emphasis added]
she hit familiar notes of criticizing medicare for all as she touted her midwestern appeal and legislative success in the senate. klobuchar's plea boiled down to making a case for democratic sensibility as a break from the smash-mouth nature of trump's presidency.
we bring our party together, it's an issue we can all agree on and fight to end the corruption, warren said. we're the democrats. we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and republicans on that. they hate the corruption as well.
she quickly shifted to making a party unity plea and echoing her stump speech lines about big money in politics and corruption.
mexican federal law enforcement sources revealed to breitbart texas that late last week, 27-year-old hugo enrique rafael peña went missing and was discovered hours later–shot multiple times, blindfolded with tape, and hands tied. according to police file 65/2018, authorities found 11 9mm bullet casings at the scene.
minnesota sen. amy klobuchar scoffed at sanders' health care proposal. former vice president joe biden noted that sanders says he has no idea how much his proposal could cost, though experts have put it at at least $30 trillion.
after making entry into the house, the agents found 36 illegal immigrants stashed inside. the migrants came to the u.s. from guatemala, mexico, el salvador, and honduras, officials stated.
the director of national intelligence called transnational organized crime a growing threat to the security and health of u.s. citizens. the director said these groups, including mexican drug cartels and ms-13 cliques, contribute to increased social violence and the erosion of governmental authority in many countries.
today, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the u.s. under 18, exceeding the annual roughly four million american babies born every year and costing american taxpayers about $2.4 billion every year to subsidize hospital costs.
but yang was largely left out of the heated exchanges that simmered through the debate, focusing instead on stepping back and looking at the larger picture.
offered a chance early to swing at his two main rivals — sanders and buttigieg — biden opened by basically admitting he was going to lose new hampshire.
president trump is seeking to halt the flow of birth tourism, the practice of foreign visitors arriving in the united states only to secure their u.s.-born children birthright american citizenship, by issuing a new regulation for state department officials.
there are millions of people who can desire to run for office but i guess if you're worth $60 billion and you can spend several hundred millions of dollars on advertising you have a slight advantage, sanders said.
the responses were clear signals that they take bloomberg seriously.
a former military intelligence officer, buttigieg seemed comfortable discussing foreign affairs, such as the trump administration's killing of iranian general qassem soleimani. there is no evidence that that made our country safer, he said, adding later, this is not an episode of '24.'
every year, as breitbart news reported, the birth tourism industry delivers about 33,000 u.s.-born children, commonly referred to as anchor babies, who secure birthright american citizenship despite their foreign parents having only come to the country on visitor visas. previous research has put the annual estimate for birth tourism anchor babies at 36,000.
the dni listed epidemic criminal activity as one of the key political issues for 2016.
the billionaire noted that well into the debate, we have not said one word tonight about race.
many leading conservative scholars argue the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to u.s. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th amendment was ratified.
bernie won by 20 points last time, biden said softly. his criticisms of sanders and buttigieg weren't nearly as sharp as those offered by other candidates. biden's had difficulty talking about the gop investigation into his own son that triggered trump's impeachment and that has coincided with the former vice president's slide in the polls.
we cannot solve the problems before us by looking back, buttigieg said. we have to be ready to turn the page.
the majority of beneficiaries of birth tourism arrive in the u.s. from china and russia, two nations that are not visa waiver countries, meaning their nationals do not have instant temporary access to come to the u.s.
to date, the u.s. supreme court has never explicitly ruled that the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic american citizenship, and a number of legal scholars dispute the idea.
an official with the white house said the rule is not only to enhance national security, but also to protect american taxpayers from being forced to subsidize the medical costs of foreign nationals solely trying to secure american citizenship for their u.s.-born children:
presidential elections, including those in mexico and colombia, will occur at a time when support for political parties and governing institutions is at record lows and could bolster the appeal of outsider candidates, the report states.
the director prepared the worldwide threat assessment report for 2018 in preparation for testimony before the senate intelligence committee on tuesday.
warren skipped a chance to differentiate herself more from sanders, a fellow progressive whom she calls a longtime friend. given the chance to create some distance, warren said, we have a lot of things in common, we have a lot of things that we differ on.
regarding mexico specifically, the director coats wrote:
state department officials have said foreign nationals seeking b visas are increasingly stating during the application process that they are traveling to the u.s. to give birth to their children.
cartel chronicles reported on tuesday about the kidnapping and murder of a federal narcotics agent near cancun.
the former vice president was left asking the crowd to give a standing ovation to lt. col. alexander vindman, who was led out of the white house hours earlier. vindman had testified in december before democrats investigating trump's dealings with ukraine.
after his disappointing showing in iowa, biden was fighting to survive. sometimes it didn't seem like it, but biden also displayed flashes of the fire and emotion that have traditionally endeared him to democratic voters.
mexican criminal groups will continue to supply much of the heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana that cross the us-mexico border, while china-based suppliers ship fentanyls and fentanyl precursors to mexico-, canada-, and u.s. based distributors or sell directly to consumers via the internet, daniel r. coats, director of national intelligence (dni) wrote in a worldwide threat assessment report released on tuesday (attached below).
warren also did little to explicitly come to sanders defense as her vermont rival was attacked by the more moderate candidates over his prized medicare for all policy goal, an idea warren supports.
but he showed a characteristic durability. in the deeply divided field, sanders is now leading in many polls by virtue of that following.
are you kidding me? he asked as a discussion of race ensued.
massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren invested deeply in neighboring new hampshire as a key part of her 2020 run, but she struggled to find a standout moment as she begins to make her final case to the state's voters.
and he did — with one significant stumble.
insecurity and lack of economic opportunities likely will remain the principal drivers of irregular migration from the northern triangle countries of el salvador, guatemala, and honduras. homicide rates in these countries remain high, and gang-related violence is still prompting central americans to flee.
homeland security investigations is leading the investigation into the possible human trafficking charges that could be filed.
and the department of justice will take up as many of those cases as humanly possible until we get to 100 percent, sessions said as part of a speech at a law enforcement conference in arizona.
steyer's fiery play … for south carolina
donald trump is not the cause of all of our problems, yang said. and we are making a mistake when we act like he is. he is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades.
the partnerships in laredo between the united states border patrol, homeland security investigations, and the laredo police department continue to show results in disrupting criminal organizations from operating in south texas. we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to prosecute those responsible and prevent individuals from being subjected to deplorable conditions, laredo sector assistant chief patrol agent gabriel acosta said in a written statement.
transnational organized criminal groups probably will generate more revenue from illicit activity in the coming year, which the un last estimated at $1.6-$2.2 trillion for 2014, the dni continued.
breitbart texas also reports on u.s. prosecutors' efforts to extradite former mexican governors for their alleged roles in narcotics trafficking and public corruption.
worldwide threat assessment — 2018 — us director of national intelligence by bob price on scribd
billionaire activist tom steyer does not have much of a chance in new hampshire. so he used the debate to make a strong appeal to african american voters in south carolina, where his campaign has invested heavily and black voters make up two-thirds of the primary electorate.
pete buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of south bend., ind., was the candidate of the moment friday. all eyes were on him friday night to see if he could make his case.
the reports from mexico record the ultra-violent activities of the drug cartels — particularly in the civil war-torn region of tamaulipas, just south of the texas border.
the rule will codify in federal statute a requirement that b visa-holders prove they can pay the full costs associated with any medical treatment they are seeking in the u.s. as opposed to current policy, consular officers will be ordered to presume that a pregnant national seeking a b visa is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining u.s. citizenship for the child.
border patrol agents in the laredo sector discovered 36 illegal immigrants packed into a tiny stash house while assisting officers from the laredo police department on monday.
i didn't come from money, klobuchar said, insisting voters want to have someone that they can understand in the white house.
two words were spoken friday night that have rarely come up on the trail or in prior debates: mike bloomberg.
he bounced onto the stage without a tie, in stark contrast to his more buttoned-up male rivals.
i don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the united states, warren said.
the integrity of american citizenship must be protected, a white house official said.
the attorney general said his department will refer anyone who enters the united states illegally for prosecution, breitbart news reported.
the migrants are now subject to prosecution in criminal court for illegally entering the u.s. according to a zero tolerance policy put in place by u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on monday.
a white house official told breitbart news that nationals arriving from the 39 visa waiver countries, including south korea, singapore, poland, and taiwan, are not subject to this new rule.
mexicans are focused on presidential and legislative elections scheduled for july 2018, in which corruption, high violence, and a tepid economy will be key issues. the mexican government has made slow progress implementing rule-of-law reforms and will continue to rely on the military to lead counternarcotics efforts. mexico's $1.1 trillion economy benefits from strong economic fundamentals, but uncertainty over trade relationships and higher-than-expected inflation could further slow economic growth. president enrique pena nieto is focusing on domestic priorities, including recovery from the september 2017 earthquakes and managing impacts from potential us policy shifts ahead of the elections. in recent years, mexican us-bound migration has been net negative but might increase if economic opportunity at home declined.

special agents from u.s. immigration and customs enforcement's homeland security investigations division contacted the laredo station about suspicious activity in a house located near slaughter park. the park is a known location for smuggling humans and drugs across the border. the agents went to check out the house with the help of the local police department, according to laredo border patrol officials.
the most notable punch was thrown by buttigieg, who said democrats will have a problem working to unite this country at a moment when we need unification when our nominee is dividing people. asked if he meant sanders, he said yes.
breitbart texas editor-in-chief and managing director, brandon darby, and investigative journalist ildefonso ortiz reported:
but it's not clear whether his performance will quell worries.
manchester, n.h. (ap) — three days before the critical new hampshire primary, seven democratic presidential candidates debated, with many of them fighting to survive in the race to challenge president donald trump.
there were two lines of attack — sanders' uncompromising liberal positions and, specifically, his proposal to immediately have the federal government take over the entire health care system.
for almost two years, trump has signaled that he has reviewed signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, otherwise known as the anchor baby policy. that executive order, though, has yet to come up for consideration.
in addition to drug smuggling, the director also listed the continuing human trafficking enterprises carried out around the world by transnational criminal organizations. the dni estimates that about 25 million people are victimized by human traffickers.
it didn't take long for the candidates to make clear whom they saw as the front-runner. sen. bernie sanders of vermont was piled on by competitors fighting to become the moderate alternative to the self-declared democratic socialist.
the department does not believe that visiting the united states for the primary purpose of obtaining u.s. citizenship for a child, by giving birth in the united states — an activity commonly referred to as 'birth tourism' — is a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature, for purposes of consular officers adjudicating applications for b nonimmigrant visas, the state department regulation states.
the former new york mayor and multibillionaire is skipping the early nominating states and instead spending hundreds of millions on super tuesday states with far more delegates at stake.
a new rule issued by the trump administration states that consular officers who grant b-1 and b-2 visas, temporary business and tourist visas, must deny such visas if they believe a foreign national intends to travel to the country for the primary purpose of delivering a child on u.s. soil and thus securing them birthright citizenship.
but buttigieg's trouble spot has long been race. asked about a spike in arrests of black people for marijuana possession in his city after he became mayor, buttigieg began to decry systemic racism but seemed to acknowledge he couldn't escape it in the city that he ran.
businessman andrew yang was not burdened by low expectations. he was at ease and having fun on the debate stage friday night, even though his chances to win new hampshire, let alone the democratic nomination, are minuscule.
bob price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for breitbart texas. he is a founding member of the breitbart texas team. follow him on twitter @bobpricebbtx, gab, and facebook.
director coats also addressed the massive migration of people from central american and attributed this crisis to gang-related violence, particularly in countries like el salvador, honduras, and guatemala.
former tamaulipas governor eugenio hernandez flores served from 2005 to 2010 and since 2014, is wanted in the southern district of texas on several money laundering and fraud charges. the case against hernandez stems from an ongoing probe by u.s. homeland security investigations and the u.s. drug enforcement administration. … hernandez and his predecessor, tomas yarrington ruvalcaba, both hail from the same political party and both are wanted by u.s. authorities on similar charges tied to moving cartel bribes and embezzled funds into texas. as breitbart texas reported, yarrington is currently in an italian prison fighting extradition; the disgraced politician is facing additional drug trafficking charges in the u.s. related to los zetas, the gulf, and the beltran leyva cartels.
a viewer-submitted question asked why the candidates were better than bloomberg.
