under first amendment standards, universities may put in place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on where and when demonstrations can take place on campus in order to limit disruptions to regular college activities and functions. however, forcing students to apply for a permit two weeks in advance in order to conduct all sorts of demonstrations — whether involving a group of three people or one of three hundred — is nowhere near reasonable. promising students that they'll have the right to hold a demonstration is meaningless and misleading when students are prevented from actually reacting to current and still-unfolding events in the moment. usc must revise this policy so that students are not discouraged from protesting altogether by a burdensome permit application process, and so that students can instead conduct spontaneous expressive activities on campus.
like so many other tragedies, this case illustrates the threat posed by the egregious and often recidivist criminal offenders our agency identifies, targets, and seeks to apprehend and remove, and is another example of how california's sanctuary policies lead to violence against innocent victims while protecting illegal aliens who have no authority to be in our country, quinones continued.

the things that the economy values become things that these knowledge workers do, he said. the lawyers figure out strategies for corporate takeover fights instead of strategies for corporations to employ more workers and make new things. they figure out strategies for stock buybacks. they figure out derivatives, which as you know ended up completely crashing the economy. the people behind it were not held accountable. the people who lost their homes were the ones who suffered and who lost their jobs.

in the case of syria, as we've discussed before, i think a lot of people were worried that the retaliation for the chemical weapons attack was just the first step toward a much greater involvement in the syrian conflict. those who wanted that said there was a change of policy, and they liked it. those who opposed it said there was a change in policy and they didn't like it, he said.
but the answer the massive food lobby favors is quite different: more and more money. they lobby for ever-more government spending, and they work feverishly to convince americans to kick in yet more private donations as well. lobbying and fundraising is where they spend a sizable chunk of their vast fortune. they also spend some of their lucre on food pantries and food banks, of which there are something like thirty thousand in this country. rector, though, calculates that only a third of very low food secure families avail themselves of food banks or pantries. two-thirds say they don't have access to them.

in her 1979 essay, kirkpatrick never claimed that human rights and democracy were unimportant; she simply argued that the american national interest was more important. indeed, it's worth noting that in recent decades, some authoritarian allies of the u.s.—including south korea, taiwan, argentina, brazil, and chile—have evolved into functioning democracies, and those countries are stronger as a result. so yes, it's possible for our friends to improve and for the free world to expand; it's just that the process must be handled with the utmost care.

the word solidarity in the eu has become tainted for conservatives and populists, owing to it evoking the response of brussels and berlin to the 2015 crisis. after german chancellor angela merkel flung open the doors of europe to unlimited migrants, she then demanded other countries — who had not been party to the decision to suspend asylum rules in the first place — show their 'european solidarity' and take their 'fair share' of migrants. if member states did not, the eu threatened punishment. the ultimatum caused a rift in the eu between western and eastern europe, with countries like hungary and poland flatly rejecting asylum seekers.

the video did not mention that companies are free to hire employees away from other companies by offering higher wages and benefits.
obama's skepticism is perhaps understandable. on the campaign trail in 2012, obama pledged to create 1 million manufacturing jobs in his second term. instead, the u.s. economy added only 549,000 jobs in manufacturing over the following four years. in his final year in office, manufacturing employment actually contracted. for an administration staffed by people who regarded themselves as the smartest economics minds on the scene, the failure to revive manufacturing jobs likely made it seem like an impossible task.

there are technically two votes for the speakership. the first is in conference, where members of a party select whom their candidate will be. democrats already selected pelosi as their conference's candidate with a late november vote of 203-32 with three blank ballots and one absent member. the second, and more consequential, vote is on the floor of the house of representatives. the first order of business of a new congress is for the house to elect a speaker. so, when the 115th congress disbands and the 116th congress is sworn in, before the house can do anything else, the chamber must elect a speaker.

margaret brennan: you've been sparring with the pro-israel lobby known as aipac. you said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu. today, israel's ambassador to the un says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-israel lobby in this way?

the sites reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the sacramento river, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. more than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. in addition to reducing flows in the sacramento river, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western sacramento valley. impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. the sites project authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. but this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …

in a few countries, the remittances paper over the economic damage imposed by the progressives' hunger games. for central american countries, the negative effects of emigration seem to be broadly (or more than) offset by gains from their higher remittance receipts, the iom reported in 2012. those remittances are huge: remittances sent to guatemala represented 11 percent of gdp and 46 percent of household income in 2017 … [i el salvador] remittances reached $5.47 billion in 2018, amounting to roughly 20 percent of the country's gdp, said a 2020 report by the texas public policy foundation. who gains? those remittances consist of wages taken from the hands of blue-collar american workers, including many black and latino hands. illegal migrant workers rationally take jobs at low u.s. wages, so exempting u.s. employers from the wage-raising pressure to make fair bargains with the tens of millions of americans who are disabled, parenting, drugged, isolated, or unemployed. wealthy americans also gain from the extraction of foreign labor and consumer demand, said a 2013 article titled dollars, 'free trade,' and migration: the combined forces of alienation in postwar el salvador. it argued that capitalists in the destination countries capture surplus labor and value from migrants by paying substandard wages, [as] capitalists in el salvador also profit both directly and indirectly, from remittances. joe biden's pro-migration allies are pressuring him to maximize migration into the united states, despite the public's deep opposition to cheap-labor migration. https://t.co/0p3uzj6k5n — breitbart news (@breitbartnews) december 29, 2020

the obamacare accommodation biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many catholic schools and organizations. instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. in short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the obama-biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.

under the green new deal, congress must develop a plan for the transition of the united states economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. and to accomplish that, the u.s. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the u.s. economy to suit their utopian and unrealistic world view. with hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the green new deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. and neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the us a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.

van jones was one of the early proponents of the green new deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, the green collar economy: how one solution can fix our two biggest problems. an amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of fdr's original new deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. this also happens to be exactly what ocasio-cortez promises in her version of the green new deal. wiki said, the book is a detailed proposal for a 'green new deal.' in 2009, jones resigned from the white house under a cloud for supporting the view that president bush was complicit in the september 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the green new deal failed to get traction.

the overall goal seems to have been convincing second- and third-tier indo-pacific governments that china seeks to dominate them and giving them good reasons to push back while undermining china's efforts to present itself as an irresistible hegemonic power with a superior economic and political system. one of the major strategic objectives outlined in the framework was promoting u.s. values throughout the region to maintain influence and counterbalance chinese models of government. another was investing in capabilities that promote uncensored communication between chinese people.
trump's aggressive approach with iran is remarkable considering his oft-repeated desire to avoid expensive military entanglements. his aversion to long-term military presence has led to him butting heads with his top advisers as he has sought to end the u.s. military presence in afghanistan and syria.

it really was striking for a number of reasons, wolf. one of these, while we are used to since the days of ronald reagan, a president going to the people in the first lady's box to illustrate some sort of policy point or some sort of american note, whether it's honor troops or talking about education, we've never seen … a scholarship given, which is what the president did with the young girl from philadelphia. we've seen the type of thing where a war hero like tuskegee airman gen. mcgee. that was a lovely moment. to have a 100-year-old tuskegee airman there with his grandson, who wants to be in the space force. president trump telling a little girl that she's going to get a scholarship, president trump announcing that there is a solider coming home and reuniting with his wife and children, we've never seen anything like that before.
we are proud that naral's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. we know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways. both candidates need to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to roe v. wade and safeguarding abortion access. when joe biden fell short of that commitment, supporting the discriminatory hyde amendment, we pushed him along with our partners committed to reproductive justice. we will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. he must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.

but democratic leaders are under pressure from angry illegals — many of whom believed the democrats' shutdown-or-amnesty threats — and that grassroots pressure may cause the democrats leaders to make concessions or make further mistakes, such as blocking the next budget deal which is due by january 19. the washington post reported january 4: government funding may depend on a deal with democrats on dreamers, said stan collender, a nonpartisan budget expert and forbes columnist. 3. delay helps the economy improve, not merely expand. the government has a duty to help create a labor market where americans' ability to fairly earn higher wages is balanced with pressure on investors to buy american-made, labor-saving machinery instead of just relying on government-imported cheap labor. but any daca or a bigger 'dreamer' amnesty would subsidize investors by giving them more welfare-funded immigrant-customers, so enlarging the consumer economy while damaging the nation's productivity-based economic growth. any focus on the core economic issue of productivity means that a delay is the high-minded, good-government policy favored by statesmen, in contrast to the crony-capitalist deals favored by billionaires and donation-seeking politicians. 4. delay is good for the public fisc. the proposed amnesty is far larger and more expensive than its supporters now admit. for example, the bipartisan dream act amnesty would reach 3.25 million initially, while chain-migration would add millions more. the congressional budget office estimated the 10-year cost to be $26 billion, but that estimate ignored dream act loopholes which would sharply boost the numbers and costs.
this is of particular importance because signing a trade deal with the united states quickly after brexit appears to be a key lynchpin of the post-eu strategy, as an easy passage of that agreement would be a major signal to the rest of the world that the uk is emerging ready to trade, and easy to do business with. it also holds the european union's feet to the fire, as their anticipated prevarication over signing a deal with the uk would be shown up as a sham in the light of a quick deal with the u.s.

worse, these foreign workers — most of whom are employed as contractors by little-known foreign-0wned staffing companies — usually accept lower wages than americans because they hope to be paid by winning the hugely valuable deferred bonus of green cards from the u.s. government. americans cannot get that federal bonus because they are already citizens.
but it is backfiring. they started by telling the story of alexander downer, an australian diplomat, as having remembered a bar conversation with george papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the trump campaign. but how did the fbi know they should talk to him? that's left out of their narrative. downer's signature appears on a $25 million contribution to the clinton foundation. you don't need much imagination to figure that he was close with clinton foundation operatives who relayed information to the state department, which then called the fbi to complete the loop. this wasn't intelligence. it was likely opposition research from the start.

the site's immigration writer, dara lind, described sessions as the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies, who:
the war for yemen's future is no longer between saudi and iranian loyalists, but between al-qaeda and the islamic state. the united states must push for a saudi-houthi pact immediately, so they can collaborate to fend off the jihadists. the recent bombings in ivory coast, and is's storming of areas in libya, prove that washington has yet to grasp the threat posed by is and al-qaeda, or at least adopt a consistent strategy to fight them.
speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source told breitbart london this afternoon that the eu has no real analytical ability to help it inform policy decisions, therefore when an incident like this happens, there is no one to help guide the process. instead, while brussels is happy to dictate an open borders policy, and a policy of mandatory migrant quotas – it simply will not and cannot deal with the fall out.

struggling americans are going to go to their mailboxes and find four-figure checks to help with their bills. why? because the senate stepped up. many american families who poured everything into a restaurant or a shop or a small manufacturer are going to keep making payroll and keep their businesses alive, because this senate stepped up. hundreds of thousands of workers in key sectors, who might well have been laid off through no fault of their own, will instead get to keep their job and continue their career, because this senate stepped up. and for the health care heroes who leave their own sleeping children and drive to the hospital for an all night shift, who spend hour after hour healing the sick, comforting strangers and literally battling this disease, there will be more masks in their supply closets, more funding for their hospitals, and soon more new treatments to administer to their patients, because this senate stepped up.
china's development of forward military bases in the south china sea began in december 2013 when the first dredger arrived at johnson reef. through 2015, china used dredging efforts to build up these reefs and create manmade islands, destroying the reefs in the process. since then, china has constructed clear military facilities on the islands, with several bases including hangars, barracks, underground fuel and water storage facilities, and bunkers to house offense and defensive kinetic and non-kinetic systems. these actions stand in direct contrast to the assertion that president xi made in 2015 in the rose garden when he commented that beijing had no intent to militarize the south china sea. today these forward operating bases appear complete. the only thing lacking are the deployed forces. once occupied, china will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into oceania. the pla will be able to use these bases to challenge u.s. presence in the region, and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other south china sea-claimants. in short, china is now capable of controlling the south china sea in all scenarios short of war with the united states.

the white house can use unspent funds to build a wall if president donald trump declares a national emergency and fends off various lawsuits, say lawyers cited in media reports.
by contrast, under their own theory of the case, for the house managers to carry their burden of proving that merely raising the matter was illegitimate, they would have to prove that raising the issue could have no legitimate purpose whatsoever. their theory is obviously false. and especially on this record, the house managers cannot possibly carry that burden, because no such definitive proof exists. nobody, not even house democrats' own witnesses, could testify that the bidens' conduct did not at least facially raise an appearance of a conflict of interest. and while house democrats repeatedly insist that any suggestions that vice president biden or his son did anything wrong are debunked conspiracy theories and without merit, they lack any evidence to support those bald assertions, because they have steadfastly cut off any real inquiry into the bidens' conduct. for example, they have refused to call hunter biden to testify. instead, they have been adamant that americans must simply accept the diktat that the bidens' conduct could not possibly have been part of a course of conduct in which the office of the vice president was misused to protect the financial interests of a family member.

it has also, however, deformed the face of the nation's apolitical media, which are forced to cater to the needs of a population desperately trying to make ends meet. what were once among the most carefree pages of the nation's newspapers—the lifestyle, health, fitness, and women's interest sections—now boast life hacks designed to help families struggling to find basic goods like oil and flour.

in wales, which voted to leave the eu, just 35 per cent said they felt european, the smallest proportion in the country.
the central american deportation numbers show little improvement until 2020, partly because the d.c. establishment strenuously opposed trump's campaign promise of border security — until trump threatened trade sanctions with mexico in 2019. the dhs data shows no confirmed departure for 97.2 percent of the 440,616 central american family migrants in 2019 — and just 61 percent among the sharply lower 22,056 arrivals in the first three months of fiscal 2020, during october to december 2019.

without much to go on, stars and stripes theorized abe might have been alluding to a mission last spring where a japanese helicopter carrier escorted a u.s. navy vessel to resupply one of the warships protecting japan from north korean missiles. that seems a bit less remarkable than what the prime minister alluded to, or perhaps that mission was more exciting than previously reported.

california's dams are also multipurpose facilities, providing hydroelectric power generation; water storage and supply; recreation; and flood management protection.
wired then criticized breitbart news and sean hannity for covering the story, and twitter for going on the defense, despite uncovering a whole lot of nothing. wired seems more interested in attacking conservative media than it is in investigating the claims of twitter's own employees that the company ignores user privacy in a desperate attempt to bolster advertising revenue.

in the text released of his final state of the union address, president obama cynically attacks congress for his own inaction against isis. although — whether it's flooding the country with illegals or restricting gun ownership for law-abiding americans — this lawless president is always eager to usurp the constitution through illegal executive actions, on the one issue where he does have the constitutional authority (foreign policy) he blames congress for his dereliction of duty:

what is on their agenda? well, pack the supreme court, barbour explained. add three more supreme court justices, to make washington, d.c. and puerto rico states — by a simple majority vote. they want to do that. their agenda for energy is very plainly stated. they want a carbon-free economy. you know, a carbon-free economy — not gasoline cars, not natural gas cars. they want electricity to be generated in some way, through solar and that sort of stuff. if you look where it is actually happening in the united states — the volume is nowhere near what it takes in this country for energy generation.

doug jones has made clear whose side he's on, sessions said. he has supported speaker pelosi's gambit to withhold the articles of impeachment for purely political timing reasons, not for substantive reasons. he's supported that. he's supported only the witnesses chuck schumer has called for. he's supported sen. schumer's call for only democratic witnesses. he's supported speaker pelosi's idea that she can hold back the articles for political reasons and political timing. he's also called the case presented by the house impeachment managers 'compelling.' fourthly, i would say, with regard to alabama, he's not once defended president trump from all the unfair attacks he's been subjected to throughout this process, even though president trump carried alabama by a super large margin. he's ignored the wishes and beliefs of the people of alabama.

the eu had also retained the right to bid for public contracts on largely the same terms as before — terms which had seen british shipbuilding jobs and even the manufacture of the new eu-free blue british passports farmed out to continental europe.
by all accounts, that's exactly what trump did—hyper-focusing on trying to win back the black community for republicans, something that has even democrats like van jones worried—and sessions said this success trump has had in building a broad coalition is why democrats are trying to take him out.
he lied to congress. nobody chose to impeach him. but he lied to congress and committed a felony. is he in jail? no — he's making millions of dollars as a contributor on television now, using and peddling his national security influence for dollars, after having committed a felony in lying to us. these are the people who plotted to bring the president down. these are the people who continue to plot to bring the president down.

from technology to the weather, the factors affecting the price of oil are frequent and varied. one key constant, however, is the organization of the petroleum exporting companies (opec), a cartel that uses its significant reserves of crude and concentrated political power structures to exert undue influence on the world price, affecting the u.s. economy as a result. this influence was felt most prominently and recently in our own energy industry. amid the rising oil prices of the previous decade, a small group of innovative american producers used new technology to unlock the oil held in u.s. shale formations, long considered to be too expensive and limited to produce. this new production rewrote the energy rulebook, and our oil imports were halved.

let's be clear what this is really about, cox said. this president is trying to create an illusion that he's doing something to keep people safe. he needs to do that because the truth is his policies have failed miserably. we saw that materialize itself in san bernardino when we had a terrorist attack. this president didn't use it as an opportunity to unite this country. he didn't use it as an opportunity to lay out a plan to defeat terrorism. he used it as an opportunity to impose more gun control on law-abiding americans.
he added, the failed foreign policy—when you fail in foreign policy and national security, this is what you get. you get chaos and killings and isis now spreading throughout the region.
despite the fact that numerous national-level politicians, journalists, and media personalities have identified eric ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower, silicon valley companies have refused to relax their censorship of his name. facebook previously said it would lift the ban if enough public figures named the alleged whistleblower, but it has not done so. twitter does not have an official policy banning the naming of ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower, but it has mistakenly taken down accounts for mentioning his name.
and the uk is no different. according to official figures from eurostat, october saw 5,095 migrants and their dependents claim asylum in the uk. that represents the highest figure in a single month since the statistic was first recorded in 2009, up from 2,270 a month at the start of 2015, the telegraph has reported.
there is no mother that wants to raise her children on the streets of portland today, and what we're seeing in democrat-run cities is what could happen coast-to-coast in this country if we let the democrats run every single branch of washington, d.c. and make the decisions going forward, noem outlined. they have not stood by law enforcement officers. they've not enforced the law in this country, and we're seeing that play out in the streets and the violence that is happening back and forth in the last several months. listen, kelly and david love our law enforcement. they recognize that we have laws in this country for a reason, and they should be enforced, and when they're broken, there should be consequences. that is an important discussion in georgia, but also i recognize people understand the marxism, the communism, you know, the socialism discussion and what their life looks like six months from now if their expenses go up, if they have less money in their pocket because democrats have raised taxes. we could in a year and a half, two years see $4 to $5 gasoline as a result of democrat policy.

many leading conservative scholars argue the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to u.s. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th amendment was ratified.

the statement warned the new house democrat majority of president trump's intention to veto the bills, noting that the administration cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the nation's urgent border security needs.

last october, twitter shut down links to the new york post's story about the biden family's business dealings in ukraine, in part citing its policy regarding hacked materials. given the new york post's sourcing of mac isaac's discoveries on hunter biden's laptop for its reports, twitter's censorship amounted to a framing of mac isaac as a hacker.

to be sure, obergefell addressed the question whether a state must recognize same-sex marriages. but nothing in obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether §20–18–401 of the arkansas code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go. the statute in ques- tion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. before the state supreme court, the state argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend oberge- fell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders. in an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage obergefell, the state supreme court agreed. and it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the constitution. to the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this court's prec- edents suggest just the opposite conclusion.
pompeo endorsed trump's demand for a safe zone around the syrian kurds. if we can get the space and the security arrangements right it would be a good thing for everyone in the region, he said.
meanwhile, a daca amnesty would drag increasing u.s. wages down for the country's working and middle class, delivering benefits to the business lobby while squashing the intended goals of the trump administration ahead of the 2020 presidential election. the plan is also likely to hit the black american community the hardest, as they are forced to compete for blue collar jobs against a growing illegal and legal immigrant population from central america.

abrams, who also served as deputy national security adviser to president george w. bush, added, other governments also pay attention. i've always believed that most governments, particularly in europe, base their relationship [with israel] on ours. they don't want to be quite as close to israel. so if we're distant, they're more distant. if we're close, then they get closer.

the official hailed the agreement as a massive breakthrough that would lead to more stability in the region.
the houthi shiite movement controls much of yemen – including the capital, sana'a – and has been attempting to wrest control from the legitimate government of president abdrabbuh mansur hadi, who enjoys the support of the government of saudi arabia. the shiite government of iran has lent its support to the houthis, creating a proxy war situation since the civil war began in 2015 that has led to a dire humanitarian crisis.
this regime is not going to change its behavior, he stressed. it has three times in the past 25 years made unequivocal statements it would give up its nuclear weapons program. it has violated them every time, usually before the ink was dry. that's the pattern iran is watching. they see this: there are no consequences really for north korea. even in the bush administration, the administration lifted sanctions against north korea that now we're looking at reimposing. if this is the way north korea behaves before they can hit the united states with a nuclear weapon, imagine how they're going to behave once they're able to.

so we think — what the secretary described, is that pull-factor. we think that — by allowing children to apply for asylum in those countries [via the cam program] and by making it clear that those that are not eligible for asylum will be returned to the countries, we think that we will take part of the incentive that human traffickers use to take thousands of dollars cash to take children on a long and dangerous journey, oftentimes facing physical and sexual abuse along the way north, to attempt to come into our country to take advantage of loopholes in our laws.
what twitter did went beyond censorship, della rocca stated. they decided to label what happened. they decided to say that 'this is dissemination of hacked materials. so we're not going to let you push it through. we're not going to let you spread this information.'

the only notable decreases were on the (confusing) questions of the quality of the environment — a six point drop from 52 to 46 percent; the level of immigration, a drop from 41 to 35 percent (which might mean people agree with trump that there's too much immigration, or disagree); and the country's abortion policies, where satisfaction dropped seven points, from 39 to 32 percent. again, though, we don't know if that means people think abortion policy is too restrictive or liberal.

atf interpreted the claim of ma embracing supervision as an indication he has been arrested – the ccp likes to portray its prisoners as instantly reticent and overwhelmed with guilt – but also quoted bda china consultant duncan clark theorizing ma has been told to lay low while the chinese government dismantles his financial mega-corporation, the ant group.
for example, the group's call for automatic visa-worker extensions is buried in a press release urging common-sense measures to provide economic support to jobless americans and small companies:
the basic insight that there is no intrinsic value to any agreement – or foreign policy initiative of any sort – that does not advance the interests of the united states or protect the american people is striking, because it has been absent from american foreign policy in relation to rogue regimes and entities for better part of the last generation.
on second thought, maybe the media won't applaud grassley for digging into this after all. they're currently very eager to promote the idea that the obama administration was utterly incorruptible and completely above partisan politics. it won't look good at all if the fbi was preparing to hire the creator of the slipshod, frequently ridiculous trump dossier until certain media outlets decided to attack trump by leaking his work.
in the meantime, now, secretary of state mike pompeo is on an eight-day trip to the middle east, visiting our allies in the region, seeking to bolster regional strength against another rival, iran. some of those allies—most notably, saudi arabia and egypt—are intensely controversial here at home, and so that's another reason why kirkpatrick's wisdom is still so relevant, and important.
redlining, if you remember, was the term where banks took whole neighborhoods and said, 'people in these neighborhoods are poor, they're not going to be able to pay off their mortgages, tell your salesmen don't go into those areas.' and then congress got involved — local elected officials, as well — and said, `oh that's not fair, these people should be able to get credit.' and once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn't as good as you would like.
australia's abc notes the cover also contained images of the funerals of 'martyrs' killed in the military clashes with kurdish rebels in the south-east, which some suggest is a sign of support for attacks against the kurdistan workers' party (pkk) terror group. the newspaper also uses a favorable photo of erdogan attending a pro-woman's event, holding hands with an elderly woman.

russia is unusual among demographically-challenged countries in having an official blueprint for dealing with the problem, but it is evidently a rather vague blueprint that has yet to produce much in the way of effective policy. berman suggests the kremlin knock off its extensive military spending and foreign adventurism in places like ukraine and syria, and spend more on health care and education. the kremlin is not very likely to heed that advice.
two words were spoken friday night that have rarely come up on the trail or in prior debates: mike bloomberg.
on that matter, obama and netanyahu struggled to speak with a unified voice. trump has shown significant flexibility — stunning many last month when he broke with decades of u.s. policy by saying the u.s. could live with a one-state solution, rather than a two-state solution involving palestinian statehood, if both israelis and palestinians agreed.

but instead of explaining to the times' readers why trump's promise to build a wall shook the political world to its foundation, the newspaper trotted out campaign adviser sam nunberg's boast that he invented build the wall because trump's mind tends to wander. it was only a dumb talking point, you see, not a serious campaign pledge.

no one is ever going to celebrate a price increase, wang said. but i think that with the wage increases, people won't see working in the food industry as a lowest-paying job you take if you can't find work, and start viewing it as a career. it will be good for the industry in the long run.

george washington was indispensable, but only for what he was, not for what he did, mcdonald continued. he was the symbol of the presidency, the epitome of propriety in government, the means by which americans accommodated the change from monarchy to republicanism, and the instrument by which an inconsequential people took its first steps to becoming a great nation.
della rocca added, john paul had to shut down his business. the day the story broke, the day twitter refused to allow the story to be disseminated, [mac isaac] started getting bad yelp reviews, calls to the shop, death threats, essentially people trying to destroy his business. that's essentially what happened. he had to close up the business. it's no longer active and he is now 46-years-old trying to figure out what the next thing to do is when you've been a mac specialist for more than 25 years.

congress created the national security council to assist presidents in managing the complexities of this expansion of the federal government. the 1947 law establishing the nsc, which originally consisted of the president, vice president, and the secretaries of state and defense, stated: 'the function of the council shall be to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security.' the word 'advise' is fundamentally important. while the statutory members of the nsc, in some cases, run departments that execute foreign policy, the nsc staff at the white house was intended to coordinate policy rather than run it. my job as the national security adviser is to distill and present to the president the views and options that come from the various departments and agencies. the nsc then ensures that those agencies actually execute the president's decisions. this is the 'honest broker' model of the national security adviser, best personified by brent scowcroft, who held the post during both the gerald ford and george h.w. bush administrations. during the obama administration, the nsc ballooned to well over 200 policy staffers. by comparison, a mere 12 nsc policy staffers helped president john f. kennedy deal with the cuban missile crisis in 1962. as president jimmy carter handled multiple crises in the late 1970s, the nsc staff totaled just 35 professionals. during the first term of the george w. bush administration, with two major wars in iraq and afghanistan underway, the policy staff was about 100 people.

some said the islamic state's defeat in marawi was less important than the impressive length of time they were able to hold off philippine government forces, which inspired more feuding islamist bands to rally under the isis banner. presumably, the militants were even more impressed by vans and trucks overstuffed with money and jewelry rolling out of marawi during the occupation.
if citizens struggling to cover their own health care nurture resentments against any group perceived to be getting help to which they themselves are not entitled — or worse, if they grow xenophobic and subscribe to the notion that immigrants carry diseases — they might be compelled to endorse policies even more draconian than those already in play. that would create more anxiety among noncitizen communities, which would lead to fewer people seeking medical care when they need it. from there, the epidemic would only get worse.

friday's protest was hardly the first incident of public unrest over vaccines. a smaller and less physical group of parents dared to protest in beijing over the summer, demanding justice for the victims of corruption and incompetence in the chinese pharmaceutical industry. a series of scandalous revelations rocked china over the past year, with each new outrage erupting as soon as the previous one began to subside. this reinforced the public sense of distrust in both medical companies and government regulators, an attitude most unhelpful to communist party leader xi jinping's effort to rebrand china as a high-tech powerhouse and triumph of centralized economic policy.
it began in our schools on college campuses where our students are taught the absurd notion that free speech is about privilege and power, and not open debate and rational deliberation. for our constituents, taking away means freedom of speech is silent and good ideas are stifled. … the resolution strips all mentioned the words of father, mother, son, daughter, brother, mother in law, daughter in law. i'm a proud father. i'm an extremely proud son. but we're going strike them from the rules. first we take your speech away. then we take what you can say.

johnson: well, again, i want to maintain pressure, because i actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. you know, hugh, we do have a crisis. you know, it drives me crazy how democrats are minimizing this problem. you know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? everybody recognized it. the obama administration responded to it. the cbp was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. about 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. in the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. you know, we have the flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. and once they get here, they are home free. and when i hear democrats talk about technology on the border, i mean, that's fine. we can track somebody, we can apprehend them. we process them. and then we disburse them, and they're here to stay, because if we don't detain them, it's almost impossible to remove them. that's the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally and hugh, there's nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, i think that's a low estimate, get sexually assaulted.

healthcare facilities must be immigration enforcement-free zones so that immigration status does not prevent a person from seeking care, said a statement by several hundred medical professionals. the march 2 statement continued:
hewitt: i don't think anyone does. that's the right answer. i don't think anyone does. so given that it's an open question, and i know jonathan turley thinks it's an open question, you'll get some ideologues and both sides who will say it's a closed question. it's not. nobody knows what they would do. the key case here is youngstown sheet and tube. given that that is an open question, isn't that preferred to opening the government sort of halfway? or do you think yours is the preferred solution?
however, most of the russians quoted in the article said the flynn resignation was relatively unimportant, and what concerned them was the possibility that trump would prove to be as erratic as his predecessor. the russians mostly use erratic as code for linking issues they believe should be completely unrelated, such as their conduct in syria linked with u.s. arms control negotiations.

trump's motorcade will travel amid cheers from a battery of carefully picked and vetted modi loyalists and workers from his bharatiya janata party who will stand for hours alongside the neatly manicured 22-kilometer (14-mile) stretch of road to accord the president a grand welcome on his way to the newly constructed stadium. tens of thousands of police officers will be on hand to keep security tight and a new wall has come up in front of a slum, apparently to hide it from presidential passers-by.
it is expected that the courts will make a ruling on this issue within coming months, although the court does not always follow the suggestions of outside advisers when it comes to policy and legislation, it is also not uncommon for them to do so. this makes it even more likely that the court will follow the advice of advisers such as szpunar.
this week brought a sobering reminder of the cybersecurity challenges the irs faces, as identity thieves used 460,000 stolen social security numbers to attack the internal revenue website. fortunately, they were unable to force the irs website to generate most of the pin numbers they needed to file fraudulent tax returns.

current law requires that all firearm transfers be reported to the california department of justice via a mail-in form announcing that the gun has changed hands. the firearms policy coalition reports that the form costs $19, and the new bill, senate bill 1037, categorizes the failure to file as a continuing offense. the punishment for this offense can range from a misdemeanor to a felony.

sanders aggressively denied supporting authoritarian regimes when asked to justify comments made repeatedly this week praising cuban dictator fidel castro's literacy campaigns, indoctrination plans that forced children to read communist propaganda and worship mass murderers like ernesto che guevara. sanders never mentioned in his prior supportive comments that cuba had an extremely high literacy rate before the 1959 communist revolution that did not necessitate the alleged literacy programs.

let's put this in perspective. consider the presidential election campaign fund tax check-off, which is promoted by the irs through the 1040 tax form and doesn't require a contributor to give any money beyond what he is already paying in taxes. in april of 2016—normally the highest contribution month during a presidential campaign year—it raised $9.9 million. in a typical month, it raises less than a million dollars.
the us navy has been challenging china in the south china sea by conducting freedom of navigation air and sea patrols throughout the region, including within 12 miles of china's artificial islands. this has infuriated the chinese, but us navy officials argue that to do nothing would be to allow china to prevent any foreign naval vessel from traveling through the south china sea, which is one of the biggest commercial routes in the world.

what does all this mean? magically, after years, the fbi finds more clinton emails that show clinton used text messages for government work, not to mention the continuing flow of classified information transmitted over her unsecure email system. these documents further underscore the need for a fresh, unbiased and thorough criminal investigation into clinton's blatant malfeasance – and the related doj, fbi, and state department cover-up.
similarly, people seemed insufficiently concerned when johnson's summer deadline for the eu to agree a trade agreement or else face no-deal came and went — their minds now increasingly preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic which emerged from china and the lockdowns which had followed it.

the fighter jet purchases are part of a greater proposed defense spending increase in the year's budget. the south china morning post reports that taiwan is looking to increase its defense spending from two to three percent of its gdp in 2018, a high not seen since 1999. this would mean spending up to $11.4 billion on defense. tsai's predecessor, the kuomintang party's ma jing-yeou, took a conciliatory approach to relations with beijing.
as mcconnell sets the rules for the trial, trump has given mixed messages about whether he prefers lengthy or swift proceeding, and senators are under pressure with the emerging new evidence to call more witnesses for testimony.
immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor u.s. latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as berkeley and oakland:
one way that bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. if elected, bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former president barack obama. a portion of the new refugees will be individuals fleeing the impact of climate change, an idea also favored by bloomberg's more progressive rivals, like sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) and environmentalist billionaire tom steyer.
in my day, i must have had three or four courses where we read on liberty, by john stuart mill, which taught the basics of free speech and why we need it. it was very common to read john stuart mill and other defenses of free speech in the tradition of classical liberalism – such as what the founders practiced. this is not taught today. instead, people teach about so-called white privilege and other ideas that, in an indirect way, are ultimately derived from marxism or what you might call neo-marxism, where the basic idea is that individual rights are just an illusion, and you really have just a bunch of powerful classes. instead of an economic class nowadays they talk about it as an ethnic or a gender class. and those powerful classes dominate and they create ideas like free speech that pretend to be neutral and fair to every individual, but they really aren't. they're just disguising the power of the class. that ideology comes from marx, but it's been spread out and used in this new frame with ethnicity and gender. so, this is the ideology that dominates the ethos of the studies programs.
on november 7, 2012, mills forwards a classified email chain with the subject global health doc to clinton's personal email. the initial email, which included a draft of this document was labeled and highlighted confidential fyi – not for larger dissemination to any others.
in addition to admitting that he confirmed some of the medley analysts non-public information, lacker also said that he did not initially tell the fed's investigators that the analyst was in possession of that information during the call. instead, he only disclosed this fact in 2015 when he was interviewed as part of the investigation by federal prosecutors, the cftc and the federal bureau of investigations.
it appears that eliason has decided to take a different approach to politics when compared to some of her colleagues in academia, such as ole miss professor james thomas, who in october 2018 said that simply harassing republicans in restaurants isn't enough, and that leftists should put their whole damn fingers in senators' meals, because they don't deserve civility.

bell's attorney, sean pena, said in a statement that the allegations against his client are demonstrably false.
if one of your family members is getting $87,000 a month from the most corrupt gas company in the ukraine, and it's your job to deal with corruption in the ukraine, you're not looking very hard. somebody needs to look, not to help trump, but to help us all, because that is not good foreign policy. it is not good government, graham said.
rogin also cites unnamed state department bureaucrats who don't feel that they are able to affect policy through the normal channels due to what they see as lack of communication coming from trump's and tillerson's people.
when fox news anchor martha maccallum challenged trump's familiar and false assurance about preexisting protections, trump obliquely acknowledged he has not delivered on his promise — and apparently won't before the election.

the figure would be double that of last year, when around 500,000 people crossed from the war-torn nation into europe, making up one of the largest constituencies of the migrant crisis.
the gang of six amnesty in the senate would offer residency or citizenship to roughly 8 million illegals, plus chain-migration relatives, according to the white house. the illegals would likely have won that prize if rubio's gang of eight amnesty had not been rejected by voters in 2014.
we bring our party together, it's an issue we can all agree on and fight to end the corruption, warren said. we're the democrats. we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and republicans on that. they hate the corruption as well.
when people in the crowd called for help, officers found they could not work their way through to reach them because of groups of men blocking their way. when officers ordered members of the mob to disperse, they were ignored.
the bill, sponsored by california democrat representative judy chu, has been endorsed by the american civil liberties union, who characterized it as a response to trump's racism. three years after the first muslim ban, president trump expanded his discriminatory muslim ban, targeting more black and brown immigrants and their families, employers, and educational institutions, they said, continuing:
no, i wouldn't concede that at all, price said. the fact of the matter is they are going to be able to a coverage policy that they want for themselves and for their family.
biden's campaign, however, uses this section of the agenda to condemn trump's tax cuts, which actually helped middle class americans and to vow to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.
there's so much that's not being communicated inside the building and it's a huge problem that effects everybody, one career state department official said, according to rogin. posts are calling us and asking us, 'what are we supposed to say?' we don't know what to tell them.
on top of the new migrant crisis, europe is also grappling with the threat of the china-origin coronavirus. hungary has changed its already robust asylum rules in light of the spreading virus, with the country's national security advisor gyorgy bakondi announcing on sunday that because of the related risks of uncontrolled movements of people and infection, hungary has indefinitely suspended access to border transit areas for asylum seekers.

authorities arrested him on may 12, 2014, and have kept him behind bars since. they denied him access to a lawyer while in solitary confinement. the specialized criminal court (scc), saudi arabia's counter-terrorism court, convicted brinji on these charges: insulting the rulers of the country, inciting public opinion, accusing security officers of killing protestors in awamiyya, ridiculing islamic religious figures, and violating article 6 of the anti-cyber crime law.
those wages gains, though, risk being depleted this year. also running the risk of being depleted is history-making wage growth for american workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black americans.
conservative jewish activist laura loomer says she didn't know until recently that outside groups and individuals had privately lobbied twitter executives to remove her from the site in late november. in an email to ms. loomer, twitter said she had violated its hateful conduct policy for a tweet calling ilhan omar, the muslim congresswoman from minnesota, anti-jewish and supportive of shariah law. in an interview, ms. loomer says she was referring to a 2012 tweet from ms. omar in which the congresswoman wrote, may allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of israel. among the groups that had complained to twitter was the council on american-islamic relations, an advocacy organization. the council doesn't often step in to advocate against other users, says executive director zahra billoo, but did so in the case of ms. loomer based on her previous comments about muslims. in 2017, ms. loomer tweeted after a terror attack in new york city, leave it to muslims to ruin everything. people can't even enjoy #halloween without those savages f**king everything up for everyone. other organizations, including the civil-rights organization muslim advocates, voiced similar complaints.

given trump's enormous twitter following, the top reply to his tweets often receives a great deal of attention. as twitter favors verified users on the platform, while often shadowbanning conservative accounts, liberal and left-leaning responses to the president often appear at the top of his replies.

earlier wednesday, the house voted 228-193, almost entirely along party lines to deliver the charges. the split reflected the deeply divided nation at the start of this presidential election year. it came one month after the house impeached trump alleging he abused his presidential power by pressuring ukraine to investigate democratic rival joe biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. trump was also charged with obstructing congress' ensuing probe.

when you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. our leaders don't even try. they hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. there's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. under our current system, an american who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. we tax capital at half of what we tax labor. it's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. in 2010, for example, mitt romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. he paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. for normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. no wonder romney supports the status quo. but for everyone else, it's infuriating. our leaders rarely mention any of this. they tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. please. it's based on laws that congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. it worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. unfairness is profoundly divisive. when you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. they hate each other. that happens in countries too. it's happening in ours, probably by design. divided countries are easier to rule.
six weeks later, on february 8, the regulators imposed the type of net neutrality facebook aggressively lobbied for and won in the u.s. to prevent telecommunications companies from charge discriminatory pricing for different web services. the move essentially killed free basics' business model, which was all about creating a monopoly.

this growing use of this green card workforce is ignored and misunderstood by the largely powerless white-collar reporters in the corporate media. many media companies — such as the washington post — are owned by firms or investors who want to grow the green card workforce. other white-collar reporters choose to view the visa workers via the lens of progressive immigration politics, even though the h-1b workers are foreign contract workers who replace white-collar americans and who do not become immigrants until they receive a green card.

there was a steady decrease in white voters in the seven congressional districts that are in and around orange county between 1980 and 2017, according to census data. in 1980, whites made up 75 percent of the population in the district where mr. cisneros won. by 2017, that number dropped to 30 percent. [emphasis added] the county's immigrant population grew five times as fast as the general population between 1980 and 2000, and while the pace of immigration has slowed, the latino and asian populations continues to increase, driven by the children of immigrant families born in the united states. [emphasis added] … you went from a solid republican county to one in which republicans were just barely the majority, and it fell pretty quickly in the past two years, said ms. godwin. you have had continued demographic changes. this is a county that went from majority-white to having a majority that are latino and asian-american. so that has gone hand-in-hand — particularly with the rising asian-american population — to voting more democratic.

the birth tourism industry threatens to overburden valuable hospital resources and is rife with criminal activity, as reflected in federal prosecutions. closing this glaring immigration loophole will combat these endemic abuses and ultimately protect the united states from the national security risks created by this practice. it will also defend american taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism.

democrats are blocking wall spending, but they have other policy goals in trade, infrastructure, healthcare, and the environment, vaughan said. for example, democrats want to add more worker protection to the nafta 2 treaty, and they want more construction projects in big cities, she said. trump should offer concessions in those areas, and so force democrats to deal or reveal the political cost of their obstructionism, she said.

google and other search engines shouldn't be forced to apply the european union's right to be forgotten beyond the bloc's borders, an adviser to the eu's top court argued thursday. the recommendation—if followed by the eu's luxembourg-based court of justice—would be a major victory for google, a unit of alphabet inc., which has for three years been fighting an order from france's privacy regulator to apply the eu principle globally. maciej szpunar, an advocate general for the court, argued in thursday's nonbinding opinion that if the eu ordered removal of content from websites accessed outside the eu, there was a danger that other jurisdictions would use their laws to block information from being accessible within the eu. there is a real risk of reducing freedom of expression to the lowest common denominator across europe and the world, mr. szpunar wrote.

in recent years, china-us relations have run into unprecedented difficulties. fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of us policymakers about china. some see china as the so-called biggest threat and their china policy based on this misperception is simply wrong. what has happened proves that the us attempt to suppress china and start a new cold war has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail. china-us relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening. we hope that the next us administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with china, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation.

the washington-imposed economic policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. it also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.

in her piece, kirkpatrick focused on the foreign-policy failings of president jimmy carter, who had so badly mishandled the cold war against the soviets. the immediate issue, back then, was that the carter administration was more critical of non-democratic allies than of actively anti-democratic enemies. hence the double standard in kirkpatrick's title; our non-democratic allies were scorned, while our anti-democratic enemies were sometimes even praised. indeed, the carterites seemed determined actually to depose pro-american autocratic regimes, thus paving the way for pro-soviet totalitarian regimes.

the american people have known for more than 30 years – the american people are right about this – that our immigration system is broken. it's intentionally designed to be blind to merit. it doesn't favor education or skills. it just favors anybody who has a relative in america — and not necessarily a close relative. that defies common sense. employers don't roll dice when deciding who to hire. our incredible military doesn't draw straws when deciding whom to accept. but for some reason, when we're admitting new americans — the future of this country — our government uses a randomized lottery system and chain migration.

he added, and increasingly, we are hearing from republicans, democrats, journalists, citizens, on the basis of real hard information why it may be that a consensus is developing that donald trump is unfit to be president of the united states, because of his actions in obstructing justice because of what we just saw in syria, because of his ignorance on foreign policy, because of his putting his self-interest and that of his family ahead of the national interest, but above all the lying.

moreover, house democrats' accusations rest on the false and dangerous premise that vice president biden somehow immunized his conduct (and his son's) from any scrutiny by declaring his run for the presidency. there is no such rule of law. it certainly was not a rule applied when president trump was a candidate. his political opponents called for investigations against him and his children almost daily. nothing in the law requires the government to turn a blind eye to potential wrongdoing based on a person's status as a candidate for president of the united states. if anything, the possibility that vice president biden may ascend to the highest office in the country provides a compelling reason for ensuring that, when he forced ukraine to fire its prosecutor general, his family was not corruptly benefitting from his actions.

to save themselves universities must overcome their obsession with identity politics. there are too many classes focused on narrow topics: too few on transcendent works of genius. students complain, i don't see myself in the curriculum. you are not supposed to. the purpose of education is to take you outside yourself into a larger world. conservative scholars can't do much to turn things around. they have all but disappeared from campus. so it's up to liberal academics to restore sanity. will they do it? i'm not so sure. anyone who challenges the identitarians will face a lot of hostility and be told the check their privilege. who wants that? but there is one hopeful development. the university of chicago has indicated that it will not be going the way of safe-space, trigger warnings and censorship. some have suggested that universities need to be clear about their primary mission: they can pursue truth, at the expense of identity validation and emotional comfort–or they can choose comfort, and admit that they sometimes do so at the expense of truth. either is fine, but at least students will have a choice.

in response, milo stated, our ads promoted my smash #1 bestseller dangerous just by stating my name, its title, and a quote from the press. we didn't have anything to say about issues or policy unless you consider my face to be a political statement. so i have a simple question for the d.c. metro. what advertisement could we have posted that *did not* break those policies?

i do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realdonaldtrump from twitter, or how we got here. after a clear warning we'd take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off twitter. was this correct? i believe this was the right decision for twitter. we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.

halting construction of the border wall system, stopping deportations for 100 days, expanding daca, ending mpp [migrant protection protocols] , providing free health care, providing amnesty to millions of individuals here illegally, and the list goes on and on. this isn't an immigration strategy; it is an open-borders strategy. if your strategy consists of releasing you into the interior of the united states once you've illegally entered and have been apprehended, protecting you from local deportation, and providing substantial rewards such as free health care, you have just created a complete system of incentives. who wouldn't try to enter with release, protect, and reward being the new open border strategy?

for instance, fire believes students should have access to the active assistance of counsel in most disciplinary cases, as opposed to only those with a potential penalty of greater than 30 days' suspension or those involving expressive conduct. the bill draft also addresses a few items about which fire does not take a position, and which fire would therefore not address through its own efforts. but there is little doubt that passage of this model legislation would represent a real improvement in free speech protections in states that do not already include such protections in state law.

for players not already in the drug-testing program, it means that the once-per-year substance-abuse test can happen at any point between now and early august. which means that, if/when a player not in the drug-testing program passes the annual substance-abuse test, he can use recreational drugs like marijuana without consequence until next year. as long as, of course, he isn't arrested for marijuana possession in a state where it's illegal or a bag of weed doesn't fall out of his coat pocket while visiting the league office. given the amount of time necessary for marijuana metabolites to exit the system (it can take as long as 30 days) it may be too late to stop smoking yesterday. for those who stopped in time to produce a clean sample, they'll be hoping to get their number pulled sooner than later, so that they can resume doing what is now legal in nine states for recreational purposes and 29 states for medicinal purposes.

so to repeat, [obama] is not going to use american resources to defeat isis, o'reilly said. second thing we've learned: europe is in chaos. as you know, millions of mostly islamic refugees are pouring into western europe. nobody knows who they are, nobody knows what they're doing. in belgium where the bombers struck this week intelligence agents cannot tap telephones, they cannot look into computers, and police are restrained from raiding private homes from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. and belgium wonders why it is a terror target? the incredible laxity on immigration and the ultra-liberal policing have made europe the easiest target in the world for isis. and believe me if the far left had its way here, we'd be just like belgium.

they'll change the filibuster rule which as you know is very difficult and we'll never be able to get that back and that means they are creating a single-party system. this is what was tried in cuba and venezuela and north korea and iran and all the places we know it's failed. they want total control. aoc said that 'we want to win these two seats so we don't have to negotiate.' then, defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, amnesty, higher taxes, socialization of our healthcare, and the green new deal. all of this becomes our reality if in fact we don't hold these two seats.

one of the effects of emigration is erosion of human capital, which can have a negative impact on the economic and social development of the countries of origin, said a 2005 report by the united nations. a 2020 report by a reporter for the guardian for the texas public policy foundation spotlighted one example:
with the president's reelection reckoning just ten months away, barring some unforeseen turn of events, trump will have an easy time asking americans the classic reelection question: are you better off today than you were four years ago? and if former vice president joe biden is the 2020 democrat nominee, that question will help to clarify an even starker choice. after all, it is the failed obama-biden administration trump has improved upon.

the fundamental problem is that biden and his progressives see large-scale, wage-cutting migration as a core value… the highest values of our nation — and they view migration as far more important than economic development in central america, africa, latin america — or in central los angeles, central detroit, or anywhere else in americans' home country.

the times' willingness to disseminate pro-hezbollah propaganda may have represented a new low in its advocacy for terror groups. but arguably, the times' decision to champion the most powerful non-state actor in the world — with one of the world's largest missile arsenals, all pointing at israel — is not the worst aspect of its coverage.

it is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. that is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. we might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.

5. democrats are hypocrites. many democrats — including senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-ny) — have voted for a barrier at the border in the past. border walls, and fences, are not immoral, as speaker nancy pelosi keeps saying. nor are they racist. they work — which is why the european union builds them, why our ally israel builds them, and why even developing countries in africa build them. the main reason democrats oppose a barrier at the border is because they don't want president trump to have a political win. stop making this personal.

trump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the american worker. the president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. it also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.

first, pelosi does not lead the legislative branch. she leads only one chamber of that branch — and the house is generally considered the lower chamber relative to the senate. moreover, she only leads at the pleasure of her party, and is only one among equals. the constitution mentions the speaker but does not give the office special powers.

biden said, i think there's a 2nd amendment. i think the 2nd amendment is being very badly interpreted. it's not consistent with what they're — our founders intended, in my view. you saw justice john paul stevens say that we should — because it's been so prostituted, we should repeal the 2nd amendment. it was about a standing militia. it's a long story. i won't go into all the legal side of that having taught it in law school. but there's rational or irrational policy.
later that evening, however, she appeared at a reception hosted by the far-left moveon.org organization, and declared — to the cheers of those present: we're gonna impeach that motherfuck**r.

this is not coincidental. the idea of 'degrowth' as a virtuous goal is a key tenet not only of hard-left environmental groups such as extinction rebellion but also of the great reset, which sees the economic destruction wrought by covid-19 not as a crisis but as an opportunity for a 'new normal.'
i and a lot of the other senators, who i've spoken to over the weekend, are worried that we're not doing enough to get cash in the hands of affected workers and families quickly so we're going to be focused this week on how to do just that, the arkansas republican continued. we worry that the bill setting up a new and complicated system relying on businesses giving paid sick leave and then getting a refundable tax credit won't move quickly enough and could put pressure on those businesses to lay workers off.
the surprise fall, the first since last october, was largely due to falling gas prices at the pump as lower wholesale crude prices were passed on to drivers. despite the fall, living standards in britain are still falling as price increases outpace wage rises.

in fact, very few of the roughly 3.25 million illegals — perhaps as little as 1.7 percent — hold four-year college degrees. data provided by the migration policy institute shows that roughly 90 percent work in unskilled jobs and would rely on welfare and aid for most of their lives.
no democrat wants to go to a signing ceremony in the white house where president trump signs anything, and no republican wanted to go to a signing ceremony in the white house where president obama signed anything, brill said, returning to his main thesis.
kirkpatrick's point was that the u.s. had to be smart about its friends and its enemies. that is, we had to realize that an imperfect friend was a lot better than an implacable enemy. in a word, it's important to realistic, to deal with the world as it is. and it's also important to deal with the fact that not everyone in the world is going to live up to our standards of purity—and yet if they're friendly to us, well, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. as franklin d. roosevelt's secretary of state, cordell hull, reportedly once quipped about one pro-america dictator, he may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
after all, this is the same president john roberts who singlehandedly rewrote the unconstitutional obamacare mandate into a tax — something the lawmakers who wrote the obamacare law specifically said it was not — just so he could protect barack obama's signature policy.
the purge of christians has been shockingly effective, one of the most brutal and devastating ethnic cleansing campaigns in history, although not generally reported as such by western media. chaldean patriarch louis raphael sacco notes in the foreign desk piece that christians have been eliminated from the captive city of mosul for the first time in iraq's history.

on the national emergency, let me say, the president said in front of all you, just the other day, that it's something that he's considering looking into. he's made no decision on that. i will say that one of the [alternative] ways that congress can find the resources for this is through an emergency [funding] supplement. and we did indicate to them, over the course of this weekend, that we would be willing to work with them on forming an emergency supplemental for some of the resources — the additional resources we're asking for.

in fact, the economy has continued to grow post-referendum, with factory output especially strong as the fall in sterling lets the air out of what princeton university academic ashoka mody described as a finance-property bubble and redirects economic activity towards manufacturing and exports.

the economy would be in an official financial depression if not for the world's central banks conspiring to push rates down—effectively stealing from savers. this policy is no different than cutting off your leg to feed yourself when on the brink of starvation—you may no longer be hungry, but you'll still bleed out. when the fed drops rates to benefit people purchasing and refinancing homes, for example, savers have to resort to eating into their principal. this one action is likely going to be the cause of the next mounting financial crisis: pension and insurance failures.

7. let the engineers design a barrier that works. the wall should not be a democratic or republican issue. nor should it be a budget issue: democrats are fighting over a mere $5 billion, when their own budget bill spends tens of billions more in excess of white house requests on other items, including foreign aid. the wall — or fence — is little more than an engineering problem. we should let experts make their recommendations about what kind of physical barriers to build at each point along the border. let the engineers do their job — and let's put america first.

this is something i worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come. it is one of those elusive generational reforms. it is why we do this.
both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. certain economic systems allow families to thrive. thriving families make market economies possible. you can't separate the two. it used to be possible to deny this. not anymore. the evidence is now overwhelming. consider the inner cities. thirty years ago, conservatives looked at detroit or newark and were horrified by what they saw. conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. the majority of children were born out of wedlock. single mothers were the rule. crime and drugs and disorder became universal. what caused this nightmare? liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. they were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.

xi clearly appreciates how unhelpful this is because vaccine activists are beginning to disappear, stuffed into unmarked cars by the same type of plainclothes goon squad that makes uppity campus marxists vanish. protesting parents have been told it would be best for their children if they muted their criticism of the government. online forums created by concerned parents have been censored. activists sardonically note that locking them up is apparently easier than cracking down on corrupt and incompetent officials.

the contradiction between migration and development is not a problem for progressives, said kirkorian. ideological libertarians and leftists look at it this way: that any way of getting here, under any circumstances, is better [for migrants] than staying where they are, he said. the development damage done to the home countries is waved away as brain gain or circulation or something like that, he added.

to date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support. and—it is my duty as speaker to say this—nearly 750 bills that the house has passed remain stuck in the united states senate. but the rest made it into law. we have taken on some of the biggest challenges of our time, and made a great and lasting difference in the trajectory of this country. we began a historic rebuilding of our military and national defense. we enacted new and tough sanctions on some of our biggest foes. we ushered in a new career and technical education system. record regulatory reform to help small businesses. a long-sought expansion of domestic energy production, to be followed by america's new energy dominance. to stem the tide of opioid addiction, the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. criminal justice reform to give more people a chance at redemption. a landmark crackdown on human trafficking that is already yielding results and saving lives. a va with real accountability, and finally, better care for veterans. and, after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years. think about it. we went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive.

the huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything boris johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration. it's also a betrayal of the very thing on which boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful brexit. one of the key elements in boris's vision of a bright, post-brexit future for britain outside the european union is international trade: all those incredible deals britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by eu regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by president trump with the u.s. but trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the huawei deal. if you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the remain-biased civil service — led by arch-remainer mark sedwill — is using the huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage boris's post-brexit deals in order to make the brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the eu more likely. you would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment. we have scotched the remainer snake but we have not killed it. no doubt it will come back to bite us many times hence.

sandweg framed his catch and release policy as a health and crime issue, saying:

if it is an hf [high-frequency or over-the-horizon] radar, then it would enormously boost china's capacity to monitor ships and aircraft in the south china sea. cuarteron is the logical place for such an installation because it is the southernmost of china's features in the spratlys, meaning that it would be the best place if you wanted early warning radar to give notice of ships or planes coming up from the strait of malacca and other areas to the south such as singapore. this would be very important in a chinese anti-access area denial strategy that sought to reduce the ability of the u.s. to operate freely in the south china sea, including bringing forces up through the south china sea in case of any future crisis in northeast asia.

it should be particularly apparent in the minds of americans today—after the passing of the great originalist supreme court justice antonin scalia—how fragile american liberty is. this country as it was founded will not survive if leaders do not commit to circumscribed governmental power. it will be even worse if the people no longer care to hold them accountable and in check.

washington came into office as a great man: the hero of the american revolution, a great warrior, general, and leader who had also made himself wealthy through hard work and shrewd business practices at his mount vernon plantation. having already willingly resigned his commission to the continental congress at the end of the revolutionary war, he ended any discussion of military dictatorship for the new country. washington was aiming for something much higher than being simply one of history's great commanders and conquerers.

looking at a real world example, one might wonder what might necessitate a company like apple to borrow money. the most profitable publically traded company in the whole world, with a pristine balance sheet and billions in cash holdings, is borrowing money and buying back stock. this is not a recommendation on the purchase of apple stock, but instead an observation about that nature of what low-interest rates do to pervert the capitalist system. historically, firms once borrowed to invest in new equipment and r&d. today, they are engaging in a buyback orgy that is significantly larger than equity purchases by institutions and retail investors.

said gaffney in discussing the unmasking controversy, citing the duration of the effort and potential involvement of others, i think that there's unquestionably a political warfare operation being run by their former boss, barack obama. and i think there's a lot of evidence that they're still lashed up with him and therefore i think it's a safe assumption that they are probably performing opposition research, if you wish to call it that, for organizing for action… and their purpose for it is pretty clear – destroying the trump presidency.

in kopits' most recent report on illegal immigration, he notes that california's farm wages for americans have increased because of slower illegal immigration throughout 2017 and increased enforcement, with the caveat, however, the more enforcement succeeds, the higher wages will go, and the greater the incentive to evade the ban. in california, for example, tougher border enforcement has raised farm wages to $16 / hour, up perhaps $5 / hour over earlier times.

immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor u.s. latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as berkeley and oakland.

democrats have been pushing republicans, who have a slim senate majority, to consider new testimony, arguing that fresh information has emerged during pelosi's monthlong delay in transmitting the charges.
this was a colossal failure of the democratic house, first and foremost, sessions said. this was nowhere close to an impeachment. i've been saying that for weeks. it's not an offense. it's nowhere close to being an impeachable offense. they should not have done this. they have abused the great impeachment article in the constitution more than it's ever been abused in its history and they deserve to be criticized for it. it's become more and more clear, i think, to the american people as time went on that this is not—the evidence did not justify removal from office. it's nowhere close to what's required. i'm glad the republicans said listen and went through a process, but they're correct to bring this to a close. it's just not there. i thought ken starr and alan dershowitz made the case in a compelling fashion.

so why are conservatives fretting about corporate america cutting off the gop, a process merely accelerated by last week's (disgraceful) mob assault on the capitol. did they think building a working-class party was going to be painless? that they could mouth pro-worker rhetoric while continuing to ignore workers' concerns on issues like immigration and wages? a country-club party with blue-collar décor?

the h-1b program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for american workers at lower pay. i remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread h-1b abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at disney in florida when americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. i will end forever the use of the h-1b as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire american workers for every visa and immigration program. no exceptions.
others in the international news media have reacted with similar skepticism regarding russia's alleged withdrawal from syria.
federal officials should quietly ignore migrants' illegal status as they try to detect, isolate, and treat all of the americans who are infected by the epidemic, he said. the government should make clear that they are not going to be checking legal status when they're trying to protect public health, and it seems perfectly reasonable to say that use of public benefits [by would-be migrants], in this case, will not be factored into public charge rules.

marek's pitch to progressives is the latest example of employers trying to globalize the american labor market so they can hire anybody they want from abroad and break the bargaining position of american workers, said krikorian. he continued:
well it was, in the truest sense of the word, a deeply emotional relationship, but also very pragmatic. i was just saying on the air a few moments ago that i thought their thespian training, their hollywood background, helped them in politics, because they were conscious of the fact the country wanted something grand in the presidency, brokaw said. he also noted that:
what is less clear, is why the british government has so willingly entered into a relationship with huawei which appears to sabotage the government's own aims on brexit — namely signing trade deals with close allies after leaving the european union. australia and new zealand have warned the uk against imperilling the five-eyes intelligence sharing agreement — the deepest and most successful of its kind in human history — by admitting huawei into the nation's data architecture, and the united states has explicitly said huawei involvement would imperil a post-brexit trade deal.

a third case involved those foreigners who wished to be admitted entirely to their fellowship and mode of worship. even here, dealing with those who wished to integrate fully into the life and worship of israel required a certain order, aquinas observed. for they were not at once admitted to citizenship: just as it was law with some nations that no one was deemed a citizen except after two or three generations.

regarding china's one-child policy that former chinese leader deng xiaoping instituted over three decades ago, eberstadt said that while lots of people were talking about the liberalization of china and the economic reforms under deng xiaoping, the heart of the society—the basic unit of society is the family—and the claim that the government has the right to decide how many babies parents have is much more totalitarian than anything that lenin even planned.

they know they cannot afford to be seen blocking border security. we have to remember that nancy pelosi is not in the speaker's chair now because voters want to abolish ice or open the border. the democrats [in november] won because there were a lot of democratic candidates who won because they said they were just as hawkish on immigration as republicans.

the impact is worst in mcallen, but it's everywhere, federal public defender for the southern district of texas marjorie meyers told the times. she called it an explosion. she said the impact is being felt in all four divisions of the district, including corpus christi, which is located more than 120 miles from the mexican border.
remainers and leaver alike were baffled. the impasse between britain and the eu had remained fairly constant: the eu wanted britain to submit to its regulations and state aid rules essentially in perpetuity, via what it called a level playing field, as well as a guarantee that britain would not escape to the jurisdiction of the european court of human rights.

the president-elect's vision is to implement a worker-centered trade policy, tai said, according to the wall street journal. what it means in practice is that u.s. trade policy must benefit regular americans, communities, and workers. and that starts with recognizing that people are not just consumers. they are also workers and wage earners.
vox is a progressive site, which generally adopts pro-migration policies that subordinate the interests of white-collar and blue-collar americans to the interests of migrants, investors and cheap-labor ceos. like many other sites, vox's articles reflect the progressive view that americans have a moral duty to help foreigners migrate to the united states, and it is eager to overlook the resulting civic and economic damage done to ordinary americans — and also to ignore the huge economic gains that cheap-labor migration delivers to investors and upper-income postgraduate progressives.

one of the most notable areas of interference by the european union is over the matter of mass migration. after eu home affairs commissioner dimitris avramopoulos warned against italy changing its border policy from the last government — which saw the nation acting as one of the main points of ingress for illegal migrants and asylum seekers to the continent — lega leader salvini hit back.
and it is the general public upon whose behalf congress is supposed to legislate, not the tens of millions who participate in shooting sports. even a marginal increase in risk to the population cannot be justified, unless the harms to the minority from current policy are very severe and there are no means to reduce them other than the proposed legislation. in fact, the harms to shooters are modest — somewhat elevated risk of non-total hearing loss, essentially — and effective alternatives to silencers are readily available.

last week, ankara broke the 2015 agreement with brussels in which it would stop the illegal flow of migrants through turkey in exchange for money and continuing eu accession talks, and opened the gates which resulted in thousands of migrants amassing on the near-east country's land border with greece. the migrants are reportedly from syria, afghanistan, and iraq.

images of american presidents being feted on the world stage stand in contrast to those of their rivals in the opposing party slogging through diners in early-voting states and clashing in debate. this trip, in particular, reflects a trump campaign strategy to showcase him in his presidential role during short, carefully managed trips that provide counter-programming to the democrats' primary contest and produce the kinds of visuals his campaign can use in future ads. his aides also believe the visit could help the president woo tens of thousands of indian-american voters before the november election.

nationwide, the u.s. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. that flood of outside labor spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.

when a married woman gives birth in arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. according to the court below, however, arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: the state need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the state. because that differential treatment infringes obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples 'the constellation of benefits that the states have linked to marriage' … we reverse the state court's judgment.
given this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that western greens would be well advised to work with brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. that is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. after all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.

taiwan did just that late last year following the election of president donald trump in the united states. president tsai called trump to congratulate him on his election victory and trump, in an unprecedented move, accepted the call, implying he understood tsai to be a fellow head of state. the chinese communist government condemned tsai and insisted in assurances from washington that the trump administration would not abandon the one china policy, which demands foreign nations also deny taiwan's sovereignty. trump reportedly agreed to the one china policy in a february phone call with president xi jinping.

this problem is more than evident in a recent report from the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) on global temperature trends. between them, the two agencies operate the most accurate, comprehensive system of temperature measuring instruments in the world. but rather than cite data from their best sources when nasa and noaa reported global temperatures on january 15, they chose to use severely compromised data from temperature readings adjusted—in a process called homogenization—they and others gathered from biased monitoring stations.

as breitbart news host stephen k. bannon pointed out, the current fiscal environment punishes people for saving money, and rewards them for piling up huge amounts of debt at low interest rates – precisely the opposite of how we have traditionally been taught to handle our money. the punishment comes from not only failing to reward savers with decent interest on their accounts, but actually reducing the value of the money they have saved over time. not only is the small depositor earning virtually no interest from his savings account, but money-printing federal policies cause the dollars in that account to be worth less when he withdraws them later, like food mysteriously spoiling in a deep-freeze.

internalizing this won't be easy for republican leaders. they'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. they'll likely lose donors in the process. libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. that's a lie. socialism is a disaster. it doesn't work. it's what we should be working desperately to avoid. but socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the american economy in a way that protects normal people.

the consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. across the ocean, the south african city of cape town, africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. as a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.

immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor u.s. latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as berkeley and oakland.

worse, it is clear that iran used its american prisoners as a bargaining chip–first to ensure that the u.s. dropped sanctions as the iran nuclear deal went through; second, to expand its ballistic missile program in violation of the u.n. resolution giving effect to that deal; and third, to humiliate the u.s., most recently in the arrest of ten sailors.

chinese intellectuals have petitioned the government to halt the evictions, calling them a violation of human rights. even some state media have criticized the campaign. according to yi fuxian, a china population expert, the government has called migrants a low-end population – basically implying that they are inferior quality human beings. china didn't just say this. they actually wrote it into government documents. this is absurd, says yi. reuters and shanghaiist (24-nov) and bbc and npr (4-dec-2017)

needless to say, the thought of digging up amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to western environmentalists. yet for their part, brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted bolsonaro into office. as this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.

i think the democrats are terrified. i think it goes beyond just hostility to president trump, sessions said. i think they believe he's assembling a majority coalition in america that could govern this country for a decade or more. the loser will be the radical, socialist, secular left who are going to be left out in the cold. they are a minority in america. president trump has shown he knows how to appeal across party lines and draw in the extra voters that you need to win elections. so they went after him personally because they feared him, and they feared they were losing the support of the american people. it's not just that they didn't like him personally but he and his agenda—that i've believed in for a long time—his agenda assembles a working majority of americans. they support that. he will now have this impeachment behind and he'll be even more effective driving his policies, and the american people will continue to respond and the economy is growing at a very, very positive rate. i think we have a window of opportunity in the next year or two to make some changes that will be historic for america, to build on the good judges and to build on the tax reductions and regulation reductions and to defend people of faith and reduce our involvement in endless war and to protect our borders and protect american jobs and manufacturing. that can be a matter of great historic importance. i'm just really excited about it.

corporate tax cuts are also popular in washington, and romney is strongly on board with those too. his piece throws throws a rare compliment to trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. this isn't surprising. romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called bain capital. bain capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. romney became fantastically rich doing this. meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. this is the private equity model. our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. it's how they run the country.
describing the arrival of the europeans as a 'settlement' is a view of australian history from the perspective of england rather than australia, the information pack declared.
the coronavirus outbreak in china has highlighted severe and longstanding weaknesses in our medical supply chain. this is more than unfortunate; it's a danger to public health. our health officials need to know the extent of our reliance on chinese production so they can take all necessary action to protect americans. this legislation will give us the information we need to better secure our supply chain and ensure that americans have uninterrupted access to life-saving drugs and medical devices.

in our own little ways—whether as employers, consumers, or homeowners—each of us has long counted on, and effectively encouraged, the development of this extralegal immigration system, jawetz testified in 2019. at the risk of being provocative, the truth is that our arcane immigration system is so broken that it long ago abandoned the right to expect and deserve compliance and respect.
as ian acheson, himself a former home office civil servant, rightly suggests in that tweet, most british people have many, many more important things to worry about than whether or not priti patel bullied a senior civil servant so that 'he signed off with stress.'

for a while, it looked as though the know nothing, anti-immigrant party was on track to become the second major party in america, in opposition to democrats. this party, which thrived alongside the organization of various secret societies, was ultimately defeated by the republicans, who outmaneuvered and subverted them. the republican party ultimately prevailed because its leaders stood on principle, regardless of temporary popularity. the know nothings disappeared nearly as fast as they shot to power.

north korea has spent decades trying to develop operational nuclear weapons.
it's really not difficult to read between the lines here. rutnam – and his fellow civil servants – tried to frustrate patel rather than help her. patel wasn't having this and made her displeasure known. this then enabled the civil service to pretend that the issue was patel's workplace bullying rather than its own institutional sclerosis and incompetence.
we have sent notices to staff who did not return to ensure that our expectations are clear. and we are optimistic that more staff will report to work in the coming days. if staff choose not to attend and support the students who are relying on them, we will handle those on a school-by-school and case-by-case basis.

if things really are looking up, then russia is emerging from what business insider called a perfect demographic storm that was crippling the nation in 2015. up to 30 percent of russian deaths in one study were alcohol-related. russia has also battled other forms of drug abuse, and a serious hiv/aids crisis, contributing to that notoriously high mortality rate for russian men. it is likely that men embarked upon such tragically short life paths are not settling down to family life and raising children.
the hill reports pushback against koskinen's budget request from house republicans. subcommittee chair ander crenshaw (r-fl) said it was sometimes difficult to take budget requests seriously when the irs again asks for an unrealistically high amount that doesn't make customer service a priority and fails to adopt some of the good government reforms that we added.

president-elect joe biden unveiled a coronavirus plan thursday that he claims will turn the tide on the pandemic, speeding up the vaccine rollout, and providing financial help to individuals, states, and local governments and businesses struggling with the prolonged economic fallout.
the peace plan made absolutely no sense whatsoever for reasons i gave at the time — russia and syria will continue bombing what they claim are terrorist groups, which are pretty much all sunnis in syria, and the plan would not apply to the so-called islamic state (is or isis or isil or daesh) and the al-qaeda linked jabhat al-nusra (al-nusra front). and sure enough, the cessation of hostilities collapsed in less than a week. in fact, the peace plan actually worsened the hostilities, since it provided cover for substantially increased bombing and fighting from all groups.

so we have a cessation of hostilities which is almost identical to the last one, with the same effect: no one is going to cease hostilities. i have little respect for john kerry and these politicians, but i can understand how they could do this dance once. but a second time? i'm baffled. cnn and npr and foreign policy
cotton said, it's not enough, and it's certainly too late. vladimir putin is kgb. he always has been, he always will be. president obama has consistently looked the other way from russia's provocations and aggression. the dnc hack last year was just one minor item in what russia has done over the last eight years, to include things like invading and occupying crimea and supporting rebels in eastern ukraine as well as threatening nato air ships — aircraft and ships and so forth.

della rocca continued, it was not hacked materials. john paul accessed those materials when he legally owned them, because it was part of abandoned property. so they made a mistake there. the fact that they even decided to label it is a problem. it had direct harm. there's no way that you can say that something is hacked materials and not directly infer that the person who provided that information is a hacker.
mr. buffett will on occasion utilize berkshire personnel and/or have berkshire pay for minor items such as postage or phone calls that are personal. mr. buffett reimburses berkshire for these costs by making an annual payment to berkshire in an amount that is equal to or greater than the costs that berkshire has incurred on his behalf. during 2017, mr. buffett reimbursed berkshire $50,000.

speaking to french broadcaster bfm tv in an interview on sunday evening, she said:
this dynamic took on a dramatic turn in the runup to the 2016 brexit referendum, when then-u.s. president barack obama told the british people that britain would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal should it ever dare leave the european union at the request of then-prime minister david cameron.
but what has barack obama done for eight years? in the very early years of his administration, he sent hillary clinton to push the reset button with the russian foreign minister, he continued. in the middle of his re-election campaign in 2012 he told the russian president that he would have more flexibility after the election. when mitt romney characterized russia as our number one geopolitical adversary, barack obama mocked him and said that the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back. i'm glad the president has finally realized the threat that russia poses to the united states and our interests but i wish he had recognized this eight years ago.

from a layman's perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist – well, 'obamacare lite' it's been called – approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for, gaffney said. i think that's what donald trump set out to do. that's what he promised the voters. it's what i think you could get a majority of the congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you're not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support.

remain mps did not play along, however — and they did not allow johnson to force a no-deal by running down the clock, either, with the tony blair-created supreme court overturning a move to prorogue (temporarily suspend) parliament before the deadline in a highly dubious and possibly unconstitutional use of their powers.
now, the government can't create jobs. they've never created a job ever, but they can create the right environment so that small business, which is the engine of this economy, can create jobs, and that's exactly what we've seen under this administration and the policies that have come out of it, she added.

(jns) — israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and u.s. president donald trump are expected to meet at the white house in late march, a few weeks before the israeli election, israel hayom has learned.
johnson: well, first of all, i think the president will. he's certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you're talking about the border right now. and from my standpoint, i think one of the things republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. you know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. we should be preparing, and i'm actually working on a piece of legislation, there's already one right now that i'm a co-sponsor of to fund the coast guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. hopefully, mitch mcconnell will bring it up on the floor of the senate. i don't think we should be fully opening these agencies, because democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. and of course, nancy pelosi was very clear in the white house yesterday that when president trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? you know, will i get my barrier funding? and she said no. and so again, the democrats are being hypocritical. they're paying lip service to border security. barriers actually work. they absolutely do. we need them. it's kind of a first step table stakes issue. but they're playing politics. and i hope the president stands strong.

(see guideline 7.3 on page 10 of the document.) stunningly, the world jamboree guideline 7.3 also has exceptions, allowances and instructions for the consumption of alcohol in confined areas at the 12-day camping event. (it appears the jamboree guidelines were drafted after the 2015 world jamboree in japan in preparation for the 2019 event and were just recently released in an email.)

i think trump's victory was an extraordinary one, and he did it by being, frankly, different, not being a run-of-the-mill establishment republican. i don't think there's an appetite for a romney run in the republican party, nor do i think mitt romney-style big government establishment republicanism is frankly popular enough to win in a general election, paul continued.
sadly, in the field of climate research and climate policy, good data, when not ignored entirely, is increasingly twisted to fit the narrative claiming that humans are causing a climate crisis. climate action partisans, in pursuit of political power and ever increasing resources, force data to fit their delusion that humans must forego modern, industrial civilization to save humanity and the earth from climate doom.

when some u.s. politicians insist on finding scapegoats to cover up their own incompetence in responding to covid-19, the threat to public health will only worsen. faced with domestic criticism and deepened public fears, some white house politicians sharpened their rhetoric against china this week, referring to the widespread coronavirus as the chinese virus, wuhan virus, or the kung-flu, blaming china for the epidemic, and arousing virus-related hatred. but putting the blame on china is not an easy or quick way out of the twin health and economic crises faced by the u.s. administration. the tactic can only hurt china-u.s. relations and dampen the confidence in fighting the coronavirus, domestically and internationally. when the u.s. public sees that their government has sunk so low as to scapegoat china, fears will only deepen, as shown in the continuous slide in the u.s. stock market despite increasing policy efforts.

in each instance, we might add, the soviets were active on the other side—sometimes in a big way, sometimes in a lesser way. and just a few years earlier, moscow had helped to engineer communist victories in vietnam, cambodia, angola, and mozambique. this was the reality of the cold war—the russians were playing for keeps.

as american lives and our economic sovereignty continue to be risked to ensure a free flow of oil for countries that do not share our interests, the time for action is now. the president has rightly prioritized energy security in his america first energy plan, stating that his administration wants to, become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the opec cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.

joe biden understands that [immigration] is an irrefutable source of our strength. generations of immigrants have come to this country with little more than the clothes on their backs, the hope in their heart, and a desire to claim their own piece of the american dream. it's the reason we have constantly been able to renew ourselves, to grow better and stronger as a nation, and to meet new challenges. immigration is essential to who we are as a nation, our core values, and our aspirations for our future. under a biden administration, we will never turn our backs on who we are or that which makes us uniquely and proudly american. the united states deserves an immigration policy that reflects our highest values as a nation.

employers are increasingly adopting so-called implicit bias training, which targets employees by race or gender. not only are the tests associated with unconscious bias well short of meeting scientific standards, but because they purport to aid employers in targeting employees primarily based on their race or ethnicity and/or their gender they potentially allow employees to be assessed, disciplined or promoted on the basis of race or gender activity which title vii specifically bars. whether based on good intentions or not, an employer's plan to hire, promote or advance employees who are minority and/or female using implicit bias as a motive disadvantages non-minority and male employees.

as a result, much of brazil's land became off-limits to development. today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. to put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average brazilian. admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. and yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all brazilians.
the times' influence operation against american jews and american jewish supporters of israel is being carried out – conveniently enough — by its jewish columnists. these writers run the gamut from far-leftists to neo-liberal former conservatives in the never trump camp.
hungarian prime minister viktor orbán said thursday that french president emmanuel macron is the champion of europe's pro-immigration forces and therefore he has a duty to oppose him.
marek's daca refers to president barack obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy. the daca work-permit giveaway has not been approved by congress, partly because many millions of americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. it's not amnesty, marek wrote in 2014. it is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the united states. that's the kind of border security we need.

fox la reports that lovingood wants citizens to get concealed carry permits, and he wants to see a change in policy at county offices that will allow county workers to volunteer to become authorized to carry concealed weapons as well. and it appears many san bernardino county residents are thinking the same way. for example, waiting times for concealed carry permits in san bernardino county have spiked from 3 months before the shooting, to more than a year, due to the flood of applicants.

one of the claimed concessions made before the signing of the agreement from china was to work towards implementing international labour organization conventions which prohibit the use of slave labour and set out rights for labour unions.
the articles of impeachment before us were not even the first ones house democrats introduced. this was go-around number seven. those previously-alleged 'high crimes and misdemeanors' included things like being impolite to the press and to professional athletes. it insults the intelligence of the american people to pretend this was a solemn process reluctantly begun because of withheld foreign aid. no, washington democrats' position on this president has been clear for years. … here's their real position: washington democrats think president donald trump committed a 'high crime or misdemeanor' the moment he defeated secretary [hillary] clinton in the 2016 election. that is the original sin of this presidency: that he won and they lost.

we're trying to avoid conflict in the world. we're trying to protect our interest without hostilities. but you have to do that from a position of strength, bolton explained. you've got to start with political leadership, then you've got to follow it up with some very extensive programs to re-furbish the military. that's going to cost money. nobody better blink at that.

wang said the sudden onslaught of covid-19 [chinese coronavirus] has accelerated the once-in-a-century transformation in an increasingly fluid and changing world, presenting the chinese system as a model for the world to follow:

we are in a state of war, a war against covid-19 [chinese coronavirus]. war compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. as such, psg exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the filipino people, durante added.
policies like the one in question at usc have unfortunately become increasingly common at universities around the country. true liberals should take issue with the reality that students now have to get permission if they want to stand in a campus courtyard with poster boards promoting their political positions. these types of demonstrations have been an integral part of american academic culture, specifically as a result of our country's emphasis on first amendment principles.

and, of course, once the u.s. economy is flooded with rent-raising, wage-cutting legal (or illegal) immigrants, then blue-collar americans are denied the right to a tight labor market where employees and employers can bargain as equals as they trade work for wages. jawetz and other progressives would join with ceos to steal that bargaining power and decide which jobs need to be filled by low-wage, compliant, and grateful migrants instead of well-paid, free-speaking, indepndent american citizens.

jones on wednesday, hours before the u.s. senate is scheduled to vote to acquit president trump on both articles of impeachment adopted by the u.s. house of representatives after a weeks-long senate trial, revealed that he intends to vote to convict president trump on both counts. jones's votes will fail, as the u.s. senate has well more than enough votes to acquit president trump, but the fact that he has decided to align himself with the leftists who have taken over the democrat party has people like sessions alarmed on behalf of the state of alabama.

the washington, dc-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, wall street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.

the latter remark referred to china's policy of using sharp power, or economic intimidation, to force international corporations to accept its worldview. throughout 2018, companies such as ikea, american airlines, and marriott faced the brunt of sharp power, forced to choose between identifying taiwan as a country in their legal papers, websites, and drop-down menus or losing access to the massive chinese market. three major airlines in the united states ultimately changed their fight booking options to stop identifying taiwan as a country even as the u.s. government dismissed china's bullying as nonsense and urged them not to do so. marriott, in one notable instance, fired a social media manager for liking a twitter post by a group called friends of tibet, which opposes communism.

since 2001, u.s. free trade with china has eliminated at least 3.4 million american jobs. in 1985, before china entered the wto, the u.s. trade deficit with china totaled $6 billion. in 2019, the u.s. trade deficit with china totaled more than $345 billion.
the dissent between the u.s.-backed groups and is and nusra front … was about the distribution of resources. and the proof is that on the eve of last month's geneva talks, saudi arabia, backed by america, demanded that the areas controlled by nusra be included in the ceasefire agreement, which syria and russia dismissed out of hand. america was subsequently left with no choice but to declare nusra, riyadh's ally, a terrorist organization.

we're not necessarily being singled out by those tech companies, but certainly by the people who have been putting pressure on them and, in fact, we think we're being set up in a lot of ways because in looking at some of the content, these are accounts that have been created two days ago and they have few pieces of content and some of them are parodies of what you would think a right-wing inciter of violence would be.

the complaint also alleges that assistant coach dominick donnie spataro showed pornographic and nude photographs of himself and others on his mobile photo to plaintiff and other minor wrestlers.
trump and white house officials are touting the emergency option, which may be announced by trump in his pending january 8 national address. on january 7, vice president mike pence told reporters:

the exchange cited further consultation with regulators but its announcement late monday gave no other details. many analysts think the move reflects the expectation of a softening of the stance of u.s. policy toward china when president-elect joe biden takes office.
the security source said: half the problem is no effective analysis is applied to these things in brussels as there's no real analytical capability to inform policy decisions. so the dots between brussels and eu policy on the one hand and security implications, social cohesion etc, particularly in the medium to long term – the second and third order effects you might say – on the other are never joined. that is a serious and systemic problem.

congress can terminate a declared emergency, but it requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers, according to loyola law professor jessica a. levinson. … [kim lane scheppele, a legal scholar and professor at princeton university's center for human values] said if trump continues to make the case that the wall is necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the u.s., then he may be able to make the case that building a wall has a military purpose and he has a freer hand.
by the time fidel castro rode victoriously into santiago, the prevailing belief (including among the island's business leaders) was that castro's overthrow of batista would lead to democracy and free elections. col. haza believed democracy was cuba's destiny and stood with castro on a stage soon after. but it became evident that castro neither believed in nor would support democracy; col. haza withdrew his support. within a few days, col. haza was forced into a dark cow pasture where he and 70 other prisoners were executed under the direction of raul castro, fidel's younger brother and now cuban president.

biden was silent on many critical details. for example, he did not say how migrants would be judged as welcome for life in the united states — even though at least 150 million people want that prize. he was silent about how rejected migrants would be deterred from entering the obstacle course, and how they would be sent home — even though 11 million resident illegals are already refusing to leave the united states.
the democrats' legal case against the border wall is also limited by the ideological nature of their objection to the wall. the wall is a symbolic rejection of america's welcome for migrants, house speaker nancy pelosi told an msnbc event on january 4, saying it builds walls in people minds about who should come here.
it means this deep recognition that our sole responsibility is to protect the american people. when we do that, i am very confident we will increase security for people all around the world, we will raise others up as well. but our mission set, everyday, is to say, 'how do we make sure that everything we do secures freedom for america?' and it's gotten us to walk away from a whole bunch of things. we've walked away from the world health organization. we walked away from the un human rights commission. we walked away from some of the central understandings of the world trade organization. each of these things was detrimental to the american people, their prosperity, their security. we were right to do that. it's a sensibility that i think 75 million people still understand and understood in november of this year. they haven't stopped understanding, i promise you that.
president donald trump has made strengthening the military a priority in his administration, including in 2017 reserving military service to men and women based on their biological sex and not their gender identity.

after consulting several of my predecessors and analyzing the nsc's current configuration, i have determined that the agency can and should be streamlined, and am in the process of restoring the nsc to its historical mission. with the president's approval, we will reduce the nsc staff, making it more effective by reaffirming its mission to coordinate policy and ensure policy implementation. the nsc staff should not, as it has in the past, duplicate the work of military officers, diplomats or intelligence officers. with that in mind, we will be able to reduce 174 policy positions to under 120 by early 2020.

no one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to u.s. airstrikes that killed 25 iran-backed militiamen in iraq and syria. the u.s. blamed the militia for a rocket attack that killed a u.s. contractor in northern iraq.
that policy continues to be a lightning rod for national criticism after the murder last month of corporal ronil singh, a legal immigrant and police officer who was allegedly shot and killed by an illegal alien during a traffic stop.
yet instead, it seems as though western greens are saddling up for a major confrontation with bolsonaro. on december 27, the sierra club magazine headlined a story, what will it take to rein in the trump of brazil? brazil's president-elect threatens the planet. in that article—which reads exactly like the lefty imperialism that ernesto araújo was railing against—the sierra club declares, bolsonaro has shown a responsiveness to economic and international pressure, which could be one way to contain him.
there's a lot at stake here, he concluded. a real leader could explain that, could explain to the american people how it could affect their daily lives – and why we have to take actions such as a substantial naval rebuilding program, so that our navy doesn't sink to levels we haven't seen since world war i, and so that we can protect our freedoms here, and our way of life.

facebook was forced by the eu regulators to admit that they are tracking people on other websites. if a facebook user researches a new television on an external website or inside of a mobile app, his or her profile is tagged for advertisers to know that a user on another site has indicated an interest in televisions and in electronics. facebook then sells the data to advertisers pitching electronic devices that want to reach a facebook user.

tel aviv – a piece in the london-based saudi daily al-sharq al-awsa opined that the detention of 10 american sailors just hours before president obama's final state of the union address effectively kidnapped the foolish u.s. president himself by casting a shadow over his authority.
the conservative party has complacently taken many thousands of pounds in donations to its coffers from huawei. the conservative peer, baroness wheatcroft, joined the huawei 'advisory board'. (she was accompanied in this enterprise by such luminaries as the former senior civil servant sir andrew cahn, the former bp chief executive lord browne, and the late former head of the confederation of british industry, dame helen alexander.) huawei's meticulous ingratiation into the heart of the british establishment went to the very top: it donated half a million pounds to the prince's trust. it was only a year ago that prince charles's most treasured public enterprise declared it would 'not be accepting new donations from huawei' because of 'public concerns'.

i think trump's response was entirely appropriate, he argued. i think where he has not stepped up to the plate yet, at least his administration hasn't, is the iranian nuclear weapons program. despite his very strong view during the campaign that the obama nuclear deal was a debacle, just yesterday secretary of state tillerson signed a letter to speaker ryan, in compliance with the congressional reporting requirement, saying iran was in compliance with the deal.
rci reports that peterson's handling of this situation is being put forward as a possible reason why israel did not fire the deputy after he refused to go inside and confront the parkland school shooter. instead, israel allowed peterson to resign and he now draws a pension of over $100,000 a year.

following the announcement of amazon's plans to build the new hq, cities across america began attempting to entice amazon to develop the building in their city. kansas city mayor sly james bought and reviewed as many as 1,000 amazon products in an attempt to convince amazon to locate there while stonecrest, georgia, offered to rename the city amazon, georgia, and give the company 345 acres of land on which to develop their new hq for free. however, it seems that many of these locations didn't fit amazon's criteria which included being close to a major airport and the city's ability to attract talented tech workers.

the goal for america is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. it's happiness. there are a lot of ingredients in being happy: dignity. purpose. self-control. independence. above all, deep relationships with other people. those are the things that you want for your children. they're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. but our leaders don't care. we are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. they're day traders. substitute teachers. they're just passing through. they have no skin in this game, and it shows. they can't solve our problems. they don't even bother to understand our problems.
but trump's support for an amnesty would show that the establishment's cheap-labor policies are king, so deflating pressure on employers to pay higher wages to workers in the run-up to the 2018 election. 8. delay gives time to democrats to gradually accept the nation's desire to shift from a high immigration/low-wage economy to a low-immigration/high-wage economy. this huge economic change will impose a huge psychological shift among democrats, plus their billionaire and media allies, who have persuaded themselves that voters really want business groups to get an unending stream of cheap-labor in the hope that the cheap-labor will also vote democratic. many democrats have already started their journey with shock on november 8, 2016, but it just takes time for people to work their way through denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, and eventually, acceptance and renewed hope. a daca delay will help democrats get through the bargaining stage, prior to guilt in summer, anger in november, then depression in christmas and acceptance in the spring of 2019. 9. delays are not a primary problem because the 3.25 million 'dreamers,' including the 700,000 'daca' illegals are foreigners and their interests are simply less important than americans' interests, regardless of any deadline. few of the illegals will be deported in 2018, partly because enforcement officers are chasing the many criminals protected under obama's deputies.

china used to publish the number of mass incidents occurring in the country. the number of mass incidents of unrest recorded by the chinese government grew from 8,700 in 1993 to about 90,000 in 2010, according to several government-backed studies. the government stopped publishing the figures in 2010, but it is reasonable to believe that the number of mass incidents per year is well into the hundreds of thousands. if even just one of these mass incidents occurred in america or europe, it would be international news, so the fact that hundreds of such mass incidents occur in china every day indicates how socially unstable china is.

but what he leaves out of this glowing self-praise is perhaps most important: he failed to repeal obamacare, he failed to secure the border or do any big picture immigration deal, in large part because his open borders views were out of line with the rest of the conference, he failed to cut spending, he failed to shrink the deficit, he failed to bring the national debt under control, and he failed to do major welfare or entitlement reforms–things he also spent years pitching.

ice is fortunate that the threat [to migrants' health] posed by these detention centers can be mitigated rather easily. by releasing from custody the thousands of detainees who pose no threat to public safety and do not constitute an unmanageable flight risk, ice can reduce the overcrowding of its detention centers, and thus make them safer, while also putting fewer people at risk.
3. the border crisis has nothing to do with legal immigration, which we embrace. corporal ronil singh, a newman, california police officer — and legal immigrant — was murdered the day after christmas by an alleged illegal alien. many americans want less immigration — a debate for another day. regardless, americans respect legal immigrants. we should reform our immigration laws, including those that allow foreigners to claim amnesty as soon as they touch american soil. corporal singh gave his life to defend the rule of law. that is what is at stake.
our troops in south korea are vulnerable. they've got thousands of tons of chemical weapons. south korean civilians are vulnerable. that's why my view has long been that really the only solution to the nuclear problem in north korea, and, in fact, the north korean problem generally, is to reunify the peninsula. as long as this regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually come to fruition, with horrible consequences, he warned.

well, how exactly are you going to do that? what exactly are you going to do? there's no answer to it, obama said. he just says, 'well, i'm going to negotiate a better deal.' well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? what magic wand do you have? and usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.

backed by an array of free-speech advocates, the tech company has argued that expanding the territorial scope of the right to be forgotten would infringe on other countries' sovereignty and encourage dictators and tyrants to assert control over content published beyond their countries' borders. the eu's executive arm also argued in september that the right shouldn't be extended overseas. at issue in the case is the right, established by the court in 2014, for eu residents to demand that search engines remove links containing personal information—such as a home address—from searches for their own names. under the 2014 ruling, search engines must then balance those requests against the public's right to associate the information in the link with that individual, taking into account, for instance, whether the person is a public figure. since that decision, google has removed 1.1 million links from search results in the eu. but it left those links intact for the same searches conducted outside europe.

commissioner richard ross said starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing. he said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything, as he said is company policy. he said they then refused to leave. ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released after the company elected not to prosecute. he said the officers 'did absolutely nothing wrong' and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but 'got the opposite back.' he did not mention the person who said he was meeting with the men. 'as an african american male, i am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,' ross said. but he added if a business calls and they say that 'someone is here that i no longer wish to be in my business' (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.'

the third problem was that pelosi and schumer failed to talk about the problems trump raised in emotive terms: the murders, the drugs, the sexual assaults — not just targeting americans, but targeting the migrants themselves. the victims of the cartels were totally absent from their address. instead, they wrung their hands about turmoil in the administration. they looked and sounded as if they did not care about the human suffering at the border.

even mere whispers of this possibility can never be publicly acknowledged by any currently serving central banker; to do so would seriously undermine their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, who have become accustomed to their spoon-fed propaganda. these experts are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the problems we now face. they allow politicians to spend beyond their respective countries' means, then give them blank checks to bail them out whenever they get into too much trouble.
though president trump signed his buy american, hire american executive order in early 2017, his department of homeland security (dhs) secretaries, general john kelly and kirstjen nielsen, have each approved an additional 15,000 foreign workers for business to import in 2017 and 2018.

between 1995 and 2006, the usda defined four broad categories of food security: food secure, food insecure without hunger, food insecure with moderate hunger, and food insecure with severe hunger. in 2006, they changed their categories to persons with low food security and those with very low food security. they dropped food insecurity with hunger because not enough respondents reported that they felt hunger at any point during the reporting year. this ought to be a tip-off that something is fishy with government hunger numbers.

the trump administration prioritized foreign policy initiatives that made it more difficult for the cuban communist regime to oppress its people, in contrast with the appeasement strategy of predecessor barack obama. among the policies implemented against the castro regime were the conclusion of people to people tours to cuba – an exception to the embargo under obama – and the outlawing of american cruises to cuba. while tourism to cuba is technically not legal under the longstanding embargo, obama legalized tourism via cruise ships, netting the castro regime millions of dollars.

5. radical left-wing ballot initiatives defeated. though democrats managed to defeat president trump at the polls, voters rejected almost all of the left's most radical ballot initiatives. tax hikes failed even in deep-blue california and illinois, and california voters also rejected an effort (proposition 16) to allow racial discrimination (affirmative action) in state-run institutions. these were major victories, and a sign that even democratic voters were pushing back against the radical left.

carney was speaking after the bank kept interest rates on hold – again as expected. how long they will stay on hold will likely depend on how long rate-setters can overlook rising inflation. rate-setters have a difficult balancing act – how to set policy to meet a legal mandate to keep inflation at 2 percent against the need to support economic growth.

the covid-19 response should not be linked to immigration enforcement in any manner. it will undermine individual and collective health if individuals do not feel safe to utilize care and respond to inquiries from public health officials, for example during contact tracing. similar enforcement-free zones have been declared during hurricanes and other emergencies, including after the september 11 terrorist attacks. these policies should be clearly and unequivocally articulated to the public by the federal, state, and local governments.
over the past week or so, we had reports of strong growth and rising wages (good things!), which sent bonds and stocks down (bad for most investors) due to justifiable fears that the fed will tighten faster than is priced in the credit markets. the surge in growth and wages came because of both the fiscal stimulation and the rekindling of animal spirits, thrusting the economy into late-cycle capacity constraints, which is leading to the expectations of faster fed tightening. in other words, fiscal stimulation is hitting the gas, which is driving the economy forward into the capacity constraints, which is triggering interest rate increases that are hitting the brakes, first in the markets and later in the economy. this confluence of circumstances will make it difficult for the fed to get monetary policy exactly right. this is classic late-cycle behavior (when it's difficult to get monetary policy exactly right, which leads to recessions), though it is more exaggerated because the durations of assets are uniquely long, which means that when interest rates are low, prices of assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than when interest rates are high.

bromund saw the state department as a less than optimum choice for implementing congressional instructions since state actually has very little to do with interpol coordination. he reflected that the united states tends to treat interpol as what it actually is—essentially a global bulletin board for the police—and uses law enforcement agencies to interact with it, whereas china and some other members view interpol as a political entity and use political and diplomatic agencies to deal with it.

economists will no doubt spend years figuring out exactly what gave rise to the trump manufacturing boom and why so many forecasts were so far off-base. no doubt trade policy, tax cuts, and regulatory reform all played a role. but a good deal of the manufacturing revival is likely based on something less tangible but no less real: the revival of hope. people who believe we can make america great again are hiring, starting new businesses, and returning to the workforce.

two different worlds. similar outcomes. how did this happen? you'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. mostly they're not. they don't have to be. it's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born americans who are slipping behind. but republicans now represent rural voters. they ought to be interested. here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. all that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. in many places, women suddenly made more than men. before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. maybe they should want to, but they don't. over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. this isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. it's social science. we know it's true. rich people know it best of all. that's why they get married before they have kids. that model works. increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in america can afford.

jeh c. johnson, who served in the obama administration as secretary of homeland security and general counsel of the defense department, said the laws trump could invoke with his national emergency declaration are designed to authorize military construction projects during wartime. he said using them for a border wall could curtail presidential powers in the years to come as lawmakers react to trump and work to constrain him. the danger of using an authority like this and stretching it beyond its intended use is that congress could then take it away, and it could not be used in situations where it's really needed, johnson said. robert f. bauer, a white house counsel under president barack obama, said trump would be poorly positioned to defend such an action in federal courts, in part because his statements about the wall have been contradictory and have contained provable falsehoods.

step up and recognize that there is a political game going on in these organizations, and that in order to fight the politicization of these organizations, you have to be willing to call it out for what it is, and to appoint individuals to u.s. leadership positions inside the u.s. government who are willing to fight to keep these organizations technical and apolitical, by recognizing that other people want to treat them as political, he advised.

another proposal is to build the sites reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of maxwell, just over an hour north of sacramento. as noted earlier, the sites reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.
americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by breitbart news. more than 85,000 americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the h-1b visa program. worse, the h-1b system allows u.s. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing u.s. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.

social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. the real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the american family is collapsing. nothing can be fixed before we fix that. yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. the idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. they refuse to consider it. questioning markets feels like apostasy.

what's at stake here is absolutely critical. we are holding the line here for the country to maintain a balance of power, perdue said. if you look at what we have to do, it's simply to get our vote out. five million people voted in november. there were nefarious activities that went on allegedly, and we have done a lot to add to the integrity of that by putting poll watchers in and we've got cameras on these drop boxes, so on and so forth. we're doing everything we can to make sure every vote is counted legally and accurately on jan. 5. but what we've really got to do, we've only gotten 3 million out to vote so far. that's off from where we were in november — i think some 3.6 million had voted already by this point in november. so we've got a ways to go but we've got to get our vote out. we also know that republicans win on election day. if there's any republicans out there, any conservatives out there, any independents or libertarians out there who haven't voted it, they owe it to their children and grandchildren to help us hold the line against this radical socialist agenda. that's what's at stake here, pure and simple. i know that sounds like trite words, but this is not the typical election where you can just correct it in two or four years. if these things get done, we will not be able to help self-correct this.
the steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. in the years ahead, united states emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks. the most significant reductions last year were around transportation, which remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, said kate larsen, a director at rhodium group, a research and consulting firm. but as vaccines become more prevalent, and depending on how quickly people feel comfortable enough to drive and fly again, we'd expect emissions to rebound unless there are major policy changes put in place.
as for why america's financial industry and intelligence agencies have overestimated china's growth potential, eberstadt said that it's the easy temptation to think that tomorrow is going to be just like today plus two percent. growing in a straight line. but straight lines don't happen in history when you actually look at it, he said.

the jan. 6 nuclear test has led to another push in the u.n. to tighten sanctions. north korea in 2013 also did a nuclear test and then unnerved the international community by orchestrating an escalating campaign of bombast, including threats to fire nuclear missiles at the u.s. and seoul.
the scorecard for implementing the 2017 strategic framework over the following three years is far from perfect, especially after the wuhan coronavirus pandemic, which china ruthlessly exploited to overturn many of the policy goals outlined in the nsc document. as 2020 drew to a close, china was aggressively using the pandemic and its disruptions to argue for the superiority of its authoritarian system and command economy, the exact opposite of how the framework authors hoped the world's new struggle against authoritarianism would be faring at the end of trump's term.

the children of migrants are our future workforce, said marek, as the video shows migrants working in jobs needed by americans such as cleaning hotel rooms, driving, construction, and laying bricks. the video also shows many jobs where employers prefer to use cheap migrant labor instead of investing in labor-saving machinery. so the video shows migrants cutting weeds with prehistoric tools, milking cows, picking fruit by hand, and delivering food by bicycle.

fdr's decision was intensely controversial at the time, and yet for the sake of american lives, it was absolutely necessary. the red army bore the brunt of the fighting in world war two, and that was the fighting that spared our gis. in fact, the russians inflicted 75 percent of the casualties suffered by the germans in the entire war.

were president trump to actually send troops to the southern border, it would not be unprecedented. in 2006, president george w. bush deployed roughly 6,000 troops to the border to support domestic law enforcement activities. and in 2010, president obama took similar action. notably, while those actions might have been unpopular, no one seriously questioned whether presidents bush and obama violated the posse comitatus act.

the americans weren't interested in the yemeni war in the first place, but since they were so adamant to move ahead with the iranian nuclear deal they lent their support to the saudis to minimize tehran's reach in the region, he said. that policy drove two opponents of al-qaeda against each other, which was exploited by the group to assassinate government officials and consolidate its foothold around the capital aden, as well as key regions like taaz, hadramout, and others.

in observance of world water day on tuesday, the white house convened what was billed as a first-of-its-kind summit on water. the meeting, which the fresno bee reports was attended by california democrats including rep. jerry mcnerney and rep. jared huffman, focused on water conservation — but did not address the fact that the federal government prioritizes the endangered delta smelt fish over the needs of farmers, often flushing out hundreds of thousands of acre-feet to sea.

they were always prepared to help deliver that, not just on a substantive point of view, but also in a kind of metaphorical way. so when they went out in public, they had a patina, more than a patina, of glamour about them, and she kept that up after we lost the president. at the [reagan] library, for example, she would be always introduced as the former first lady of the united states. they had ruffles and flourishes played. the whole setting at the library, i think, is a real tribute to their personal tastes, but also to the place of the presidency in our lives, whether you're a republican or a democrat or a tea party member or whatever. you go in there and you have a sense of the majesty of the office, if you will, and i mean that in a pragmatic sense, not in the royal sense.

this [speech] turned this thing on its head, people have this so backwards. you hear this all the time, oh, all the money spent on law enforcement all the prisons are filled with these low-level drug users. not true! smoke a joint and the odds you're going to prison are virtually the same as if you don't smoke a joint. it's just a huge myth out that there.

it was this adherence to ideas and the rule of law that separated washington from a napoleon buonaparte—another great man who helped topple the french monarchy to established a republic, but eventually drove his nation to an empire of arbitrary rule. and it was the commitment to the constitution and ultimately the virtue of the american people that allowed america's founding generation to create an empire of liberty. washington understood this when he become the first president of the united states. he said in his inaugural address, the sacred fire of liberty and destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people.

cindy anderson, a member of doctors for camp closure — an association of medical professionals who oppose immigration detention — decried camp conditions in matamoros, across the rio grande from brownsville, texas. i was in matamoros in january and we were seeing a lot of influenza-like illness at that time. and so any kind of virus, it would spread quickly through a camp like that, just because people are in close proximity with one another, said anderson. i think the big concern is if someone developed respiratory distress there that very quickly the resources will be overwhelmed.

but, in fact, i don't really think there was a change in policy, bolton continued. i think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons, just as we would respond if it were nuclear weapons or biological weapons. it's a threat to american national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction. so trump's response – which so far, at least, has been confined to the one strike at the syrian airbase, although obviously, it took place in syria – was not a shift in policy on the civil war.

remittances sent from the united states prop up households, provide stability to national economies, and spur consumption. migration has provided some ambitious central americans with an escape from poverty. but it has also enabled elites, who see no need to slow migration, as it is a status quo which works for them—and they are content to keep it intact. as a guatemalan think tank analyst said ruefully after president trump demanded guatemala sign an asylum cooperation agreement: we continue doing everything except taking responsibility. …we're not the victims and we need to assume our responsibilities because the united states is no longer going to cover the cost of guatemala's shortcomings.

essentially, what we'd like to see is that they continue what the state department has done, bringing together – i think it's now 32 countries – through a ministerial on religious freedom to set some standards worldwide, curry noted, referring to the annual conferences founded by the trump-era state department to give foreign ministers a venue to discuss how to bolster religious freedom at home. but i also think you look first to those people we have international relationships with, like india. if china wants to be part of the international community – that is a big question mark – but if they do, we have to have some standards of human rights that are agreed upon.

in no way would a fourth-hand report from a maltese professor justify wholesale targeting of four or five members of the trump campaign. it took christopher steele, with his funding concealed through false campaign filings, to be incredibly successful at creating a vast echo chamber around his unverified, fanciful dossier, bouncing it back and forth between the press and the fbi so it appeared that there were multiple sources all coming to the same conclusion.

one of the things our campus free speech bill does, in addition to insisting the colleges adopt good statements defending free speech and explaining the meaning of free speech, we insist there be a section of freshman orientation where the students are taught about these statements, and that they're taught about the policy that disciplines people who shut down speakers. so, there is an educational element in our legislation, but ultimately legislation can never be a complete solution. there has to be a change in which we start to really educate students again in the principles of free speech and what classical liberalism of the kind the founders practiced are all about. if we don't do that, this generation is going to be lost and the country is going to be lost.
japanese prime minister shinzo abe called the north korean rocket launch and the recent nuclear test violations of u.n. agreements.
proponents of closed borders and small social safety nets have a tendency to highlight the tension between citizen and noncitizen, to imply or explicitly state that the only way to help one group is to deprive the other. but the truth is, people on both sides are hanging by a thread. infectious diseases, especially those like covid-19, have a knack for penetrating and exposing such false dichotomies.

making the speech in new york city was a risky move for lincoln, as it was a stronghold of his chief rival for the gop nomination, william h. seward. at that point in the race, lincoln was a heavy underdog to lead the surging and strengthening republican party. but his lengthy speech defending the constitution, the union, and the vision of the founding fathers catapulted him to victory in the most contentious election in american history.
what the media and critics haven't done, and won't do, ashford added, is to point out that their attacks on pence are part of a larger and very disturbing trend in american life – an ugly form of prejudice called christian shaming.
in short, there is ample reason to believe trump's decision was about more than thin skin, and his skin didn't have to be very thin to think abrams wouldn't be a good fit for an administration he previously regarded as an improbable catastrophe. six weeks of non-stop leaking and bureaucratic sabotage might understandably have reduced the president's tolerance for a number two official at the state department who (according to senator paul) once declared donald trump unfit to occupy the chair where washington and lincoln once sat—but evidently had no such reservations about hillary clinton.
trump has ridiculed the impeachment process for months, and he responded to the opening of the trial by once more branding it a hoax.
and in any case, none of these gotcha moments amount to anything revelatory, they continued. these videos don't prove that twitter has a partisan bias against its far-right conservative users. (indeed, they're some of its most prolific users.) they do show, though, that the right-wing backlash against tech giants has reached a new height. with every new policy intended to curb abuse, twitter, youtube, facebook, and other platforms invite rancor. the new rules have been necessary to fight an increasingly toxic atmosphere online. but project veritas sees those steps, and the ban of high-profile far-right users—over clear, apolitical terms of service violations—as an attempt not to improve discourse online, but to quash the free exchange of ideas.
she told me that 'mankind' does not refer to all people, only males. i refuted, stating that it does refer to all people, [but] she proceeded to tell me that i was wrong; 'mankind' is sexist, and i should make an effort to look beyond my preset positions and ideologies, as is the focus of the class, jeffers claimed.

the same was the case with the palestinians. as clinton, bush and obama all saw it, the only salient question regarding the palestinians was whether or not israel was willing to cut a deal with the palestine liberation organization (plo). they considered plo sponsorship and incitement of terror a mere distraction. the plo's partnership with hamas was said to be a passing phase. plo corruption and embezzlement of billions of dollars in u.s. and international aid dollars was just an irritant.
on the other hand, graham templeton at extremetech argues that exposing hellfire technology to cuba might not matter all that much because that technology is already available. not only is there a strong possibility that hackers have looted hellfire data during numerous raids on u.s. systems, but the weapons have been sold to dubious allies like iraq, saudi arabia, and turkey, who would have had many opportunities to share hellfire tech with their even more dubious allies.

now trump and the israeli leader are both speaking vaguely of a broader middle east package. israel's arab neighbors, who traditionally opposed israel but have realigned because of common concerns about iran — would serve as guarantors.
he lamented the failure of mainstream parties to make a policy that appears at least halfway sensible and said this failure had triggered panic in many people.
many gop and democratic politicians will likely dislike any emergency declaration because trump would redirect funding from their districts to the border wall in texas and california. but it is not clear that majorities in the house and senate could formally override the president's emergency powers.

5. obama claimed the geneva convention applies broadly, even to non-parties not officially at war. in a seminal foreign policy speech in 2007, candidate obama made it clear that he considered terror detainees protected by the geneva conventions: as president, i will close guantanamo, reject the military commissions act, and adhere to the geneva conventions. yet terrorists are not parties to the convention, or officially at war with us.
a collection of leaked documents appears to show facebook redefining rules around hate speech and re-educating content moderators following the charlottesville protest in 2017.

as a tool of terror, the drug would work best in a closed space, said daniel gerstein, a senior policy researcher at rand corp. who served as acting undersecretary in the department of homeland security's science and technology directorate in the obama administration. open-air release probably wouldn't be as effective, as the drug could become too diluted, he said. if ground-up fentanyl is placed on everyday objects, people could easily put their fingers in their mouths or rub their eyes and have a deadly reaction, bloom said.

in the absence of federal legislation, massachusetts is free to ban these weapons and large capacity magazines. other states are equally free to leave unregulated and available to their law-abiding citizens. their policy matters are simply not of constitutional moment. americans are not afraid of bumptious, raucous, and robust debate about these matters. we call it democracy.

kirkpatrick thus put her finger on a central and enduring aspect of liberalism: namely, the instinct to focus intensely on the small flaws of friends, while being blind to the larger flaws of foes. she derided this liberal impulse as a formula for self-abasement and apology. and we might add that this mindset never seems to change—hence, decades later, barack obama's notorious apology tours.

clegg attempted to hit back with a line that would come to be repeated through the brexit campaign as an example of the haughty disdain the westminster elite held voters in, when he said: no, no, no… it is a dangerous fantasy. it's just not true! i want to explain the truth and reality, not this fantasy world you keep talking about that simply doesn't exist.

1. delays help trump pressure democrats to accept his popular pro-american policies. many democrats don't believe trump will allow the daca work-permits to continue expiring in march, so feel little pressure to trade their policy priorities for continuing work-permits. so if trump declines to negotiate a deal until after the expirations accelerate in march, democrats will recognize that trump is playing hardball. they [now] think they have the upper hand, they don't really believe he will pull the trigger and let [daca] expire, said mark krikorian, the director of the center for immigration studies. it is important to not just wait until march but to wait until [more illegals] lose their work permits to ensure the democrats come back to the table and stop saying 'my way or the high way.' 2. delays help democrats make mistakes. in december, trump called the democrats' bluff when they suggested they would shut down the government spending unless the gop gave them an amnesty. that was a bluff in december, and it will be a bluff in january or march or november 2018 because polls show that americans strongly oppose any government shutdown to help illegals.

regarding the impeachment more broadly, sessions said the partisan push by the u.s. house—it's the first time in the history of the united states that an impeachment has been purely partisan in nature with bipartisan opposition—was a colossal failure. in the house, all republicans were joined by three democrats in opposing one article of impeachment and by two democrats in opposing the other. a fourth democrat voted present on both articles, refusing to vote for either one. one of the two democrats who voted against both articles left the democrat party over it, joining the gop. the senate process has been similarly marred by democrat partisanship. what's more, sessions says, the actual allegations don't pass muster.

operating the [aircraft] carrier in the face of increasingly lethal and precise munitions will thus require the united states to expose a multi-billion dollar asset to high levels of risk in the event of a conflict. an adversary with a2/ad [anti-access/area denial] capabilities would likely launch a saturation attack against the carrier from a variety of platforms and directions. such an attack would be difficult – if not impossible – to defend against.

one of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. economics is a topic for public debate. family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. both parties believe this. members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the democratic party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. in other words, functionally libertarian. they don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. as far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

the comparison of this view to the united states' long history of anti-catholic bigotry has been disputed. actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. a 19th-century bigot would have regarded catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with america's democratic rules. the same attitude seems currently present in the u.s. senate.

hewitt: but the consequences are spreading. i know one person whose home purchase is screwed up, because fema can't issue flood insurance, and the cost of private flood insurance is prohibitive. and so there are consequences to a government shutdown that very few people see, but a lot of people feel. i'm not sure of the politics of this, but a national emergency declaration would allow you to reopen the government and then move the conversation to the courts, although as an article i guy, you're not going to like the idea that article ii can act unilaterally.

in the week prior to the election, kabila's election commission said that the election will still be held, but will be delayed until march in three cities: beni, butembo, and yumbi. the reasons given for beni and butembo are that there are ebola outbreaks in those cities and that voting would be dangerous. however, voting has not been delayed in other cities with ebola outbreaks. what these three cities have in common is that they are strongholds for anti-kabila opposition. on election day, the local government of beni held its own elections, just to prove that voting was not dangerous.

in the last congress, my colleagues pete aguilar of california, a democrat, and will hurd of texas, a republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on. it would have directed homeland security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer congress a strategy for each section of the border. it might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in san diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath. it might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day. it might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor. or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. but if homeland security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.

alonso benítez was considered a model farmer, growing organic coffee in honduras' western highlands. in recent years, he had switched to organic methods, planted timber-producing trees to diversify his income, and worked with a cooperative to earn a premium on the world price. benítez also had a large extended family in the area, who pitched in with harvests and lowered his labor costs. but benítez vanished one day in april 2019 with his 17-year-old son, leaving an elder, 18-year-old son to oversee the farm. he paid a coyote 170,000 lempiras ($7,300) to take him and his son to the u.s. border, according to the elder son, jordi benítez. after spending four days in the custody of u.s. customs and border patrol, the pair were released and went to houston—where benítez found work in a gravel pit.
in nevada, too, the state's supreme court ruled against the local chapter of the aclu, which was challenging the nevada's new esa program on the grounds it violated the state constitution's blaine amendment. and though, as burke writes, both research and legal precedent … make [esas] well-positioned to withstand legal challenges based on blaine amendments, the amendments continue to serve as an impediment to families accessing school choice programs in an efficient way. in nevada, for instance, thousands of families are stuck on a waiting list as the legislature figures out a way to fund the esa program after the state's supreme court declared the program (but not its funding mechanism) constitutional.
even putting aside the risk of acquiring covid on set – a risk that we have done a great deal to mitigate through our safety protocols – on-set production always poses some risk of injury, whether because of a stunt gone wrong, an equipment failure, or a garden-variety fall. right now, with few, if any, hospital beds available, it is hard to understand how a worker injured on set is supposed to seek treatment. i would like to thank the jpc and the pga for their efforts to reinforce safety measures for all, and we acknowledge and appreciate the major studios and other producers who have proactively stepped up and postponed their production during this emergency.

the culprit is adults' bad choices. cigarette smoking is a major cause of very low food security, rector told congress. he is not a no-smoking scold; he is concerned about the cost of the habit. very low food security adults are much more likely to smoke than are food-secure adults, and money that is spent on cigarettes cannot be spent on food.
the rocket, fired from north korea's west coast and tracked by the governments in south korea and japan, came about two hours after an eight-day launch window opened sunday morning. it follows north korea's widely disputed claim last month to have tested a hydrogen bomb. washington, seoul and their allies will consider it a further provocation and will push for more tough sanctions in the united nations.

trump's political campaign dismissed the house effort as just a failed attempt to politically damage president trump leading up to his reelection.
so a delay would allow officials to better grasp the cost and scale of the proposed amnesty. 5. delay makes for honest government. obama's daca policy offered temporary work-permits — not permanent work-permits — pending a solution by congress. in fact, obama claimed in june 2012 that this is a temporary stopgap measure. by allowing obama's temporary work permit to remain temporary, trump is simply implementing the claimed spirit of obama's promise — even if obama intended to make his temporary deal into a permanent fixture. 6. delay keeps trump's political opponents fixated on their unpoular pro-illegal-immigrant rhetoric throughout 2018, while an amnesty deal instead would give democrats a morale-boost before the 2018 election — plus the time to shift towards more popular rhetoric, such as stoking fears about government medical care. by refusing an amnesty, trump helps makes the 2018 election all about the democrats' noisy and unpopular demands for limitless amnesty. 7. delay helps trump's 2018 election turnout. under trump's buy american, hire american policies, wages are now rising in some cities, perhaps marking the arrival of a wage-boom in the run-up to the 2018 election. the scheduled expiration of daca will nudge many illegals out of the labor market before november, likely boosting wages for american voters and encouraging the roughly nine million sidelined working-age american men to take jobs.
the immigration controls would be a boon for american taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.

how that happened is one for the ages: all of a sudden, when she opposed pelosi, a letter she wrote seeking a lenient sentence for a cleveland-area disgraced former judge convicted of beating his wife resurfaced. the timing could not have been better for pelosi: that same judge had just been arrested on suspicion of brutally stabbing his wife to death after release from prison on the domestic violence charges for which fudge sought a more lenient sentence for him. the judge has since been formally charged with his wife's murder, and pled not guilty, and fudge's nascent bid for the speakership ended before it even took off. she dropped out of the running, took a token subcommittee chairmanship, and then endorsed pelosi for speaker.

so you could have a runoff between these two candidates, neither of whom obviously represents one of the major standing french political parties of the center-right or the center-left. i think that is the kind of scenario – a proto-communist, basically, versus marine le pen – where she could win. in any event, no matter who the last two are, i think that things are so volatile in france and across the european union that while i still think it's unlikely le pen would win in the final round, i don't think you can discount that yet, said bolton.

finally, looming over all pro-american countries—and, in fact, over just about every country in the world—is the threat of china. china, of course, is a human rights-violator second to none: even if we put its maoist mass-murderous past aside, today, we see that it is defiantly anti-democratic; it routinely suppresses christians, as well as tibetans and other minorities and dissidents, including the falun gong. indeed, it's reliably reported to have preemptively locked up as many as one million muslims, without even the pretense of a legal trial.

combine that with what they want to do with open borders, sanctuary cities, and defunding the police, perdue said. explain to me how that makes our cities safer. if you want to see what georgia would look like, and you've said this before, under a democratic regime in washington, just go to california. look at the anarchy in the streets of portland, oregon, today. atlanta is now tied with chicago as the murder capital of the world on a per capita basis. this is not something democrats will own up to, that they do not want to talk about, so he is pandering to that latino community and my question is the same thing i would ask the african american community: what have they done for you lately? president [donald] trump has just passed tremendous things that help both communities. we passed opportunity zones, which brings millions of dollars into these economically challenged areas in both the latino and the african american communities. we've funded hbcus, our historically black colleges and universities, and we passed a criminal justice reform act that we've been trying to do forever to correct the joe biden bill from 1994. the latino community is smarter than these democrats think. we did very well with them in the general election and we're going to do well with them on tuesday. we've just got to get all republican voters out on tuesday. it is absolutely essential that every person who's concerned about the future of america must hold the line here.

castro: i don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. and we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. so no, i don't agree with that. the other thing i'll say margaret, and this is very important is, i hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. and actually, the exact opposite happened. and so he's failed. he's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. and it's just a failure of leadership all around. i would end this kind of family detention. i would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.

that's a total of 23 words, if you're counting. twenty-three words that leave you more confused when you get to the end of them than when you started. is tillerson trying to talk tough? or is he refusing to give north korea the attention he thinks they're trying to grab in advance of the us-china meeting? somewhere in between? neither? both? the statement reads, to channel winston churchill, like a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. it's ernest hemingway but for complicated and delicate matters of foreign policy. it's, in a (hyphenated) word, a head-scratcher.

when iran's revolutionary guards seized two american naval craft in the gulf on tuesday evening [january 13, 2016], with ten american sailors on board, it was not the sailors who were the important point, but the fact that the revolutionary guards effectively kidnapped u.s. president barack obama [himself only] a few hours before he was to deliver his final state of the union address, towards the end of his second term in office.

we are witnessing something truly extraordinary. in merely 19 days, a gofundme campaign to raise private contributions to build sections of the wall along the mexico border has raised an astonishing $19.0 million. it will soon be the most successful gofundme campaign ever—the current record holder is the time's up legal defense fund for victims of sexual assault, which raised $22 million in 2018 over a much longer period of time. the campaign to build the wall should blow past that number in a few days.
the reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, i paid $15 an hour and within a month if i could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. if i hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. now, the average wage in los angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. they can't go lower than the minimum wage. and much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.
