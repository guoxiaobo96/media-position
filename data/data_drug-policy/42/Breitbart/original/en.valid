half of the blue-collar migrants who openly crossed the southern border between 2014 and 2019 remain in the united states, according to march 2020 data posted by the department of homeland security.\n\nagents registered 3.5 million arrivals and sent 1.8 million back home via deportations and repatriations by march 2020, said the december 31 report. the report did not include data about the additional migrants who successfully sneaked through the border.\n\nbut 280,000 of the 3.5 million were provided relief, so allowing them to stay in the united states and eventually get green cards.\n\nthat means one in 12 blue-collar migrants get the colossal prize of u.s. residency and citizenship for themselves and all of their descendants — in exchange for surviving the u.s. government's semi-formal obstacle course of cartels and coyotes, distance and bribes, judges and lawyers, deserts, walls, and border agents.\n\nmoreover, another 1.4 million blue-collar migrants are still living in the united states, mostly while they are waiting for a final court decision, said the report, titled fiscal year 2020 enforcement lifecycle report.\n\nmany of those 1.4 million not-deported migrants take jobs from u.s. employers. the imported labor reduces the marketplace pressure on employers to compete for american workers with offers of higher wages, better working conditions, and more investment in labor-saving machinery.\n\namid enthusiastic sympathy from white-collar progressives, the migrants hold down americans' blue-collar wages while also nudging up rents, and they crowd into the k-12 schools needed by the children of blue-collar americans.\n\ncitizenship is the first prize in the migration obstacle course, said mark krikorian, director of the center for immigration studies. but, he added, everybody who gets in wins something. he continued:\n\nif you get in, and can live and work here for a while — even if you ultimately lose, and even if you're taken into custody and sent home — you've still gotten a year or two or three years of ability to live in the united states, to work here, and to establish the connections and networks that lead to future migration.\n\nonly the migrants who get sent home immediately don't get anything, he said:\n\nsome people lose if they mortgaged their little farm or home to pay the smuggler and are turned around immediately (before they can get a u.s. job to repay the loan), or if they're victimized during the trip. that's a real loss. no question about it, a real cost.\n\nmost white-collar migrants arrive via the visa worker obstacle course. they include the roughly one million h-1b workers and spouses used by silicon valley companies and other firms, the j-1 workers at universities and healthcare chains, and the opt workers used in the outsourced software sweatshops at the bottom of the fortune 500's labor pyramid.\n\nthe dhs data shows that 1.8 million southern border migrants were repatriated from 2014 to march 2020.\n\nbut the dhs data does not show how many of those deported migrants were deported on arrival without being released into the job market.\n\nimmigration officers sent 840,000 migrants home via expedited processing. another 600,000 were sent home because they had been deported previously — dubbed reinstatement of removal — and 240,000 other arrivals were sent home as returns because they had faced incomplete deportation charges in prior years.\n\nthe data also shows that 300,000 migrants have been given a final order to go home — but have not returned home. that number includes roughly 76,000 people who skipped out on their court hearings. many of those illegals hold jobs in democrat-run sanctuary cities, much to the disadvantage of lower-skilled and younger americans.\n\nthe data shows that 1.1 million migrants remain in the united states while they wait for a final courtroom decision on whether they can stay or must go home.\n\nthe dhs report said:\n\nencounters with these different groups tend to lead to different paths through the enforcement system, both in terms of whether and how quickly encounters are resolved and what resolution is reached: encounters with mexicans tend to lead to repatriations; encounters with central americans tend to remain unresolved; and encounters with nationals from countries other than mexico or the northern triangle tend (on average) to lead to relief. encounters with single adults tend to quickly lead to repatriations, while encounters with fmuas [spouses and children] and non-contiguous uacs [unaccompanied alien children] tend to remain unresolved. encounters with aliens who do not claim a fear of return to their home countries tend to be repatriated, while those who claim fear are more likely to remain in the united states and some eventually get relief.\n\nan appendix to the dhs report shows that 315,000 uacs were accompanied from central america to the border by coyotes from 2013 to 2020. the vast majority were the children of illegal immigrants who had earned enough money in u.s. jobs to hire coyotes to escort their children to u.s. border officers, who then deliver the young migrants to their parents. only about 15,000 of these younger migrants have been sent home, while roughly 90,000 were allowed to stay — even though many were coming to work as child laborers in jobs that would have been held by americans.\n\nthe coyotes and migrants improve their odds when they overwhelm the border system, detention facilities, and courtrooms, the dhs report indicated:\n\nthe detention pattern yielding the greatest share of unresolved cases were encounters initially placed in detention but then released prior to a final enforcement outcome. these partially detained encounters resulted in repatriations just 3 percent of the time and relief just 12 percent of the time, with 85 percent still unresolved, including 18 percent with unexecuted removal orders (14 percent in absentia orders).\n\nthat coyotes' strategy was recently aided by three california judges who directed the agencies to reopen the 1997 flores catch-and-release gateway through the border.\n\noverall, the low ratio of total losers to partial or complete winners will encourage the next wave of migrants, said krikorian:\n\nhow could it not, especially once the [joe] biden administration comes and let's even more people in? even if you don't win first prize, the second or third prizes are still pretty good, and with a democratic administration that is going to be more lax in border enforcement, we're practically inviting people to sneak across the border.\n\npresident-elect joe biden says his border policies will emphasize the need for family reunification. his policy may help more illegal migrants get into the united states by pleading a need to join their spouses, parents, uncles, or aunts.
traumatised by its nazi past, post-war germany has carefully relegated right-wing populist movements to the fringes of politics, but the anti-migrant afd may have muscled its way in from the cold.\n\nwith discontent growing in germany over chancellor angela merkel's liberal refugee policy, the populist alternative for germany (afd) on sunday captured seats in the regional parliaments of baden-wuerttemberg, rhineland palatinate and saxony-anhalt.\n\nit garnered as many as close to one in four votes in saxony-anhalt while in the other two states, support reached between 12.5 and 15 percent, projections based on partial results showed.\n\nandreas roedder, contemporary history professor at mainz university, told afp that due to the migrant crisis, we are seeing a normalisation of right-wing populist movements in germany just like elsewhere in europe, even if here, it takes on a special form because we can't ignore germany's past.\n\nthis is not the first time that germany has experienced such a surge in populism since 1945. neither is it the first time that such right-wing parties have been able to capture seats in regional parliaments.\n\nin the 1960s, the npd, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s the republikaner — a splinter party from the csu, the bavarian sister party of merkel's christian democratic union (cdu) — both managed to send deputies to regional parliaments.\n\nbut each time, they have proved to be no more than passing fads.\n\nthe christian conservative alliance of the cdu and csu has thus far been able to occupy the right of the political spectrum, preventing any party from having any lasting claim further right.\n\nthat has until now made german politics unique, compared to austria, switzerland or france, where far-right parties have traditionally had a stronger presence in the political arena.\n\nmuch of the reason boils down to war guilt that has made germans determined to never give the so-called brown shirts a chance to rule the nation again.\n\n– 'shame for germany' –\n\nbut afd has arrived on the political scene at a fortuitous moment.\n\nafter a record 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in germany in 2015 alone, many germans are unsettled by what this sudden surge in newcomers mean for their homeland — a fear that afd has capitalised on.\n\nfirst founded in 2013 on an anti-euro platform, it found its first supporters through its claims to defend germans against free-spending southern eu nations.\n\nsince then it has morphed into a party that has even suggested that police may have to shoot at migrants to stop them from entering the country.\n\nwhile its first successes were concentrated in the former communist east, which has been lagging the west in terms of jobs and opportunities, it is now gaining ground also in prosperous western states.\n\nafd has become a national german party, said the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung.\n\nopinion polls suggest that afd might even capture seats in the lower house of parliament in elections in 2017 in what would be an unprecedented success for such a movement.\n\nfinance minister wolfgang schaeuble, known for being a straight-talker, simply described afd as a shame for germany.\n\nuntil now, right-wing populist or extreme-right parties are considered taboo, considered like aliens in the political sphere, said german political analyst wolfgang merkel in a interview with tagesspiegel daily.\n\nmainstream parties have stridently refused any sort of television debate with afd members.\n\nbut the analyst believes that the taboo surrounding such right-wing populism could be soon shattered.\n\nin which case, we would have to live with afd like france does with the national front and switzerland with the svp (swiss people's party), and be confronted daily with xenophobia in political discourse, he said.\n\nsome believe that the chancellor herself is to blame for pushing a middle ground politics that tries to be all things to all people. although her strategy has led her party to win over some from the centre-left social democrats, it has left its right flank exposed.\n\nwith the 'social democratisation' and therefore a shift left of the cdu under the chancellor's mandate, it's more difficult for the christian democrats to cover all bases on the right, said bernhard wessels, political analyst at berlin's humboldt university.\n\ndie welt daily went as far as to say that afd is merkel's child because the cdu has ditched its identity.
in a wednesday op-ed, the los angeles times called for the initiation of wide scale de-trumpification and the shunning of exiting trump administration officials who are described as arsonists fleeing a wreckage they've made.\n\nthe essay, penned by university of california-irvine law professor and former u.n. special rapporteur on free speech david kaye, questions how trump administration officials and appointees, including the shameless liars, the sycophants and the cynical enablers in congress who knowingly sacrificed their reputations to support this president are to be held accountable after the end of president trump's term later this month.\n\nthough exiting political appointees have traditionally landed at prestigious institutions, with some becoming experts in the media, keynote conference speakers, memoirists with book deals, and others running for office or working for the public interest, these should not necessarily be available to former officials of the trump administration, according to kaye.\n\nnot so fast, the essay declares. elite institutions unthinkingly opening their doors to this crew will facilitate exactly what we must avoid: normalizing the trump years and evading a reckoning for trumpism.\n\nkaye then accuses departing trump administration officials as a group, without providing evidence, of having participated in undermining the democratic process, perpetuated lies from podiums, attacked the press, corrupted our foreign policy and intelligence agencies, damaged government departments devoted to the environment and education and much more.\n\nby doing all this, trump officials should forfeit the normally automatic benefits that come from a stint in government, he adds.\n\ncommending only a few who maintained their independence and spoke truth to power inside and out of government, the rest of the trump administration officials are to be met with skepticism about the value [they] bring to any mainstream institution.\n\nlaw firms, for example, should scrutinize trump lawyers carefully as they return to private practice, and corporate boards should just say no.\n\nin addition, the essay calls for journalists and their editors to think hard about how they integrate the voices of trump officials in their stories and to indicate their trump affiliation and role clearly when being quoted.\n\nlastly, kaye calls for a meaningful and high-profile process of public accounting for trump administration actions that overstepped the law.\n\nin the concluding paragraph, kaye seeks to ensure the reader that his propositions are not primitive, though they may appear to be so.\n\nshunning may sound primitive, but it is not, he writes. it can be a way to reinforce democratic values.\n\nthe essay is part of a host of calls on the left to shun conservative voices and at a time of unprecedented purges of such voices on various social media platforms.\n\nlast thursday, a forbes magazine op-ed warned companies about hiring fabulists from the trump administration.\n\nlet it be known to the business world: hire any of trump's fellow fabulists above, and forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie, forbes magazine's chief content officer, randall lane, wrote.\n\nalso last week, the anti-trump lincoln project announced that it was building a database of trump officials and staffers with the intention of holding them professionally accountable for supporting the president.\n\nat @projectlincoln we are constructing a database of trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the trump administration & track where they are now. no personal info, only professional. but they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved https://t.co/dkpxpawawb — stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) january 9, 2021\n\nlast month, a washington post essay encouraged the media to shun republicans who questioned the election results.\n\nthe essay itself admitted promoting a radical approach yet stood by it as the only way to safely proceed with live interviews with republicans who may be carrying a dangerous conspiracy theory that spreads on air.\n\nalso last month, the washington post published an essay comparing denying election results to denying the holocaust and using that as a pretext to silence opposing voices.\n\nwe would not allow a holocaust denier to speak on evening news programs or have free rein on social media, the essay's authors write unequivocally. old and new media alike should no longer give a platform to these dissimulations, starting with trump's.\n\nfollow joshua klein on twitter @joshuaklein.
secretary of state mike pompeo's speech monday at the heritage foundation marked a pivotal moment in u.s. foreign policy.\n\npompeo made several important arguments in the course of his half hour address, in which he set out president donald trump's policy regarding iran in the wake of his may 8 announcement that he is abandoning barack obama's 2015 nuclear deal with iran.\n\nthe key line in his speech was, inarguably, as president trump said two weeks ago, he is ready, willing and able to negotiate a new deal [with iran]. but the deal is not the objective. our goal is to protect the american people.\n\nthe basic insight that there is no intrinsic value to any agreement – or foreign policy initiative of any sort – that does not advance the interests of the united states or protect the american people is striking, because it has been absent from american foreign policy in relation to rogue regimes and entities for better part of the last generation.\n\nin 1994, when then president bill clinton sought to contend with north korea's illicit nuclear program, the first fantasist president, jimmy carter, turned up in pyongyang to see if there was a deal to be had.\n\nas claudia rosett has noted, north korea was on the ropes back then. its patron, the soviet union, had collapsed three years earlier, and its cash flow had dried up. china was still too poor to pick up the slack, as it had just undergone its first succession. famine was killing north koreans by the tens of thousands.\n\nand it had just been caught, red handed, violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, of which it was a signatory, and developing plutonium-based nuclear weapons at its yangbyon nuclear reactor.\n\nif clinton had confronted the north koreans for their duplicity and malign behavior towards the region and towards their own subjects, he stood a decent chance of bringing an end to the regime.\n\ninstead, following carter's odd intervention, clinton decided to hand the stalinist hermit gulag state a new lease on life. he sent wendy sherman, his special advisor for north korea, to negotiate what became known as the agreed framework.\n\nin exchange for padlocking — but preserving — their plutonium reactor at yangbyon, the north koreans received internationally financed light water reactors and some $4.5 billion in fuel and food aid. the regime was saved, empowered and legitimized.\n\nand north korea's regime wasted no time in cheating on the nuclear deal — developing intercontinental ballistic missiles; testing them; proliferating their missile and nuclear technologies and know-how to iran and syria; and building a nuclear arsenal that now threatens the u.s. and its allies.\n\nbut clinton was happy. he had a deal. he was a statesman. and no matter how much proof surfaced of north korea's continued nuclear activity, he and his advisors — and, later, his successors george w. bush and obama — were unwilling to do a thing about it. the notion that it was possible to cut a deal with north korea was more important than the substance of the deal. the fact that the regime's policies endangered the american people – not to mention all u.s. allies in asia and beyond — was beside the point.\n\nthe point was the deal.\n\nthe same was the case with the palestinians. as clinton, bush and obama all saw it, the only salient question regarding the palestinians was whether or not israel was willing to cut a deal with the palestine liberation organization (plo). they considered plo sponsorship and incitement of terror a mere distraction. the plo's partnership with hamas was said to be a passing phase. plo corruption and embezzlement of billions of dollars in u.s. and international aid dollars was just an irritant.\n\nthe only thing three successive administrations concerned themselves with regarding the palestinians generally, and the plo specifically, was whether or not they would say from time to time that they were willing to cut a deal – any deal – with israel.\n\nas far as all three administrations were concerned, the possibility of mediating a deal — the deal — between israel and the plo was the only u.s. middle east policy that mattered. everything else was secondary. the situation reached a level of absurdity where every issue was viewed as contingent on israel agreeing to make a deal with the palestinians.\n\nfor instance, in 2006, then-president bush appointed former secretary of state james baker and former congressman lee hamilton to present him with a strategy for dealing with the insurgency in iraq. the two men said that the u.s. could safely withdraw its forces from iraq if it did so while forcing israel to cut a deal with the plo.\n\nwhy iran or syria or their terror proxies in al qaeda, hezbollah, and other militias would stand down if israel gave jerusalem to plo chief mahmoud abbas was never explained.\n\nit was never explained because as everyone who was anyone in washington agreed, u.s. foreign policy in the middle east wasn't about securing the american people per se. it was about cutting a deal.\n\nthis, then, brings us to the so-called joint comprehensive plan of action (jcpoa), better known as the iran nuclear deal, which wendy sherman also negotiated. as she did in 1994 with the north koreans, sherman negotiated a deal based on the notion that it didn't matter what the deal said, but rather only that it was concluded.\n\nu.s. foreign policy officials from the clinton administration on down repeatedly argued that merely signing a deal would create a positive dynamic that would encourage rogue regimes – whether in pyongyang or ramallah or tehran – to change their behavior and assessment of washington and its allies.\n\nthe fact that this assumption has never been borne out by events — and indeed, has been repeatedly contradicted and proven wrong by events — never made an impression on the foreign policy experts who clung to the notion that process is more important than substance.\n\nin this context, the trump doctrine is brilliant in its simplicity and straightforwardness.\n\nthe trump doctrine involves a simple concept: u.s. foreign policy must be grounded in reality rather than fantasy, and its aim is to achieve the only goal that matters: securing and enhancing the security of the american people.\n\nit is a testament to president trump's iconoclasm and common sense that he has embraced reality after so many years of fantasy presidencies.\n\nbut his decision to prefer reality over theory is also borne of necessity. the bill has come due on his predecessors' unhinged deals.\n\nas president trump has noted repeatedly, the u.s. reached the end of the road with north korea. after pyongyang tested intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the mainland of the u.s. last summer, it was clear there was nowhere to kick the can anymore.\n\nwith iran using the status and wealth it received from obama's nuclear deal to realize its imperialist aspirations in the middle east, while actively engaging in armed attacks against israel and saudi arabia, maintaining faith with the nuclear deal that enabled iran to bring the region to the brink of a massive war was no longer an option.\n\nas for the plo and israel, the jig finally is up on that fairytale as well. with its 83-year-old, corrupt, virulently antisemitic, anti-american, terror-supporting leader mahmoud abbas on the verge of death, the palestinian authority is about to decompose altogether or transform into something else. and whatever may happen there, it is now inarguable that the terror group is a bit player, not a power broker.\n\nno regional issue of concern to the u.s. will be ameliorated by appeasing the plo.\n\nas for israel, due to the wreckage of weakened arab allies on the one hand, and empowered enemies left by trump's predecessors on the other, the trump administration cannot follow the old practice of treating israel like a problem. the now-undeniable fact is that when israel strikes iranian installations in syria and iran's proxies in gaza, it is stabilizing the region, not destabilizing the region.\n\nanother undeniable fact is that israel is america's most powerful and trustworthy ally in the middle east. to the extent a deal between the plo and israel weakens israel – and every deal that has been presented over the past 25 years, like the phony peace process itself, has weakened israel – u.s. interests are harmed.\n\nmany commentators have interpreted pompeo's list of twelve specific demands from iran as an opening bid for future negotiations with tehran.\n\nbut his own statements indicate that this is not the case. pompeo rightly explained that all of his demands — from iran ending and dismantling its nuclear program and ballistic missiles program, to ending its sponsorship of terror groups; from withdrawing its forces from syria, to releasing all u.s. and foreign hostages it holds — are basic demands.\n\nthere are so many demands, pompeo explained, because at a fundamental level, iran is breaching the most basic norms of international behavior. every single activity he demanded that iran halt is an activity that undermines not only regional security, but also u.s. national security. as such, compelling iranian compliance with the trump administration's demands is vital to the security of the american people.\n\nthe media echo chamber has made much of the fact that the north korean regime is now making noises to the effect that it is unwilling to make a deal with the trump administration. insults against national security advisor john bolton in the north korean media are pointed to as proof that trump's america first foreign policy is undermining efforts to secure a deal with north korea.\n\nthese commentaries miss the point. as pompeo and trump himself have explained, american foreign policy is no longer driven by a slavish devotion to wendy sherman-esque deals with enemies of america.\n\namerican foreign policy is now about making americans safe in the real world.\n\nand, thanks to the slavish devotion of the previous three administrations to agreements-at-all-cost, achieving the goal of protecting americans has become urgent, dire, and no job for showboaters who want to be loved by europe and msnbc.\n\ncaroline glick is a world-renowned

leader of the conservative austrian people's party (övp) sebastian kurz has announced a coalition agreement with the green party that will see several green policies but no changes to migration policy.\n\nmr kurz, along with green party leader werner kogler presented their new government programme at a joint press conference on thursday, with kurz claiming the new government would be the best of both worlds and that its priorities would be tax reform and fighting illegal immigration, kronen zeitung reports.\n\nthe övp leader added that both parties had also agreed to ban the islamic headscarf for children under the age of 14 and would be expanding programmes to teach new migrants the german language and put more emphasis on getting asylum seekers into the labour force.\n\nkurz has been critical of migration policies within the european union since forming the previous government with the populist freedom party.\n\naustria's sebastian kurz warns of new migrant wave 'brewing' https://t.co/psxwazyfhp — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) september 25, 2019\n\nin 2018, he went as far as confronting german chancellor angela merkel on the issue, disagreeing on her proposal to link eu funds to migration quotas.\n\ngreen leader kogler, meanwhile, stressed the importance for austria to combat climate change and said that the pricing of co2 will be implemented into what he called a greening of the tax system. he also proposed a nation-wide public transit ticket that would cost around three euros per day.\n\nthe two-party leaders then met with leftist austrian president alexander van der bellen, a former member of the green party, with kogler telling the austrian press that the entire programme for the new coalition was still being worked on.\n\nthe greens are expected to occupy four ministerial posts including the environmental ministry and the justice ministry, with the party demanding at least half of the ministers be female.\n\nthe successful government deal comes after kurz was able to score a resounding victory in the austrian national election in september of last year.
senator roy blunt (r-mo), chairman of the senate republican policy committee, said sunday on cbs's face the nation that removing trump from office with impeachment is clearly is not going to happen.\n\ndiscussing the riots, anchor margaret brennan said, are republican leaders going to hold him accountable in any way for it?\n\nblunt said, i think the country is is the right to hold presidents accountable. the president should be very careful over the next 10 days is that his behavior is what you would expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world. my personal view is that the president touched the hot stove on wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again.\n\nhe continued, i did, the day senator hawley announced he would be contesting those electoral votes, announced that i would not be. when senator cruz said he had a plan to put back in place a commission like the one formed in 1877, i said that wouldn't happen. i wasn't interested then or now in spending a lot of time on things that can't happen just like the impeachment of the president to remove him from office clearly is not going to happen between now and the last day he is in office.\n\nhe added, as nancy pelosi just said and jim clyburn said earlier today, this is more about a long-term punishment of the president than trying to remove him from office.\n\nfollow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen
six gop senators briefed jared kushner and president donald trump's top congressional aide about a plan to swap two amnesties in exchange for border-wall funding.\n\nthe briefing shows the gop leaders' contempt for trump's immigration-reform campaign promise, said rosemary jenks, policy director at numbersusa. there is no talk in this about asylum reform, tvpra, detention spaces or sanctuary cities, or any of the enforcement needs — it is about amnesty and cheap labor, and that is exactly what candidate tump campaigned against.\n\nthe proposed amnesties-for-wall swap appeared wednesday as trump pressured democrats to reciprocate his compromises on the day after his successful prime-time address to the nation. on thursday, trump will visit the border to call for wall funding.\n\nthe senators' draft offer to the democrats, however, also includes incentives sought by gop-aligned business groups, such as an expansion of the h-2b blue collar visa-worker program.\n\nfew democrats support the h-2b visa program but its inclusion could encourage gop legislators to ignore protests from the gop's pro-american base. several gop senators in the group also support a daca amnesty because it would add more imported workers and consumers to their local markets.\n\ncnn reported:\n\ngop senators privately gathered in sen. lindsey graham's office wednesday to discuss a way out of the logjam. the long-shot idea: propose an immigration deal that would include $5.7 billion for trump's border wall along with several provisions that could entice democrats. those items include changes to help those who are a part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program as well as immigrants from el salvador and other countries impacted by the temporary protected status program – along with modifications to h-2b visas.\n\nthe daca work-permit program for roughly 800,000 younger illegals was created by former president barack obama in 2012 but is likely to be declared unlawful this year by the supreme court. trump is rolling back the tps program, which grants temporary sanctuary and work permits to more than 300,000 visitors from countries hit by disasters. the tps grants were repeatedly extended by former presidents obama and george w. bush, even after the countries recovered from their disasters.\n\ncnn continued:\n\ngop senators pitched the idea to senior white house adviser jared kushner, who said if they came up with a proposal that got trump his border wall money and could pass the senate, the white house would be open to more discussions on the matter, the source said. he did not say trump would endorse such a plan.\n\nhowever, other media outlets did not corroborate cnn's claim that kushner said trump would endorse amnesties and cheap-labor wage-cuts in exchange for a wall.\n\nthe hill reported:\n\ngraham said that under a potential deal the president gets his security funding and can add some things to the mix that would draw some bipartisan support.\n\n… graham summarized the framework as the wall plus something else that he hopes would garner some democratic support.\n\nthe six gop senators included graham, north carolina's thom tillis, tennessee's lamar alexander, ohio's rob portman, alaska's lisa murkowski, and maine's susan collins.\n\nkushner was accompanied by shahira knight, the former banker who now runs trump's outreach to the hill. in august, knight declined to oppose a series of unpopular pro-migration and cheap-labor amendments added to to the draft 2019 homeland security budget by rep. kevin yoder. those giveaway measures were paired with a $5 billion budget for the wall but were blocked when yoder lost his seat in november.\n\nkushner meets with moderate gop senators

boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. that flood of outside labor spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nthe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nimmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor u.s. latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as berkeley and oakland.

dubai, united arab emirates (ap) — netflix faced criticism on wednesday for pulling an episode in saudi arabia of comedian hasan minhaj's patriot act that criticized the kingdom's powerful crown prince.\n\nthe american comedian used his second episode, released on oct. 28, to lambaste crown prince mohammed bin salman over the killing of writer jamal khashoggi and the saudi-led coalition at war in yemen.\n\nminhaj said the crown prince was being hailed as the reformer the arab world needed until khashoggi's killing.\n\nbut the revelations about khashoggi's killing have shattered that image and it blows my mind that it took the killing of a washington post journalist for everyone to go: 'oh i guess he's not really a reformer,' he added. khashoggi wrote critically of the crown prince in columns for the newspaper.\n\nkhashoggi was killed and dismembered by saudi agents inside the saudi consulate in istanbul last year. the u.s. senate has said it believes the crown prince is responsible for the grisly killing, despite insistence by the kingdom that he had no knowledge of the operation.\n\nin the roughly 18-minute monologue, minhaj also mentions the ruling al saud family and its vast wealth, saying: saudi arabia is crazy. one giant family controls everything.\n\nthe saudi-led coalition's airstrikes in yemen have also come under intense scrutiny since khashoggi's killing. the war, which began in march 2015, has killed thousands of civilians and pushed millions to the brink of famine.\n\nthe financial times first reported that netflix yanked the episode from streaming in saudi arabia last week after the government's communications and information technology commission informed the internet streaming service that its content violated cyber-crime laws in the kingdom. the ft says the episode can still be seen on youtube in saudi arabia.\n\nnetflix told the ft it strongly supports artistic freedom worldwide and only removed the episode after it received a legal request and to comply with local law.\n\nofficials at the communications and information technology commission could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nrights group amnesty international said saudi arabia's censorship of netflix is further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression.\n\nby bowing to the saudi arabian authorities' demands, netflix is in danger of facilitating the kingdom's zero-tolerance policy on freedom of expression and assisting the authorities in denying people's right to freely access information, said samah hadid at amnesty international.\n\nnetflix did not immediately respond to an associated press request for comment.\n\nthe saudi cyber-crime law states that production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine, according to rights group amnesty international.\n\nsaudi prosecutors have used the broadly worded law to imprison rights activists, poets and others who've expressed views deemed critical of the government or its policies on social media.\n\nsince prince mohammed was named heir to the throne in mid-2017, dozens of writers, activists and moderate clerics have been jailed.\n\namong those detained since may of last year are women's rights activists who had long pushed for more freedoms, including the right to drive before it became legal in june. several people with knowledge of their arrest have told the associated press that some of the women detained have been subjected to caning, electrocution and others were also sexually assaulted.
a poll of united states service members and veterans finds that only 39 percent approve of transgender individuals serving in the military.\n\nwhen the sex of the respondent is a factor, the poll – which surveyed the views of 1,031 service members and veterans – shows that 37 percent of male members approve of transgender troops, while 62 percent of females approve.\n\nonly 32 percent of the greatest generation (world war ii) approve of transgender troops, while 39 percent of baby boomers, 42 percent of generation x, and 55 percent of millennials approve.\n\npresident donald trump continued the decades-long policy that bans transgender individuals from military service, but legal challenges to it continue. on friday, however, federal appellate judges in washington, d.c. vacated one injunction that had blocked the policy, though it continues to be blocked by other courts. the supreme court is considering whether it will review the policy.\n\nin response to a statement about having experienced gender or gender identity discrimination in the military, only 11 percent of survey respondents answered yes.\n\nwith sex as a factor, only six percent of male service members say they have experienced gender discrimination, while 68 percent of female members say the same.\n\nsimilarly, 11 percent of participants say they have personally experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment in the military.\n\nof the males, only six percent say they have been sexually assaulted or harassed, while 66 percent of females claim the same.\n\nwhen asked if they had witnessed another member of the service being sexually harassed or assaulted during their military service, 19 percent of those surveyed said yes.\n\nof the male participants, 17 percent said they had witnessed sexual assault or harassment, while 42 percent of the females said the same.\n\nthe survey was conducted by smithsonian in conjunction with both stars and stripes– a publication of the defense department – and the schar school at george mason university.\n\noverall, the poll's margin of error was plus or minus three percent.
the coronavirus outbreak continues to grow. on wednesday, 201 u.s. citizens who were evacuated from wuhan, china, arrived in the united states and were transported to the march air reserve base in california, where they are being informally quarantined and monitored for a three-day period.\n\nbut there's a crucial group of people who are not being quarantined and monitored—the thousands of chinese nationals sneaking into the united states from mexico.\n\nin december, eleven chinese migrants were caught illegally crossing the border in a rental truck carrying furniture from tijuana to san diego. a month earlier, six chinese migrants had been caught sneaking into the country at the same port of entry using a moving truck. these cases were not isolated instances. they are part of a problem that has been growing for the past two years.\n\nand it's not a problem that's limited to the border regions of california. illegal entries by chinese nationals are on the rise all across the mexican border.\n\nfor example, look at the rio grande valley (rgv) sector, which is the section of border in texas abutting the gulf of mexico. in fy 2019, the number of chinese migrants caught at the southern border in the rgv sector increased 85%, from approximately 700 to over 1,300.\n\nalthough figures for the entire border haven't been made public, it is likely that the number of chinese nationals apprehended at the mexican border is well over 4,000. and, for every illegal alien who is caught at the border, there are at least three who make it in without getting caught.\n\nthat means that, estimating conservatively, more than 12,000 chinese nationals entered the country illegally across the southern border in fy 2019. and none of them were screened for infectious diseases. this year a similar number are sneaking into the united states—coming from the country that is the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nat times like this, it is imperative that the process of immigration be orderly and controlled. a secure border is essential in our defense against not only crime and terrorism, but also against pandemics.\n\nif congress had given the president all of the money for border wall construction that he needed back in 2017, the united states would be in a much better position to address this crisis. the 450 miles of wall that are now in the stages of planning and early construction would already be completed. and it would be much more difficult to enter the united states illegally.\n\nand that means greater security during times of pandemic. the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the united states will undoubtedly grow from the six known cases—in california, arizona, washington state, and illinois. but worthy of note is the case in reynosa, mexico, right next to the u.s. border. the international border next to reynosa is wide open. and so is our vulnerability to the coronavirus being carried across it.\n\nkris w. kobach served as the secretary of state of kansas during 2011-2019. an expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the arizona sb-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the 10 ice agents who sued to stop obama's 2012 daca executive amnesty. he currently serves as general counsel for we build the wall and is a candidate for the u.s. senate. his website is www.kriskobach.com.
border patrol agents in the laredo sector discovered 36 illegal immigrants packed into a tiny stash house while assisting officers from the laredo police department on monday.\n\nspecial agents from u.s. immigration and customs enforcement's homeland security investigations division contacted the laredo station about suspicious activity in a house located near slaughter park. the park is a known location for smuggling humans and drugs across the border. the agents went to check out the house with the help of the local police department, according to laredo border patrol officials.\n\nafter making entry into the house, the agents found 36 illegal immigrants stashed inside. the migrants came to the u.s. from guatemala, mexico, el salvador, and honduras, officials stated.\n\nthe partnerships in laredo between the united states border patrol, homeland security investigations, and the laredo police department continue to show results in disrupting criminal organizations from operating in south texas. we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to prosecute those responsible and prevent individuals from being subjected to deplorable conditions, laredo sector assistant chief patrol agent gabriel acosta said in a written statement.\n\nhomeland security investigations is leading the investigation into the possible human trafficking charges that could be filed.\n\nthe migrants are now subject to prosecution in criminal court for illegally entering the u.s. according to a zero tolerance policy put in place by u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on monday.\n\nthe attorney general said his department will refer anyone who enters the united states illegally for prosecution, breitbart news reported.\n\nand the department of justice will take up as many of those cases as humanly possible until we get to 100 percent, sessions said as part of a speech at a law enforcement conference in arizona.
a handful of republican and democrat lawmakers are continuing to tout a plan that gives amnesty to nearly a million illegal aliens in exchange for some amount of funding for president trump's proposed border wall along the u.s.-mexico border.\n\nrep. mark meadows (r-nc), as well as sen. lindsey graham (r-sc), and democrats such as rep. jackie speier (d-ca) and debbie dingell (d-mi) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.\n\nin an interview with yahoo news, meadows said he has had multiple conversations with graham about a daca amnesty-for-wall funding deal:\n\ncompromise and finding common ground are not void from the conversations that he and i have had, as well as some of the conversations i've had with some of my democratic colleagues, meadows said. [emphasis added] though the freedom caucus has previously opposed extending protections from deportation for the children of undocumented immigrants, meadows suggested he would be open to a deal to preserve such concessions in exchange for wall funding. [emphasis added]\n\ngraham has touted an amnesty for daca illegal aliens for months as part of a deal on funding at least a portion of trump's proposed wall.\n\ncoincidentally, the daca amnesty deal is supported by the billionaire donor class that delivers campaign funds every election cycle to republicans and democrats who support the country's mass illegal and legal immigration policy of importing about 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign workers every year to compete against america's working and middle class.\n\nas breitbart news most recently reported, the billionaire koch brothers and their network of organizations have made passing an amnesty for daca illegal aliens their goal for the new year.\n\nsimilarly, billionaire facebook ceo mark zuckerberg's cheap labor lobbying group fwd.us is asking republicans, democrats, and the trump administration to reach a deal whereby daca illegal aliens are allowed to permanently remain in the u.s.\n\nthe organization, founded and funded by silicon valley's tech plutocrats, has been demanding an amnesty for daca illegal aliens since at least 2017.\n\nso here is what ⁦@fwdus⁩ would like to see happen with the incoming congress, this harmful shutdown and urgently needed immigration policy changes… pic.twitter.com/zffgeppvbg — todd schulte (@thetoddschulte) january 3, 2019\n\non fox news, operated by billionaire rupert murdoch, a deal wherby daca illegal aliens are given amnesty in exchange for some border wall funding has been floated repeatedly. last week, a fox news host touted such a plan with white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney.\n\nbut let me ask this, we're talking about money, $5 billion $1.5 billion, $2.7 billion, the host said. why aren't there other things on the table? daca for example, is that being negotiated?\n\nmulvaney said that while the money for a border wall is being negotiated, other changes to the country's immigration system are being discussed as well, though he did not specifically cite the daca program as one of those changes.\n\nany form of amnesty coupled with funds to build a wall along the southern border would render the barrier almost useless in stopping illegal immigration, breitbart news has noted.\n\nwhile a border wall would take years to build, amnesty for illegal aliens would be nearly immediate, delivering benefits to illegal aliens and foreign nationals first, while americans only see the hope of a border wall down the road.\n\nin terms of legal immigration, a daca amnesty would implement a never-ending flow of foreign relatives to the daca illegal aliens who can be readily sponsored for green cards through the process known as chain migration — a flow of potentially more than 8.5 million legal immigrants.\n\nmeanwhile, a daca amnesty would drag increasing u.s. wages down for the country's working and middle class, delivering benefits to the business lobby while squashing the intended goals of the trump administration ahead of the 2020 presidential election. the plan is also likely to hit the black american community the hardest, as they are forced to compete for blue collar jobs against a growing illegal and legal immigrant population from central america.
thursday on fox news channel's the o'reilly factor, host bill o'reilly offered his takeaways from the terrorist attacks in brussels earlier this week.\n\no'reilly argued much of this could have been prevented if not for european governments' policy decisions on immigration and on policing.\n\nso to repeat, [obama] is not going to use american resources to defeat isis, o'reilly said. second thing we've learned: europe is in chaos. as you know, millions of mostly islamic refugees are pouring into western europe. nobody knows who they are, nobody knows what they're doing. in belgium where the bombers struck this week intelligence agents cannot tap telephones, they cannot look into computers, and police are restrained from raiding private homes from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. and belgium wonders why it is a terror target? the incredible laxity on immigration and the ultra-liberal policing have made europe the easiest target in the world for isis. and believe me if the far left had its way here, we'd be just like belgium.\n\nfollow jeff poor on twitter @jeff_poor
many americans may not know her name, but gary kaltbaum appeared on breitbart news thursday to explain why federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen is the most important woman in our lives.\n\njanet yellen is able to move the purse strings around in ways unimaginable, said kaltbaum. keep in mind, this started with ben bernanke, who decided to go with this grand experiment of zero percent interest rates, and the printing of trillions of dollars, which led to janet yellen.\n\nkaltbaum charged bernanke's money-manipulation policies with causing the housing market bubble and crash, leading in turn to the desperate bank bailouts of 2008. that meant big money for big bankers… and the screwing of the average american.\n\nthat's because average americans find it difficult to earn money through savings in a zero-interest environment.\n\nas breitbart news host stephen k. bannon pointed out, the current fiscal environment punishes people for saving money, and rewards them for piling up huge amounts of debt at low interest rates – precisely the opposite of how we have traditionally been taught to handle our money. the punishment comes from not only failing to reward savers with decent interest on their accounts, but actually reducing the value of the money they have saved over time. not only is the small depositor earning virtually no interest from his savings account, but money-printing federal policies cause the dollars in that account to be worth less when he withdraws them later, like food mysteriously spoiling in a deep-freeze.\n\nthe riskless income investor was taken away and was given to the banks, said kaltbaum. it was gifted to the banks, and that's why the banks have done better over the last few years.\n\nfew politicians see political gain in railing against this state of affairs, including the socialists from the ostensible party of the little guy. the democratic party is not for the middle class and poor, said kaltbaum. they're for the middle class and poor's votes. go look at all their policies. just recently, barack obama is proposing a ten percent tax on oil companies, where everybody knows it's gonna be flushed down into the consumer. who gets hit the worst? the poor and the middle class.\n\nbut nobody says anything, he sighed. this is about currying votes… keep marketing to these people that you're the end-all and be-all. you're going to do this, that, and the other thing for them. but they end up doing nothing for nobody, except themselves, and their own power base.\n\nkaltbaum saw little hope of a popular revolt against these exploitative policies until the masses have been properly educated in economics – an education they will never receive from a mass media with the democrat party's political interests at heart, and a natural tendency to revere big, splashy, centrally-planned solutions to the nation's problems.\n\nin an interconnected global economy, the world's problems become america's problems, too. while the coming financial implosion of china is seen as both a financial and national-security threat by almost every u.s. government agency, kaltbaum said the even worse news is that america's fiscal situation is more troubling than china's.\n\nwe are the country that's $20 trillion in debt, he warned. we are the country that has papered over this with $5 trillion in printed money, and zero percent interest rates. we are the country where taxes, and mandates, and regulations are going up, and government is taking over our life.\n\nit's a combination of china, and europe, and its socialist states and their massive debt, and our country – which has gone from a great, market-based, free market economy into something that is controlled by these big, power-hungry, power-centric maniacs that present a looming crisis for the american taxpayer… which, of course, will also be forced to clean up the wreckage afterward, and pick up the tab for the failures of their political elites.\n\nbannon noted that janet yellen wasn't prepared to say that even a lunatic policy like japan's negative interest rates would be beyond her authority. i've got news for you – even if it's illegal, they'll make it legal anyway, kaltbaum agreed, citing president obama's abuse of executive power as precedent.\n\nanything is possible at this point in time, he concluded. as the markets go lower, we're going to see more acts of desperation, and they're going to try to come up with things that, in our lifetimes, we would never even dream would occur. and i suspect negative interest rates will probably be a part of it.\n\nlisten:
sen. pat roberts (r-ks), chairman of the senate agriculture committee, announced friday he will not seek another term in the u.s. senate.\n\njust in: gop sen. pat roberts of kansas announces he won't seek reelection in 2020. never, never in my wildest dreams did i think i would become the longest-serving member of congress in our state's history pic.twitter.com/soz1bpplbd — tictoc by bloomberg (@tictoc) january 4, 2019\n\nspeaking before reporters in manhattan, kansas, roberts said: i am announcing i will serve the remainder of this term as your senator, fighting for kansas in these troubled times. however, i will not be a candidate in 2020 for a fifth senate term.\n\nnever, never in my wildest dreams did i think i would become the longest-serving member of congress in our state's history, he added.\n\nroberts, 82, maneuvered the 2018 farm bill through congress with support from both parties — a move ultimately embraced by president donald trump as a rare bipartisan success. however, some republican critics argue roberts' work across the aisle resulted in a deeply flawed and costly farm bill that represents a betrayal of conservative values. it's a slap in the face to ronald reagan, said robert rector, senior research fellow at the heritage foundation. it's a victory for a massive welfare state without work requirements and an out-of-control budget.\n\nno one had yet announced a primary challenge against roberts, but conservative activists viewed him as vulnerable from the right. he narrowly survived a primary against tea party candidate milton wolf in 2014. republicans including outgoing gov. jeff colyer (r) and rep. roger marshall (r-ks) are eyeing a race in anticipation that roberts might not run.\n\nin a december opinion-editorial, the kansas city star's editorial board called on roberts to retire and step aside to allow other qualified candidates to seek the office.\n\n[t]he 21st century will demand fresher ideas — not just on farm policy, but on trade, immigration, taxation, spending, defense and other national challenges. roberts isn't the senator who will provide those new ideas, the bluntly stated op-ed read. this isn't a matter of the senator's age, although roberts will be 84 years old in 2020. it's much more about roberts' four decades of service in the house and senate, a long tenure that makes it difficult for him to see things in a different way.\n\nroberts has served as the senior senator from kansas since 1997 and was elected in his home state's first congressional district to the house of representatives in 1980.\n\nsen. lamar alexander (r-tn) announced last month that he will not run for re-election in 2020.\n\nthe associated press contributed to this report.
the director of national intelligence called transnational organized crime a growing threat to the security and health of u.s. citizens. the director said these groups, including mexican drug cartels and ms-13 cliques, contribute to increased social violence and the erosion of governmental authority in many countries.\n\nmexican criminal groups will continue to supply much of the heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana that cross the us-mexico border, while china-based suppliers ship fentanyls and fentanyl precursors to mexico-, canada-, and u.s. based distributors or sell directly to consumers via the internet, daniel r. coats, director of national intelligence (dni) wrote in a worldwide threat assessment report released on tuesday (attached below).\n\nin 2016, the report states that drug overdoses accounted for more deaths than suicide, motor vehicle crashes, and all forms of homicide. the number of drug overdoses skyrocketed during the past two years–doubling in 2016 because of the national opioid epidemic.\n\ntransnational organized criminal groups probably will generate more revenue from illicit activity in the coming year, which the un last estimated at $1.6-$2.2 trillion for 2014, the dni continued.\n\nin addition to drug smuggling, the director also listed the continuing human trafficking enterprises carried out around the world by transnational criminal organizations. the dni estimates that about 25 million people are victimized by human traffickers.\n\nthe dni listed epidemic criminal activity as one of the key political issues for 2016.\n\npresidential elections, including those in mexico and colombia, will occur at a time when support for political parties and governing institutions is at record lows and could bolster the appeal of outsider candidates, the report states.\n\nregarding mexico specifically, the director coats wrote:\n\nmexicans are focused on presidential and legislative elections scheduled for july 2018, in which corruption, high violence, and a tepid economy will be key issues. the mexican government has made slow progress implementing rule-of-law reforms and will continue to rely on the military to lead counternarcotics efforts. mexico's $1.1 trillion economy benefits from strong economic fundamentals, but uncertainty over trade relationships and higher-than-expected inflation could further slow economic growth. president enrique pena nieto is focusing on domestic priorities, including recovery from the september 2017 earthquakes and managing impacts from potential us policy shifts ahead of the elections. in recent years, mexican us-bound migration has been net negative but might increase if economic opportunity at home declined.\n\nbreitbart texas has reported extensively on the unstable political climate created by the mexican drug cartels through its cartel chronicles series. the series utilizes citizen journalists who are willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\n\nthe reports from mexico record the ultra-violent activities of the drug cartels — particularly in the civil war-torn region of tamaulipas, just south of the texas border.\n\ncartel chronicles reported on tuesday about the kidnapping and murder of a federal narcotics agent near cancun.\n\nthe anonymous writer reported:\n\nmexican federal law enforcement sources revealed to breitbart texas that late last week, 27-year-old hugo enrique rafael peña went missing and was discovered hours later–shot multiple times, blindfolded with tape, and hands tied. according to police file 65/2018, authorities found 11 9mm bullet casings at the scene.\n\nbreitbart texas also reports on u.s. prosecutors' efforts to extradite former mexican governors for their alleged roles in narcotics trafficking and public corruption.\n\nbreitbart texas editor-in-chief and managing director, brandon darby, and investigative journalist ildefonso ortiz reported:\n\nformer tamaulipas governor eugenio hernandez flores served from 2005 to 2010 and since 2014, is wanted in the southern district of texas on several money laundering and fraud charges. the case against hernandez stems from an ongoing probe by u.s. homeland security investigations and the u.s. drug enforcement administration. … hernandez and his predecessor, tomas yarrington ruvalcaba, both hail from the same political party and both are wanted by u.s. authorities on similar charges tied to moving cartel bribes and embezzled funds into texas. as breitbart texas reported, yarrington is currently in an italian prison fighting extradition; the disgraced politician is facing additional drug trafficking charges in the u.s. related to los zetas, the gulf, and the beltran leyva cartels.\n\ndirector coats also addressed the massive migration of people from central american and attributed this crisis to gang-related violence, particularly in countries like el salvador, honduras, and guatemala.\n\nthe report concludes:\n\ninsecurity and lack of economic opportunities likely will remain the principal drivers of irregular migration from the northern triangle countries of el salvador, guatemala, and honduras. homicide rates in these countries remain high, and gang-related violence is still prompting central americans to flee.\n\nthe director prepared the worldwide threat assessment report for 2018 in preparation for testimony before the senate intelligence committee on tuesday.\n\nbob price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for breitbart texas. he is a founding member of the breitbart texas team. follow him on twitter @bobpricebbtx, gab, and facebook.\n\nworldwide threat assessment — 2018 — us director of national intelligence by bob price on scribd
a german government ministry has begun an aggressive advertising campaign urging citizens to overcome their dark side and embrace open door mass migration and multiculturalism.\n\ngermany, stay strong! with humanity towards your dark side and against hate & baiting – no ifs or buts read the propaganda billboards.\n\nthe text is written over a german flag dripping with black paint. organisers say they hope to retrieve the flag from right wing and nationalist groups such as the pegida and the eurosceptic alternative for germany (afd), represented on the poster by the encroaching black paint.\n\n'germany, stay strong!' is a call to civil society, to oppose right-wing tendencies and incitement. an appeal to a welcoming culture for people in need – and for a cosmopolitan germany, writes the left wing 'show your face! for a cosmopolitan germany' group on its website.\n\nsix hundred such giant billboard adverts are expected to go up, and 20,000 stickers and 45,000 postcards will be distributed in the campaign, which is backed by germany's ministry for families, seniors, women and youth.\n\npegida and co. abuse the flag of the federal republic, proclaimed uwe-karsten heye, the chairman of the group at the campaign launch. indeed the flag and constitution stand for an open society, the right to asylum and for inviolable human dignity, he claimed.\n\nmerkel removes the german flag angela merkel's disdain for germany, summed up in 9 seconds. posted by raheem kassam on saturday, january 30, 2016\n\ni think it is necessary to give people courage to stand against right-wing extremism and xenophobia, mr. heye added, talking to der tagesspeigel.\n\nthe organisation's manager, sophia oppermann, said that they also wished to encourage left wing and humanitarian groups to use and display the national flag more often.\n\nwe're tired with the right constantly waving the german flag, and all the others have no chance, she said. we are also proud of this country and we stand for the values ​​that have this flag and this country.\n\nspecifically, the group wants the german public to embrace the 1.5 million migrants who arrived in germany in 2015, and to keep welcoming them this year as chancellor merkel's open door policy continues unabated.\n\nwe must continue to act with humanity and we must insist that we are dealing with individuals, individuals, have to do, ms. oppermann said.\n\nshe argued that the majority of migrants were refugees seeking protection, but admitted there are huge problems associated with the mass influx from the middle east.\n\nyou have to develop ideas on how you can do that, she said. adding: people will, together we hope, strengthen the great majority of society.
the official twitter account for the international civil aviation organization (icao), the united nations airspace body, spent much of monday and tuesday blocking social media users who noted that its exclusion of taiwan is particularly dangerous in the context of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in china.\n\nthe icao, like the world health organization (who) and the u.n. itself, refuses to recognize taiwan's sovereignty as part of its relationship with china. china considers taiwan a rogue province under its legitimate control despite the fact that taiwan is fully independent of beijing and the island has never in history formed part of the people's republic. beijing insists that any state seeking diplomatic relations with china, or any international body seeking its cooperation, ignore taiwan's sovereignty and reject any attempts by the taiwanese government to establish ties.\n\nthe head of the icao, secretary-general fang liu, was formerly an aviation official for the chinese communist party. the party has a history of disappearing its alums who go on to head international organizations if they do not strictly obey its commands, even abroad.\n\ntaiwan has documented eight cases of the new coronavirus – which causes respiratory system damage, pneumonia, and death – as of wednesday morning, according to its government. the who considers taiwan a province of china and thus does not distinguish taiwanese cases as separate from the nearly 6,000 cases documented in that country. the virus has killed 132 people at press time, all within china. most cases have been documented in wuhan, the central chinese metropolis where the virus is believed to have originated.\n\ntaiwan operates some of the world's busiest airports and, close to some of the hardest-hit provinces in southern china, is geographically critical to monitoring travelers and containing the virus. yet the icao, which claims to be playing a supporting role in u.n. coronavirus response, rejects any attempts by taipei to join the global conversation on how to contain the outbreak.\n\nthe hong kong free press (hkfp) reported on tuesday that the growing scandal surrounding the icao began on saturday, when user jessica drun, a non-resident fellow at the project 2049 institute, revealed that the icao blocked her on twitter after she questioned the organization's exclusion of taiwan from coronavirus response measures.\n\nhey everyone, check this out– i've been blocked by the international civil aviation organization (@icao), a @un specialized agency, for assumedly tweeting about the need for taiwan's inclusion (not membership) in light of a global health crisis. 1/ pic.twitter.com/yezur36xvp — jessica drun (@jessicadrun) january 25, 2020\n\ndrun had originally questioned both the icao and the who, writing, want to drive the point home that two orgs, @who & @icao, refuse to share knowledge w/ taiwan authorities. this means civil aviation authorities for one of busiest regional airports do not receive up-to-date info on any potential icao-who efforts. this is how a virus spreads.\n\nfollowing drun's revelation that the icao had blocked her, several others also objecting to taiwan's exclusion reported having the same experience. others criticized the icao for not doing enough to save lives and instead received ill-timed mockery.\n\nas reports of the icao blocking users concerned about the coronavirus outbreak spread, american officials issued statements condemning the united nations organization. the foreign affairs committee of the house of representatives issued a statement on twitter on monday denouncing the icao for silencing dissent.\n\nthe united nation's @icao plays a valuable role in ensuring aviation security. but silencing voices that oppose icao's exclusion of taiwan goes against their stated principles of fairness, inclusion, and transparency, the twitter post read. individual members of congress also expressed outrage at the u.n. organization, which is tasked with representing the interests of all global civilians, silencing legitimate questions on its treatment of taiwan.\n\ntaiwan's foreign ministry thanked those supporting its inclusion in the global response to coronavirus on twitter. the ministry has also lodged a solemn protest before the icao, which is headquartered in canada.\n\nsupporting #taiwan's inclusion in @icao is communicating misinformation? 🙈🙉🙊 & then the taiwan issue will just disappear? no! taiwan will remain an air traffic hub & the only way to ensure safety is inclusion. jw https://t.co/2nlhuxkazk — 外交部 ministry of foreign affairs, roc (taiwan) 🇹🇼 (@mofa_taiwan) january 28, 2020\n\nspeaking to the hkfp, icao communications director anthony philbin claimed that those individuals blocked on twitter were deemed to be purposefully and publicly misrepresenting our organization in order to draw attention to their own campaign objectives. he added that the icao is allegedly fully bound by the fact that the u.n. general assembly, the organization's largest body, has rejected the reality of taiwanese sovereignty.\n\non twitter, the icao repeatedly referred to support for taiwan as spam:\n\ndue to an unusually large amount of spam, we are unfortunately unable to answer genuine queries at this time. as we are committed to empowering the public, media and civil society through information sharing, we regret the inconvenience. — icao (@icao) january 28, 2020\n\nwe understand peer pressure, but we only block people for doing uncool stuff, like sending us spam. — icao (@icao) january 27, 2020\n\nthe icao's rejection of taiwan mirrors that of the world health organization, which as openly rejected any information taiwan has to offer or expertise in handling the coronavirus. chinese president tsai ing-wen demanded the country's rightful place at the international body last week as china admitted, nearly a month after privately notifying the who, that it had identified a new strain of virus.\n\npolitical considerations should not surpass protection for the people, tsai said. i want to again urge the who not to exclude taiwan for political reasons. taiwan is on the front line of global infectious disease prevention. the who should have a space for taiwan's participation.\n\nthe who rescinded taiwan's invitation to its annual world health assembly in the aftermath of tsai's election. tsai's democratic progressive party (dpp) discourages cooperation with china that requires disregarding the nation's sovereignty and actively rejects beijing's proposal to install one country, two systems, the policy currently in place in hong kong, on the island.\n\nfollow frances martel on facebook and twitter.
in a recent thread on his own platform, twitter ceo jack dorsey discussed the recent suspension of president donald trump, stating that he believes it was the right decision and that the mass blacklisting of trump by the silicon valley masters of the universe was not coordinated, writing more likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.\n\nin a recent tweet thread, twitter ceo jack dorsey discussed the company's recent decision to permanently suspend president trump from its platform. the company stated last week that president trump was suspended from the platform due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\n\nnow, dorsey has discussed the decision at length in a tweet thread which can be found here. dorsey wrote in the thread:\n\ni do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realdonaldtrump from twitter, or how we got here. after a clear warning we'd take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off twitter. was this correct? i believe this was the right decision for twitter. we faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\n\ndorsey went on to say that the ban had significant ramifications, adding that while there are clear and obvious exceptions, i feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation.\n\nhe further added that he didn't believe that the mass de-platforming of president trump was coordinated, stating: i do not believe this was coordinated. more likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others.\n\ndorsey finished the tweet thread stating: i believe the internet and global public conversation is our best and most relevant method of achieving this. i also recognize it does not feel that way today. everything we learn in this moment will better our effort, and push us to be what we are: one humanity working together.\n\nbreitbart news recently reported that twitter stock dropped by as much as 12.3 percent on monday morning this week, reaching a low as $45.17 per share.\n\nit was noted by multiple analysts that the decision to suspend president trump could reignite legislation to revoke section 230, which protects internet companies from liability for content users posts according to analyst notes. bank of america securities analysts said in a note to clients: while a democratic administration may be less focused on significant reform of section 230, recent events may make content legislation more likely.\n\nread more at breitbart news here.\n\nlucas nolan is a reporter for breitbart news covering issues of free speech and online censorship. follow him on twitter @lucasnolan or contact via secure email at the address lucasnolan@protonmail.com
friday on msnbc's andrea mitchell reports, chuck todd, the moderator of nbc's meet the press, said one of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton's vulnerabilities is the miscalculation to topple libyan dictator muammar gaddafi because it helped to create the dangerous conditions that lead to the 2012 benghazi terror attack.\n\ntodd said, competency has been her strength but i do believe what benghazi and libya present was this was an example of her being miscalculating, the policy was wrong. i've always believed she's more vulnerable than on the policy than on what happened. you know, why was benghazi a dangerous situation? because of the decision to topple qaddafi. that has always been her real policy vulnerability there. i actually think the incompetent tag, i see what he's trying to do there.\n\nfollow pam key on twitter @pamkeynen

president tsai ing-wen of taiwan responded vigorously to a speech this week by chinese communist party chief xi jinping announcing that china would no longer tolerate taiwan's sovereignty, urging xi to bravely move towards democracy and face the reality of the existence of the republic of china.\n\nin his speech on tuesday, xi called taiwanese independence a dead end and warned that, in 2019, china would no longer accept the status quo.\n\nwe make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures, he warned.\n\ntsai, speaking on wednesday, responded by lamenting that china has consistently rejected the democratic values that, according to her, define the national identity of taiwan and condemned china for spending much of 2018 attempting to bribe taiwan's allies away from recognizing the nation's sovereignty.\n\ndemocratic values are the values and way of life that taiwanese cherish, and we call upon china to bravely move towards democracy, tsai declared. this is the only way they can truly understand taiwanese people's ideas and commitments.\n\ntsai called on china to face the reality of the existence of the republic of china (taiwan), and not deny the democratic system that the people of taiwan have established together. she insisted that taiwan absolutely will not accept 'one country, two systems,' the policy in place for hong kong, which nominally allows hong kong to remain democratic but technically deprives it of sovereignty. xi's regime has increasingly crippled hong kong's ability to govern itself under one country, two systems by banning political candidates anathema to the communist party's interest from running for office.\n\ntsai also implied that china's behavior towards taiwan, particularly since she took over as president in 2016, had brought it international embarrassment. i want to remind the beijing authorities that a superpower must act with the demeanor and take the responsibility of a superpower, she noted, and international society is watching china to see if it can make changes and become a trustworthy partner.\n\npressuring international corporations to change their designation for taiwan won't bring about a spiritual union, nor will buying off taiwan's diplomatic allies or circling taiwan with military aircraft and naval vessels, tsai concluded.\n\nthe latter remark referred to china's policy of using sharp power, or economic intimidation, to force international corporations to accept its worldview. throughout 2018, companies such as ikea, american airlines, and marriott faced the brunt of sharp power, forced to choose between identifying taiwan as a country in their legal papers, websites, and drop-down menus or losing access to the massive chinese market. three major airlines in the united states ultimately changed their fight booking options to stop identifying taiwan as a country even as the u.s. government dismissed china's bullying as nonsense and urged them not to do so. marriott, in one notable instance, fired a social media manager for liking a twitter post by a group called friends of tibet, which opposes communism.\n\nchina has also used its belt and road initiative (bri, or one belt, one road) to offer high-interest loans to nations that maintain friendly relations with taiwan, notably in latin america. nations like the dominican republic and el salvador announced last year they no longer recognized taiwan's sovereignty after lucrative business meetings with beijing's representatives. an enraged tsai warned the world in august that china's increasingly out of control behavior was not only a threat to cross-strait peace … [but] caused high levels of global instability.\n\ntsai's speech on wednesday followed new year's remarks from xi jinping warning that 2019 would be the last year china would tolerate taiwan's existence.\n\nreunification is a historical trend and it is the right path. taiwan independence is an adverse current of history and is a dead end, xi announced. the issue of taiwan is part of china's domestic politics. it is a core interest of china, and the … feelings of the chinese people, and foreign interference is intolerable.\n\nhe added that chinese officials make no promise to abandon the use of force to end taiwan's independence.\n\nasked about the aggressive remarks on wednesday, chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang claimed to reporters that xi was not speaking for china, but for the world.\n\nxi made it very clear in his speech that adherence to the one-china principle is a consensus shared by the international community, lu said. the international community generally understands and supports the just cause of the chinese people in opposing 'taiwan independence' separatist activities and realizing national reunification.\n\nwe make no promise to renounce the use of force. this does not target compatriots in taiwan, but the interference of external forces and the very small number of 'taiwan independence' separatists and their activities, he added, likely alluding to the united states as an external force against beijing's interests on the matter.\n\nthe threat of use of force is not new for xi's regime. in october, chinese defense minister wei fenghe said during remarks to the press that if someone tries to separate out taiwan, china's military will take the necessary actions at any cost. two months later, the people's liberation army (pla) reportedly deployed a significantly larger fleet of naval vessels to the taiwan strait, presumably to surround taiwan's military and intimidate u.s. ships in the area. the chinese foreign ministry argued this was necessary because a u.s. navy ship had traveled through the sovereign vietnamese waters in the south china sea, which china has illegally claimed for itself.\n\nfollow frances martel on facebook and twitter.
pro-life groups oppose a democrat spending bill on thursday that increases money for abortion programs while including no increased border wall funding.\n\nthe house democrat majority plans to vote on a spending bill that will end the partial government spending program. the spending bill includes a provision that repeals a provision instituted by president donald trump that would require foreign non-government organizations (ngos) to assure that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nthe stipulation, known as the protecting life in global health assistance policy, used to be called the mexico city policy, known by some critics as the global gag rule.\n\nthe democrat bill increases the united nations population fund by $5 million to $37.5 million. pro-life groups contend that the program leads to coercive abortions and involuntary sterilizations.\n\nthe legislation also increases funding for the united nations populations fund, which provides contraception and hopes to reduce childhood deaths. trump ended american financing for the group because pro-life groups oppose its relationship with china, which discourages its citizens from having more than two children.\n\nthe legislation mirrors some of the provisions contained in the senate appropriations committee spending bill, which passed through the committee unanimously. the bill does not include president trump's requested $5 billion in border wall funding.\n\nmarjorie dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, said that democrats are already trying to foist a radical pro-abortion agenda on the nation.\n\na strong majority of americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, dannenfelser said.\n\nthe leader of the susan b. anthony list said that repealing trump's policy would make taxpayers complicit in the exportation of abortion and destruction of countless unborn children around the world. this is unconscionable, and we oppose the bill in the strongest terms.\n\nthe democrat spending bill faces slim prospects of passing through the republican-controlled senate. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) said he would only put a vote on the chamber's floor if president trump endorsed the bill and it included border wall funding.\n\nmatt wolking, communications director for sen. bill cassidy (r-la), tweeted on thursday that nancy pelosi will not provide money to protect americans from illegal immigrants; however, she will increase funding for abortion.\n\nnancy pelosi's funding plan won't provide a single dollar to protect americans from being murdered by illegal immigrants, wolking wrote. but it will provide $5 million dollars for a un program that promotes abortion and the forced sterilization of people of color:
former longtime univision anchor maría elena salinas revealed on tuesday evening that many latinos are buying the arguments president donald trump is making about illegal immigration.\n\nsalinas, whom the new york times once described as the voice of hispanic america, told cnn host don lemon after trump's tuesday evening oval office address that she is saddened that latinos are buying some of these arguments against undocumented immigrants that trump has been making.\n\nand it's very sad to see that our own people, who are immigrants themselves, are attacking these immigrants that are trying to come in, knowing themselves how difficult the situation is in a lot of these latin american countries, she continued. and, you know, they're buying it, and some people, just like some other trump supporters, are saying, well, you know, so what if he tells lies, as long as we have lower unemployment among the latino community.\n\nin his oval office address, trump specifically mentioned that illegal immigration hurts african-americans and hispanic americans.\n\nit strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages, trump said of illegal immigration. among those hardest hit are african-americans and hispanic americans.\n\nduring the 2016 presidential campaign, trump, in addition to making the economic case for fewer illegal immigrants, also explicitly pointed out that the media often ignore latino families who have been victimized by illegal immigrant crimes.\n\ntrump ended up shocking the political and media establishments by doing better among hispanic voters than mitt romney did four years before. and though the media have tried to vilify trump as a racist who hates brown people, trump's support among latinos has remained steady.\n\na december associated press report pointed out the gop's position among hispanics has not weakened during the trump administration, despite the president's rhetoric against immigrants and the party's shift to the right on immigration.\n\nthough latino voters are a key part of the democratic coalition, there is a larger bloc of reliable republican latinos than many think, the associated press explained.\n\nap's votecast data from the 2018 midterm elections reportedly found that  32 percent of latinos voted for republicans while other midterm election surveys also found roughly one-third of latinos supporting the gop.\n\nthe associated press noted that the stability of republicans' share of the latino vote frustrates democrats, who say actions like trump's family separation policy and his demonization of an immigrant caravan should drive latinos out of the gop.
the times of israel reports: u.s. president donald trump sent his peace envoy back to the middle east on tuesday in a move seen as a sign that he intends to make a push for a peace deal.\n\nthe envoy jason greenblatt met late tuesday with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas at a resort on the dead sea in jordan, which is hosting this week's arab league summit. abbas's spokesperson nabil abu rudeinah described it as a follow-up meeting to exchange ideas, according to the official pa news agency wafa. abbas heads to washington for his first meeting with the new president in the next few weeks.\n\ngreenblatt also met with a series of arab leaders and is expected to hold further talks on wednesday as the summit starts. ahead of those meetings, greenblatt met with european union foreign policy chief federica mogherini for talks focused on advancing the israel-palestinian track. it's a priority for both of us, he tweeted.\n\nread more here.
the algemeiner reports: jns.org – may 2017 set a monthly record for the number of tourists arriving in israel. since the start of 2017, tourism has infused $2.18 billion into the israeli economy, according to figures published thursday by israel's tourism ministry. the month of may saw 347,000 tourists enter israel, an increase of 16.7 percent from may 2016.\n\ntourism minister yariv levin attributed the tourism boom to the israeli government's marketing efforts.\n\nit's not a coincidence; it's a clear policy, he said. the positive trend that has continued for over six months is making a tremendous contribution to israeli employment and the economy, and i'm convinced that if we work correctly, we'll see this trend continue into the coming months.\n\nread more here.
finland's much-celebrated experiment in rolling out universal basic income (ubi), a proposed replacement for out-of-work benefits in post-industrial nations where all citizens are paid by the government regardless of their income, is to end as the local government seeks other alternatives to welfare reform.\n\nthe limited trial which began in 2017 selected 2,000 unemployed finns to receive a monthly payment of €560, regardless of whether they consequently found employment or not. rather than expand the experiment to more jobseekers, the finnish government has instead decided to let the trial expire at the end of 2018, signalling the end of the road in the nordic nation for ubi.\n\nthe bbc reports the remarks of finnish ubi designer professor olli kangas, who said: the eagerness of the government is evaporating. they rejected extra funding [for it]… i'm a little disappointed that the government decided not to expand it.\n\nthe exact reasons why finland decided not to extend the trial against the advice of professor kangas are not yet known and won't be revealed until after the project is completed in 2019, but the news will be a disappointment to many who saw ubi as a new and enhanced way force increased taxation levels and redistribute wealth.\n\nthe concept has proven popular with silicon valley elites, with the hyper-wealthy facebook ceo mark zuckerberg and tesla ceo elon musk, as well as slack ceo and flickr co-founder stewart butterfield joining together to endorse ubi in the united states, with zuckerberg stating giving all citizens tax money would give everyone a cushion to try new things.\n\nothers have argued that ubi will become necessary when increasing automation in the workplace renders some human work redundant, creating — it is claimed — mass-unemployment.\n\nyet findings by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) may hold some answers to the early end of finland's experiment — after the report showed that basic income paid by the government could actually increase inequality rather than solve it, and would require a 30 per cent income tax rise to pay for the policy.
manchester, n.h. (ap) — three days before the critical new hampshire primary, seven democratic presidential candidates debated, with many of them fighting to survive in the race to challenge president donald trump.\n\nhere are some key takeaways.\n\nmayor pete makes his case\n\npete buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of south bend., ind., was the candidate of the moment friday. all eyes were on him friday night to see if he could make his case.\n\nand he did — with one significant stumble.\n\nattacked for his thin resume, buttigieg shot back, if you're looking for the person with the most years of washington, d.c., experience under their belt, that candidate is not me. he promoted his youth compared with the lawmakers onstage talking their achievements from decades ago.\n\nwe cannot solve the problems before us by looking back, buttigieg said. we have to be ready to turn the page.\n\na former military intelligence officer, buttigieg seemed comfortable discussing foreign affairs, such as the trump administration's killing of iranian general qassem soleimani. there is no evidence that that made our country safer, he said, adding later, this is not an episode of '24.'\n\nbut buttigieg's trouble spot has long been race. asked about a spike in arrests of black people for marijuana possession in his city after he became mayor, buttigieg began to decry systemic racism but seemed to acknowledge he couldn't escape it in the city that he ran.\n\nsanders under attack\n\nit didn't take long for the candidates to make clear whom they saw as the front-runner. sen. bernie sanders of vermont was piled on by competitors fighting to become the moderate alternative to the self-declared democratic socialist.\n\nthere were two lines of attack — sanders' uncompromising liberal positions and, specifically, his proposal to immediately have the federal government take over the entire health care system.\n\nthe most notable punch was thrown by buttigieg, who said democrats will have a problem working to unite this country at a moment when we need unification when our nominee is dividing people. asked if he meant sanders, he said yes.\n\nminnesota sen. amy klobuchar scoffed at sanders' health care proposal. former vice president joe biden noted that sanders says he has no idea how much his proposal could cost, though experts have put it at at least $30 trillion.\n\nbut he showed a characteristic durability. in the deeply divided field, sanders is now leading in many polls by virtue of that following.\n\nbiden bounce back?\n\nafter his disappointing showing in iowa, biden was fighting to survive. sometimes it didn't seem like it, but biden also displayed flashes of the fire and emotion that have traditionally endeared him to democratic voters.\n\noffered a chance early to swing at his two main rivals — sanders and buttigieg — biden opened by basically admitting he was going to lose new hampshire.\n\nbernie won by 20 points last time, biden said softly. his criticisms of sanders and buttigieg weren't nearly as sharp as those offered by other candidates. biden's had difficulty talking about the gop investigation into his own son that triggered trump's impeachment and that has coincided with the former vice president's slide in the polls.\n\nthe former vice president was left asking the crowd to give a standing ovation to lt. col. alexander vindman, who was led out of the white house hours earlier. vindman had testified in december before democrats investigating trump's dealings with ukraine.\n\nbiden, 77, was more energized in the later hours of the debate. he was visibly enraged at trump's dismissive comments on u.s. casualties during the iranian retaliation for the u.s. killing of an iranian general. he sharply attacked sanders over the vermont senator's prior support for gun rights, defended his long record on the supreme court and promoted his historic support from african-americans.\n\nbut it's not clear whether his performance will quell worries.\n\nwarren didn't have a plan for breaking through\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren invested deeply in neighboring new hampshire as a key part of her 2020 run, but she struggled to find a standout moment as she begins to make her final case to the state's voters.\n\nwarren skipped a chance to differentiate herself more from sanders, a fellow progressive whom she calls a longtime friend. given the chance to create some distance, warren said, we have a lot of things in common, we have a lot of things that we differ on.\n\nshe quickly shifted to making a party unity plea and echoing her stump speech lines about big money in politics and corruption.\n\nwe bring our party together, it's an issue we can all agree on and fight to end the corruption, warren said. we're the democrats. we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and republicans on that. they hate the corruption as well.\n\nwarren also did little to explicitly come to sanders defense as her vermont rival was attacked by the more moderate candidates over his prized medicare for all policy goal, an idea warren supports.\n\nklobuchar made a mark\n\nklobuchar was quick with the quips as she tried gain an edge in the primary's moderate lane. she repeatedly made a virtue of her ability to compromise and work with republicans. there was an urgency to her presentation, with good reason: she needs an upset in new hampshire.\n\nshe hit familiar notes of criticizing medicare for all as she touted her midwestern appeal and legislative success in the senate. klobuchar's plea boiled down to making a case for democratic sensibility as a break from the smash-mouth nature of trump's presidency.\n\ni didn't come from money, klobuchar said, insisting voters want to have someone that they can understand in the white house.\n\nsteyer's fiery play … for south carolina\n\nbillionaire activist tom steyer does not have much of a chance in new hampshire. so he used the debate to make a strong appeal to african american voters in south carolina, where his campaign has invested heavily and black voters make up two-thirds of the primary electorate.\n\nthe billionaire noted that well into the debate, we have not said one word tonight about race.\n\nare you kidding me? he asked as a discussion of race ensued.\n\nhe added later, i am for reparations to african americans in this country and anyone who thinks that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality.\n\nyang not burdened\n\nbusinessman andrew yang was not burdened by low expectations. he was at ease and having fun on the debate stage friday night, even though his chances to win new hampshire, let alone the democratic nomination, are minuscule.\n\nhe bounced onto the stage without a tie, in stark contrast to his more buttoned-up male rivals.\n\nbut yang was largely left out of the heated exchanges that simmered through the debate, focusing instead on stepping back and looking at the larger picture.\n\ndonald trump is not the cause of all of our problems, yang said. and we are making a mistake when we act like he is. he is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades.\n\nthe elephant not in the room\n\ntwo words were spoken friday night that have rarely come up on the trail or in prior debates: mike bloomberg.\n\nthe former new york mayor and multibillionaire is skipping the early nominating states and instead spending hundreds of millions on super tuesday states with far more delegates at stake.\n\na viewer-submitted question asked why the candidates were better than bloomberg.\n\ni don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the united states, warren said.\n\ni just simply don't think people look at the guy in the white house and say, 'can we get someone richer?' klobuchar said.\n\nthere are millions of people who can desire to run for office but i guess if you're worth $60 billion and you can spend several hundred millions of dollars on advertising you have a slight advantage, sanders said.\n\nthe responses were clear signals that they take bloomberg seriously.
british exports are at their strongest since 2010, according to a report by heathrow airport and the centre for economics and business research (cebr) — making a mockery of claims that post-referendum uncertainty would crash the economy.\n\nthe value of export goods destined for markets beyond the european union and switzerland have risen by some 150 per cent, with heathrow carrying £48.9 billion — or 30 per cent — of this cargo, city a.m. reports.\n\njohn holland-kaye, heathrow's chief executive officer, said that the figures proved that britain needs to secure its status as an outward-looking global trading nation — although he stopped short of calling out the eu loyalists in parliament seeking to tie britain to an eu customs deal which could see the bloc continuing to set britain's trade policy.\n\ntrade is so brisk, in fact, heathrow is operating at capacity, with holland-kaye claiming that the airport must expand so we can connect all corners of the uk to the growing markets of the world.\n\nbrexit boom: manufacturing set to outpace the rest of economy as exports surge https://t.co/4scfrgg0pd — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) march 5, 2018\n\nthe figures are just the latest nail in the already overcrowded coffin lid of the remain campaign's project fear, whose centrepiece was a treasury report warning voters that a leave vote would inflict an immediate and profound shock to the british economy, tipping the country into recession and putting hundreds of thousands out of work.\n\nin fact, the economy has continued to grow post-referendum, with factory output especially strong as the fall in sterling lets the air out of what princeton university academic ashoka mody described as a finance-property bubble and redirects economic activity towards manufacturing and exports.\n\nbreitbart london reported on march 5th that manufacturing growth is now expected to outpace the rest of the economy, with international firms such as siemens and unilever announcing multi-million-pound plants and research centres, expected to create thousands of new jobs.\n\nfollow jack montgomery on twitter: @jackbmontgomery
president-elect joe biden unveiled a coronavirus plan thursday that he claims will turn the tide on the pandemic, speeding up the vaccine rollout, and providing financial help to individuals, states, and local governments and businesses struggling with the prolonged economic fallout.\n\nthe proposal reflects the priorities of democrats, spending more money on aiding state governments, schools, and colleges than stimulus payments to individuals. it also includes a minimum wage hike, a measure sought by democrats long before the pandemic struck.\n\nthe proposal includes:\n\n$350 billion in state and local government aid\n\n$170 billion for k-12 schools and institutions of higher education\n\ndirect payments of $1,400 to most americans, costing around $320 billion according to a breitbart news' estimate\n\nenhanced unemployment benefits increasing payments by $400 per week through the end of september\n\n$50 billion for covid-19 testing\n\n$20 billion toward a national vaccine program\n\nraising the child tax credit to $3,000 per child and making it fully refundable for 2021\n\nthe non-spending proposals include:\n\nhiking the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour\n\nextending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums until the end of september\n\nextended family leave\n\ncalled the american rescue plan, it would amount to $1.9 trillion in spending. despite the massive cost, the plan does not focus on creating jobs or set aside money for building american infrastructure.\n\nthose things will have to wait for a second bill that biden says will be introduced in february, to also include measures, his advisers say, will combat climate change and advance racial equity.\n\nthe proposal falls short of expectations for $2,000 direct stimulus payments. instead, it provides for what breitbart news estimates would be around $320 billion in direct payments of $1,400 for most americans. biden's aides say this amounts to the promised $2,000 when coupled with the $600 included in the aid bill president donald trump signed last year.\n\nthe proposal includes an even larger amount of funds for state and local governments, schools, and colleges. biden's plan provides for $350 billion in state and local government aid and another $170 billion for k-12 schools and colleges.\n\nunder biden's multipronged strategy, only about $400 billion would go directly to combating the pandemic, while the rest is focused on economic relief and aid to states and localities.\n\nbiden's aides claimed, without evidence, that the proposal would advance his target of administering 100 million vaccines by the 100th day of his administration and help move toward the objective of reopening most schools by the spring.\n\nin an odd decision when unemployment is extremely high among low-income americans, the proposal shoehorns inthe long-term democratic policy aim of hiking the minimum wage to $15 an hour. that is likely to make it harder for low-income americans to find jobs, putting further strains on state budgets funding employment benefits.\n\nthe proposal also expands paid leave for workers and increases tax credits for families with children, goals shared by many pro-family conservatives seeking to make family formation more affordable.\n\nthe political outlook for the legislation remained unclear. in a joint statement, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer praised biden for including liberal priorities, saying they would move quickly to pass it. but democrats have narrow margins in both chambers of congress, and republicans will push back on issues that range from increasing the minimum wage to providing more money for states, while demanding inclusion of their priorities, such as liability protection for businesses.\n\nremember that a bipartisan $900 billion #covid19 relief bill became law just 18 days ago, tweeted sen. john cornyn, r-texas.\n\nthe emergency legislation would be paid for with borrowed money, adding to trillions in debt the government has already incurred to confront the pandemic. aides said biden will make the case that the additional spending and borrowing is necessary to prevent the economy from sliding into an even deeper hole. interest rates are low, making debt more manageable. inflation is below the federal reserve's target, indicating that the economy has enough slack to withstand additional demand introduced by deficit spending.\n\nbiden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably linked with controlling the coronavirus. our work begins with getting covid under control, he declared in his victory speech. we cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments until we get it under control.\n\ndespite this claim, the economy in the final six months of the trump administration has out-performed the expectations of most economists. re-opening many businesses and adjustments to business operations, including encouraging employees to work from home and making workplaces more amenable to social distancing, have allowed many businesses to regain their footing.\n\nthe plan comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic's most dangerous wave yet. so far, more than 385,000 people have died of covid-19 in the u.s. and government numbers out thursday reported a jump in weekly unemployment claims, to 965,000, a sign that rising infections are forcing businesses to cut back and lay off workers.\n\nabout $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by congress. biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.\n\nthe plan provides $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. about $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.\n\nthe plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus.\n\nthere's also a proposal to boost investment in genetic sequencing, and to help track new virus strains, including the more contagious variants identified in the united kingdom and south africa.\n\nthroughout the plan, there's a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments, aides said.\n\nwith the new proposals comes a call to redouble efforts on the basics.\n\nbiden is asking americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. he contends it's still the surest way to slow the covid-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on tuesday.\n\nbiden's biggest challenge will be to win the hearts and minds of the american people to follow his lead, said dr. leana wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.\n\nwith the backing of congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines. and more are on the way. yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start, with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.\n\nbiden believes the key to speeding that up lies not only in delivering more vaccine but also in working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. the trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but they largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.\n\nthis is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources, said dr. nadine gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan trust for america's health. there is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.\n\nbiden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. the pace of vaccination is approaching one million shots a day, but 1.8 million a day would be needed to reach widespread or herd immunity by the summer, according to a recent estimate by the american hospital association. wen says the pace should be even higher — closer to three million a day.\n\nit's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. polls show it's particularly a problem among black americans. it's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities, said gracia.\n\nnext wednesday, when biden is sworn in as president, marks the anniversary of the first confirmed case of covid-19 in the united states.\n\n___\n\nthe associated press and ap writer josh boak contributed to this report.
when it comes to setting policy in syria, secretary of state john kerry is not taken seriously and is laughed at in the larger middle east, breitbart jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter aaron klein stated in a radio interview on wednesday.\n\nklein was speaking during his weekly segment on john batchelor's popular national radio show.\n\nclick below to listen to klein's full segment on batchelor's program.\n\nklein, reporting from tel aviv, told batchelor that he heard the anti-kerry sentiment from diplomats in the region regarding u.s. policy in syria:\n\nwhat i'm hearing is that the middle east right now is entirely disappointed by john kerry, by the united states. there is no leadership. there is almost nothing being done on the american side. america has almost completely abandoned syria to russia; to what russia wants in the ceasefire agreement. … the united states has been largely absent. …\n\njohn kerry, by the way, is not taken seriously in the middle east and beyond. he's laughed at. there is no policy. he hasn't presented anything serious.\n\nkerry has been attempting to broker a ceasefire agreement in syria. but klein says it is russian president vladimir putin who has taken the leadership position in trying to arrange a vaguely-defined halt in hostilities scheduled to take effect saturday.\n\nthe guardian reported:\n\nthe russian president spoke by phone to leaders in iran, saudi arabia, israel, and syria in an attempt to garner support for the ceasefire, and explain its complex details.\n\nhe has also opened a coordination centre to which the warring parties can send complaints of specific breaches of the truce.\n\nthe truce will not apply to zones controlled by the islamic state and the al-qaeda-affiliated nusra front.\n\nhowever, klein said ceasefire efforts may be complicated by the assad regime's insistence on labeling rebel groups as terrorists.\n\nklein is not the only one mocking kerry's syria diplomacy. shadi hamid, a senior fellow at the brookings institute, was quoted stating, the only one holding out hope is john kerry.\n\nright now, it's hypothetical and not based on anything real. how kerry even explained it in his own words, it's hard to take seriously, hamid stated.\n\nklein, however, was speaking to what he said was the absence of a larger cohesive u.s. policy in syria.\n\non thursday, kerry cited previously unheard pentagon estimates essentially making public the dim chances of creating any future safe-zone or no-fly-zone in syria.\n\nabc news reported:\n\nkerry said today that creating a safe zone isn't as simple as it sounds. in addition to controlling the airspace, kerry said, a large troop presence would be required to shield the population from isis attacks on the ground.\n\nall this talk about safe zones does not go through the process of what it really means, kerry said.\n\nour pentagon estimates that to have a true safe zone in the north of the country you may have upwards of fifteen to thirty thousand troops. now are we ready to authorize that? are we ready to put them on the ground?\n\naside from the inherent physical and political risks of putting a large number of u.s. troops on the ground inside syria, the u.s. worries about potential conflicts with russia, which is also conducting an aerial bombing campaign over syria.\n\ncreating a no-fly zone would most likely mean the u.s. would have to enforce that rule against russian jets – a potentially dangerous scenario.\n\nnevertheless, kerry said that the u.s. is considering other options if a ceasefire can't be reached inside syria.
las vegas (ap) — as early voting surged in nevada's nominating contest, former vice president joe biden lashed out at democratic rival bernie sanders on saturday for not doing enough to control his most aggressive supporters.\n\nbiden's attack during an interview for nbc's meet the press came as he fights to rescue his struggling presidential bid and sanders works to strengthen his strong standing with the contest speeding into a new phase. biden also sought to downplay expectations for next saturday's nevada caucuses, telling reporters that he did not need to win.\n\nin the interview, the former vice president seized on reports that sanders' supporters insulted and made online threats against leaders of an influential union that declined to endorse any of the eight candidates still in the democratic race.\n\nhe may not be responsible for it, but he has some accountability, biden charged. he continued: if any of my supporters did that, i'd disown them … flat disown them.\n\nthe sanders campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about biden's assertion.\n\nearlier saturday, the fiery progressive senator went on the offensive against his moderate competitors for accepting campaign cash from billionaires, although he declined to go after his opponents by name.\n\ndemocracy is not candidates going to the homes of billionaires raising money, sanders charged during a rally at a suburban las vegas high school.\n\nboth biden and pete buttigieg have aggressively courted wealthy donors over the past year. buttigieg met with donors behind closed doors in seattle at roughly the same time sanders made the comments.\n\nit was a familiar line of attack in a relatively unfamiliar setting as the 2020 primary contest descended upon nevada for a weekend of frenzied campaigning, colored by mobile campaign billboards cruising the las vegas strip and a diverse set of voters weighing in for the first time.\n\nwhile the state's formal presidential caucuses are still a week away, democrats opened the first of four days of early voting across more than 80 locations. state party officials at some sites across nevada were overwhelmed by long lines.\n\nin northern nevada's washoe county, a line of more than 300 people snaked through aisles of book shelves at a public library as another 100 queued up at the county party's headquarters. dozens left without voting.\n\na spokeswoman for the nevada democrats, molly forgey, downplayed concerns related to the large early turnout as the political world anxiously watched from afar less than two weeks after iowa's presidential caucuses turned disastrous.\n\nwe are happy to see the number of energized democrats participating in our first ever early voting period, forgey said, noting that early voters have four days to participate. our volunteers and staff are working to make every site runs as efficiently as possible and to ensure every voter gets to make their voice heard.\n\nearly votes cast on paper ballots will be added to in-person caucus votes made on feb. 22, when democrats will attend about 2,000 precinct meetings around the state. the nevada state democratic party abandoned its plans to use an app like the one that caused trouble in iowa and has scrambled to come up with a new system to tabulate results.\n\namid heightened concern over the process, several candidates were making urgent get-out-the-vote pushes with rallies and town halls ahead of a fundraising gala for the las vegas-based clark county democratic party to feature a half-dozen white house hopefuls.\n\nbiden, looking to nevada's diverse electorate to help revive his campaign after weak finishes in iowa and new hampshire, seized on president donald trump's hard-line policy and incendiary rhetoric on immigration as he courted voters.\n\neverybody knows how donald trump is. we gotta let him know who we are, biden said, drawing a roar from about 100 campaign volunteers gathered at a las vegas middle school gymnasium for a latino organizing event.\n\nbiden thanked the volunteers, emphasized the importance of the latino vote and touted his relationships with unions. he later told reporters that he didn't need to win nevada's caucuses to mount a comeback.\n\ni just have to do well, the former vice president said when asked what he needs out of the state. asked whether he has to win, he replied, no, i don't think i have to, but i think we have a shot at winning.\n\nformer sen. harry reid, an icon in nevada's democratic politics, told reporters that people should not be counting joe biden out of the race yet, but also offered warm words for sanders' candidacy. when asked he downplayed concerns from some democrats that sanders might hurt other candidates should he become the nominee.\n\ni care a great deal about bernie sanders. and he has gotten where he has by having people support him, said the 80-year-old reid. and so i'm not going to be critical of bernie sanders.\n\nelizabeth warren, meanwhile, also reeling after a weak performance last week in new hampshire, looked to nevada's women for momentum.\n\nthe massachusetts senator pitched her universal childcare plan as she addressed about 30 people, mostly women, at a downtown las vegas reggae and cocktail bar. after being introduced by actress yvette nicole brown, warren said her childcare plan would be paid for by a wealth tax of 2 cents on every dollar for fortunes of more than $50 million.\n\nit's good for our babies, warren said. think about what it means for every mama. every mama who can now finish her education, even if she's just had a baby. every mama and every daddy who could take a job.\n\nmike bloomberg, who isn't competing in nevada as part of a strategy to skip the first four states voting for a nominee, was on the cusp of qualifying for wednesday's presidential debate in la vegas. the billionaire businessman and former new york mayor has increasingly become a target of the democratic party's far-left wing as national polls show suggest he is on the rise.\n\nboth warren and sanders criticized the role of big money in politics and billionaires seeking the presidency. bloomberg and tom steyer are in that category.\n\ndemocracy is not billionaires spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to get elected. democracy is when working people stand up, fight for justice, sanders declared.\n\nthe campaign of bloomberg, who campaigned saturday in virginia, announced the opening of seven new campaign offices in florida, bringing the total to 10. the former new york mayor has more than 2,000 paid staff spread out across the nation and has already spent over $300 million on tv, radio and digital advertising, according to the ad tracking firm advertising analytics.\n\n___\n\npeoples reported from new york. associated press writers nicholas riccardi, bill barrow and jonathan cooper in las vegas and scott sonner in reno contributed to this

the department of homeland security (dhs) is releasing from custody more than 2,000 border-crossing adults and the children they arrived with over the course of a few weeks.\n\na dhs official confirmed to breitbart news that the u.s. border patrol and the immigration and customs enforcement (ice) agency is releasing more than 2,000 family units caught at the u.s.-mexico border, citing a lack of detention space.\n\nthe border-crossing adults and the children they arrived at the border with will be released and given a court date for an immigration hearing. the adults will be given ankle monitors, though the dhs official says the process of keeping track of border-crossers via ankle monitors is not effective.\n\nborder patrol and ice are experiencing major issues with detention space at the yuma, arizona sector of the border, as well as in san diego, california, el paso, texas, and the rio grande valley sector of the southern border.\n\nthe dhs official said there is not nearly enough bed space for family units at border detention facilities, while border patrol encounters about 2,100 border-crossers a day with more than 60 percent of those adults bringing children with them in the hope to be quickly released into the interior of the country.\n\nphotos captured over the last couple of weeks reveal the mass release of border-crossing family units by dhs:\n\na dhs spokesperson blamed the country's immigration loophole, known as the flores settlement agreement, in a statement to breitbart news.\n\nwe are living through an immigration crisis that is in part driven by a disastrous ruling by a district court judge in the ninth circuit that incentives illegal alien adults to put their children in the hands of smugglers and traffickers, waldman told breitbart news in a statement. the flores settlement agreement has created an immigration loophole that rewards parents for bringing their children with them to the united states.\n\nthe flores settlement agreement — to which the president trump's administration has demanded an end — requires border-crossing family units to be released after 20 days, even before their immigration hearing. the result is a growing illegal alien population, as less than two percent of border-crossing family units are deported.\n\nsince 2015, we have seen a 169 percent increase in family units crossing the border. there has been a 110 percent increase in males traveling with children over the last two years, waldman said. as long as activist judges continue to set national immigration policy they continue to put family units and innocent children in harm's way.\n\nas the trump administration mass releases border-crossing family units, illegal immigration continues surging at the southern border. breitbart news's bob price reports that about 22,000 border-crossing minors crossed the border last month.\n\nin november 2018, there were close to 52,000 border crossings on the southern border, alone, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of november since 2006. projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade.
international human rights lawyer anne bayefsky reported on un ambassador nikki haley's latest statement about the un human rights council on tuesday's breitbart news daily. bayefsky expressed disappointment with the mild character of haley's brief remarks, compared to the boldness of her earlier criticism of the council.\n\ni'm afraid that she didn't say very much. she was very hopeful. her attitude was one of hope that the human rights council would do a better job going forward, bayefsky said of haley's remarks.\n\nit was a very short speech. you get very little time at the human rights council to speak, so she couldn't say very much of anything, she noted.\n\nshe might have said that unless the council does a, b, c, the united states will remove itself, but she didn't say that. she said that venezuela should voluntarily step down, which of course is completely and utterly unrealistic. she said no human rights violator should be on the council, should be allowed to take a seat. that isn't going to happen because the general assembly and the council itself determines who are its members, and they have no intention of changing their procedures, bayefsky noted.\n\nand she said it's essential that the council address its anti-israel bias, but again, u.s. ambassadors to the united nations have said that for the last three decades, to no avail. there was no 'or else,' she said.\n\nsiriusxm host joel pollak noted that haley's hopeful tone was not dramatically different from the obama administration's attitude when it decided to improve the human rights council by re-joining it and working from within. he asked if those years of effort had produced any positive changes.\n\nthat's a good question, bayefsky replied. first of, they didn't 'rejoin' because president bush had never joined. it was created in 2006. obama, it was one of his very first foreign policy moves to join it, to lend it credibility. he left president trump holding the bag because he ran the united states for a three-year term that began only on january 1, 2017, hoping to essentially rule from the grave. so they were faced with an issue of whether to get off it from the get-go at the trump administration, and they didn't.\n\nthe obama administration made very specific reform efforts to a) change the composition so that countries like saudi arabia and so on were not members, and secondly they attempted to change the entrenched anti-israel bias. they failed miserably on both counts, she said.\n\nto see ambassador haley raise this as a potential viable reform effort is unfortunate because she's playing a shell game. she doesn't have the votes, the united states doesn't have the votes. the procedures don't permit those kinds of reforms. there is a complete lack of political will, and it isn't going to happen, bayefsky contended.\n\nthe current situation is that the council is collecting a blacklist of american and other companies doing business with the state of israel, and when we're on it, the american taxpayer is paying for that blacklist. it's shameful. we shouldn't be anywhere granting the kind of legitimacy that the leader of the free world brings to the table at the human rights council, she urged.\n\nit is possible to still go there and give speeches, non-members can still do that, even co-sponsor resolutions, she noted. but to lend our money and our clout, in terms of membership, is completely inexcusable.\n\npollak asked for president trump's options, if he decides not to wait until america's three-year membership in the human rights council expires.\n\nhe could withdraw tomorrow, bayefsky replied, noting with a chuckle that the deadline for withdrawing today has passed. he has very clear options. he could say, 'the united states taxpayer is no longer going to pay for this travesty that builds equality rights on the backs of inequality of jews. we're going to get off now.' that's the first option.\n\noption number two is to play the reform game, which the un enjoys, and has enjoyed for a very long time, she continued. which simply perpetrates a fraud. i can't put it in any other way. they're not going to do the major reforms necessary – changing of composition and removing of the anti-israel bias.\n\nbayefsky said the trump administration could play that reform game until the cows come home, and then simply allow membership in the human rights council to lapse when the current term expires.\n\nthat would have lent the council another three years of legitimacy, which they don't deserve, she said. and it's not just that. their demonization of the state of israel is leading to what we see as anti-israel bias on college campuses. it gives a license to the bds, the boycott, divestment, and sanctions regime. it isn't cost-free, and i think that's what we have to understand.\n\nengagement and the way nikki haley has legitimized the council by going there and giving it that kind of cachet of a u.s. un

president donald trump's administration issued a formal veto threat to democrats in congress, vowing to oppose their government funding bill without border security.\n\nin a statement from the office of management and budget, the administration wrote that they cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the nation's urgent border security needs.\n\ntrump has demanded that any bill funding the government include $5.6 billion for border security.\n\nthe white house noted that the house democrat spending bill also undermined the president's mexico city policy, an executive order that trump imposed to bar taxpayer funds from subsidizing overseas abortions. the house bill also included funding for the west bank/gaza strip as well as syria and pakistan and certain united nations funds, which the administration said were frozen or under review during the trump administration.\n\nthe administration looks forward to working with the congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the nation's borders and get the federal government back to work for the american people as soon as possible, the statement read.\n\ndemocrats took power on thursday in the house of representatives, electing nancy pelosi as the new speaker of the house. they planned to pass two bills to fund the government, although senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has refused to take up the bills without trump's approval.
airbnb announced on monday that it would be reviewing reservations in the washington dc area ahead of the presidential inauguration and will ban any guests it believes are associated with hate groups or violent activity. the company is also cross-referencing arrest records from the capitol hill incident with its customer base to ban attendees from using the platform in the future.\n\ncbs news reports that the online rental marketplace airbnb has announced plans to review reservations in the washington dc area ahead of next week's presidential inauguration and will ban any guests it believes are associated with hate groups or violent activity. the decision comes shortly after city officials asked airbnb, vrbo, and other rental hosts to remove listings until the january 20 inauguration is over.\n\nwashington city council member janeese lewis george said in a twitter post: there's no way to guarantee that your guests are not coming to incite violence. please protect your neighbors and the district from more attacks.\n\nairbnb has had a policy of removing guests that are confirmed to be members of hate groups since 2017 after the company blocked guests who were traveling to a white supremacist rally in charlottesville, virginia.\n\nairbnb stated that it will warn all guests in the washington area that it may bring legal action against them if they are found to be members of a hate group or planning violent activities. hosts are also encouraged to call a hotline if they suspect guests are violating airbnb policies.\n\nairbnb also announced that anyone who engaged in criminal activity in last week's protest at the u.s. capitol will be banned from the platform. airbnb is reportedly cross-referencing arrest records to determine who should be removed from the platform but has not yet stated how many have been banned.\n\nthe company also stated it will not give political donations to republicans who voted against certifying the results of the election last week, joining marriot, at&t, and others in taking that stance. airbnb's political action committee donated $866,519 to candidates and political parties in the 2020 election cycle, according to open secrets. joe biden was the biggest recipient of airbnb donations.\n\nlucas nolan is a reporter for breitbart news covering issues of free speech and online censorship. follow him on twitter @lucasnolan or contact via secure email at the address lucasnolan@protonmail.com
house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff indicated during his opening remarks at the senate impeachment trial wednesday that lawmakers must remove president donald trump from office to avoid his reelection in november, claiming that we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won.\n\nechoing other democrats, schiff indicated that democrats are trying to impeach and remove trump from office to avoid his winning a second term.\n\nschiff declared:\n\nas we will discuss, impeachment exists for cases in which the conduct of the president rises beyond mere policy disputes to be decided otherwise and without urgency at the ballot box. instead, we are here today to consider a much more grave matter, and that is an attempt to use the powers of the presidency to cheat in an election. for precisely this reason, the president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won:\n\nimpeach him or else he'll win kinda gives the game away https://t.co/gdl9xi7fmf — ben mcdonald (@bmac0507) january 23, 2020\n\nschiff served as the chief impeachment inquiry inquisitor in the house. now, he is one of seven managers arguing the case for convicting and removing trump in the ongoing senate trial.\n\nthis week, he argued that if the senate rejects democrats' demands for more witnesses, trump will be considered guilty despite the verdict reached by the republican-controlled senate.
claim: sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) claimed during tuesday night's democrat debate that he has opposed authoritarianism all over the world.\n\nverdict: mostly false. sanders has repeatedly praised communism in cuba, china, and nicaragua, with weak caveats acknowledging that they are authoritarian regimes.\n\nsanders aggressively denied supporting authoritarian regimes when asked to justify comments made repeatedly this week praising cuban dictator fidel castro's literacy campaigns, indoctrination plans that forced children to read communist propaganda and worship mass murderers like ernesto che guevara. sanders never mentioned in his prior supportive comments that cuba had an extremely high literacy rate before the 1959 communist revolution that did not necessitate the alleged literacy programs.\n\ni have opposed authoritarianism all over the world, sanders insisted on tuesday. of course you have a dictatorship in cuba, what i said is what barack obama said … that cuba made progress on education.\n\nsanders then proceeded to yell at the crowd, which booed his support for communism.\n\nreally? literacy programs are bad? sanders asked.\n\noccasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about american foreign policy, that includes the fact that america has overthrown governments all over the world, sanders continued, without explaining what his claims of american meddling in iran and chile had to do with fidel castro's childhood indoctrination schemes.\n\nafter insisting he has opposed authoritarianism consistently, he then defended authoritarianism on the debate stage.\n\nwhen dictatorships, whether it is the chinese or the cubans, do something good, you acknowledge that, he said, over the unintelligible shouts of several other candidates on the stage.\n\ni have condemned authoritarianism … authoritarianism of any stripe is bad, but that is different than to say that governments on occasion do things that are good, sanders concluded.\n\nin the comments that sanders defended on the stage – offered to anderson cooper on 60 minutes sunday – the socialist senator applauded cuba and condemned those who criticized castro for saying everything is bad.\n\nwe're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of cuba but, you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad. you know? when fidel castro came into office, you know what he did? he had a massive literacy program. is that a bad thing? even though fidel castro did it? he asked.\n\non monday, sanders offered a similar defense on cnn.\n\n[w]hen fidel castro first came to power he initiated a major literacy program. there [were] a lot of folks in cuba at that point who were illiterate, and he formed a literacy brigade … they went out and they helped people learn to read and write, sanders said. you know what? i think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. i have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world … but, you know, you can't say — china is another example. china is an authoritarian country, becoming more and more authoritarian. but can anyone deny — i mean, the facts are clear, that they have taken more people out of extreme poverty than any country in history.\n\nsanders did not offer his authoritarian caveats in the 1980s remarks that prompted the 60 minutes interview question on cuba.\n\nyou may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the castro was the worst guy in the world. all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro, sanders said at the time. they had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.\n\ngranma, the official state newspaper of the cuban communist party, approvingly translated sanders' comments for an article tuesday applauding him as today one of the strongest aspirants to the democrat party nomination to the november presidential election.\n\nfollow frances martel on facebook and twitter.
as the presidential race shifts into high gear, college students and recent graduates are still being largely ignored, except by one candidate whose promises of rainbows and unicorns are dreams – not reality.\n\nas the smartest and, possibly, poorest generation in our nation's history, millennials will soon have their day of reckoning. here are the key issues threatening our generation, that we hope the next administration will tackle, so that we, too, can live the american dream.\n\n1. colleges are robbing students.\n\ncollege tuition costs have skyrocketed by over 500 percent since 1985. as long as schools continue to tell young people that a degree will guarantee them a better future, they'll keep footing the bill. the government helps them load up on debt – and leaves them with little to no help after the fact.\n\n2. to get a job in america you need to spend money you don't have.\n\noutstanding student loan debt has reached a staggering $1.2 trillion, with over 70 percent of ba degree graduates borrowing to pay for college. some 21 million students now each owe an average of $29,400. what's worse, students have rack up all that debt even for jobs that pay $10 an hour. good luck working that off.\n\n3. that $200,000 degree may not be worth the paper it's printed on.\n\ncollege students graduating today are more likely to work a low-wage job that doesn't require a college degree – the worst imbalance since at least 1990, according to the federal reserve.\n\neven worse, the average median earnings for the class of 2013 was the lowest since 1980, adjusting for inflation.\n\n4. we're kept financially illiterate by a broken education system.\n\none of the most indebted generations in american history is also the least equipped to manage its debt. only 24 percent of millenials qualify as financially literate, according to pwc and half expect that they wouldn't be able to handle an emergency bill of $2,000.\n\nfew colleges and fewer high schools teach pocketbook economics. no wonder we're slaves to the system.\n\n5. the government puts up roadblocks to starting our own businesses.\n\ndespite the majority of millennials and college students indicating that they want to start their own business at some point, the number of actual entrepreneurs is going down. the share of new entrepreneurs between the ages of 20 and 34 declined by 12% when compared to the same demographic in 1996.\n\naccording to the manhattan institute, one of the biggest barriers to new business creation among those under 30 is the mountain of federal, state and local regulations.\n\nwithout modernizing government regulations to encourage new startups, we're likely to see entrepreneurship continue to decline. we'll also have less chances of making money driving an uber or renting out a room on airbnb, as the taxi and hotel industries and regulators crack down on innovation.\n\n6. not only does government stop us from working, it takes what little cash we may have.\n\npoliticians use millennials to pay for programs such as social security and medicare that would otherwise be insolvent. the amount of debt held by the public will be more that 79 percent of gdp by 2024, when millennials will make up most of the labor force. to pay for that debt, taxes will have to rise.\n\nthe think tank demos calls this generational theft.\n\n7. of course, in the end, politicians don't care about us. we're, um, fkd.\n\na survey from genfkd confirms our suspicions: presidential candidates don't discuss the issues important to america's largest eligible voting demographic, millennials.\n\nwhen asked whether or not the presidential candidates were addressing the issues close to them, roughly 86 percent, all aged 18 to 34, reported feeling ignored.\n\nwhat now?\n\nif grandma and grandpa wonder why today's kids are angry, they may need to look at the economic policies that have us trapped. today's political candidates need to:\n\nlay out realistic and viable plans to boost job growth;\n\noverhaul last century's regulations,\n\nstop ripping us off to pay for the generations that stand in front of us;\n\nlet us get on with our careers, our business ideas and our dreams\n\nor maybe they want us to believe pigs can fly.\n\njustin dent is the co-founder and policy and director at genfkd. justin grew up in new york city and studies agricultural resource economics and government at the university of maryland.
newly-installed rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) is calling for 70% taxation on the wealthy as a way to pay for her green new deal, which proposes to use government to create new jobs by investing in renewable energy.\n\nin an interview set to air sunday on cbs news' 60 minutes, ocasio-cortez — who has begun referring to herself by the nickname, aoc — told anderson cooper that the green new deal would require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, including raising taxes to a marginal rate of 70%, as in the 1960s.\n\naoc referred to the 70% rate on people at the tippy-tops as the rich merely paying their fair share of the tax burden.\n\nshe compared the green new deal to other radical policies like president abraham lincoln signing the emancipation proclamation, and president franklin delano roosevelt launching social security in the new deal.\n\nas breitbart news has noted, the green new deal is in fact an old idea, first championed by president barack obama's green jobs czar, van jones. it seeks to implement classic socialist policies of state-run enterprises, using the pretext of an environmental crisis.\n\nto that end, proponents often exaggerate the threat of climate change and other environmental challenges. aoc herself has warned of cataclysmic climate disaster unless the united states moves to 100% renewable energy sources in the next ten years.\n\nin comparison, california — the most ambitious state in green energy policy — has merely set itself a goal of 100% renewables by 2045, more than 25 years away.\n\nobama's green jobs program was a notable failure, with many investments failing to pay off — most notoriously the solar panel company solyndra, which failed after obama, vice president joe biden, and others held it up as a model.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
branden river high school in bradenton, florida, could make bras officially mandatory for female students following a controversy surrounding one of their students who was forced to put band-aids over her nipples after showing up for class without a bra on under her shirt.\n\nin an attempt to address the situation, the school said it would change its dress code next year to make bras mandatory for all female students, reported the washington times, who added that the american civil liberties union (aclu) stepped in this week to defend the choice of students who don't want to wear a bra, saying the school's threat to impose a mandatory bra policy for girls amount to sex discrimination.\n\nin a statement, the aclu declared, a school's dress code cannot make generalizations about what types of clothing or appearance are appropriate for a boy or a girl to wear to school. unfortunately, we often see gender stereotypes and discrimination play a prolific role in the enforcement of school dress codes across the country.\n\nlast month, 17-year-old lizzy martinez recounted her experience with the school.\n\nshe told me that i needed to put a shirt on under my long-sleeve shirt to try to tighten my breasts — to constrict them, claimed martinez. and then she asked me to move around.\n\nmartinez was then sent to the school nurse, who gave her four band-aids to put over her nipples, which reportedly caused martinez to break down in tears and leave school early.\n\naccording to the bradenton herald, martinez is organizing a bracott against the school.\n\ncharlie nash is a reporter for breitbart tech. you can follow him on twitter @mrnashington, or like his page at facebook.
corporations should be encouraged to support gay rights as a means to further economic gain, attendees at the world economic forum in davos will hear this week.\n\nworld leaders gather this week at the swiss ski resort to discuss how to make globalism more inclusive in response to the rising tide of populism.\n\nas part of that agenda chief operating officer of the thomson reuters foundation antonio zappulla has suggested private and public sector leaders be encouraged to be more inclusive of lgbt staff.\n\nsingling out organisations who have been leading on that agenda for praise, zappulla cited the british intelligence agency, mi5, as an example of the progress made over the last decade.\n\nmi5, the uk's national counter-intelligence agency, currently ranks as stonewall's top employer of the year: a remarkable achievement when you think that until the early 90s, lgbt people were altogether banned from working at the british intelligence services, he wrote.\n\nstarbucks, too, was also lauded as a company in touch with current lgbt culture, as evidenced by its advert featuring drag queens bianca del rio and adore delano, while starbucks's ceo howard schultz gained applause from zappulla for famously [putting] his money where his mouth is by telling a shareholder who opposed the company's vocal support for gay marriage to invest elsewhere.\n\nexamples such as these are good p.r., but they're also good for an organisation's bottom line, zappulla argues.\n\na report by out now estimates the us economy could add an extra $9 billion a year if companies improved their ability to retain lgbt talent through the implementation of inclusive policies. countries where such policies do not exist are missing out: the world bank estimates india is losing $32 billion a year in economic output precisely because of widespread discrimination against lgbt people.\n\nthe numbers are clear: there is an economic case for lgbt inclusion, and it's strong, he insists.\n\ncompanies with strong lgbt policies tend to innovate the most, to have loyal employees, and to experience significantly less [sic] cases of discrimination lawsuits. in addition to that, they are also positively perceived by their customers. it's a win-win.\n\nhowever, he acknowledges that furthering lgbt interests, especially in countries with cultures opposed to the promotion of gay lifestyles, will be a challenge. his answer is to think and act 'glocally': underscoring the business benefits of diversity locally, and adopting global policies that make the workplace safe, fair and accepting for all.\n\nzappulla's agenda contribution comes as the world economic forum releases its inclusive growth and development report 2017, arguing that countries' economic development should not be judged on gdp alone, but on social participation.\n\naccording to the authors, the report, which covers 109 economies, seeks to improve our understanding of how countries can use a diverse spectrum of policy incentives and institutional mechanisms to make economic growth more socially inclusive without dampening incentives to work, save and invest.\n\nafter ranking the countries based on twelve key performance indicators of inclusive development including poverty, two inequality measures, and carbon intensity, norway came out at the top of the list, followed by luxembourg, switzerland, iceland, denmark, sweden, and the netherlands.\n\nthe united kingdom was ranked 21st, while the united states was in 23rd place.\n\nthe authors hope to inspire a coordinated international initiative to raise median living standards, in part through the replacement of free trade deals with the facilitation of trade by encouraging convergence around best practices and standards to reduce frictions and boost development.
german government ministers have agreed on the outline of a new law, which, if passed, would make it easier to deport immigrants who break german laws.\n\nwe will tighten criminal law to make deportation easier, said justice minister heiko maas.\n\nthe new proposal would lower that threshold to pursue deportation such that any immigrant convicted of a crime with a jail sentence longer than one year would be eligible. in addition, specific crimes which will be looked at as cause for deportation include sexual assault, threatening someone's life, or attacking a police officer. currently, these crimes usually result in probation and thus, do not result in deportation.\n\nchancellor angela merkel, who has been under pressure since news of the assaults in cologne broke last week, said of the proposal, we must make sure the law can take effect as soon as possible. merkel supported an open border policy that led to over one million new immigrants entering the county, primarily from northern africa and the middle east.\n\non new year's eve, as many as 1,000 drunk men, identified by victims and police as mostly immigrants, filled the plaza outside the train station in cologne and sexually assaulted passing women. a total of 553 police reports have been filed with law enforcement in cologne, germany, based on incidents that took place on new year's eve. the bbc reports 45% of those–about 250 reports–allege sexual assault on women.\n\ndespite the complete breakdown in public order, the police report published january 1 claimed the previous night had been relaxed and peaceful. it was only a week later that word of what had really happened began to make its way into newspapers.\n\na leaked police report described the scene as chaos, with police completely unable to restore order or protect women being attacked. one direct result of the fiasco came last week; cologne's police chief was ordered to take an early retirement.
in recent weeks, the boy scouts of america announced the organization would admit girls to take part in its programs. and now, charisma news reports that condoms will be made available for its 2019 world scout jamboree in west virginia and alcohol permitted in some areas.\n\ncharisma news reported:\n\nthe guidelines require that host organizations, who in this case include the former boy scouts of america (now scouts bsa), … ensure that condoms are readily and easily accessible for all participants and ist [staff] at a number of locations on the site. heads of contingent must be informed in advance and made aware of their responsibility in communicating this policy to their participants, unit leaders, contingent staff, and ist in an appropriate way. (see guideline 7.3 on page 10 of the document.) stunningly, the world jamboree guideline 7.3 also has exceptions, allowances and instructions for the consumption of alcohol in confined areas at the 12-day camping event. (it appears the jamboree guidelines were drafted after the 2015 world jamboree in japan in preparation for the 2019 event and were just recently released in an email.)\n\nthe theme for next summer's jamboree is unlock a new world and will celebrate cultural exchange, mutual understanding, peace, and friendship, charisma news reported.\n\nthe scouts have defended their recent decision to admit girls, citing inclusivity.\n\nthe program for the older boys and girls will largely be divided along gender-lines, with single-sex units pursuing the same types of activities, earning the same array of merit badges and potentially having the same pathway to the coveted eagle scout award, the associated press (ap) reported.\n\nthe new world market is the only source for your official 24th world #scoutjamboree merchandise and swag! today, we're… posted by 24th world scout jamboree – north america 2019 on friday, april 20, 2018\n\nap has reported that the boy scouts have been for boys and young men only for more than 100 years.\n\nbut in early may, a new name was announced to reflect the decision to admit girls: scouts bsa. the change will become effective in february 2019.\n\nchief scout executive mike surbaugh said many possibilities were considered during lengthy and 'incredibly fun' deliberations before the new name was chosen, ap reported.\n\nwe wanted to land on something that evokes the past but also conveys the inclusive nature of the program going forward, surbaugh said. we're trying to find the right way to say we're here for both young men and young women.\n\nthe parent organization will remain the boy scouts of america, and the cub scouts — its program for 7- to 10-year-olds — will keep its title, as well, ap reported. but the boy scouts — the program for 11- to 17-year-olds — will now be scouts bsa.\n\nthe girls scouts issued a statement about the boy scouts' decision to admit girls by touting what makes its organization uniquely suited for girls.\n\ngirl scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls, sylvia acevedo, ceo of girl scouts of the usa, said in the statement. we are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents who want to provide their girls opportunities to build new skills, explore stem and the outdoors, participate in community projects, and grow into happy, successful, civically engaged adults.\n\nwe're also dedicated to building that critical stem workforce pipeline that businesses and communities across the country are looking for, acevedo said. girls are our country's great untapped resource and are the key to our nation's competitive advantage in the new digital economy we're living in.\n\nthey'll be the drivers and the designers of our industries of the future, filling and creating jobs that don't even exist yet, acevedo said. and at girl scouts, we're preparing them for these opportunities.\n\nthe 24th world scout jamboree will be held july 22 to august 2, 2019.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter.
president trump is seeking to halt the flow of birth tourism, the practice of foreign visitors arriving in the united states only to secure their u.s.-born children birthright american citizenship, by issuing a new regulation for state department officials.\n\nevery year, as breitbart news reported, the birth tourism industry delivers about 33,000 u.s.-born children, commonly referred to as anchor babies, who secure birthright american citizenship despite their foreign parents having only come to the country on visitor visas. previous research has put the annual estimate for birth tourism anchor babies at 36,000.\n\na new rule issued by the trump administration states that consular officers who grant b-1 and b-2 visas, temporary business and tourist visas, must deny such visas if they believe a foreign national intends to travel to the country for the primary purpose of delivering a child on u.s. soil and thus securing them birthright citizenship.\n\nthe department does not believe that visiting the united states for the primary purpose of obtaining u.s. citizenship for a child, by giving birth in the united states — an activity commonly referred to as 'birth tourism' — is a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature, for purposes of consular officers adjudicating applications for b nonimmigrant visas, the state department regulation states.\n\nan official with the white house said the rule is not only to enhance national security, but also to protect american taxpayers from being forced to subsidize the medical costs of foreign nationals solely trying to secure american citizenship for their u.s.-born children:\n\nthe birth tourism industry threatens to overburden valuable hospital resources and is rife with criminal activity, as reflected in federal prosecutions. closing this glaring immigration loophole will combat these endemic abuses and ultimately protect the united states from the national security risks created by this practice. it will also defend american taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism. [emphasis added]\n\nthe rule will codify in federal statute a requirement that b visa-holders prove they can pay the full costs associated with any medical treatment they are seeking in the u.s. as opposed to current policy, consular officers will be ordered to presume that a pregnant national seeking a b visa is traveling for the primary purpose of obtaining u.s. citizenship for the child.\n\nthe integrity of american citizenship must be protected, a white house official said.\n\nstate department officials have said foreign nationals seeking b visas are increasingly stating during the application process that they are traveling to the u.s. to give birth to their children.\n\nthe majority of beneficiaries of birth tourism arrive in the u.s. from china and russia, two nations that are not visa waiver countries, meaning their nationals do not have instant temporary access to come to the u.s.\n\na white house official told breitbart news that nationals arriving from the 39 visa waiver countries, including south korea, singapore, poland, and taiwan, are not subject to this new rule.\n\nto date, the u.s. supreme court has never explicitly ruled that the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic american citizenship, and a number of legal scholars dispute the idea.\n\nmany leading conservative scholars argue the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to u.s. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the 14th amendment was ratified.\n\nfor almost two years, trump has signaled that he has reviewed signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, otherwise known as the anchor baby policy. that executive order, though, has yet to come up for consideration.\n\ntoday, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the u.s. under 18, exceeding the annual roughly four million american babies born every year and costing american taxpayers about $2.4 billion every year to subsidize hospital costs.\n\njohn binder is a reporter for breitbart news. follow him on twitter at @jxhnbinder.
the house committee on science space and technology released a report on thursday detailing how russia has been using social media platforms to disrupt domestic energy markets and influence domestic energy policies.\n\nthe 21-page report includes russian posts on twitter, facebook, and instagram, some with photographs and slogans.\n\nthe committee began investigating russian attempts to influence u.s. energy markets in the summer of 2017 when chairman [lamar] smith wrote [to] the secretary of treasury regarding russia's intricate money-laundering scheme. russian-sponsored agents funneled money to u.s. environmental organizations in an attempt to portray energy companies in a negative way and disrupt domestic energy markets, the report states.\n\nupon discovering that russia may have exploited american social media platforms to accomplish its disruptive objectives, the committee broadened the scope of its investigation, the report outlines. on september 26, 2017, the committee requested data from facebook and twitter as part of this expanded investigation.\n\nthe documents social media companies provided to the committee confirm russia's influence peddling, according to the report.\n\nthe report also includes an article posted on the buzzfeed news website that revealed how the russians used instagram to influence native americans on oil and gas pipelines, including the dakota access pipeline, the site of native american protests.\n\nsmith requested more information about russian actvity from social media companies last october, according to the report.\n\nthe committee received and reviewed the companies' produced documents for evidence of russian influence, the report states. twitter, facebook, and instagram were able to identify russian accounts linked to the internet research agency (ira), a russian company based in saint petersburg established by the russian government for the purpose of deceptively using various social and traditional media platforms to advance russian propaganda.\n\nthe information received from twitter, facebook, and instagram shows that russian agents indeed sought to disrupt u.s. energy markets and influence domestic energy policy by exploiting american social media platforms, the report states.\n\nsome of the key findings of the report include:\n\n• between 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 9,097 russian posts or tweets regarding u.s. energy policy or a current energy event on twitter, facebook, and instagram.\n\nbetween 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 4,334 ira accounts across twitter, facebook, and instagram.\n\naccording to information provided by twitter, more than four percent of all ira tweets were related to energy or environmental issues, a significant portion of content when compared to the eight percent of ira tweets that were related to the election in the u.s.\n\nthe ira targeted pipelines, fossil fuels, climate change, and other divisive issues to influence public policy in the u.s.\n\nthe report also reveals that russia wants to disrupt the cutting edge technology that has resulted in an american domestic energy renaissance, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking.\n\nhorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing as a means for producing oil and natural gas began in the early 2000s, the report states. at that time, there were approximately 26,000 hydraulically fractured wells in the united states, which accounted for 'less than 7%' of all u.s. marketed natural gas. by 2011, fracking had become the primary method for oil and natural gas development in the united states.\n\nsince 2014, fracked wells have 'accounted for most of all new wells drilled and completed,' the report states. the number of fracked wells had climbed 'to an estimated 300,000' by 2015, and were responsible for approximately 67 percent of all u.s. natural gas output.\n\nin january 2017, the office of the director of national intelligence released a report that contained clear evidence that the kremlin is financing and choreographing anti-fracking propaganda in the united states, the report states.\n\nthe report also highlights how u.s. energy exports reaching the global marketplace is a threat to russia's dominance in some of those markets. for example, according to the report, poland recently signed a five-year agreement with the united states to import liquefied natural gas into the country in an attempt to decrease dependency on russian energy supplies.\n\nclimate change is also an issue the russians are exploiting on social media, according to the report.\n\nnumerous russian posts focused on the ongoing debate about climate change by linking catastrophic weather events to climate change and divisively labeling one viewpoint as right and one as left, the report states. one post characterizes americans as ignoring major events that are allegedly signs of climate change. additionally, these posts frame the conservative viewpoint regarding climate change as a 'liberal hoax, all in an effort to generate further domestic controversy surrounding the issue of climate change.\n\nthe report concludes:\n\nthe

hungarian prime minister viktor orbán said thursday that french president emmanuel macron is the champion of europe's pro-immigration forces and therefore he has a duty to oppose him.\n\nthere is no denying that emmanuel macron is an important figure, in fact, the leader of the pro-immigration forces, mr. orbán told a press conference in budapest.\n\nresponding to a question from le monde, the prime minister said that he has good relations with macron, but when it comes to views of migration, the two are on opposite sides.\n\nit is nothing personal, but a matter of our countries' futures, orbán noted.\n\nif what he wants with regards to migration takes place in europe, that would be bad for hungary, therefore i must fight him, he said.\n\nmr. orbán said he hopes that parties committed to curbing illegal immigration will win a majority in the european parliament elections next may, in order to modify the current policy of the eu executive.\n\nhe also denounced the policy of chancellor angela merkel and the attitude of the german media, which are constantly pushing for europe to welcome more and more migrants, in opposition to the will of the hungarian people.\n\non that, there is no compromise possible, he insisted. german politics does not respect the hungarians' decision not to become an immigrant nation.\n\nthe prime minister also welcomed the initiative of poland and italy to form an alliance for the next european elections, to fight for the renaissance of european values ​​against the immigrationist schemes of the globalists.\n\nthe italian-polish alliance, the warsaw-rome alliance is one of the biggest events that could mark this beginning of the year, mr. orbán said, while holding up italian interior minister matteo salvini as a hero who managed to stop the influx of migrants in italy.\n\nmr. salvini met wednesday with his polish counterpart joachim brudzinski to discuss migration policies and european union (eu) border security.\n\nthe europe that will be formed in june will guide us all, unlike the one that exists today and is led by bureaucrats, salvini said during his visit to warsaw.\n\nthis is not the first time that mr. orbán has called out mr. macron as a key player in europe's pro-immigration forces.\n\nlast august, mr. orbán and mr. salvini labeled the globalist french president the leader of pro-migration parties in europe today at a joint press conference in milan, italy.\n\nthe two pro-sovereignty politicians singled out macron as their political enemy, announcing that they would form an anti-mass migration coalition ahead of european parliament elections to challenge his vision for the european union.\n\nhe leads the european force that backs migration, he's the leader of those parties who back migration to europe, and on the other side there's us who want to stop illegal migration, orbán said.\n\nfor his part, mr. macron welcomed the title, announcing that he is the chief adversary of the european populist bloc spearheaded by matteo salvini and viktor orbán.\n\nfollow thomas d. williams on twitter follow @tdwilliamsrome
thursday on the hugh hewitt show, sen. ron johnson (r-wi) said it is likely if president donald trump declared a national emergency to build a border wall it would be overturned in the courts.\n\npartial transcript as follows:\n\njohnson: well, first of all, i think the president will. he's certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether you're talking about the border right now. and from my standpoint, i think one of the things republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. you know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. we should be preparing, and i'm actually working on a piece of legislation, there's already one right now that i'm a co-sponsor of to fund the coast guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. hopefully, mitch mcconnell will bring it up on the floor of the senate. i don't think we should be fully opening these agencies, because democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. and of course, nancy pelosi was very clear in the white house yesterday that when president trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? you know, will i get my barrier funding? and she said no. and so again, the democrats are being hypocritical. they're paying lip service to border security. barriers actually work. they absolutely do. we need them. it's kind of a first step table stakes issue. but they're playing politics. and i hope the president stands strong.\n\nhewitt: should the president invoke a national emergency declaration even though there are good arguments on both sides whether or not that is constitutional?\n\njohnson: yeah, you know, i hope he doesn't. i think that does open up a pandora's box. i think we'd be far better off, again, with a very bare bones type of budget funding essential personnel, making sure those individuals get paid, funding just essential services of these agencies that are shut down right now. you know, one thing from a conservative standpoint, we could really take a look at, you know, where is the fat in some of these agencies and simply don't fund it. and i think that would provide a fair amount of pressure on democrats to really come to the negotiating table in good faith.\n\nhewitt: but the consequences are spreading. i know one person whose home purchase is screwed up, because fema can't issue flood insurance, and the cost of private flood insurance is prohibitive. and so there are consequences to a government shutdown that very few people see, but a lot of people feel. i'm not sure of the politics of this, but a national emergency declaration would allow you to reopen the government and then move the conversation to the courts, although as an article i guy, you're not going to like the idea that article ii can act unilaterally.\n\njohnson: no, i don't think any of us should. and let's face it, i think we probably understand what the courts would rule in this case. i mean, they're going to take it up to the 9th circuit, and we know the result of that, so we still won't get the barrier. so i want the barrier. i want a secure border. and i think the best way to do that is to acknowledge the fact, you know, the president was, came to our lunch yesterday, told everybody to hang together. you know, i'm all for doing that. i'm happy to hang with him. there will be increasing pressure, and legitimate pressure. i mean, there are some people really being harmed by this. there's no doubt about it. so let's address that specifically. don't completely reopen these agencies, but we should be ready with plan b as democrats, as nancy pelosi, chuck schumer continue to dig in, let's give them basically an offer that they simply can't refuse, but still puts an awful lot of pressure on them to negotiate in good faith and provide the barrier funding that we need.\n\nhewitt: but that ends up, again, leaving if not 800,000 people out of a paycheck, 400,000 people without a paycheck and the consequences of a shutdown, whereas a national emergency declaration allows you to reopen the government and moves the question of the president's power concerning the border squarely, and jonathan turley has written a great piece on this in the hill. i know you're an article i guy. but i'm not sure, it goes to the 9th circuit, they'll lose in the 9th circuit. it would go up to the supreme court. are you sure it would lose at the supreme court, senator johnson?\n\njohnson: no, i have no idea. i'm not a lawyer. but let's face it. the administration hasn't been doing really well in court on a lot of these issues, because we still have a lot of very liberal, progressive judges that are not going to really rule based on what the law is. it's going to be based on their policy preference. so let's face it. our courts have become very politicized, and that concerns me.\n\nhewitt: now, but do you believe if it got to the supreme court where there is a 5 member conservative majority, that he would win there on his right to protect the border via unilateral action?\n\njohnson: i really don't know.\n\nhewitt: i don't think anyone does. that's the right answer. i don't think anyone does. so given that it's an open question, and i know jonathan turley thinks it's an open question, you'll get some ideologues and both sides who will say it's a closed question. it's not. nobody knows what they would do. the key case here is youngstown sheet and tube. given that that is an open question, isn't that preferred to opening the government sort of halfway? or do you think yours is the preferred solution?\n\njohnson: well, again, i want to maintain pressure, because i actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. you know, hugh, we do have a crisis. you know, it drives me crazy how democrats are minimizing this problem. you know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? everybody recognized it. the obama administration responded to it. the cbp was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. about 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. in the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. you know, we have the flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. and once they get here, they are home free. and when i hear democrats talk about technology on the border, i mean, that's fine. we can track somebody, we can apprehend them. we process them. and then we disburse them, and they're here to stay, because if we don't detain them, it's almost impossible to remove them. that's the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally and hugh, there's nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, i think that's a low estimate, get sexually assaulted. i've seen the pictures of a dead, desiccated animal-chewed bodies in the desert because we incentivize people to try and come to this country illegally. there's nothing humane about that. that is the crisis.
california governor gavin newsom proposed his first budget for the state on friday, and it includes a tax on drinking water.\n\nthe budget, titled california for all, declares drinking water a fundamental right, and adds: the budget includes short-term measures to bring immediate relief to communities without safe drinking water and also proposes an ongoing sustainable funding source to address this problem into the future.\n\nthat source is a new fund, the safe and affordable drinking water fund:\n\nsafe and affordable drinking water fund—establish a new special fund, with a dedicated funding source from new water, fertilizer, and dairy fees, to enable the state water resources control board to assist communities, particularly disadvantaged communities, in paying for the short-term and long-term costs of obtaining access to safe and affordable drinking water. this proposal is consistent with the policy framework of sb 623, introduced in the 2017-18 legislative session. the budget also includes $4.9 million general fund on a one-time basis for the state water resources control board and the department of food and agriculture to take initial steps toward implementation of this new safe and affordable drinking water program, including (1) implementation of fee collection systems, (2) adoption of an annual implementation plan, and (3) development of a map of high-risk aquifers used as drinking water sources.\n\nthe san francisco chronicle notes: the details of the proposed tax are unknown, but a similar proposal was abandoned by then-governor jerry brown last year after failing to garner enough support in the legislature.\n\ncritics have already slammed the plan, with former republican gubernatorial candidate travis allen urging fellow republicans to take back the state, and the howard jarvis taxpayer association and the association of california water agencies saying the state should tap into its budget surplus to pay for the needed clear water supplies.\n\njoel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
senator lindsey graham led a group of republican senators warning that they would oppose a swift passage of the economic rescue package unless changes are made to its unemployment benefits section.\n\nthat prompted vermont senator bernie sanders to say he too would hold up the bill over his objections to the aid to u.s. businesses.\n\nunless republican senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, i am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund, senator sanders tweeted.\n\ngraham's last-minute objections to the deal agreed to by the white house, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, and democrat leader chuck schumer sent shudders through financial markets. stocks lost about half their gains for the day as it became apparent that the deal was not as sure to pass as it had seemed.\n\ngraham said in a statement issued with senator tim scott, the south carolina republican, and senator ben sasse, the nebraska republican, that there was a massive drafting error in the economic stimulus bill.\n\nunless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work, the senators said. we must sadly oppose the fast-tracking of this bill until this text is addressed, or the department of labor issues regulatory guidance that no american would earn more by not working than by working.\n\nin ordinary circumstances, unemployment benefits are designed to pay workers less than they would earn by working, creating an incentive to seek and accept work. the economic rescue package under consideration by senate provides for bolstered benefits that could, in some circumstances, pay some workers more than they had earned while employed.\n\nthis bill pays you more not to work than if you were working, graham said during a press conference wednesday. if this is not a drafting error, then this is the worst idea that i've seen in a long time.\n\nproponents of the more generous benefits say that in the current situation, where many businesses have been closed by anti-pandemic efforts and workers are being urged to stay home, this objection is meritless. when people are told not to work for the sake of public health, disincentivizing work is not a serious problem.\n\nsenator rick scott, the florida republican, joined the other three senators at a press conference on the issue wednesday.\n\nonce we get this crisis behind us, we shouldn't have policies in place that disincentivize people from returning to the workforce,  the florida senator tweeted.\n\ngraham's comments suggest he did not understand that millions of american workers are being shut out of their workplaces by government policy, minimizing the cost created by alleged incentives not to work. what's more, workers who voluntarily quit their jobs do not receive unemployment benefits.\n\nsanders' responded by raising his own objections to the bill. it's likely that if graham and his fellow republicans open up parts of the bill to renegotiation, democrats will also demand changes.\n\nunless republican senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation, i am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund. pic.twitter.com/7x0o9c4boo — bernie sanders (@sensanders) march 25, 2020\n\nthat could result in delays to the rescue package that could make the economic damage from the pandemic much more severe.
the lack of taxpayer payments to central american economic migrants is a crisis on the border, says california democrat scott peters, who presented the party's weekend message.\n\nit's a crisis when this administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on american streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations, he said in the carefully drafted january 11 speech.\n\npeters did not say how much financial aid and healthcare must be given by u.s. taxpayers to the economic migrants as they head for u.s. jobs, communities, and schools.\n\noverall, the speech tried to blame president donald trump for public alarm over the growing flood of economic migrants into u.s. job markets and neighborhoods. peters said:\n\nthere is a humanitarian crisis created by him. it's a crisis when the president threatens to shut down the nation's legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick. it a crisis when the president spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didn't exist, like he did in november, as a political stunt to rally the base. it's a crisis when this administration is allowing women and children – babies – to be dumped on american streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.\n\nin reality, migrants bring their children because multiple democrat-backed loopholes in u.s asylum law allow them to walk through the border walls and into u.s jobs, welfare programs, schools, and communities.\n\nthe democrats' speech tried to reassure voters that democrats are not pushing for a policy of open borders, even though nearly all democratic legislators oppose any policies which might reduce the flow of migrants. nearly all democrats also oppose the deportation of economic migrants, even after judges say they do not meet u.s. legal requirements for asylum.\n\npeters said:\n\nwhen president trump says democrats are against border security and for open borders, he's lying. we do not support a multi-billion dollar wall that will destroy sensitive lands, take private property, and can be tunneled under, climbed over or cut through, all while illegal border crossings have steadily declined over the past two decades. no. that's not border security. that's borderline crazy.\n\ninstead of a border wall – like the triple-layered wall which effectively protects his district from migration out of mexico — peters touted the democrats' promise of a virtual wall of technology and sensors. legislators know the virtual wall does not stop migrants — but it does shield some pro-migration politicians from worried voters.\n\npeters pushed that claim while touting a draft bill that would require the border agencies to postpone action until they have studied the migration problem they have studied and grappled with for decades:\n\nin the last congress, my colleagues pete aguilar of california, a democrat, and will hurd of texas, a republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on. it would have directed homeland security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer congress a strategy for each section of the border. it might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in san diego, it's easy to dig tunnels underneath. it might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day. it might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor. or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. but if homeland security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, they'd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.\n\nnancy pelosi is pushing the no-wall 'technology wall' alternative to trump's actual wall. the pr scam worked for biz under bush/obama – until the public picked trump to build a real wall. but it now might help provide pr cover for democrats to compromise. https://t.co/hqx024ecty — neil munro (@neilmunrodc) january 11, 2019\n\nnationwide, the u.s. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. that flood of outside labor spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nthe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nimmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. in turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor u.s. latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as berkeley and oakland.
this year's oscar broadcast could be a lot less boring as the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announced monday that acceptance speeches can no longer contain the endless lists of thank yous that have become a staple at the awards ceremony.\n\nat the annual oscar nominee luncheon in beverly hills on monday, the academy announced that for the first time, all nominees would submit written lists of those they wish to thank that will then be displayed on screens at the dolby theatre and on viewers' screens at home.\n\nas you probably are aware, and we don't want to embarrass anybody, but there is a long list of winners who have totally forgotten their directors, their husbands, their wives, their children and their animals, producer david hill said, according to the independent. it's a permanent record which could be kept, even framed and kept in the family forever. how cool is that?!\n\nacceptance speeches were capped at 45 seconds beginning in 2010. the new move allows the academy to skip past what is traditionally the most boring part of any oscars ceremony, and nominees will be under less pressure to remember every single producer or associate they ever worked with.\n\nwhile the new policy will help cut down on famously long speeches like those from dallas buyers club winner matthew mcconaughey and monster's ball's halle berry, it could also deprive viewers of some of the most memorable oscars moments ever, like cuba gooding, jr.'s acceptance speech at the 1997 oscars:\n\njoe pesci, however, is unlikely to be affected.

lawmakers in north dakota are taking up legislation that would allow competing in sports in high school and college based on one's biological sex.\n\nif it becomes law it would mean that girls or boys could not participate in sports based on their preferred gender, they would have to compete based on their actual sex.\n\nthe grand forks herald reported on the bill:\n\nhouse bill 1298 would prevent publicly funded institutions, like high schools and universities, from allowing any individual who was assigned the opposite sex at birth to participate on an athletic team that is designed exclusively for females or exclusively for males. additionally, the bill would outlaw any state-owned athletic facility from hosting a competition in which an athlete competes against anyone outside of the gender they were assigned at birth. but while lgbtq advocates argued the bill would have far-reaching implications for transgender people in north dakota, its lead sponsor, rep. ben koppelman, r-west fargo, said the legislation has nothing to do with transgender athletes. instead, koppelman said he is pursuing changes to the law out of a concern for fairness in sports and to prevent women from being disadvantaged by having to compete against men. while transgender athletes are not explicitly noted in koppelman's bill, critics argued that it clearly targets the transgender community. house minority leader josh boschee, d-fargo, said he couldn't think of any other reason that this bill would be introduced.\n\ni kind of dismiss the idea that it should be about trans, because it's not about trans — it's about fair competition, koppelman said. what it's based on is science that says, 'here are the physiological differences between people when they are born.' and these are irreversible things.\n\ni don't know the problem that's trying to be solved, koppelman said.\n\nright now under a north dakota high school activities association 2015 statute transgender students taking hormonal supplements can compete in sports under their gender identity on a case by case basis.\n\nunder this policy, a student who has transitioned from female to male may compete in boys sports but is no longer eligible to compete in girls sports, the tribune reported. a student who has transitioned from male to female may continue to compete in boys sports and is eligible to compete in girls sports after completing one year of testosterone suppression.\n\nthe tribune interviewed opponents to the legislation, including libby skarin, a regional campaign director with the american civil liberties union (aclu), who said the bill is an attack on transgender north dakotans.\n\neither don't compete at all, or compete in a sport that doesn't match their gender identity, skarin said.\n\nsen. janne myrdal, r-edinburg, is a co-sponsor on the bill and said it was about women's rights and disagrees.\n\ni would never want my daughter to play in sports and have a guy beat her out in track or out in javelin, where she has no chance, myrdal said.\n\nunlike a transgender athlete bill defeated in the south dakota legislature in 2019, koppelman's bill also applies to collegiate athletics, a difference that skarin said could put north dakota out of step with national governing bodies like the national collegiate athletic association, the tribune reported.\n\nthe ncaa supports athletes competing according to their perceived gender rather than their biological sex.\n\nmydral said in the report that students have to make choices, including whether they want to pursue athletics.\n\npeople will scream and holler and say, 'oh, you denied them being in sports,' she said. yeah, maybe we do. so maybe by making that choice to try to change your gender, you lose some opportunities. but you're not going to take all women and girls' opportunities away just because you wish to do that.\n\nfollow penny starr on twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
the united kingdom has shrugged off concerns of handing china a back-door key to the nation's critical national infrastructure and spiking post-brexit trade with key anglosphere allies, signing off the involvement of huawei in the future 5g data networks.\n\ntech giant huawei, a company critics claim is controlled by the chinese government and uses its advanced, cheap, and pervasive equipment to commit espionage on foreign powers — claims the company strongly denies — will have a so-called limited role in the rollout of next-generation 5g technology, the british government has decided.\n\ndelingpole: huawei, coronavirus and boris's great brexit betrayal https://t.co/xdfshrd9cj — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) january 27, 2020\n\nthe move was decided tuesday by the uk national security council, a group of senior cabinet ministers chaired by the prime minister and attended by civil servants and military bosses, following advice from the civil service, which decided in spite of the many warnings and potential pitfalls presented by the huawei deal to rubber-stamp the deal last week.\n\nunder the decision, huawei will not be permitted to supply equipment to sensitive parts of the network core, but will provide a third of the equipment to what the bbc reports to be the periphery of britain's future 5g network. the report states the permitted equipment will include masts, clearly implying the radio backbone of the network itself which will handle consumer and business data will use huawei technology.\n\nthe distinction between the core and the periphery has been enough for the government to overlook security warnings from both senior intelligence figures as home, and key allies abroad. but the united states, for instance, which has been absolutely clear in its calls for huawei to be totally excluded, believes the distinction now will not protect the network from potential espionage and sabotage in future.\n\nwhat is less clear, is why the british government has so willingly entered into a relationship with huawei which appears to sabotage the government's own aims on brexit — namely signing trade deals with close allies after leaving the european union. australia and new zealand have warned the uk against imperilling the five-eyes intelligence sharing agreement — the deepest and most successful of its kind in human history — by admitting huawei into the nation's data architecture, and the united states has explicitly said huawei involvement would imperil a post-brexit trade deal.\n\nu.s. warns britain accepting huawei 5g will imperil post-brexit trade deal https://t.co/rik3ojyxhk — breitbart london (@breitbartlondon) january 25, 2020\n\nthis is of particular importance because signing a trade deal with the united states quickly after brexit appears to be a key lynchpin of the post-eu strategy, as an easy passage of that agreement would be a major signal to the rest of the world that the uk is emerging ready to trade, and easy to do business with. it also holds the european union's feet to the fire, as their anticipated prevarication over signing a deal with the uk would be shown up as a sham in the light of a quick deal with the u.s.\n\nyet, the bbc reports, china seems to have given the united kingdom a simple choice — choose huawei or face substantial repercussions to trade and investment. given the choice between the u.s. and china, prime minister johnson appears to have chosen beijing.\n\ngiven this disconnect in stated policy and public action, some may view the advice of unelected civil servants to the national security council to ignore security and trade concerns and sign with huawei anyway with concern.\n\nresponding tuesday, a white house spokesman said the trump administration was disappointed with the decision, while conservative statesman and former party leader sir iain duncan smith has said the decision beggars belief.\n\nklon kitchen of the heritage foundation said of china's previous bad-faith behaviour on leveraging their tech equipment installed in foreign nations: china has already shown it's perfectly willing and able to exploit others in this way, having siphoned data from the african union headquarters in ethiopia, over networks its state-owned companies constructed earlier this decade. recent history and common sense are united: it would be utterly foolish for britain to give china similar access.\n\njames delingpole writes of this in breitbart london:\n\nthe huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything boris johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration. it's also a betrayal of the very thing on which boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful brexit. one of the key elements in boris's vision of a bright, post-brexit future for britain outside the european union is international trade: all those incredible deals britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by eu regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by president trump with the u.s. but trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the huawei deal. if you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the remain-biased civil service — led by arch-remainer mark sedwill — is using the huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage boris's post-brexit deals in order to make the brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the eu more likely. you would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment. we have scotched the remainer snake but we have not killed it.

brazil's new president, jair bolsonaro, was sworn in on january 1. he won a landslide election in october on a platform that's pro-business, pro-gun, pro-united states, and pro-israel. at the same time, his platform was also anti-crime, anti-political correctness, anti-cuba, and anti-venezuela.\n\nin his inaugural address, bolsonaro made it clear that his views haven't changed. for instance, pledging his strong support for the police and the military, he recalled the words ordem e progresso, emblazoned on his country's flag: the national motto is order and progress. no society can develop without respecting these:\n\na recent poll showed his approval rating to be 75 percent.\n\nyet at the same time, bolsonaro has plenty of enemies, especially in the international media. although he embraces the label tropical trump, the media escalate from there; it's common to see him characterized as a neo-fascist, or just a plain old fascist.\n\nyet brazilians will likely judge bolsonaro on that most familiar of metrics: the economy. the country is, after all, poor—it ranks 110th in the world—and it shouldn't be.\n\nby territory, brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world, and on that land, and under that land, are vast natural resources. it's been estimated, in fact, that brazil's natural wealth—much of it gold and uranium—is worth $21.8 trillion. that's a lot of money, about $103,000 for every brazilian man, woman, and child.\n\nit is, of course, important that some equitable plan for resource development be put in place. that is, a plan that rewards risk-taking and entrepreneurship but also assures workers and citizens a piece of the action. we might note that one of the signal successes of the previous left-wing regime was its program of family allowances, aimed at the poor and working poor. such conscious spreading of the wealth is, of course, good politics, and yet it's also good policy because every citizen deserves a fair shake and because it's important to preserve social peace.\n\nyet if fairly dividing the pie is important, strongly expanding the pie is even more important. there's wealth in brazil, but not nearly enough of it—at least not now.\n\nand part of that problem is that brazil is remarkably undeveloped. if we look at a map showing where the nation's 211 million people are located, we see that they are mostly huddled along the atlantic ocean. we might compare this situation to that of the u.s.; imagine what our prosperity would be like today if we had never pushed across north america, to texas, california—and everywhere else west of the atlantic seaboard.\n\nso why haven't brazilians gone west, as we did? part of the answer is that the territory is mostly amazonian rain forest, and as such, for most of brazil's history, it has been inhospitable to settlement, let alone development.\n\nyet by the time that new technologies to foster development in amazonia had come along—including air conditioning, mosquito abatement, and the helicopter—a new and hostile political attitude had taken hold.\n\nthe new thinking focused on preservation, of both the land and the native people. some of this new thinking was guilt about past ill-treatment of indigenous folk, leading to the present-day idea that they should remain in their environment, living as they always had. and some of it, too, was an emerging ecological consciousness; amazonia is, undeniably, a fascinating and abundant region, and as such, it has become a preoccupation of greens around the world.\n\nas a result, much of brazil's land became off-limits to development. today, indigenous tribes account for .4 percent of brazil's population, and yet they inhabit 13 percent of the land. to put that another way, natives are about 32 times more land rich than the average brazilian. admittedly, there are often violations of these pro-native restrictions, as illegal poachers and loggers seek quick profits in no-go zones. and yet because these violations are illegal, they are episodic, not offering the potential economic benefits of permanent settlements and systematic development—that is, of the kind that could offer good jobs at good wages to all brazilians.\n\ncombined with other environmental restrictions on land use, amazonia has become something of a giant national park, and that fencing off of resources has helped to impoverish the nation. and, of course, nobody is poorer than the indigenous tribes; one wonders if people living in huts are really happy living that way—and many do, in fact, flee.\n\nindeed, if we want a quick measure of which countries are rich and which aren't, we might view a nighttime map of the world. where we see dark, not light, there's not many people, nor much prosperity. and brazil has plenty of people; the problem is that they lack the wealth to purchase that obvious indicator of economic progress, lights at night.\n\nwe can say that brazil today is a bit like what the u.s. would be like if the land west of the appalachian mountains was mostly proscribed from economic development. (in fact, the u.s. federal government owns a prosperity-crimping 28 percent of the land in this country, although that's a tale for another time.)\n\nmoreover, as we all know, in recent years there's been a sudden surge of attempted restrictions on economic activity in every country in the world—namely, international mandates to clamp down on carbon dioxide, all aimed at doing something about climate change.\n\nthe average brazilian doesn't consider climate change to be a very important issue, especially not in relation to truly terrible problems such as poverty—or the crime rate, which is even more terrible. indeed, brazil is rated as having the highest crime rate in the world, and street crime is terrifyingly rampant.\n\nyet still, before bolsonaro, leftist brazilian governments had meekly accepted the western green agenda, even if it hurt economic development. such is the power of ideas—and of foreign aid with strings attached to it.\n\nthen came bolsonaro. his campaign platform included a pledge to withdraw from the 2015 paris climate framework, and he has named ernesto araújo, a leading critic of climate activism, his foreign minister. araújo has been unsparing in his critique of foreign influence on his country; as he wrote in october, the tactic of the left essentially consists of the following: to sequester legitimate causes and noble concepts and to pervert them to serve their political project of total domination:\n\nso we can see that in his fierce antagonism toward foreign hegemonists, araújo almost sounds like a leftist himself. and yet he's not: he's simply a brazilian nationalist, tired of other countries imposing their will on his country.\n\nin december, bolsonaro himself made the case for more economic growth: environmental politics can't muddle with brazil's development. today, the economy is almost back on track thanks to agribusiness, and they are suffocated by environmental questions.\n\nyet in addition, brazil's potential wealth extends far beyond the resources that have already been identified.\n\nas bloomberg news has reported, bolsonaro carried chunks of metal with him on the campaign trail, all to make a point about the value of mining. one of those chunks was of niobium, which is one of the rare-earth elements that undergird the modern economy. because it is needed to strengthen steel and semiconductors, niobium is precious; it sells for about $42,000 a ton. brazil has 40 million tons of niobium, and if we do the math, that's $1.68 trillion—which is a lot for a country whose annual gdp totals barely more than $2 trillion. the metal is already being mined in brazil, but bolsonaro's point is that there's a lot more niobium in the country–and many other rare earths, too; brazilians just have to find them and get them out of the ground.\n\nas an aside, we might note that rare-earth elements are a key strategic concern of the u.s., since they are vital to our military technology, as well as to our civilian tech. and yet today, the u.s. is 100 percent dependent on china for 29 minerals.\n\nif such dependency on a potential foe doesn't seem to be a good idea, that's because it isn't. the trump administration has emphasized the need for domestic rare-earth production, but with distinctly limited success, at least so far. and so in the meantime, it would be enormously helpful if we could import rare earths from brazil.\n\nneedless to say, the thought of digging up amazonia in pursuit of minerals is horrifying—horrifying, that is, to western environmentalists. yet for their part, brazilians seem okay with it; after all, they just voted bolsonaro into office. as this author has argued in the past, if a resource is sitting there, it only makes sense that hungry people will wish to see it utilized. green elites may sentimentalize poverty as living in harmony with nature, but the poor would rather have refrigerators, automobiles, and good health care.\n\ngiven this reality—that people won't willingly stay poor while wealth sits under their feet—one might think that western greens would be well advised to work with brazil, so that the nation's mineral wealth can be developed responsibly. that is, resources could be mined using best practices, such that environmental damage is minimized and then the land completely reclaimed. after all, mine reclamation has made huge advances; with proper techniques, the wealth can be extracted and the land made as good as ever.\n\nyet instead, it seems as though western greens are saddling up for a major confrontation with bolsonaro. on december 27, the sierra club magazine headlined a story, what will it take to rein in the trump of brazil? brazil's president-elect threatens the planet. in that article—which reads exactly like the lefty imperialism that ernesto araújo was railing against—the sierra club declares, bolsonaro has shown a responsiveness to economic and international pressure, which could be one way to contain him.\n\nwe might pause over that word: contain. that is, the people of brazil just elected a new leader, knowing full well of his pro-growth agenda. and yet now, the sierra club, and other western greens, seek to contain him—and, by extension, to contain the brazilian standard of living.\n\nwill brazilian nationalists be pleased to discover that the greens are actively using international financial levers against their country? and how will ordinary brazilians respond to these threats to their standard of living? it will be interesting to see what happens in this looming standoff.\n\nlike donald trump in north america, jair bolsonaro in south america is an experiment. both are conservative economic nationalists, both promised during their campaigns to unleash prosperity. both are challenging the entrenched forces of orthodoxy, including green orthodoxy, at home and abroad:\n\ntrump has his track record, and bolsonaro is starting his. mindful of the high stakes, other economic nationalists, in other countries, should be paying close attention.
well-heeled customers of the new york times paid more than $7000, not including airfare, to tour the country of iran and even visit the home of the late ayatollah khomeini. this at a time when a washington post reporter had been in a brutal tehran prison for more than two years.\n\nthe official tour guides of these trips included by-lined reporters and columnists of the times, raising ethical questions and questions about the times' often favorable coverage of the repressive regime. lee smith of the tablet goes so far as to accuse the times of buying the iran concession.\n\nthe trips are a part of the new york times' glitzy times journeys that typically sends wealthy readers to places like austria and great britain.\n\njames kirchik, writing in foreign policy, said it is dismaying that the times would collaborate in a business venture with a government currently imprisoning an american reporter.\n\ncalled iran: tales from persia, the 13-day tour included on the ground experts who will help untangle this nation's complex timeline. starting in tehran, you will journey across the country, through beautiful landscapes, arid mountains and rural villages, learning about the traditions and cultures of a land who influence has been felt for thousands of years.\n\nthe business aspect of the arrangement would almost certainly have to be approved by the iranian government, with the regime taking a cut of the new york times action.\n\nsmith accuses the times of going into this business arrangement to spare their own people the fate of jason rezaian [washington post reporters who was just released] while also ensuring that they would have plenty of access to the regime — or the people who speak to western reporters, namely the moderates. he calls the arrangement a bribe.\n\nsmith calls this a new journalism model where the times makes money not on getting new readers, but on selling travel to authoritarian regimes and gaining journalistic access in the bargain.\n\nwould the regime have struck a deal with the times if the paper of record promised to send its toughest, hardest-hitting reporting — the kinds of tough guys like burns or c.j. chivers who would rather have their fingernails pulled out one by one by the torturers in evin prison than pull their punches in print? he asks.\n\nrather, the times uses name reporters like roger cohen, elaine sciolino, and john f. burns, who moonlight as tour guides. smith excoriates the times' man in tehran thomas erdbrink, who has consistently lauded current iranian president hassan rouhani. smith says, selective ignorance seems to be erdbrink's journalistic trademark.\n\nsmith accuses erdbrink of going out of his way defend the iranian president, such as the time erdbrink reported that rouhani went on cnn and condemned the holocaust though it was pointed out rouhani never used that word. erdbrink also reported that rouhani wished israelis a happy rosh hashanah though the times later had to correct that.\n\nit is unclear whether jews or homosexuals are allowed on the new york times tours to iran.\n\nfollow austin ruse on twitter @austinruse.
democrat presidential candidates entered the ninth democrat presidential primary debate on wednesday in attack mode.\n\nthe candidates launched at least 50 different attacks in the debate that, at times, appeared to overwhelm the nbc debate moderators.\n\nthe candidates who participated in the eight prior debates immediately teamed up against newcomer, former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, who took the debate stage for the first time on wednesday.\n\nmr. bloomberg had policies in new york city of stop and frisk, which went after african american and latino people in an outrageous way, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) said in his first debate answer. that is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.\n\nsen. elizabeth warren (d-ma) went further, reminding voters that bloomberg called women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, comparing him to president donald trump.\n\nlook, i'll support whoever the democratic nominee is, she said. but understand this: democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\n\nsen. amy klobuchar (d-mn) attacked bloomberg's campaign for suggesting that the three more moderate candidates should get out of the way to allow him to become the nominee.\n\ni'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from mayor bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him, she said.\n\njoe biden began the debate by challenging bloomberg on new york city's policy of stop-and-frisk.\n\nhe didn't get a whole lot done, biden said about bloomberg. he had stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\n\npete buttigieg began his remarks by warning democrats that the democrat race could end up between bloomberg and sanders.\n\nlet's put forward somebody who's actually a democrat, he said, alluding to sanders' political identity as a democratic socialist and bloomberg's flip from a republican to an independent to a democrat.\n\nwe shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out, he continued. we can do better.\n\nsanders then pivoted to buttigieg, reminding voters that he took money from billionaires like michael bloomberg, prompting buttigieg to accuse sanders of fueling a toxic political environment that produced online attacks against the culinary union in las vegas.\n\nsen. amy klobuchar jumped in to attack sanders' insurance bill, citing the millions of americans who could lose their health care under his plan.\n\nwarren then attacked buttigieg, klobuchar, and sanders on their health care plans.\n\nbuttigieg, she said, had a health care plan that was a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. klobuchar, she said, was like a post-it note, that read, insert plan here. and sanders, she said, only fueled online attacks of people who questioned how it would work.\n\nklobuchar pivoted to a las vegas gambling attack on both warren's and sanders' plan for health care.\n\nwhy is medicare for all not on the wheel? she asked. why is it not on the wheel? because two-thirds of the democratic senators are not even on that bill.\n\nbiden then stepped in to warn that sanders' bill cost over $35 trillion and warned that he had no decent answer for how it would get paid for and also attacked bloomberg for calling obamacare a disgrace.\n\nwhat am i, chicken liver? bloomberg responded when warren jumped in to attack buttigieg's plan.\n\nas the moderators turned the debate topic to bloomberg's support of the stop-and-frisk policies in new york, biden pivoted back to his attacks of the practice.\n\nlet's get the order straight. and it's not whether he apologized or not, he said. it's the policy. the policy was abhorrent. and it was a fact of violation of every right people have.\n\nwarren attacked bloomberg by accusing him of willful ignorance of the stop-and-frisk impact on communities of color.\n\nwhen the moderators questioned whether sanders was being transparent about his health records, he pivoted to note that bloomberg also had two stents in his heart, suggesting that he was not as healthy as he suggested.\n\nbut buttigieg responded by attacking sanders for failing to be transparent about his health but added that he was delighted that the senator was in fighting shape and pivoted back to attacking sanders for failing to explain how he would pay for his healthcare plan.\n\nklobuchar attacked sanders for failing to release the records from his physical and called for bloomberg to release his tax returns.\n\nafter bloomberg said he was working on it, warren said that perhaps the billionaire should pay his accountants overtime to get it done and then launched into an attack of his record with women, calling him to free former employees from non-disclosure agreements.\n\nsanders attacked bloomberg by reminding democrats that he supported former president george w. bush for president in 2004 and donated to republicans.\n\nbiden reminded voters that bloomberg did not support obama for president.\n\nafter the moderators switched topics, buttigieg then jumped to attack klobuchar for failing to remember the name of the mexican president.\n\nare you trying to say that i'm dumb? klobuchar replied. or are you mocking me here, pete?\n\nas klobuchar tried to make an argument for her experience as the senator of minnesota, buttigieg compared her to failed presidential candidate walter mondale, also from minnesota.\n\nthe nbc debate moderators took a break, which led to a series of questions on nevada-focused issues before the fight resumed.\n\nsanders hit bloomberg for contributing to a corrupt political system that allowed the wealthy to escape high taxes.\n\nbloomberg hit sanders for being one of 99 other senators that allowed him to operate in the system.\n\ni was thinking there was going to be a boxing rematch on saturday in vegas, and those guys should go down there, klobuchar replied, referring to an upcoming boxing fight in the state.\n\nsanders continued, attacking bloomberg for a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth and income, which prompted bloomberg to call sanders a communist.\n\nwe're not going to throw out capitalism, he said. we tried. other countries tried that. it was called communism, and it just didn't work.\n\nsanders continued to attack bloomberg for his wealth until the former new york city mayor reminded him that the vermont senator owns three houses.\n\nwhat a wonderful country we have. the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses, he said.\n\nbuttigieg then flattered sanders by saying he was into bernie before it was cool in high school, but then immediately pivoted to attack his healthcare plan and raising taxes to pay for it.\n\nwhen warren got time, she attacked biden and klobuchar for being eager to be liked by mitch mcconnell and buttigieg for taking money from big donors and changing his positions.\n\nbuttigieg used his time to attack bloomberg for opposing raising the minimum wage and trying to buy the election while sanders was trying to burn the house down.\n\nhe also criticized klobuchar for voting to confirm trump's nominee for customs and border protection.\n\nas klobuchar and buttigieg bickered back and forth, debate moderator chuck todd intervened.\n\nguys, guys, we are at the end here. we are at the end here, he said. i've got to let that one go.
french president emmanuel macron has confirmed that he had spoken to u.s. president donald j trump and that members of the g7 will hold an emergency leaders' summit via videoconference on monday to discuss coronavirus.\n\nmr macron announced via twitter on friday: following my call with donald trump and all g7 leaders, we agreed to organise an extraordinary leaders' summit by videoconference on monday on covid-19.\n\nwe will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatment, and work on an economic and financial response.\n\nfollowing my call with @realdonaldtrump and all g7 leaders, we agreed to organize an extraordinary leaders summit by videoconference on monday on covid-19. we will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response. — emmanuel macron (@emmanuelmacron) march 13, 2020\n\nthe g7, or group of seven, is comprised of the leaders of the united states, united kingdom, france, germany, italy, canada, and japan, and generally meets to discuss economic policy and address challenges affecting global economic growth.\n\nthe announcement was made two days after president trump unveiled a travel ban on 26 european countries in the schengen zone visa-free travel area. a number of countries across europe have recently enacted restrictions including shutting schools and limiting the internal movement of people. the czech republic has followed president trump's lead and has enacted a travel ban of 13 countries considered to be high-risk nations.\n\nalso on friday, the world health organization's director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus announced: europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from china. more cases are now being reported every day than were reported in china at the height of its epidemic.\n\npresident trump has criticised the european union's response to the pandemic, saying: the european union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from china and other hotspots… as a result, a large number of new clusters in the united states were seeded by travelers from europe.
