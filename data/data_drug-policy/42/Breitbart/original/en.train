Columnist Pat Buchanan said President Obama's reluctance to intervene on foreign policy is good and his fundamental idea is poorly applied, but is right on Friday's McLaughlin Group.\n\nBuchanan argued President Obama's foreign policy legacy is a combination, I — his reluctance to intervene is good, but Libya is a disaster. He shouldn't have put the red line down. And there — so I think, overall, I don't give him high marks. But I do — his fundamental idea that we go in, we go together, and we get out and come home is right, but I think the application of it's been very poor.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Australian airline Qantas has reportedly advised employees not to manterrupt women or use gender-specific pronouns.\n\nAccording to the Evening Standard, Qantas airline staff are said to have received an information pack as part of its 'Spirit of Inclusion' month detailing a list of potentially offensive terms.\n\nOffensive terms allegedly included gender-specific words such as mum, dad, husband, and wife, as well as words such as love, honey, and darling, while employees were instructed to minimise manterruptions, which was defined as when men interrupt or speak over women.\n\nLanguage can make groups of people invisible. For example, the use of the term chairman can reinforce the idea that leaders are always men, the information pack reportedly stated.\n\nIn another section, the arrival of the British in Australia was reportedly described as an invasion.\n\nDescribing the arrival of the Europeans as a 'settlement' is a view of Australian history from the perspective of England rather than Australia, the information pack declared.\n\nThe news was both mocked and criticized by users on Twitter, with one user asking, Hey will #Qantas now have to rename the cockpit?\n\nOthers blamed the Diversity Council of Australia, who was reportedly behind the change, while some announced their intentions to boycott the airline.\n\nWho or what are the Diversity Council of Australia??? Telling us to remove words like guys and mankind and husband from the workplace in order to build inclusion. And Qantas agrees!!! — Alan Jones (@AlanJones) March 6, 2018\n\nYou can't make this stuff up. Qantas has issued a @DivCouncilAus-designed HR document to staff, recommending they don't use words like chairman or guys, but they won't be renaming their Chairman's Lounge https://t.co/abAze1Gq98 — Rachel Baxendale (@rachelbaxendale) March 6, 2018\n\nLeft-wing musician and actress Cher, however, appeared to congratulate the change, posting simply, Thanks Qantas.\n\nThanks Qantas💋 — Cher (@cher) March 5, 2018\n\nTony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister, accused Qantas of engaging in political correctness gone way over the top.\n\nFrankly, if companies like Qantas want to give their customers a better a deal, they can scrap all these inclusion units, just scrap them and save the money, because it's just rubbish this idea that we need a corporate thought police, he expressed. I mean really and truly, it is a complete and absolute utter waste of money. Qantas staff are very good people, they are decent, sensitive people, and they don't need this kind of nonsense. It is an insult to them… This is the very weird and strange times in which we live.\n\nUpdate — Qantas contacted Breitbart News with the following statement:\n\n· We never issued a booklet to staff to tell them how to/how not to speak to customers on board. · We DID put some collateral on our corporate intranet about inclusive language in the workplace as part of a focus on inclusion during the month of March. · These were not rules or a change of policy or procedures. It was simply some material to start an internal discussion about how language choice can impact how inclusive (or not) a workplace is. The material was developed by the Diversity Council of Australia and their content is used by a lot of workplaces, but it is certainly not designed to be customer-facing. · Unfortunately, this has been misreported by a couple of outlets and since picked up by other media including the Evening Standard. We're providing this same advice to those other outlets.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni told reporters following a cabinet meeting Thursday that Bolsonaro intends to fire any communists who work for the government currently, contending that those holding opposing ideological views to the new government cannot properly execute its goals.\n\nBolsonaro, who defeated the socialist Workers' Party (PT) candidate Fernando Haddad in October's run-off presidential election, ran a campaign vowing to eradicate Marxist thought from the government and from Brazil's schools and spearhead a movement of small-government conservatives in Latin America who opposed the ideologies of the region's dictatorships, Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua.\n\nSociety said 'enough' to socialist and communist ideas which, in the past 30 years, brought us to the chaos were are living today, Lorenzoni told reporters, explaining that this mandate made it necessary to remove Marxists from top positions in the government according to the Spanish news agency EFE. To accomplish this, the Bolsonaro administration will begin a review of some of the highest-ranking officials.\n\nBolsonaro's chief of staff said that at least 320 government employees were notified following the cabinet-level meeting that they would be evaluated to ensure that their work goals were compatible with what Bolsonaro was hoping to accomplish in office. These would face dismissal from the government if Lorenzoni concluded that they held far-left ideological beliefs in conflict with his administration.\n\nIt doesn't make sense to have officials with antagonistic ideological orientations [working for us], Lorenzoni asserted. It is not reasonable to have socialists, communists, any of that stuff here.\n\nLorenzoni was careful to specify that the process will not be a witch hunt and, to that end, first we dismiss, then we discuss, and those who are found to be compatible workers for Bolsonaro's government will return to their positions.\n\nThe primary reason for this reevaluation, Lorenzoni explained, was that the PT had ruled the country for 14 years, most of the 21st century. While its two presidents fared poorly after their tenures – Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is serving a 12-year sentence for corruption while president; Dilma Rousseff was impeached out of office and lost a senate bid last year – 14 years is over a decade of low-profile hires throughout the expansive Brazilian federal state infrastructure. Maintaining staff in key positions in agencies like the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of Justice who oppose the reforms Bolsonaro campaigned on could make those reforms impossible.\n\nThe removal of communists from the government is part of the first major effort of the Bolsonaro administration: reducing the prodigious size of the Brazilian government. Bolsonaro officials have suggested that as many as 3,100 government jobs are expected to be cut at the federal level. Brasilia will also move to sell as many as 700,000 government-owned properties back into private ownership.\n\nBolsonaro made the eradication of Marxist thought from the government a priority as a candidate. In his inaugural address Tuesday, Bolsonaro declared his victory the day in which the people began to free themselves of socialism, the inversion of values, state maximalism, and the politically correct.\n\nThat is our flag, which will never be red. It will only be red if it is necessary for our blood to keep her green and yellow, he concluded. We cannot allow nefarious ideologies to come and divide Brazilians – ideologies that destroy our values and traditions, destroy our families, the foundations of our society.\n\nPrior to assuming office, Bolsonaro also stated at a conservative conference that he would seek to create a global coalition against communism, particularly targeting the removal of toxic Marxist regimes in neighboring Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nAll of Latin America knows what the consequences of the left are. The clearest example is Cuba, and the nation that most clearly approximates that reality is Venezuela, he said, stating that Brazil, as South America's largest country, has an obligation to lead in the effort to restore freedom in those countries.\n\nDespite these declarations against communism, Bolsonaro held a friendly meeting with an envoy sent by the most powerful communist leader in the world, China's Xi Jinping, relaying a message of cooperation to the Communist Party leader. China is Brazil's largest trade partner as a product of a policy of distance from the West under Lula and Rousseff. Candidate Bolsonaro expressed concerns that China is buying Brazil and vowed to cut trade with Beijing down to a manageable level.\n\nThe president also met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week, expressing hope that Brasilia-Washington ties would thrive during his presidency. He told reporters that he would discuss the implementation of a U.S. military base in Brazil with American officials in the future, given growing military operations by Russia in neighboring Venezuela.
A big chunk of the world is cheering the fact that India was gutsy enough to shut down Facebook's Free Basics, because even the poor can recognize corporate digital colonialism.\n\nFacebook launched its Free Basics/Internet.org in more than 35 countries as a supposedly free way to obtain access to data for 5 billion poor people who currently have no Internet access. But the product only allowed access to Facebook and a few other pet sites in a walled garden, TechCrunch notes.\n\nThe product created a backlash among local Indian entrepreneurs, who felt that the service institutionalized an uneven playing field for Internet service providers who were denied the right to join. Facebook retaliated by reportedly spending $44 million on a PR campaign supporting Free Basics and demeaning the local activists.\n\nAfter months of bitter protests that the Facebook opponents referred to as the modern Quit India, in celebration of Mahatma Gandhi's efforts to expel the British in 1942, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India suspended the free Facebook service in December.\n\nSix weeks later, on February 8, the regulators imposed the type of net neutrality Facebook aggressively lobbied for and won in the U.S. to prevent telecommunications companies from charge discriminatory pricing for different Web services. The move essentially killed Free Basics' business model, which was all about creating a monopoly.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission's investigation of Facebook is providing an excellent window into just how insidious Facebook's business model has become. Facebook uses sophisticated algorithms to eavesdrop on its users, no matter what the privacy settings are. Information extracted focuses on the users' political opinions, sexuality, religious beliefs, income and whereabouts.\n\nMost users know that Facebook develops and maintains sophisticated internal profiles of users based on the comments they make on social media and the posts that they like within its social network. But what few are aware of is Facebook's use of plug-ins that integrate Facebook features on third-party websites for the company to eavesdrop outside of the Facebook site.\n\nTo maximize its ability to tie data-mining information to each specific individual, Facebook has also required a real-name policy since its implementation. The policy requires users to create real profiles in order to help keep our community safe.\n\nBut a critical article in the Washington Times suggests that the real-name policy has also made the Facebook community unsafe for some users. The company claims to be implementing changes to address these concerns, but tech analysts believe selling that type of data to advertisers is what makes Facebook profitable.\n\nFacebook was forced by the EU regulators to admit that they are tracking people on other websites. If a Facebook user researches a new television on an external website or inside of a mobile app, his or her profile is tagged for advertisers to know that a user on another site has indicated an interest in televisions and in electronics. Facebook then sells the data to advertisers pitching electronic devices that want to reach a Facebook user.\n\nBut the European Community regulators consider that a violation of privacy rights, since the Facebook user never agreed to allow the company to follow him or her to another site. A new EC Directive was issued in January, just before the Indian regulator's move, that will ban such targeted advertising unless a user has specifically agreed to allow it.\n\nDespite Facebook already having 132 million of the 252 million Indian monthly active users in late 2015, Board member Mark Andreessen was so angry over having the government tell him what he could or could not do, he tweeted sarcastically, Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?\n\nThe colonialist comment caused a firestorm of protests across India.\n\nI apologize for any offense caused by my earlier tweet about Indian history and politics. I admire India and the Indian people enormously. — Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) February 10, 2016\n\nEventually, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was forced to disown the racial statement with a public apology.

AHMEDABAD, INDIA (AP) — Kicking off a whirlwind 36-hour visit to India that emphasizes pageantry over policy, President Donald Trump received a warm welcome Monday on the subcontinent, including a mega-rally, meant to reaffirm ties while providing enviable overseas imagery for a president in a re-election year.\n\nAs Air Force One touched down in Ahmedabad in western India, the final preparations were underway for that day's enviable trio of presidential photo-ops: a visit to a former home of independence leader Mohandas Gandhi , a rally at the world's second-largest stadium and a trip to the famed Taj Mahal.\n\nDancers in traditional attire, dancers and drummers lined the red carpet rolled out at the stairs of the presidential aircraft as Trump was poised to receive the raucous reception that has eluded him on many foreign trips, some of which have featured massive protests and icy handshakes from world leaders.In India, he instead received a warm embrace — literally —from the ideologically aligned and hug-loving Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe sun-baked city of Ahmedabad jostled with activity the day before Trump's arrival as workers cleaned roads, planted flowers and hoisted hundreds of billboards featuring the president and first lady Melania Trump, Hundreds of thousands of people in the northwestern city are expected to greet Trump for a road show leading to a massive rally at what has been touted as the world's largest cricket stadium.\n\nTrump's motorcade will travel amid cheers from a battery of carefully picked and vetted Modi loyalists and workers from his Bharatiya Janata Party who will stand for hours alongside the neatly manicured 22-kilometer (14-mile) stretch of road to accord the president a grand welcome on his way to the newly constructed stadium. Tens of thousands of police officers will be on hand to keep security tight and a new wall has come up in front of a slum, apparently to hide it from presidential passers-by.\n\nI hear it's going to be a big event. Some people say the biggest event they've ever had in India, Trump said before he departed Washington. That's what the prime minister told me — this will be the biggest event they've ever had.\n\nThe Namaste Trump rally will be, in a way, the back half of home-and-home events for Modi and Trump who attended a Howdy Modi rally in Houston last year that drew 50,000 people.\n\nTrump's foreign visits have typically been light on sightseeing, but this time, the president and first lady Melania Trump are to visit the Taj Mahal. Stories in local media warn of the monkeys that inhabit the landmark pestering tourists for food and, on occasion, menacing both visitors and slingshot-carrying security guards.\n\nImages of American presidents being feted on the world stage stand in contrast to those of their rivals in the opposing party slogging through diners in early-voting states and clashing in debate. This trip, in particular, reflects a Trump campaign strategy to showcase him in his presidential role during short, carefully managed trips that provide counter-programming to the Democrats' primary contest and produce the kinds of visuals his campaign can use in future ads. His aides also believe the visit could help the president woo tens of thousands of Indian-American voters before the November election.\n\nThe visit also comes at a crucial moment for Modi, a fellow populist, who has provided over a steep economic downtown and unfulfilled campaign promises about job creation. When Trump touches down in Delhi late Monday, he will find a bustling, noisy, colorful capital that also is dotted with half-finished construction projects stalled due to disappearing funding.\n\nThe president on Tuesday will conclude his whirlwind visit to India with a day in the capital, complete with a gala dinner meetings with Modi over stalled trade talks between the two nations.The two nations are closely allied, in part to act as a bulwark against the rising influence of nearby China, but trade tensions between the two countries have escalated since the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium from India.India responded with higher penalties on agricultural goods and restrictions on U.S. medical devices. The U.S. retaliated by removing India from a decades-old preferential trade program.\n\nEyes will also be on whether Trump weighs on in the protests enveloping India over its Citizenship Amendment Act. It provides a fast track to naturalization for some migrants who entered the country illegally while fleeing religious persecution, but excludes Muslims, raising fears that the country is moving toward a religious citizenship test. Passage has prompted large-scale protests and a violent crackdown.\n\nTypically, Trump has not publicly rebuked world leaders for human rights abuses during his overseas trips. But one senior administration official said the U.S. is concerned about the situation and that Trump will tell Modi the world is looking to India to continue to uphold its democratic traditions and respect religious minorities.\n\n___\n\nSheikh Saaliq contributed reporting from Ahmedabad, India.

Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, New Jersey, is under fire this week after reports were published detailing alleged sexual abuse in the school's wrestling program.\n\nSeveral reports published this week allege that officials at Bergen Catholic High School conspired to cover up sexual and verbal abuse in the school's celebrated wrestling program. The abuse included the sharing of pornographic images, coaches watching wrestles strip naked and intimate text messages sent from coaches to students.\n\nA 12-count lawsuit filed in Bergen County, which alleges that the high school worked to shield their wrestling coaches from criminal charges, details a pattern of concerning behavior from more than one wrestling coach. The complaint alleges that Bergen Catholic head wrestling coach Dave Bell texted and emailed Plaintiff that he loved him, as well as other highly inappropriate and sexually predatory behavior on a minor child.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that assistant coach Dominick Donnie Spataro showed pornographic and nude photographs of himself and others on his mobile photo to Plaintiff and other minor wrestlers.\n\nThe school's president, Brother Brian Walsh, claimed in a statement that the school has zero tolerance for the alleged conduct that took place in the wrestling program. However, Walsh stated that the administration believes that the allegations are untrue.\n\nLet's be very clear that the administration has zero tolerance for the actions alleged in this complaint — and consistent with our zero tolerance policy and protocols, despite not having been served the complaint until today, the administration reported these allegations to the Archdiocese of Newark and the Bergen County prosecutor's office when it first learned of them, Walsh wrote in the statement.\n\nWith that said, the administration believes that this lawsuit is based on allegations that are unfounded, frivolous and untrue, Walsh added. The administration will vigorously defend against these false and baseless allegations.\n\nBell's attorney, Sean Pena, said in a statement that the allegations against his client are demonstrably false.\n\nThis is not the first time Coach Bell has been baselessly attacked and regrettably it's unlikely to be the last, Pena wrote. When you have reached the pinnacle of your profession people will do anything to try to tear you and what you build down. These allegations are demonstrably false and Coach Bell eagerly awaits the opportunity to be exonerated.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first child sexual abuse case at Bergen Catholic. In 2016, the high school paid a $1.9 million settlement to former students who claimed that they had been sexually abused at the school by clergymen in the 60s and 70s when they were between 13 and 17 years old.\n\nThese are Christ's representatives on Earth, former student Peter Alrutz said. You're taught to do whatever they tell you. And then all of a sudden the people who are supposed to be protecting you are abusing you.
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says he intends to block the use of the state Senate chamber for the filming of a movie that will highlight the 13-hour filibuster by abortion advocate and former state Sen. Wendy Davis.\n\nIf I have anything to do with that, I'm not going to let them use the Senate chamber to shoot because they have already disgraced it once, Patrick said in a speech to Texas Public Policy Foundation think tank. I'm not going to let them do it again.\n\nAccording to Statesman, Patrick added he has received a copy of the script for Let Her Speak, but has not read it, yet noted he was portrayed as using a curse word while criticizing Davis, who became known among pro-life activists as Abortion Barbie.\n\nI'm a long way from being a perfect person … but I don't curse, he said.\n\nPatrick said he told his wife Brad Pitt or George Clooney would be his recommendations of actors who might portray him in the film.\n\nWithout skipping a beat she said, 'Dan Aykroyd,' he quipped. She said, 'Like he looks today.'\n\nActress Sandra Bullock is slated to portray Davis, who became a rock star among abortion advocates in 2013 when she donned pink sneakers and a urinary catheter, and then filibustered a bill that would ban abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDavis's filibuster took the state Senate into recess, but then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry called a special legislative session to complete passage of the bill.\n\nSubsequently, Davis ran for governor, but was never a true contender and ultimately lost her bid by 20 percentage points to current Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). During the campaign, the news was filled with what eventually came to be recognized as her fictional accounts of her life and her flip-flopping on key issues – even abortion.\n\nIn January 2014, Davis admitted she lied about important life events, including her divorce, and, one year later, also admitted she was faking her support for gun rights to boost her chances in her gubernatorial bid.\n\nIn February 2014 – just half a year after her famous filibuster – Davis told the Dallas Morning News she supported bans on abortion after 20 weeks. The news was not a complete shock, since several months earlier Davis had also described herself as pro-life.
The wife of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said in an interview with the Christian Post that the Joe Biden administration will be just as strong as the Trump administration on the issue of religious freedom.\n\nThe Post reported Tuesday that Gayle Manchin, chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), said she has spoken with the Biden transition team about religious freedom.\n\nManchin asserted:\n\nThe Biden administration will be just as strong. I certainly congratulate the [Trump administration]. Trump put a spotlight on [religious freedom]. I believe the Biden administration will continue that.\n\nManchin added the work of the USCIRF is unique in the world.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initiated the appointment of a permanent adviser for international religious freedom to the President's office, Manchin said, a move that would highlight the plight of people around the world who are persecuted for their faith when foreign policy decisions are made.\n\nIn July 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, also a member of the USCIRF, that the Trump administration was making the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world:\n\nIt is incredibly important in President Trump's administration to make the clarion call for religious freedom all around the world. There are many countries in which religious freedom is not available and we believe that by gathering citizens from around the world … we will highlight the central nature of religious freedom and its importance to individuals in countries. We believe religious freedom is important for every citizen around the world and we want to bring everyone together to discuss how individuals of all faiths have the right to worship as they choose, or if they choose not to. Every country ought to honor that.\n\nWe're the only ones that take an interest in how Pakistan or Azerbaijan or Egypt are treating their citizens, Manchin said.\n\nI would hope that is something that will continue in the new administration, Manchin added. I think the Biden administration will be very open to working with USCIRF and all of the groups involved with religious freedom.\n\nBiden, however, has shown no indication that he values religious freedom on the domestic front.\n\nWilliam Donohue, president of the Catholic League, which defends the religious and civil rights of Catholics, told Breitbart News in a recent interview that Biden's track record on religious freedom is abysmal. He said:\n\nHe's been in office for almost half a century. I follow this rather carefully and I don't know of a single piece of religious liberty legislation he's ever penned. If he's in favor of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, well, that's rather deceitful because he's now in favor of the Equality Act which, if it were passed … would literally destroy the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed under President Bill Clinton.\n\nDonohue, however, praised Trump for his religious liberty policy.\n\nWe've never seen any administration, which could match its record, so Catholics will have to weigh all of these decisions along with many other issues, he explained, emphasizing that not all issues are weighed equally by the Church.\n\nClimate change and abortion are not identical, he said. There are some people, including some bishops, who would like to think that they are, but they're not.\n\nA self-professed Catholic, as vice president, Biden did nothing to interfere with former President Barack Obama's pro-abortion agenda. In fact, his plans to defend abortion rights will undermine the beliefs of the majority of Americans of faith.\n\nBiden has committed to embracing the Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda that includes codifying Roe v. Wade, funding Planned Parenthood, and forcing American taxpayers to fund abortions through a repeal of the Hyde Amendment.\n\nThe future president also chose as his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who, as California attorney general, directed her office to lead the raid on Center for Medical Progress (CMP) project leader David Daleiden after CMP released undercover videos exposing Planned Parenthood's fetal tissue sales practices.\n\nIt was Harris's office that collaborated with Planned Parenthood to produce legislation that would criminalize the CMP undercover journalists for publishing and distributing recordings of private communications with abortion providers in California.\n\nAs a senator, Harris voted against bills to protect the lives of babies who survive abortions and took to Twitter to tout her vote against a ban on abortions past the fifth month of pregnancy.\n\nAs a Democrat candidate for president, Harris pledged not only to restrict states' rights to pass and enact their own abortion laws, but also to block a pro-life president's power and that of his or her administration.\n\nGuardrails will ensure DOJ enforces the law even under an administration that's hostile to women's rights — and patients and providers will have standing to sue if they don't, Harris's plan stated during her campaign.\n\nA woman's constitutional right to an abortion is under attack. Today I announced a plan as president to block these dangerous and deadly state laws before they take effect. https://t.co/zKJtsgwQUM — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) May 28, 2019\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July in Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania, one that upheld a Trump administration rule exempting religious groups from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, self-professed Catholic Biden vowed to reverse protections for religious groups such as the Little Sisters.\n\nBiden said, according to Fox News:\n\nAs disappointing as the Supreme Court's ruling is, there is a clear path to fixing it: electing a new President who will end Donald Trump's ceaseless attempts to gut every aspect of the Affordable Care Act. If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions.\n\nThe Obamacare accommodation Biden referred to, however, was never viewed as such by many Catholic schools and organizations. Instead, they recognized it as an accounting trick whereby completion of a certified form would merely transfer their mandate to directly provide abortion-inducing drugs to an insurance provider, who would take care of the administration of these services for the faith-based groups. In short, the accommodation simply ensured the abortion-inducing drugs were paid for, as the Obama-Biden administration desired, while the conscience issues of the faith-based groups remained ignored.\n\nIt's alarming to Catholics to see Joe Biden tout his Catholic faith and then turn around and say he would immediately go after the Little Sisters of the Poor and reinstate the rules that would force them to either violate their faith or pay crippling fines, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, said in a statement to Breitbart News.\n\nIs there anything more contradictory than touting your faith while simultaneously threatening nuns who serve the elderly poor? she asked.\n\nEven sharp critics of Trump expressed horror at Harris's treatment of Brian Buescher, one of the president's federal judiciary nominees and a member of the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic charitable organization that collects and distributes winter coats for poor children, and provides funds and baby supplies for crisis pregnancy shelters.\n\nDuring a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Harris asked Buescher, Were you aware that the Knights of Columbus opposed a woman's right to choose when you joined the organization?\n\nMichael Gerson, one of Trump's harshest critics, wrote in January at the Washington Post:\n\nThose who want to understand how Democrats manage to scare the hell out of vast sections of the country need look no further than the story of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and the Knights of Columbus.\n\nGerson continued that Harris and her Senate colleagues attempted to force the narrative that Americans can believe what they want in private, but can't act on that belief in the public square.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThe comparison of this view to the United States' long history of anti-Catholic bigotry has been disputed. Actually, it is exactly the same as this history in every important respect. A 19th-century bigot would have regarded Catholicism as fundamentally illiberal — a backward faith characterized by clerical despotism — and thus inconsistent with America's democratic rules. The same attitude seems currently present in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Ken Blackwell, a former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, also called the behavior of Harris and Hirono thuggish and what might be expected from third world dictators.
Google-owned video giant YouTube blacklisted a Breitbart News video of a recent speech on the Senate floor by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in which Paul names the alleged whistleblower as Eric Ciaramella.\n\nThe video included the Senator's arguments surrounding the impeachment trial, meaning that YouTube is now censoring the congressional and historical record of impeachment.\n\nAfter Breitbart News uploaded the video to its official channel, YouTube promptly locked the video in private mode, meaning that only a maximum of 50 viewers invited to see the video may watch it. It is therefore inaccessible to the general public.\n\nI don't care whether it's Republican or Democrat. We cannot allow the intelligence community, secret courts like the FISA court, to go after political campaigns, said Sen. Paul, in the speech.\n\nYou've got Peter Strzok and Lisa Page talking about taking down the president, having an insurance policy against him succeeding and becoming the president. You've got McCabe, you've got Comey, you've got Clapper — you remember James Clapper, the one who came to the Senate and when asked by Sen. Wyden 'are you storing, are you gathering information from Americans by the millions and storing it on government computers,' James Clapper said 'no.'\n\nHe lied to Congress. Nobody chose to impeach him. But he lied to Congress and committed a felony. Is he in jail? No — he's making millions of dollars as a contributor on television now, using and peddling his national security influence for dollars, after having committed a felony in lying to us. These are the people who plotted to bring the president down. These are the people who continue to plot to bring the president down.\n\nLater in his speech, Sen. Paul repeated the question that he was forbidden from putting to Democrats during official impeachment proceedings.\n\nManager Schiff and Counsel for the President, are you aware that house intelligence committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close relationship with Eric Ciaramella when at the National Security council together, and are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal House proceedings?\n\nDespite the fact that numerous national-level politicians, journalists, and media personalities have identified Eric Ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower, Silicon Valley companies have refused to relax their censorship of his name. Facebook previously said it would lift the ban if enough public figures named the alleged whistleblower, but it has not done so. Twitter does not have an official policy banning the naming of Ciaramella as the alleged whistleblower, but it has mistakenly taken down accounts for mentioning his name.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter, or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?

TEL AVIV – The Hamas terror tunnel destroyed by the IDF on Saturday was intended for an attack on the border crossing where the majority of humanitarian aid reaches the Gaza Strip, an IDF spokesperson said.\n\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing is used to transport more than five million tons of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said. The tunnel, which was completely destroyed in an air strike, also passed below strategic assets including major gas pipelines and a military installation.\n\nAccording to a Hadashot TV news report, if the tunnel were to blow up under the crossing, hundreds of workers in the area could die or be injured and there would be major damage to aid trucks carrying medicine, food and fuel. The IDF said that Hamas was sabotaging the humanitarian efforts that Israel is making for the citizens of Gaza and added that the Hamas terror organization repeatedly chooses to harm the welfare of Gaza residents.\n\nThe terrorist organization Hamas is responsible for everything happening in and out of the Gaza Strip, a statement from the army read.\n\nAccording to the news report's military correspondent, Hamas prefers to harm Gazans rather than have them live with any semblance of normalcy. He added that this was the second time Hamas had attempted to destroy a border crossing, the first time being in 2007 after its takeover of the Strip.\n\nThe army denied the claim, made by Hamas late Saturday night, that the Israeli jets had targeted a smuggling tunnel between the Gaza Strip and Egypt.\n\nWe know it's a terror tunnel because it passes under different strategic assets, Conricus said, referring to its proximity to the fuel pipelines into Gaza, the Kerem Shalom Crossing and a military installation nearby.\n\nThe IDF will continue to use all the measures at its disposal, above and below ground, to thwart attempts to harm the residents of the State of Israel and to maintain the relative quiet in the area achieved after Operation Protective Edge.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the air strikes, saying, We are retaliating against attacks on Israel by very systematically attacking the [terror] infrastructure directed at us.\n\nNetanyahu added, Hamas must realize we will not allow a continuation of these attacks and [we] will respond with greater force.\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor Liberman also commented on the strike: We performed a professional and precise [military] action. The destruction of the terror tunnel network is an essential component of our systematic policy to harm Hamas's strategic capabilities. Our message to the Gazan leadership and residents of the strip is clear: invest in the sanctity of life and not in death tunnels.\n\nAccording to the army, the tunnel was discovered using the most advanced technology.\n\nThe Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai told the Arabic news outlet AlHurra that the Israeli genius along with the Jewish brain have come up with a solution to all of the terrorists' tunnels.\n\nJust like there's Iron Dome for the air, there's a technological umbrella of steel underground, he said. I want to send a message to everyone who is digging or gets too close to the tunnels: As you've seen in the past two months, these tunnels bring only death, he added.\n\nThe tunnel demolished on Saturday extended both into Israel and into Egypt, and could also have been used to smuggle weapons and jihadists from the Sinai into Gaza, Conricus said.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is vowing to fill at least half of her Cabinet positions with women and non-binary people, she outlined in a Medium post released this week.\n\nThe presidential hopeful paints a bleak picture of the state of the union in the post, detailing her plan to restore the country after President Trump's first term.\n\nShe will be inheriting a government in crisis, the post states, touting a plethora of false narratives routinely peddled by Trump's critics.\n\nFrom children in cages at detention facilities near the border to a reckless foreign policy that endangers our country and a bigoted ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries, our country will be in desperate need of immediate course correction, it warns, before adding that Trump will leave behind a government that has been infected by corruption and incompetence.\n\nWarren declares the country cannot assume that everything will be fine once Donald Trump leaves office and lays out her plan to mitigate the damage she believes Trump has caused. She will do that, in part, by removing all of Trump's political appointees and establishing a Justice Task Force designed to investigate corruption during the Trump administration.\n\nDeep in the Medium post, Warren vows to fill at least half of her Cabinet positions with women and non-binary people, or individuals who do not identify as either male nor female.\n\nAccording to her plan, she will build a Cabinet and senior leadership team that reflects the full diversity of America, including having at least 50 percent of Cabinet positions filled by women and non binary people. She also promises to ensure representation of LGBTQ+ people across all levels of government, including in leadership roles.\n\nAccording to Gallup, 4.5 percent of U.S. adults identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) in 2017, up from 4.1% in 2016 and 3.5% in 2012 when Gallup began tracking the measure.\n\nWarren has remained a favorite among Democrat primary LGBT voters, garnering 31 percent support, a YouGov and Out magazine survey released in November revealed.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator plans to move fast and is committing to announce her Cabinet choices by December 1, 2020 — less than a month after the election. She also promises to announce top nominations by December 15, 2020, and fully staff all senior and mid-level White House positions by Inauguration Day.\n\nDonald Trump's presidency has been a dark period in American history. That period won't end just because Donald Trump has left office, she warns.\n\nIf we want to write a new chapter in the American story … we will have to cleanse the corruption from our government and urgently act to appoint officials who will bring integrity to public service, she adds.
From Linette Lopez writing at Business Insider:\n\nThe Federal Reserve closed 2015 by doing something it hadn't done since 2006: It hiked interest rates, initiating a phase of tighter monetary policy.\n\nSince then, Wall Street analysts have been asking themselves when the next hike is coming and how many hikes there will be before the world gets back to a normal monetary policy (whatever that means).\n\nThere are others in the market, however, who believe that something could stop the Federal Reserve's tightening phase dead in its tracks.\n\nThey believe that weakening credit in massive economies around the world will make it impossible for the Fed to continue to hike rates through 2016.
TREBISHT (ALBANIA) (AFP) – Trebisht in northeastern Albania looks like a ghost village, emptied of its residents by a rush to get Bulgarian passports that open the door to the European Union.\n\nArman Kadriu has an Albanian name, but the 12-year-old boy says he considers himself Bulgarian.\n\nI don't want to stay here taking care of cows. I want to be a football player, he said, covered in sweat, as he juggled a ball with his feet on a dusty road in the village in the Golo Brdo region.\n\nIn England, with a Bulgarian passport, it's possible, he said, switching languages to say Dovizhdane! — goodbye in Bulgarian.\n\nBulgaria and Albania do not share a border.\n\nAnd non-EU member Albania, where a law on minorities is under consideration, does not count Bulgarians among its recognised ethnic communities, unlike the Greeks, Macedonians or Serb-Montenegrins.\n\nThe ethnicity of historically Slavic-speaking communities in parts of Albania's east has long been fluid and disputed — neighbouring Macedonia claims they are ethnic Macedonians.\n\nBut according to the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad, which helps in obtaining a passport, Bulgarian families have been settled in Albania since the 5th century and their descendants are part of its diaspora.\n\nNo statistics are available, but Bulgarian organisations in Albania estimate that there are around 100,000 of these descendants.\n\nThe European Parliament seems to agree: in February, it requested of Tirana that the rights of people with Bulgarian ethnicity in the Prespa, Golo Brdo and Gora regions be enshrined in law and ensured in practice.\n\nThe recommendation has given renewed hope. Every day at least seven or eight people come to ask about obtaining Bulgarian citizenship, said Haxhi Pirushi.\n\nHe heads the Prosperity Goloborda association, which provides certificates of Bulgarian origin to Albanians and is recognised by the government in Sofia.\n\n– Mass emigration –\n\nPerched on a hill, Trebisht is a sleepy place.\n\nA few men spend their day on the terrace of the Democracy bar and others work the land, while young people travel three kilometres (two miles) to cross the Macedonian border for temporary work.\n\nOnce the village counted around 6,000 inhabitants, but more than 2,500 left four or five years ago when they had the opportunity to benefit from a Bulgarian passport, explained resident Tahir Mucina.\n\nIn the neighbouring village of Vernice there is hardly anyone left, said the 31-year-old.\n\nSince Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, its citizens have been able to work and reside wherever they want within the bloc, with all the restrictions lifted in 2014.\n\nMucina said he was also on the lookout for passports for himself, his wife and their three children.\n\nAlbania, as a whole, is a nation of mass emigration, spurred by an average wage of 340 euros ($388) and an unemployment rate affecting nearly one in three young people.\n\nSo it does not matter that Bulgaria is the poorest country in the EU. Seen from Trebisht, it is the gateway to Germany, England or some other promised land.\n\nAnd it suits Bulgaria to claim these people as their own.\n\nIt has to do with (Bulgaria's) policy on Macedonia/Macedonians who also have access to Bulgarian citizenship because they are seen as ethnic Bulgarians, said Southeast Europe expert Dimitar Bechev at the University of North Carolina.\n\nCommunities who live on the other side of the border… qualify as well.\n\nHe said Bulgarian MEPs have successfully lobbied the European Parliament to take a stand on the issue. If Macedonia were an EU member, things would have worked another way, of course, Bechev told AFP.\n\nIn 1939, at the beginning of World War II, Bulgarians from 19 localities in Albania asked Sofia to defend their rights in what was then an Italian protectorate, according to the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad.\n\nThe toponymy (study of place names), the preservation of an archaic Bulgarian language and the local dialect and traditions are evidence of the Bulgarian character in the regions concerned, Sofia says.\n\n– Illegal path –\n\nTrebisht residents who said they consider themselves Bulgarian spoke to AFP in Albanian, but said they spoke Bulgarian at home with their families.\n\nI live in Albania, said the 60-year-old Gani Shahini, but my origins are Bulgarian.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2016, a total of 4,470 Albanian nationals applied for a Bulgarian passport and 2,608 of them were successful, according to Sofia.\n\nBut these figures do not reflect the full extent of the phenomenon. Some choose to take an illegal path, providing a market for forged passports.\n\nThree people were arrested in December 2015 and later found guilty of making Bulgarian passports on demand for between 4,000 and 10,000 euros.\n\nSince May 1, Sofia has requested documents proving the Bulgarian origin of a parent or grandparent after Bulgarian prosecutors found abuse of the system.\n\nThe only interest of these people is to obtain a passport allowing them to move freely in the European area, said Albanian historian Pellumb Xhufi.\n\nby Briseida Mema with Vessela Sergueva in Sofia
The archbishop of Washington, DC, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, issued a statement Wednesday suggesting that some of the blame for the violence in the nation's Capitol falls on the shoulders of President Trump.\n\nThe divisive tone that has recently so dominated our national conversations must change, Cardinal Gregory said, in apparent reference to Trump. Those who resort to inflammatory rhetoric must accept some responsibility for inciting the increasing violence in our nation.\n\nCardinal Gregory, the first black American cardinal, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, accusing him of racism and divisiveness.\n\nI fear that recent public comments by our President and others and the responses they have generated, have deepened divisions and diminished our national life, the archbishop declared in August 2019 after the president had sharply criticized Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) for his verbal attack on Homeland Security officers and the conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOur faith teaches us that respect for people of every race, religion, gender, ethnicity and background are requirements of fundamental human dignity and basic decency, Gregory said, seeming to imply that Trump's words were motivated by racism. This include newcomers to our country, people who have differing political views and people who may be different from us.\n\nWe all need to reject racism, disrespect or brutality in speech and action, he said, adding that racism occurs when we ignore the fundamental truth that, because all humans share a common origin, they are all brothers and sisters, all equally made in the image of God.\n\nWe must all take responsibility to reject language that ridicules, condemns, or vilifies another person because of their race, religion, gender, age, culture or ethnic background, the archbishop said.\n\nAs an American, a Christian, a Catholic pastor, I pray that our President, other national leaders and all Americans will do all we can to respect the dignity of all God's children and nothing to further divide our nation. The growing plague of offense and disrespect in speech and actions must end, Gregory concluded.\n\nThis past June, Gregory once again attacked the president, declaring that his visit to the shrine of Saint John Paul II in Washington, DC, was a photo opportunity and a manipulation of a Catholic sanctuary, adding that it violates our religious principles.\n\nI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree, the archbishop said.\n\nIn point of fact, the purpose of Trump's visit to the shrine, which commemorated the 41st anniversary of John Paul's historic visit to Poland in 1979, was to issue an executive order on advancing international religious freedom, a topic dear to the heart of Pope John Paul II.\n\nReligious freedom, America's first freedom, is a moral and national security imperative, the Trump order stated. Religious freedom for all people worldwide is a foreign policy priority of the United States, and the United States will respect and vigorously promote this freedom.\n\nIn late November, Cardinal Gregory announced that he would gladly give Holy Communion to Joe Biden, in deference to the practice established by former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of offering Communion to pro-abortion politicians.\n\nIn 2004, Gregory, then president of the U.S. Bishops' Conference, joined McCarrick in opposing Rome's call for withholding Communion from Catholic politicians who support abortion.\n\nIn December 2020, Archbishop Charles Chaput responded to Cardinal Gregory by criticizing bishops who indicate their willingness to give Holy Communion to Joe Biden despite his overt support for abortion.\n\nPublic figures who identify as 'Catholic' give scandal to the faithful when receiving Communion by creating the impression that the moral laws of the Church are optional, the former archbishop of Philadelphia said. And bishops give similar scandal by not speaking up publicly about the issue and danger of sacrilege.\n\nIn reference to Gregory's remarks, Chaput also noted that bishops contribute to the scandal when they act as if supporting abortion does not harm a person's relationship with the Church.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
Twitter has spoken out in favor of free speech, and against the shutdown of the Internet — in Uganda.\n\nTwitter's public policy department tweeted in opposition to reported efforts to shut down internet access ahead of Uganda's election this week, where President Yoweri Museveni is asking voters for a sixth term. He has been in office for 35 years.\n\nLast week, Twitter banned President Donald Trump from its platform permanently. It also continues to suspend and expel tens of thousands of Trump supporters. Twitter's main competitor, Parler, was also kicked off Amazon's servers.\n\nThis week, however, Twitter stood up for free speech and the open Internet, arguing that Access to information and freedom of expression, including the public conversation on Twitter, is never more important than during democratic processes, particularly elections.\n\nTwitter also specifically opposed the blocking of social media and messaging apps.\n\nAhead of the Ugandan election, we're hearing reports that Internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps. We strongly condemn internet shutdowns – they are hugely harmful, violate basic human rights and the principles of the #OpenInternet. — Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) January 12, 2021\n\nAccess to information and freedom of expression, including the public conversation on Twitter, is never more important than during democratic processes, particularly elections.#UgandaDecides2021 #KeepItOn https://t.co/Q2SJfsFUiD — Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) January 12, 2021\n\nBefore the November 2020 election, Twitter censored a New York Post story that exposed emails from the laptop of Hunter Biden, son of President-elect Joe Biden. The emails suggested that then-Vice President Biden met with his son's business associate from the corrupt Ukrainian energy company, Burma.\n\nOther emails also described the Biden family's attempt to start a joint venture with a Chinese company, in which Joe Biden — the big guy — was to have received a 10% stake.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden told reporters on the campaign trail in 2019 that he had never discussed his family's overseas business interests.\n\nJoel B.

The Sunrise Movement, the youth-led group largely behind the Green New Deal, is officially backing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president, it announced Thursday.\n\nThe group, composed of activists who have pushed the Green New Deal and backed the four far-left members of the Squad — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) — endorsed Sanders for president this week.\n\nIt will make a formal announcement during a January 12 rally in Iowa City, Iowa, alongside the socialist senator:\n\nThis is a huge moment for our movement. Today, we are endorsing @BernieSanders for President, but more than that, we are endorsing the movement— the political revolution— that we know is necessary to win a Green New Deal. Read our full statement here👇https://t.co/CmmzrkXFOK — Sunrise Movement 🌅 (@sunrisemvmt) January 9, 2020\n\nWe know that no matter who the next President is, we will need to turn millions of people into the streets and disrupt business as usual in order to win a Green New Deal, the Sunrise Movement said in a statement posted to Medium.\n\nBut our movement has spoken clearly. We believe a Bernie Sanders Presidency would provide the best political terrain in which to engage in and ultimately win that struggle for the world we deserve, it continued.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, which supports and lobbies for radical leftist policy proposals like the Green New Deal, has been active in the current election cycle, taking aim at Joe Biden (D) in September over a high-profile Wall Street fundraiser hosted by fossil fuel executive Andrew Goldman.\n\nIf Biden is serious about taking on the power of the fossil fuel lobby, why is he going to a fundraiser hosted by the co-founder of a natural gas company? Sunrise Movement founder and executive director Varshini Prakash asked.\n\nWe know how this works: Fossil fuel millionaires drive us towards an uninhabitable future, then host fundraisers and expect the next president to take their advice on policy, Prakash added.\n\nSanders supporter and Green New Deal advocate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined activists, including those from the Sunrise Movement, for a sit-in at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) office in 2018, prior to taking office:\n\nCalifornia is burning. Fossil fuel billionaires have a grip on America's democracy. We're running out of time to act. But we're going to win. We'll pass a #GreenNewDeal & win the solutions we need. We'll win because we have a movement behind us. And together, we're unstoppable. pic.twitter.com/mw6dKSxPVj — 350 dot org (@350) November 13, 2018\n\nShe was elected as part of the movement, she intends to govern as part of the movement, former Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent stated.\n\nTrent added:\n\nShe thinks there is no other priority that we should be focused on and supports the sunrise movements call for Democrats to create a plan to transition the economy to a zero-carbon economy so we have that ready to go when we take back the Presidency in 2020.\n\nSanders has praised the Sunrise Movement in the past and called youth the most progressive generation in American history.
Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden, who boasted during the CNN debate Sunday evening of his 100 percent rating from abortion political advocacy group NARAL, presents his Agenda for the Catholic Community at his campaign website.\n\nI'm a practicing Catholic, Biden states in his vision for Catholic Americans, and adds, I believe faith is a gift. And the first obligation we all have is, 'Love your God,' the second one is, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' … 'Treat people with dignity.' Everyone's entitled to dignity, that's a basic tenet in my household.\n\nThat dignity, however, does not extend to the unborn in Biden's vision for Catholics, though the Church makes clear its unchanging teaching in the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death.\n\nDuring his debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Biden answered his rival's challenge regarding his flip-flopping on the issue of support for the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision that is applied to congressional spending bills that prohibits taxpayer funds to be used for abortions.\n\n[B]y the way, everybody who has been to the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bits, Biden said, defending his prior votes for the Hyde Amendment, and then said:\n\nThe reason why I firmly came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all healthcare along the line, there is no way you could allow for there to be a requirement, that you have the Hyde Amendment – a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care … I did that a while ago. [N]umber two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress when I'm elected president – if I'm elected president – a codification of Roe v Wade, amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And in fact, I've gotten 100% rating from NARAL as well.\n\nBiden's latest views appear to have been influenced by the abortion lobby, rather than the Catholic church.\n\nNARAL President Ilyse Hogue released the following statement touting her group's prowess in having pushed Biden to move further left on the issue of abortion and, consequently, further away from the Church's position:\n\nWe are proud that NARAL's scorecard is seen as the gold standard for support for reproductive freedom. We know that our fundamental rights are under attack in unprecedented ways. Both candidates need to demonstrate their unequivocal commitment to Roe v. Wade and safeguarding abortion access. When Joe Biden fell short of that commitment, supporting the discriminatory Hyde Amendment, we pushed him along with our partners committed to reproductive justice. We will continue to push him to take a stronger stance. He must demonstrate that he will prioritize the critical issue of reproductive freedom as president.\n\nApparently, even actress and left-wing activist Alyssa Milano had more sway with Biden than the Church. The Atlantic reported in June 2019:\n\nAlyssa Milano, the actress who's become a major online presence on issues of women's rights as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday to Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz, telling him the candidate needed to change. More calls came in, more tough conversations.\n\nIn July, Biden finally revealed his health plan would enshrine Roe v. Wade into the Constitution and force taxpayers to fund abortion.\n\nThe Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the progress of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers free preventive care including contraception by repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Biden was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina due to his ardent support for abortion on demand.\n\nRev. Robert E. Morey, the pastor of St. Anthony Catholic Church in Florence, refused to give the Eucharist to Biden during Mass.\n\nSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden, Morey told the Florence Morning News. Holy Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that.\n\nBiden's shift radically leftward reflects that of his party.\n\nDemocratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Tom Perez said in 2017 there is no room in the Democrat Party for pro-life individuals.\n\nEvery Democrat, like every American, should support a woman's right to make her own choices about her body and her health, Perez said, as HuffPost reported. That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state:\n\nIn an AxiosOnHBO interview with Jonathan Swan, Perez rebuked Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who commented on Perez's stance: It saddens me and weakens the democracy millions of Americans cherish when the party that once embraced Catholics now slams the door on us.\n\nWell, actually the majority of Catholics voted for Democrats in 2016, Perez shot back during the Axios interview when reminded of Dolan's comment, adding:\n\nYou know, Matthew:25 is a pretty important teaching. And Matthew:25 says, you know, when you are hungry, I fed you. When you were naked, I provided you with clothing. When you were an immigrant, I welcomed you. I think one of the reasons why so many people are moving away from Donald Trump is that he's abandoned all of those values.\n\nAxios reported Perez said in a previous interview:\n\nI think the challenge that I see among a lot of people that go to Donald Trump rallies, and then they will go to church on Sunday, and I'm not … I don't know what faith they are worshipping. Donald Trump has done more to hurt the least of us among us than just about any president I can think of:\n\nA few days ago @BernieSanders declared that being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat. That is shocking & disturbing. Where's the voice of those in the Democratic Party who disagree? Where's the outcry against this & socialism? https://t.co/T2XpoVgr9Y — Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) February 12, 2020\n\nIn fact, in August, the DNC unanimously passed a resolution that embraced religiously unaffiliated voters and belittled Americans of faith.\n\nThe resolution proclaimed that 70 percent of religiously unaffiliated Americans share the values of the Democrat Party.\n\nReligiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values, with 70% voting for Democrats in 2018, 80% supporting same-sex marriage, and 61% saying immigrants make American society stronger, the DNC stated, further defending secularists by asserting they have often been subjected to unfair bias and exclusion in American society, particularly in the areas of politics and policymaking where assumptions of religiosity have long predominated.\n\nThe Democrats continued by demeaning Americans of faith, referring to them as those most loudly claiming that morals, values, and patriotism must be defined by their religious views.\n\nReligious Americans, the DNC said, have used those religious views with misplaced claims of 'religious liberty,' to justify public policy that has threatened the civil rights and liberties of many Americans, including but not limited to the LGBT community, women, and others.\n\nBiden's vision for his Catholic agenda continues with the directive Build an economy where everyone comes along and we protect the 'least of these.'\n\nOnce again, the least of these does not include the vulnerable unborn.\n\nBiden's campaign, however, uses this section of the agenda to condemn Trump's tax cuts, which actually helped middle class Americans and to vow to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.\n\nThe former vice president's campaign also says the Catholic vision includes protecting the dignity of unions:\n\nThere used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It's time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they're worth. Joe will start by strengthening unions and helping workers bargain successfully for what they deserve. His plan will check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws. He will also encourage and incentivize unionization and collective bargaining.\n\nAs a Catholic, Biden also likely knows the Church teaches marriage is reserved solely for one man and one woman.\n\nCNN reported Monday that, as a senator, Biden voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law, signed by former President Bill Clinton, that stated marriage is defined as between one man and one woman.\n\nDuring his debate with Sanders, however, Biden touted he supported same-sex marriage as early as 2012 – even before former President Barack Obama.\n\nI'm the first person to go on national television in any administration and say, 'I supported gay marriage,' Biden boasted.\n\nThe 2020 presidential candidate has made the radical shift leftward with the rest of his party.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in October, Catholic League President Bill Donohue noted the Democrat Party's hostility toward Americans of faith.\n\nTo be specific, it is clear that none of the Democratic candidates wants to be tagged as religion-friendly, he stated.\n\nThere are some voices in the Democratic Party that freely admit how dangerously secular the Party has grown, he added. Their effort to bring sanity to their Party is commendable. But it is quite clear that they have failed.
The White House can use unspent funds to build a wall if President Donald Trump declares a national emergency and fends off various lawsuits, say lawyers cited in media reports.\n\nThe New York Times reported:\n\nThe Trump administration could point to two laws and say they allow officials to proceed with building a border wall without first obtaining explicit authorization and appropriations from Congress, according to Elizabeth Goitein, who oversaw the Brennan Center's study and is a co-director of its Liberty and National Security Program. One of the laws permits the secretary of the Army to halt Army civil works projects during a presidentially declared emergency and instead direct troops and other resources to help construct authorized civil works, military construction and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense. Another law permits the secretary of defense, in an emergency, to begin military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces, using funds that Congress had appropriated for military construction purposes that have not yet been earmarked for specific projects.\n\nI think that it's possible that the president could declare a national emergency and then rely on authority Congress has historically granted for exigencies to free up some funds to support constructing a barrier along the border, William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and the author of the 1994 book National Security Law and the Power of the Purse, told the New York Times.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal:\n\nCurrently, $13.3 billion in the Pentagon budget may be available, according to a congressional aide, enough to cover the $5 billion that Mr. Trump is seeking for the border wall. That would have to be diverted from projects such as military housing that Congress previously authorized. … Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that without a statutory definition of emergency, courts are unlikely to second-guess the president's judgment on that. The National Emergencies Act envisions that political checks, rather than litigation, will prevent abuse of executive authority, Mr. Vladeck said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times said:\n\nLegal experts say the act gives the president the power to declare a national emergency. But the act does not require presidents to prove a crisis exists to declare an emergency — it's at their sole discretion.\n\nCongress can terminate a declared emergency, but it requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers, according to Loyola law professor Jessica A. Levinson. … [Kim Lane Scheppele, a legal scholar and professor at Princeton University's Center for Human Values] said if Trump continues to make the case that the wall is necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the U.S., then he may be able to make the case that building a wall has a military purpose and he has a freer hand.\n\nThe President is now asking Congress for $5.7 billion to fund a wall in 2019. Overall the wall is expected to cost roughly $20 billion to build.\n\nWhite House officials are increasingly emphasizing the cartels' role in smuggling labor and drugs into the United States. The cartels are massive criminal enterprises, Homeland defense secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told reporters January 7. They don't just deal with smuggling. They exploit children. They deal with trafficking, they deal with drugs. That emphasis will help officials fend off commonplace Democratic claims that Trump's support for the border wall is merely an expression of racial animus.\n\nMany GOP and Democratic politicians will likely dislike any emergency declaration because Trump would redirect funding from their districts to the border wall in Texas and California. But it is not clear that majorities in the House and Senate could formally override the President's emergency powers.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Democrats are objecting to the emergency construction — but are not arguing that the policy is clearly illegal:\n\nJeh C. Johnson, who served in the Obama administration as secretary of homeland security and general counsel of the Defense Department, said the laws Trump could invoke with his national emergency declaration are designed to authorize military construction projects during wartime. He said using them for a border wall could curtail presidential powers in the years to come as lawmakers react to Trump and work to constrain him. The danger of using an authority like this and stretching it beyond its intended use is that Congress could then take it away, and it could not be used in situations where it's really needed, Johnson said.

Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama, said Trump would be poorly positioned to defend such an action in federal courts, in part because his statements about the wall have been contradictory and have contained provable falsehoods.\n\nA Democratic staffer told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats would object to the President's use of the emergency laws, implicitly admitting the policy would be likely legal:\n\nWe would look at every available [option] to stop this power from being abused, and that would range from a court challenge to changes to future appropriations bills to block any construction of the wall, a Democratic House aide said.\n\nThe Democrats' legal case against the border wall is also limited by the ideological nature of their objection to the wall. The wall is a symbolic rejection of America's welcome for migrants, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told an MSNBC event on January 4, saying it builds walls in people minds about who should come here.\n\nTrump and White House officials are touting the emergency option, which may be announced by Trump in his pending January 8 national address. On January 7, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters:\n\nOn the national emergency, let me say, the President said in front of all you, just the other day, that it's something that he's considering looking into. He's made no decision on that. I will say that one of the [alternative] ways that Congress can find the resources for this is through an emergency [funding] supplement. And we did indicate to them, over the course of this weekend, that we would be willing to work with them on forming an emergency supplemental for some of the resources — the additional resources we're asking for.\n\nThe focus on the President's emergency powers comes after GOP and Democratic leaders jointly blocked the President's campaign promise to build a border wall. So far, the President has managed to get just $3.2 billion for wall construction, and most of that spending is limited by rules governing the types and location of wall construction.
With Tony Romo getting his first action of the season for the Cowboys on Sunday against Philadelphia, some kind of controversy would surely emerge from Lincoln Financial Field. However, the dramatics ended up coming from the Philadelphia media and not the Cowboys quarterbacks.\n\nThe Twitter feed of Philadelphia Daily News Reporter Les Bowen provides an in-depth, internet play-by-play of the incredibly bizarre incident where Eagles media booted The Philadelphia Inquirer's Jeff McLane from the press box, after they told reporters in the press box to quiet down. The rest is Twitter history:\n\nEagles are attempting to eject @Jeff_McLane from the press box because he objected to being yelled at by an Eagles media relations staffer — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\nOther reporters are being told they will be ejected as well if they interfere with Jeff being ejected from the press box — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\nThis is a ridiculous situation, a minor disagreement that the Eagles are making into a huge incident — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\nThe Eagles have not clarified what policy Jeff is alleged to have violated. — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\nDuring confusion over a penalty a while ago, we were all trying to figure out the call. An Eagles staffer yelled for us to be quiet. (1) — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\n(2) Many of us took exception, Jeff most vocally. He then went to the staffer and calmly discussed why the admonishment was inappropriate. — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\n(3) A while, later, security guard comes and tells Jeff he is being ejected for violating the fan code of conduct. — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\nThis ought to be good for Jeff's talk radio appearances this week. — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\nThis is the most vengeful, petty Eagles regime I've dealt with since I started covering the team in 2002. #Ejectthat — Les Bowen (@LesBowen) January 1, 2017\n\nEagles beat writer @Jeff_McLane being ejected from the press box for discussing press box etiquette w pr staff. pic.twitter.com/5IUdTdFEof — Marcus Hayes (@inkstainedretch) January 1, 2017\n\nAgain, @Jeff_McLane has been ejected from the stadium.

According to Philly.com, McLane has occasionally criticized the Eagles in his coverage. Last week, he wrote an article questioning whether executive vice president Howie Roseman had made wise investments in players. In another article, he wrote that the jury is certainly still in deliberation about the prospects for head coach Doug Pederson, though he did say Pederson deserved to return next season.\n\nAsked whether he believed his coverage played a role in his ejection, McLane said: I think you'd probably have to ask them.\n\nMcLane just might have just found his answer.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
The U.S. military confirmed a military exercise by Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers over the South China Sea Thursday, a move that prompted Beijing, which illegally claims most of the sea, to remind Washington that it remains vigilant before U.S. exercises.\n\nChina always maintains vigilance and effective monitoring of the relevant country's military activities in the South China Sea, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. China's military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability.\n\nThe Chinese government typically responds to American exercises in the region rapidly. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the sovereign territories of Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the waters off the coast of Indonesia.\n\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague ruled last year that China's claims on the Spratly and Paracel Islands–sovereign territory of Vietnam and the Philippines–were not valid, and China must cease its construction of military facilities in the region. China vowed to ignore the ruling and any other such international legal resolution.\n\nThe United States has participated in challenging these illegal territorial claims through a variety of measures, from Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) within 12 nautical miles of the territory China claims, and military exercises both unilateral and joint with allied nations in the region.\n\nU.S. Pacific Command described the exercise on Thursday as part of a greater continuous bomber presence program, which included the participation of the bombers and the USS Sterett.\n\nAccording to an extensive report in the Japan Times, the mission lasted ten hours and was launched out of U.S. territory in Guam. The goal of the operation was to improve coordination between the ship and the bombers by refining joint tactics, techniques and procedures while simultaneously strengthening their ability to seamlessly integrate their operations, Pacific Command said. The statement explicitly did not refer to the operation as an FONOP.\n\nThe report also did not address recent reports suggesting that the Chinese government has continued to expand its military presence in the region. The Pentagon recently submitted a report to Congress detailing advances in the militarizing of the Spratly Island chain.\n\nChina's Spratly Islands outpost expansion effort is currently focused on building out the land-based capabilities of its three largest outposts–Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs–after completion of its four smaller outposts early in 2016, the report read, according to the South China Morning Post. Once all these facilities are complete, China will have the capacity to house up to three regiments of fighters in the Spratly Islands.\n\nAmong the new facilities are 24 fighter-sized hangars, fixed-weapons positions and other military-grade infrastructure on the reefs mentioned.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry rejected the report. China pursues the path of peaceful development and a national defense policy. China's defense development is aimed at safeguarding state independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, spokeswoman Hua Chunying said this week, according to the state-run Global Times.\n\nAs the report also mentioned potential Chinese expansion into Pakistan, Hua chided the United States and claimed cooperation with the Pakistani government is not targeted at any third party.

During an interview broadcast on Wednesday's edition of MSNBC's MTP Daily, Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) argued that the fact that he wasn't to the White House's gun policy meeting earlier in the day shows the excessive partisanship of the White House.\n\nNelson said that the White House didn't invite him to the meeting on purpose. He continued, I'm not unhappy about it. I think it shows the excessive partisanship of, if not the president, at least those around him, which is so silly. I mean, what people want is they want us to come together in bipartisan agreement.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
The leaders of Italy's two largest political parties remain in negotiations over the form and direction of a potential coalition government despite assurances made on Sunday that an agreement was just hours away, while European Union leaders in Brussels dictate that Italy should not pursue any radical policy changes.\n\nMatteo Salvini, leader of the anti-mass migration populist Lega, and Luigi Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment populist Five Star Alliance, have been locked in round after round of talks about forming a new government which has been claimed would be a nightmare scenario for the EU — but negotiations appear to have stalled.\n\nItalian Populists Ready to Launch Coalition Govt Which Could 'Pierce Brussels Through the Heart' https://t.co/H3op0Li3oh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 14, 2018\n\nThe leaders spoke to Italian President Sergio Mattarella Sunday and promised a decision on the next Italian Prime Minister for his approval — certain to be neither party leader but a third, less contentious choice — but as of Tuesday morning, the two parties seem to have drifted further from an agreement.\n\nItalian newspaper il Giornale — otherwise highly supportive of Salvini's populist Lega party — declared the delay the work of amateurs, noting that new discussions could add days more onto Italy being without a functioning government. The paper, in particular, pointed out the differences between the parties in the key areas of policy, including taxation, immigration, justice, and the European Union.\n\nTo complicate matters, the European Union has also made itself known in the formation of the new government, warning the potential coalition partners against pursuing the policies they were elected over. Lega in particular wishes to radically cut taxes, including VAT and excise duties, but EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis spoke out Tuesday morning to tell Italy they must conform with EU demands.\n\n75 Per Cent of First-Time Young Italian Voters Marked Their Ballots For Populist Parties https://t.co/UvdmJH2ZPU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 11, 2018\n\nThe vice-president told the country he expected Italy to keep to the European Union's plan, no matter which government was elected.\n\nOne of the most notable areas of interference by the European Union is over the matter of mass migration. After EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos warned against Italy changing its border policy from the last government — which saw the nation acting as one of the main points of ingress for illegal migrants and asylum seekers to the continent — Lega leader Salvini hit back.\n\nSalvini said Tuesday: From Europe, we have the umpteenth unacceptable interference by unelected officials.\n\nWe have received and maintained too much. Now is the time for legality, security and push-backs, he concluded in remarks reported by ANSA.\n\nBoth parties in the potential coalition arrangement have agreed to crack down on immigration to Italy, but exactly how and to what extent is believed to be one of the areas still up for agreement.\n\nItaly has a long and bitter history with European Union interference in their politics. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was toppled in 2011 as a former European Union commissioner and economics professor Mario Monti was installed as his technocratic replacement after the Union decided the country had not been run to their satisfaction.\n\nMonti was appointed a life senator by the Italian president in order to make him eligible to be the prime minister, the office normally being held by an elected politician. The change was made days after a similar coup in Greece, where a former chairman of the European Central Bank was installed as prime minister.
Sen. Lindsey Graham says he will back a national emergency declaration after President Donald Trump spends three more weeks offering an amnesty deal in exchange for border wall funding.\n\nI am going to support him, Lindsey Graham told Fox News Sunday. But first, Graham added, Trump must try to reach a border wall deal with Democrats:\n\nBefore he [gives up] on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.\n\nGraham's promised support for emergency powers would be valuable because the House and Senate can jointly override any emergency declaration by the president. Graham chairs the Senates judiciary committee.\n\nDuring the three weeks, the plan is to do a deal instead of a national emergency, Graham said. He described the supposed deal as a wall funding in exchange for amnesty of the three million DACA illegal aliens plus a giveaway of citizenship to 400,000 people who allowed to live and work in the United States under a Temporary Protected Status permit. Graham said:\n\nHe is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status … there are about 400,000. They are going to lose their legal status soon. He's willing to extend that. The DACA recipients, they are all tied up in court but I think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable if you could get wall funding.\n\nGraham's claim about Trump's willingness to negotiate a DACA amnesty runs counter to repeated statements from Trump and his deputies that the Supreme Court must first rule on the legality of President Barack Obama's DACA amnesty.\n\nBut on January 11, Trump suggested that a broader immigration deal could be negotiated simultaneously with negotiations over border wall funding. According to the official transcript:\n\nQ. Mr. President, on the DACA wall, a bigger immigration deal, are you saying you would only consider a broader immigration agreement after you get the wall money? THE PRESIDENT: No, I would do it simultaneously, but I'd like to see them move fast. The nice part about the wall, or the barrier, is I can have that worked out — in 15 minutes we can start construction. We're already building. But now we would be able to carry the construction through. We actually have a fantastic design that's going to be efficient and fast and really, really work well.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump also suggested that a DACA deal could be folded into a border wall deal:\n\nDemocrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don't want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019\n\nGraham is a consistent advocate for greater immigration of foreign workers and consumers. In 2012, for example, he pushed Sen. Chuck Schumer to jointly launch the Gang of Eight amnesty and cheap labor campaign. He told reporters on January 21:\n\nWe need more legal immigration. … I don't want green cards just for computer engineers. If you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, I want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, I want them to have a chance to get a green card. I just don't want to be a country in the future of just computer engineers or high-tech people.\n\nThe Senate GOP's cheap-labor caucus is offering amnesties to Democrats in exchange for a border wall for voters & more cheap visa-workers for biz. Estb. media describes the biz-first Senators as moderates. I assume Sen. Schumer is smiling. https://t.co/B2nvoim7Aa — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nGraham is trying to persuade Democrats to accept the wall-f0r-amnesty-plus-giveaway deal during the next three weeks. Graham told Fox that Deleware Sen. Chris Coons is a great guy. We could sit down to make a deal with him: wall plus DACA, wall plus TPS.\n\nIn response, Coons told Fox, Well, I agree with the advice that Lindsey Graham just gave to President Trump, which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on.\n\nBut Trump must make a public concession before Democrats will negotiate, said Coons:\n\nI think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTrump has already made several concessions, and Democrats have not moved from their no-wall stance.\n\nTrump has made 3-5 concessions in the border wall fight. But estb. media hides Democrats' refusal to offer anything in exchange. So Trump sees an incentive to escalate via a national emergency to get a wall. IOW, media's tilt skews DC political incentives https://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) and other Republican senators asked lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-CA) during the Senate impeachment trial Thursday why his committee hired Sean Misko, a former National Security Council staffer who was reportedly close to the alleged whistleblower, a day after the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said, reading the question submitted by Johnson and others:\n\nRecent reporting described two NSC staff holdovers from the Obama administration attending an all-hands meeting of NSC staff held about two weeks into the Trump administration and talking loudly enough to be overheard, saying, 'We need to do everything we can to take out the president. On July 26, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee hired one of those individuals, Sean Misko. The report further describes relationships between Misko, Lt. Col. Vindman, and an individual alleged as the whistleblower. Why did your committee hire Sean Misko the day after the phone call between President Trump and Zelensky, and what role has he played throughout your committee's investigation?\n\nSchiff refused to answer any part of the question, claiming it was an attempt to smear his staff and out the whistleblower — whose identity he also claims he does not know.\n\nSchiff did say:\n\nFirst of all, there have been a lot of attacks on my staff, and as I said when this issue came up earlier, I'm appalled at some of the smearing of some of the professional people that work for the intelligence committee. Now this question refers to allegations in a newspaper article which are circulating smears on my staff and ask me to respond to those smears and I will not dignify those smears on my staff by giving them any credence whatsoever. Nor will I share any information that I believe could or could not lead to the identification of the whistleblower.\n\nHe said it was disgraceful that the article was being used to smear his staff. He again claimed he did not know who the whistleblower was, and added, It should be every one of us.\n\nQuestion asked about former NSC staff Sean Misko saying to the alleged Whistleblower We need to do everything we can to take out the President at an NSC meeting.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Monday endorsed a policy prescription in which the U.S. government would give $1,000 to every American adult as part of an effort to help ease financial strain during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nEvery American adult should immediately receive $1,000 to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy, Romney said in a statement.\n\nThe Utah Republican also called on the Senate to pass a House bipartisan coronavirus relief package that was approved early Saturday morning following negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). The House coronavirus response package contains critical measures to help families in Utah and across the nation in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, and the Senate should act swiftly on this legislation, he stated.\n\nRomney's backing of the measure comes after Harvard Professor Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under President Barack Obama, proposed the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. Congress should pass a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria, wrote Furman. The law should also specify that the payments would continue in 2021 and beyond if the unemployment rate rises to 5.5% and remains there or higher. Hopefully this will not happen, but if it does, the money will be needed, he added.\n\nFurman's proposal echoes that of Breitbart News Economics editor John Carney, who wrote Saturday that the government need[s] to put cash into the hands of the American people as quickly as possible.\n\nI propose $1,000 of cash for every U.S. citizen. A family of four gets $4000 per month for the duration of the crisis. Bigger families get more. This boost of income will allow Americans to build emergency savings without having to drastically cut down on their spending, Carney argued. It will make it more likely that the economic emergency can be contained to frontline effects.\n\nThe idea draws on universal basic income, championed by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which the government would give all citizens a guaranteed annual income from the government. In a Monday tweet, Yang urged Congress to adopt a form of UBI to help combat the pandemic: What exactly is the political downside of putting money into people's hands? Get your shit together Congress and do the right thing.\n\nWhat exactly is the political downside of putting money into people's hands? Get your shit together Congress and do the right thing. — Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) March 16, 2020\n\nMeanwhile, some Republican senators, chiefly Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), have said that the House's relief package is doomed to fail in the upper chamber because it doesn't go far enough.\n\nFor one basic problem, it doesn't go far enough, it doesn't go fast enough, Cotton told Fox & Friends, noting that small and medium-sized businesses aren't sufficiently covered by the bill.\n\nI and a lot of the other senators, who I've spoken to over the weekend, are worried that we're not doing enough to get cash in the hands of affected workers and families quickly so we're going to be focused this week on how to do just that, the Arkansas Republican continued. We worry that the bill setting up a new and complicated system relying on businesses giving paid sick leave and then getting a refundable tax credit won't move quickly enough and could put pressure on those businesses to lay workers off.\n\nWe don't want to see layoffs, we want to see people who are at home, if they have any reason to be home, supported immediately. This is an emergency measure that only needs to last a few weeks if we all take the prudent steps necessary, he added.
University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) law professor and self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist Antonia Eliason has announced that she is running for the U.S. House of Representatives in Mississippi's first congressional district.\n\nOle Miss law professor Antonia Eliason is challenging Rep. Trent Kelly (R-MS) in the 2020 election, according to a report by the Daily Journal, which added that the professor is the only Democrat candidate who filed for the district's primary race, and therefore will presumably be the Party's nominee to run against the incumbent Republican.\n\nEliason, who is reportedly running as a Democratic Socialist, says that she wants to bring new energy to the political landscape of Northeast Mississippi.\n\nAccording to Campus Reform, some of her stances can be found on Twitter, such as her endorsement of far-left policy proposals like Medicare for All, environmental justice, and a Green New Deal.\n\nI'm Antonia Eliason. Today, we're launching the very first congressional Democratic Socialist campaign in Mississippi (MS-01). We are 100% people powered and refuse all corporate money. Join us in fighting for a new leaf for Mississippi! #Antonia4MS pic.twitter.com/fbGZIX64cM — Antonia for Congress MS-01 (@Antonia4MS1) January 13, 2020\n\nIt's time to elect progressives in Mississippi, said Eliason said last week in a statement, according to Jackson Free Press, As a Democratic socialist, I intend to bring new energy to the political landscape of Northeast Mississippi and to our Democratic Party.\n\nThe professor claims that her campaign will focus on environmental justice, universal health care, and workers' rights.\n\nWe must confront poverty, inequality and racial discrimination at their source, she added. With the right policies at the national and state level and with the engagement of grassroots social movements, Mississippi could become a hub for sustainable development thanks to our abundant resources.\n\nIt appears that Eliason has decided to take a different approach to politics when compared to some of her colleagues in academia, such as Ole Miss professor James Thomas, who in October 2018 said that simply harassing Republicans in restaurants isn't enough, and that leftists should put their whole damn fingers in senators' meals, because they don't deserve civility.\n\nEliason joined Ole Miss faculty in 2013, teaching subjects such as International Trade Law, International Investment Law, Contracts, EU Law, the Law of Armed Conflict, as well as Law and Science Fiction, according to the university's website.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.
This Saturday, February 27, was the 156th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union Address, which was delivered at Cooper Union, in New York City. It was the speech that launched Lincoln to the White House in the election of 1860; it was the speech that paved the path for a newly-formed Republican Party to take the White House for the first time, buoyed by its identification with the boldest and most unmistakeable principles.\n\nMaking the speech in New York City was a risky move for Lincoln, as it was a stronghold of his chief rival for the GOP nomination, William H. Seward. At that point in the race, Lincoln was a heavy underdog to lead the surging and strengthening Republican Party. But his lengthy speech defending the Constitution, the union, and the vision of the Founding Fathers catapulted him to victory in the most contentious election in American history.\n\nThe empty vessel of the old Whig Party had collapsed after the Compromise of 1850—which was in large part a concession to pro-slavery forces of the slave states widely praised at the time. As the nation began to unravel, new political factions and coalitions emerged.\n\nFor a while, it looked as though the Know Nothing, anti-immigrant party was on track to become the second major party in America, in opposition to Democrats. This party, which thrived alongside the organization of various secret societies, was ultimately defeated by the Republicans, who outmaneuvered and subverted them. The Republican Party ultimately prevailed because its leaders stood on principle, regardless of temporary popularity. The Know Nothings disappeared nearly as fast as they shot to power.\n\nFormer Whigs and Democrats who had fought politically their whole lives—yet were nonetheless united in defense of the Constitution—joined forces in this new Republican coalition. They were united in the belief that the ideas of the founding were fundamentally good and just. America could be great only if it embraced the philosophy that brought it into being.\n\nLincoln unhesitatingly defended these ideas at Cooper Union as he brilliantly and eloquently positioning himself as the leader of their movement. He answered the critics who claimed that his supporters were too radical and should cave to the slave power of the Southern states. Lincoln claimed that far from radical, a defense of the country's founding principles was a conservative position.\n\nWe stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by 'our fathers who framed the Government under which we live;' while you with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new, Lincoln said. True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be. You are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers.\n\nDuring the war, the Republican Party was a bulwark against the Confederacy of slave states, which could no longer tolerate a president who stood against slavery on principle. It is clear that the unrelenting, principled, stand Lincoln made at Cooper Union animated and fueled the unionists to victory.\n\nThe final line of Lincoln's great speech gave hope to the battered forces of the Union and the Constitution in 1860—as they should always give hope to patriots who believe in American exceptionalism: Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.
TEL AVIV – The U.S. on Tuesday accused Israel of expropriating land in the Jordan Valley after Israel reclassified 2,342 dunams (578 acres) near the Palestinian city of Jericho as state land, the Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nThis decision is, in our view, the latest step in what appears to be an ongoing process of land expropriations, settlement expansions, and legalizations of outposts that is fundamentally undermining the prospects for a two-state solution, U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Washington.\n\nWe strongly oppose any steps that accelerate settlement expansion, which raise serious questions about Israel's long-term intentions. And as we've repeatedly made clear, we continue to look to both sides to demonstrate with actions and policies a genuine commitment to a two-state solution. Actions such as these do just the opposite, Kirby said.\n\nIsrael's reclassification of the area, which is mostly empty desert, does not change its current usage, but does pave the way for Israel to develop it, the Jerusalem Post said.\n\nIn accordance with the decision of the political level and the examining of the professional authorities, 2,342 dunams [578 acres] have been declared as state lands, a spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Palestinians have argued that settlement activity is a barrier to the so-called peace process. Israel counters that the Palestinian refusal to hold direct negotiations is halting the advancement of the two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority has numerous times walked away from negotiations, including Israeli offers of a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem.\n\nKirby told reporters that in order to arrive at a two-state solution both sides must be willing to take the steps necessary to ratchet down the violence, to tone down the rhetoric, and through policy and decisions and actual actions, move that process forward. It has to start there. It has to start organically.\n\nThus far, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen decisions get made to propel that process forward, and that's what we continue to want to see. In order to get there, you've got to have leadership on both sides of this be real leaders and make tough decisions and be willing to compromise, Kirby said.\n\nIn a sharply worded statement, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman focused his comments solely on Israel and said that the reclassification was an an impediment to the two-state solution.\n\nSuch actions appear to point toward an increase in settlement activity and demonstrate that Israel is continuing to push forward in the consolidation of its control of the West Bank, Ban said in a statement.\n\nSettlements are illegal under international law and the secretary general urges the government of Israel to halt and reverse such actions in the interest of a just and comprehensive peace and a just and final status agreement, the statement continued.\n\nA 45-day appeal process is set to ensue.\n\nAccording to the left-wing NGO Peace Now, which monitors settlement activity in the territories, the intention is to use the land reclassification to expand tourism and trade opportunities.\n\nPLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat condemned the move, saying it is part of Israel's plan to impose an apartheid regime in occupied Palestine.\n\nIsrael, the occupying power, continues its colonial project by maintaining its belligerent occupation and by annexing more Palestinian lands throughout the occupied West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, he said.
The outcome of Secretary of State John Kerry's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin was a renewed push for a political solution in Syria, with a call to draft a new Syrian Constitution by August.\n\nThe UN Security Council passed a resolution with a similar target date for drafting a new constitution in December.\n\nThe BBC quotes U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura describing talks in Geneva between opposition leaders and the regime of dictator Bashar Assad as productive, with a lot of common ground between the two sides.\n\nOn the subject of Assad, the BBC notes that Kerry would not say if his future had been discussed during four hours of talks with Putin. Kerry would say only that he and Putin agreed on a target schedule for establishing a framework for a political transition and also a draft constitution, both of which we targeted by August. Kerry did say that he and Putin agreed Assad should do the right thing and engage in peace talks.\n\nKerry held a press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who said Russia had agreed to join the United States in pressing the Syrian regime and its opponents to hold direct talks in Geneva – a step up from the informal discussions currently under way – and a move toward a transitional governance structure.\n\nThe New York Times judges that the shape of any political transition to end the war remained vague after Kerry's marathon talks with Putin.\n\nThe main sticking point between the two countries has long been the role of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in any political transition, and there was no indication that they had reached agreement on that, adds the Times.\n\nKerry repeatedly used the phrase make the right decision as code for Assad stepping down. Russia will have to speak for itself about what it is going to choose to do in order to help Mr. Assad make the right decisions, but we agreed today that we will accelerate the effort to try to move the political process forward, he said at one point during the press conference.\n\nI believe that Russia is fully engaged in this effort and all of us are going to try to get President Assad to make the right decision over these next days to engage in a political process that results in a genuine transition and in peace in Syria, Kerry repeated later.\n\nThe NYT is brutally direct about the significance of Kerry's mission to Moscow, noting that Russia has clearly been successful in using Syria as leverage to force an end to the American policy of trying to isolate Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine. With Kerry notching three visits to Russia and 18 meetings with Lavrov over the past year, that effort has clearly succeeded.\n\nReuters also notes the atmosphere between Kerry and Putin was noticeably more amiable than past meetings, reflecting new diplomacy the two Cold War superpowers have championed in recent weeks.\n\nFor his part, Putin was as gracious as a big winner with big plans can afford to be, declaring after his meeting with Kerry, What we have been able to achieve on Syria has been possible only thanks to the position of the U.S. top political leadership, President Obama.\n\nI very much hope that your visit will allow us to bring our positions closer on moving forward to solve the Syrian crisis and … on Ukraine, Putin added.
A few days after international media noticed that not only did Chinese tech tycoon Jack Ma lose much of his corporate empire and $12 billion of his net worth after criticizing the Communist Party in late October, but he also appears to have vanished from the face of the Earth, Hong Kong's Asia Times Financial (ATF) reported Chinese state media are claiming Ma has embraced supervision, while Beijing's army of Internet trolls denounces him as a greedy traitor.\n\nATF mentioned Ma's complete scrubbing from a Chinese reality show he once hosted and enthusiastically represented as the detail that seems to have awakened the world to the flamboyant billionaire's disappearance, then described how the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) media machine is turning against the man who was once hailed as a model citizen:\n\nMeanwhile, online vitriol towards Ma has heated up (or been ramped up) dramatically. Usually known as Uncle Horse – as his Chinese surname 'Ma' means horse – he has recently been damned as a money-grabbing 'vampire' who exploits the poor, in state media outlets strongly criticising him, even the People's Daily. For a tycoon acclaimed around the world for his entrepreneurial brilliance, as well as generosity and flamboyant promotional activities, that is an extraordinary turnaround. Jack Ma is now embracing supervision at an undisclosed location, the CCP mouthpiece has reported. […] A statement in the leading state media outlet said there would be no Jack Ma era, and that reflects the current Chinese slogan that China is entering a 'new era.'\n\nATF interpreted the claim of Ma embracing supervision as an indication he has been arrested – the CCP likes to portray its prisoners as instantly reticent and overwhelmed with guilt – but also quoted BDA China consultant Duncan Clark theorizing Ma has been told to lay low while the Chinese government dismantles his financial mega-corporation, the Ant Group.\n\nAs far back as November, shortly after Ma was summoned to a meeting with Chinese regulators, state media began describing him as an irresponsible renegade who no longer had the best interests of the people at heart. Another high-flying billionaire, Liu Qiangdong of JD.com, has been subjected to similar treatment and subsequently welcomed enhanced supervision from the CCP.\n\nIf you disregard your food and make use of the policy advantages given by the state to do business that is not conducive to economic development and not beneficial to the people's lives, you will only end up reaping the consequences, Chinese state media said of Liu and Ma, suggesting other tycoons had better remember they owe their success entirely to the support and guidance of the Chinese state and its dictator, Xi Jinping.\n\nBusiness Insider (BI) on Tuesday quoted other observers who believe Ma is keeping a low profile, perhaps under orders from the CCP, but has not been imprisoned. On the other hand, BI recalled a few other high-profile Chinese who suddenly became low-profile and later turned up in prison cells:\n\nRen Zhiqiang, a retired real-estate tycoon, fell off the radar in March after accusing the Communist Party of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic, The New York Times reported. Beijing later sentenced Ren, 69, to 18 years in prison. The country reportedly arrested other critics of its response to the pandemic, including Xu Zhangrun, a law professor, and Zhang Xuezhong, a human-rights lawyer. Xiao Jianhua, an asset manager, was abducted from a hotel in Hong Kong in January 2017, Reuters reported. Xiao disappeared into Chinese custody, and the country later seized parts of his company, Tomorrow Group, The Times reported in July. Regulators had accused Xiao and other tycoons of taking would-be investors away from Chinese stock markets, The Guardian said.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking example to date was Meng Hongwei, the former head of the Interpol international law enforcement agency, who vanished while returning home to China from a trip to France and reappeared as a prison convict a few months later, sentenced to 13 and a half years in prison on charges of bribery. His wife believes Meng was another victim of the endless anti-corruption crusade that serves the CCP as a rolling political purge.
VIENNA (Reuters) – Austria will take tougher action at its borders to turn away economic migrants in order to reduce overall immigration, Chancellor Werner Faymann said, striking a harsher tone on asylum seekers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere have entered Austria, many en route to Germany, in the past year.\n\nAround 90,000 of those sought asylum in Austria – a country of 8.5 million people – in 2015, around three times more than the previous year, ORF radio said, citing Interior Ministry statistics.\n\nOne must transit to a Plan B. That means to intensify policies together with Germany to send back economic migrants and decrease overall numbers, Social Democrat Faymann said in an interview with Austrian newspaper Krone published on Tuesday.\n\nHe said Austria needed to explore the legal framework for differentiating between those fleeing war and those who migrate for economic reasons.\n\nOne thing is certain in any case: shortly, we will be more active at our borders than today. The Germans will also do more, Faymann said.\n\nOnce more lenient on accepting migrants, Faymann has come under pressure from his conservative coalition partners and the far-right Freedom Party, which in recent opinion polls won the support of around a third of those surveyed.\n\nLast month, Faymann said Austria should step up deportations of people who do not qualify for asylum.\n\nIn Germany, attacks on women in several cities on New Year's Eve have prompted hundreds of complaints, with police suspicion resting on asylum seekers, putting pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel and her open-door migrant policy.
Iran has started work on uranium fuel for a research reactor in the capital of Tehran, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday, constituting the latest violation of the nuclear deal.\n\nNews of the metal-based fuel production was confirmed by the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency.\n\nThe move is part of a wide-sweeping campaign to avenge the November killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the mastermind behind the country's nuclear weapons program, which Tehran blamed on Israel as well as in response to sanction imposed by the U.S.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has promised to reenter the nuclear deal, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018, after entering office later this month.\n\n(International Atomic Energy Agency) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi today informed IAEA Member States about recent developments regarding Iran's plans to conduct R&D activities on uranium metal production as part of its declared aim to design an improved type of fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, the IAEA said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this month, Iran announced its plans to enrich uranium to 20 percent at its underground Fordo site, a move Israel has warned proves the Islamic Republic is seeking nuclear weapons.\n\nIran announced Monday it has begun enriching uranium up to 20 percent, far beyond the limits set out in the 2015 nuclear accords. https://t.co/hKGDx0QxEd — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 5, 2021\n\nE.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday warned Tehran its decision to enrich uranium was a very serious development with potentially severe proliferation implications.
On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News Sunday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said the Obama administration's sanctions against Russia were not enough and too late.\n\nCotton said, It's not enough, and it's certainly too late. Vladimir Putin is KGB. He always has been, he always will be. President Obama has consistently looked the other way from Russia's provocations and aggression. The DNC hack last year was just one minor item in what Russia has done over the last eight years, to include things like invading and occupying Crimea and supporting rebels in Eastern Ukraine as well as threatening NATO air ships — aircraft and ships and so forth.\n\nBut what has Barack Obama done for eight years? In the very early years of his administration, he sent Hillary Clinton to push the reset button with the Russian foreign minister, he continued. In the middle of his re-election campaign in 2012 he told the Russian president that he would have more flexibility after the election. When Mitt Romney characterized Russia as our number one geopolitical adversary, Barack Obama mocked him and said that the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back. I'm glad the president has finally realized the threat that Russia poses to the United States and our interests but I wish he had recognized this eight years ago.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
From the New York Times:\n\nON New Year's Eve, in the shadow of Cologne's cathedral, crowds of North African and Middle Eastern men accosted women out for the night's festivities. They surrounded them, groped them, robbed them. Two women were reportedly raped.\n\nThough there were similar incidents from Hamburg to Helsinki, the authorities at first played down the assaults, lest they prove inconvenient forAngela Merkel's policy of mass asylum for refugees.\n\nThat delay has now cost Cologne's police chief his job. But the German government still seems more concerned about policing restless natives — most recently through a deal with Facebook and Google to restrict anti-immigrant postings — than with policing migration. Just last week Merkel rejected a proposal to cap refugee admissions (which topped one million last year) at 200,000 in 2016.\n\nThe underlying controversy here is not a new one. For decades conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic have warned that Europe's generous immigration policies, often pursued in defiance of ordinary Europeans' wishes, threaten to destabilize the continent.\n\nThe conservatives have made important points about the difficulty of assimilation, the threat of radicalization, and the likelihood of Paris-style and Cologne-style violence in European cities.\n\nBut they have also trafficked in more apocalyptic predictions — fears of a Eurabia, of mass Islamification — that were somewhat harder to credit. Until recently, Europe's assimilation challenge looked unpleasant but not insurmountable, and the likelihood of Yugoslavian-style balkanization relatively remote.
Three illegal aliens are among six accused drug dealers who were freed from jail by New York City officials after their arrests for allegedly operating a heroin-fentanyl packaging ring, a law enforcement source confirmed to Breitbart News.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Livo Valdez, Jaslin Baldera, Frederick Baldera, Frandi Ledema, Diego Tejada, and Parfraimy Antonio were arrested by New York City law enforcement officials for allegedly running a $7 million drug packaging ring, with agents seizing 750,000 glassine envelopes of suspected heroin and fentanyl.\n\nThanks to New York's newest bail reform measures, signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), all six of the accused drug dealers were released from jail without bail roughly a day after their arrests and will not spend any time in prison before the criminal trials against them begin.\n\nA law enforcement source confirmed to Breitbart News that three of the six accused drug dealers are illegal aliens from the Dominican Republic and two others are naturalized American citizens originally from the Dominican Republic.\n\nAccording to the source, at least one of the three illegal aliens among the six suspects overstayed his B-2 tourist visa — thus making him an illegal alien by federal law.\n\nAll three illegal aliens may be eligible for deportation, though New York's sanctuary state policy prohibits the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from turning over criminal illegal aliens to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\n\nAfter spending about 24 hours in jail, the accused drug dealers are expected to show up for their court date on February 27, and if they do, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office will provide them with gifts such as Mets tickets, movie passes, and gift cards to go shopping.\n\nLaw enforcement officials investigating the case said they witnessed eight individuals come in and out of the apartment where the accused drug dealers were allegedly operating the heroin and fentanyl packaging mill. The narcotics, according to officials, were destined for buyers in New York City and Massachusetts.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.
In the text released of his final State of the Union address, President Obama cynically attacks Congress for his own inaction against ISIS. Although — whether it's flooding the country with illegals or restricting gun ownership for law-abiding Americans — this lawless president is always eager to usurp the Constitution through illegal executive actions, on the one issue where he does have the constitutional authority (foreign policy) he blames Congress for his dereliction of duty:\n\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment — or mine — to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.
The European Union's investment pact with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been characterised as a real setback for the free world by the founder of Hong Kong Watch, as human rights campaigners, diplomats, and others chastise the bloc for cosying up to the dictatorship in Beijing.\n\nThe EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) was signed in principle last week, following claims of concessions from the communist regime in Beijing. The deal, which has been characterised as the first stage of cooperation between the bloc and China, is said to pave the way for €120 billion in trade.\n\nThe European Commission has described the deal as the most ambitious agreement that China has ever concluded with a third country.\n\nOne of the claimed concessions made before the signing of the agreement from China was to work towards implementing International Labour Organization conventions which prohibit the use of slave labour and set out rights for labour unions.\n\nThe idea that the Chinese Communist Party will live up to the goal of abolishing slave labour appears to stand in direct contradiction to actual CCP policy, however, as the country has been accused of building factories in at least 135 concentration camps in the Xinjiang region, alone.\n\nIn September, the CCP began to rebrand the forced labour in Xinjiang as facilitation of employment and has accused the United States of seeking to impose forced poverty on the region, by opposing the enslavement of the native Uyghur population.\n\nVideo filmed secretly inside China documents the use of 20,000 concentration camp detainees as forced labor. https://t.co/tPdhGdLYMs — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 25, 2020\n\nThe EU investment pact with China has drawn widespread criticism amongst human rights campaigners, diplomats, and even typically globalist-minded media outlets.\n\nIn comments made to Breitbart London, the chairman and founder of the UK-based think tank Hong Kong Watch, Benedict Rogers, described the deal as a real setback for the free world.\n\nJust at a time when people are finally waking up to the dangers of the CCP, after a year in which the whole world has suffered a global pandemic caused, at least in part, by the CCP's mendacity and repression, and at a time when increasingly experts are accusing the CCP of committing genocide against the Uyghurs, now is not the time to be doing such deals, especially without any human rights safeguards in them, Rogers said.\n\nThe European Parliament passed a motion in December calling for access to the camps in Xinjiang, sanctions, and saying that no investment treaty should be struck which didn't include China ratifying human rights conventions, especially the convention on forced labour, and then the European Commission rams through this deal within days despite the European Parliament's wishes.\n\nIt's a travesty, a betrayal of the EU's values, and a threat to the security of European member states, the Hong Kong Watch founder concluded.\n\nSHOCK: China is likely using lungs taken from living political prisoners to treat coronavirus patients, a doctoral researcher said, confirming revelations by a Chinese labor camp survivor during an event on Capitol Hill Tuesday. https://t.co/aZNugPX9np — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 12, 2020\n\nThe European Union has defended its decision to plough through with the deal by likening the supposed concessions from China made in the EU agreement with the phase-one trade deal signed by the Trump administration. Brussels has argued that the deal represents the bloc's strategic autonomy.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the globalist, establishment newspaper, the Financial Times, Gideon Rachman said that the European Union's claims that the deal will discipline the behaviour of the communist regime are in fact naive.\n\nIt is naive to believe that China will respect the agreement it has signed. It is naive to ignore the geopolitical implications of doing a deal with China right now. And it is naive to think that the darkening political climate in Beijing will never affect life in Brussels or Berlin, Rachman wrote.\n\nBeijing's promise to 'work towards' enforcing international conventions on labour standards are also laughably weak, he added.\n\nFarage: China is 'Licking its Chops' at the Thought of a Biden Presidency https://t.co/63je1UHJ8X — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 1, 2020\n\nThe EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment came following seven years of negotiations. Two factors are said to have played a critical role in the signing of the deal, namely China's desire to ink a deal before President-Elect Joe Biden assumes the White House and a push from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to secure a deal prior to the end of Germany's term as the head of the EU presidency in December.\n\nThe deal — which was not done in consultation with the United States — is seen as a big diplomatic loss for the incoming Biden administration, which had promised to develop closer ties with the EU to counteract the rise of China as opposed to President Trump's tougher unilateral approach.\n\nPrior to the signing of the agreement, Mr Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, had said that the administration would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China's economic practices.\n\nGermany has become increasingly tied with the communist regime, with China becoming the country's largest trading partner in 2018, with some €200 billion in trade. Merkel has argued that closer ties with China are the only way for the world to solve pressing issues, such as supposedly man-made climate change.\n\nWith Merkel set to resign later this year, and France to take the reigns of the EU presidency in 2022 — when the deal is expected to be officially ratified by member states and the European Parliament — some smaller countries in the bloc have expressed worries that they are being steamrolled by the two major economic players in the Union.\n\nMerkel Makes Clear That Germany Will Not Help U.S. in China Trade Fight https://t.co/mD8I0wy1gu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 17, 2020\n\nOne EU diplomat told POLITICO: There's a lot of frustration among smaller countries about the way the Commission has been used to push through one of Merkel's pet projects at the end of her term and the end of her legacy.\n\nIs this the way the EU will work post-Brexit? The Brits are just out and we're already missing their open market-oriented approach, the diplomat went on to say, adding: If Germany weighs in too much, smaller EU countries have nothing to say.\n\nHong Kong Watch Founder Benedict Rogers told Breitbart London that the failures of the European Union to meaningfully take on the atrocities of the communist regime will leave a vacancy in leadership that the United Kingdom should take up post-Brexit.\n\nNow that the UK has left the EU, it must play a leadership role among democracies in championing human rights and countering the dismantling of freedom in Hong Kong, the genocide of the Uyghurs and the intense repression of religious believers, civil society, lawyers, bloggers, citizen journalists, whistleblowers, and dissidents in China, Rogers said.\n\nIt is time for the UK to work with others across the free world to build an alliance of democracies to defend liberty and counter the CCP's repression and aggression.\n\nExclusive Video: Hong Kong Watch Founder Says UK Has a Responsibility to Take Lead, Call for Sanctions on China https://t.co/nSfXTkGfqE — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 24, 2019\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulka
Breitbart News Editor at Large Peter Schweizer explained at the Breitbart News Masters of the Universe town hall event how individuals responsible for censorship at major technology firms may not even be senior employees.\n\nIn recent years, YouTube, which is owned by Google, has increasingly censored or demonetized videos that they deem inappropriate or offensive, making it harder for conservatives to produce accessible content.\n\nOn the one hand, you have situations on YouTube where they shut down a site or say it is inappropriate, Schweizer explained. That could be somebody at a relatively junior level at YouTube who just decides 'I don't like what Dennis Prager's teaching is on Judeo-Christian values or whatever, it's offensive to me so I'm just going act in my capacity to censor it,' they do that all the time.\n\nHe went on to contend that there is evidence that major technology companies are systematically eliminating certain types of content to fit their own political agenda.\n\nThere are other issues I think at a more senior management level, which again we don't if are there specific policies designed to systematically eliminate certain types of speech and clearly there seems to be evidence that there is, he said.\n\nPart of the problem is that it is not just a leadership issue, it's not just a problem of corporate policy, it's a question of Google employees or YouTube employees deciding to take matters into their own hands, he continued.\n\nSchweizer appeared alongside the senior research psychologist at the Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, Dr. Robert Epstein, conservative commentator Ann Coulter, and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow at the Breitbart News' Masters of the Universe Town Hall event hosted in New Orleans.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said on the Senate floor on Monday that the Democrats are putting American lives at risk by delaying emergency legislation to address the coronavirus outbreak's toll on Americans and the U.S. economy.\n\nAs of this morning worldwide, there have been 16,381 deaths, so that's — I'm sorry, Cruz said. That's the number now. This morning, it was only 15,308.\n\nThat means today, while the Democrats have been blocking this bill, 1,073 additional people died, Cruz said. In the United States, as of this morning, there were 471 deaths reported due to coronavirus. As of right now, it's 573.\n\nThat means today, 102 Americans died while the Democrats were blocking consideration of this bill, Cruz said.\n\nIn Texas, as of this morning, there have been eight deaths, Cruz said. Now there are nine.\n\nOne Texan died while half this chamber refused to show up and do their job, Cruz said.\n\nThere is a time for political disagreements, Cruz said. There is a time for policy disagreements.\n\nI am no stranger to robust political and policy disagreements, Cruz said. But we are in the midst of a global pandemic.\n\nPeople are dying, Cruz said. People are suffering.\n\nIt is not a time to play games, Cruz said. It is time to stand for the men and women.\n\nIt is time to stand for jobs, Cruz said. It is time to help protect people's lives.\n\nOn Monday, Democrats blocked for the second time in 24 hours a bill that would have provided immediate economic relief to American workers and businesses.\n\nThe Senate blocked a motion to cloture to advance the coronavirus package for debate. The motion failed, with 49 senators in favor of the motion and 46 against the measure.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.
The Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees sounded a tone of outrage this week at an Obama administration policy that has allowed for the release of at least three criminal aliens charged with drunk driving and implicated in the murder and severe injury of Americans this year.\n\nThis careless policy is a clear and unmistakable message to the American people that this Administration has decided that their safety and security are far less important than ensuring that illegally present aliens with no regard for the law will remain in this country without any legal consequences whatsoever, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) wrote in a blistering letter Wednesday to Department of Homeland Sec. Jeh Johnson.\n\nThe Chairmen's expressed anger comes in the wake of two separate incidents in which ICE either released or refused to detain deportable aliens charged with drunk driving crimes that injured and killed bystanders and one incident in which ICE released an illegal immigrant convicted of drunk driving who went on to allegedly commit murder.\n\nAt issue is DHS' selective immigration enforcement policies — laid out in a Johnson memo offered in conjunction with President Obama's 2014 executive amnesty — in which the Obama administration prioritizes removal for illegal immigrants only if they have been convicted of felonies, are a threat to national security, have multiple misdemeanors, or are recent border crossers.\n\nUnder that memorandum, ICE may refuse to take custody of dangerous aliens from state and local law enforcement agencies when such aliens exhibit criminal behavior, but have not been convicted of a felony and most misdemeanors, Goodlatte and Grassley wrote, noting that the mere fact that an alien is illegally present should be enough for ICE to take custody.\n\nDue to the Obama administration's high bar to enforce immigration law, the chairman say, at least two women are dead, one is in a coma, and another is injured.\n\nThey pointed to ICE's 2013 release of convicted drunk driver and illegal immigrant Esmid Valentine Pedraza who was later arrested in February for the murder of his girlfriend Stacey Aguilar. Despite the fact that ICE says Pedraza had already been on a Priority 2 list for recent illegal entrants, he was released from custody.\n\nIn addition, ICE's only response to this terrible crime is to pledge that it will review Pedraza for possible enforcement action, the lawmakers wrote. Such a response is wholly unacceptable. ICE completely failed its most basic duty to protect the public – and more specifically, Stacey Aguilar – by releasing this criminal alien from custody and thereby enabling him to allegedly commit this heinous crime.\n\nThe Chairmen further pointed to the the release of Jose Munoz Aguilar in February following his arrest for drunk driving, after he hit a car occupied by Chelsea Hogue and Meghan Lake. Lake was injured and Hogue is in a coma.\n\nAccording to ICE, Aguilar was released because he 'had no significant misdemeanor or felony conviction record,' and as such, '[h]e does not meet ICE enforcement priorities,' they wrote.\n\nFinally, the Chairmen pointed to the death of Sarah Root, whose car was struck and she was killed by Eswin Mejia, an illegal immigrant, who was drag racing and drunk at the time. ICE denied a request from local authorities to take custody of Mejia so, after posing bail, Mejia absconded and remains at large.\n\nHe is now a fugitive from justice, the lawmakers wrote. An ICE spokesman stated that ICE did not lodge a detainer on Mejia because his arrest for felony motor vehicle homicide 'did not meet ICE's enforcement priorities.'\n\nAccording to Goodlatte and Grassley, ICE's actions in these cases demonstrate a complete abandonment of ICE's law enforcement mission.\n\nOn January 4, 2016, you stated that the enforcement priorities contained in your November 20, 2014, memorandum 'focus [DHS] enforcement resources on convicted criminals and threats to public safety,' they recalled.\n\nFrom that statement, you recognize that dangerous aliens who are illegally present need not be convicted of a crime to be arrested by ICE, Goodlatte and Grassley continued. Astonishingly, in all of these tragic cases, ICE determined that it was not an important federal interest to protect the public by detaining these dangerous individuals, so that they will not victimize others.\n\nThe pair requested a wealth of additional information about each criminal alien, including data about past encounters with law enforcement, their immigration histories, and if DHS still considers the three men not enforcement priorities.
Huawei has told its Chinese employees working in Europe that if they marry Westerners, they could face being fired or forced to leave the continent for betrayal, an investigation has found.\n\nA Huawei human resources handbook, entitled 'West European Region Chinese Expatriates Assignment and Mobility Management Regulation', said that employees who applied for, or were granted, permanent residence in a European country, or married an EU resident, should be instructed to leave the country as soon as possible.\n\nThe document also went on to state that attempting to settle in Europe represents a breach of their employment contract and shall resign from the company or its subsidiary, according to an investigation by The Daily Telegraph alongside European media partners in The Signals Network.\n\nThose who've obtained residency in an EU country or whose spouses are permanent EU residents and those who have voluntarily applied for permanent residency in the EU must leave Europe ASAP. If they don't follow the order, the company will terminate their employment, the Huawei document continued.\n\nA former Chinese employee based in Europe said: The internal atmosphere at the company is that if you marry a local person and get citizenship rights then this is seen as a betrayal.\n\nThe ex-employee said that Huawei attempts to keep its employees working abroad under the thumb of the authoritarian legal codes of the Chinese Communist Party in order to prevent them from releasing confidential information to foreigners.\n\nThe company doesn't want confidential information to be released. They have some core technology which is highly confidential, so this information might be known about by different staff in different departments and the company don't want this information to be leaked to external competitors or external governments in the countries where they operate, he said.\n\nAnother former employee, who had been stationed in Europe for two and a half years, was told by his Huawei manager that he could only continue working for the company if he left Europe after it was discovered that he planned to marry a European woman.\n\nIn my opinion, the company try to stop people from using the company as a tool to emigrate to Western Europe, so if they find out you want to settle down in Western Europe they will tell you to leave, he said.\n\nIt's my opinion that the reason they don't want you to marry someone local is to stop you getting local residence and getting legal status in Western Europe.\n\n'America's Dupe': China Threatens British Businesses After Decision to Ban Huawei https://t.co/0weIHNC5U4 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 15, 2020\n\nCommenting on the investigation, a national security expert at the University of Buckingham, Professor Anthony Glees, said: These are stipulations that no normal commercial company would make of its employees and that is alarming and disturbing.\n\nIt would seem to me to contradict the market interest of the company which is to sell its kit, not give people the impression that it's some kind of state agency.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei claimed that the policy was no longer valid, although did not specify when the draconian work restrictions were dropped.\n\nIf any assigned employee elects to personally apply for permanent residence in the local country this is their personal matter, he said.\n\nThe spokesman also claimed that the UK branch of Huawei has not adopted the policy.\n\nHuawei has been at the centre of an increasingly tense diplomatic spat between Britain and the communist regime in Beijing after the UK announced that it would be banning all Huawei tech from its telecommunications networks by 2027.\n\nIn November, the UK said that wireless carriers would be barred from installing new Huawei equipment in their 5G networks by September of this year.\n\nThe move came after concerted pressure from the Trump administration, which warned that intelligence sharing could be compromised with countries that continued to use Huawei tech, which the U.S. claimed has the ability to create back doors for the CCP to use for espionage purposes.\n\nBoris Johnson Should 'Reconsider' Huawei Ban Following Trump 'Defeat', Threatens Chinese Tech Giant https://t.co/n39DQPl7XK — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 17, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulka
Hollywood celebrities are coming to the aid of the abortion industry following the Trump administration's announcement of a new rule that ends the notion that abortion is health care or family planning and requires abortion facilities to be physically and financially separate from federally funded family planning centers.\n\nThe new rule, which can be read at the website of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), bars recipients of federal Title X family planning funds from referring women for abortions and – for abortion providers that also offer family planning services – also requires completely separate facilities for these services. The rule sends the clear message that abortion is not family planning or health care.\n\nThe new regulations also require Title X recipients to both abide by all state and local laws that mandate the reporting of child sexual abuse, and to document that they have made those reports.\n\nActress and comedian Sarah Silverman started off ripping Trump on May 18 with her assertion the new rule is not about protecting life, but about limiting women's choices while courting a specific voting block:\n\nTime to expose all the abortions paid for by the hypocrite politicians that vote for this. Make no mistake, this is about limiting women's choices while courting a specific voting block. This could not be less about morals or life. https://t.co/NkivIkdOuL — Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) May 18, 2018\n\nMRC NewsBusters noted other celebrity tweets as well:\n\nTweet at him now and tell him: he has no right to make decisions about your body, tweeted actress Jane Fonda:\n\nBREAKING: .@RealDonaldTrump just announced a gag rule that would prohibit doctors from referring patients for abortion and block patients from care at PP.

Taxpayer funds that would go to abortion facilities that refuse to abide by the new regulations – and some may choose not to – are slated to go to other federally qualified health centers that do not perform abortions and that provide more comprehensive health care. Any individual who would have chosen a Title X abortion facility for regular health care and family planning services can find another center at getyourcare.org.\n\nThese centers outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by a 20:1 ratio, notes Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser.\n\nActress Jessica Biel also tweeted the gag rule is a dangerous Trump-Pence policy that allows doctors to withhold information from women about their pregnancy options and block patients from coming to Planned Parenthood:\n\nTitle X gives women access to birth control and therefore more control over their lives, health, careers and economic security. A gag rule takes that away. #NoGagRule @PPact RT pic.twitter.com/JjHkLQI7cC — Jessica Biel (@JessicaBiel) May 24, 2018\n\nThe new rule, however, does not prohibit doctors in Title X facilities from counseling women about abortion.\n\nMadame Secretary's Tea Leoni also tweeted the same misinformation about the new Title X regulations:\n\nUnder the administration's gag rule, people who access care through Title X—mostly the uninsured, low income, or people of color—wouldn't be able to get info about all their options, including abortions. Enough is enough. #IStandWithPP to say #NoGagRule. https://t.co/hWRLx6mfIZ — Téa Leoni (@TeaLeoni) May 24, 2018\n\nUnder the administration's gag rule, people who access care through Title X—mostly the uninsured, low income, or people of color—wouldn't be able to get info about all their options, including abortions, she posted. Enough is enough.\n\nAgain, the new rule does allow facilities that receive Title X funding to counsel about abortion, but not refer for abortion. Low-income individuals and the uninsured can still go to the many thousands of federally qualified health centers that provide more expansive services than Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. Additionally, Title X facilities that currently perform abortions and distribute contraception can choose to abide by the new rule and separate their family planning centers from those that perform abortions in order to remain eligible for grants under this program.\n\nOther celebrities tweeted similar left-wing talking points that reflected a lack of knowledge about the new rule.\n\nStop playing politics with our bodies and health care, postedTop Chef producer Padma Lakshmi:\n\nTitle X gives women access to contraception and more control over their lives, health, careers, & economic security — and a gag rule takes that care away, said Kate Walsh of 13 Reasons Why:\n\nTitle X gives women access to contraception and more control over their lives, health, careers, & economic security — and a gag rule takes that care away. #NoGagRule — Kate Walsh (@katewalsh) May 23, 2018\n\nNumerous other celebrities joined in attacking the new rule:\n\n.@RealDonaldTrump announced a gag rule that would prohibit doctors from referring patients for abortion and block patients from care at @PPact.

A Brazilian election poll found that 24 percent of respondents are not aware that an appellate court sentenced former president and current presidential front-runner Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to 12 years in prison on corruption charges.\n\nLula of the leftist Workers' Party (PT) is leading the 2018 presidential race with 36 percent of the vote, suggesting that over half of those who support him do not know that he has been found guilty in two courts of taking millions in graft and laundering the money, buying himself a luxury triplex property and securing his future.\n\nThe Brazilian newspaper O Globo extracted this detail from a Datafolha survey taken nearly a week after Lula's second conviction, on January 29 and 30. The 24 percent of voters not aware of the appellate court affirming his conviction and extending his sentence by two years represents 35 million people, the newspaper notes. Brazil boasts 146 million eligible voters.\n\nThe second conviction triggered the imposition of the Clean Slate Law, which bans politicians convicted of corruption from running for office. Lula still awaits a final appeal, however, in which he is clinging to the hope of having his conviction overturned before elections in October.\n\nDespite his conviction—the result of years of investigations in what is now known as Operation Car Wash, Lula remains the frontrunner. Operation Car Wash is a sprawling prosecutorial probe into Petrobras, the state-run oil company, that found politicians from nearly all of Brazil's dozens of political parties participating in a scheme in which politicians would secure overpriced infrastructure contracts to private corporations who would then kick some of the excess profits back to the politicians involved. The plan peaked during Lula's tenure; two courts have found that he personally profited to the tune of millions from the operation.\n\nSpeaking to O Globo, Mauro Paulino, Datafolha's director general, said he did not expect Lula to lose votes since 24 percent of people became informed about his conviction, as most were low education, lower-income voters—the same demographic that has traditionally supported the leftist politician. The newspaper notes that most of those who said they were unaware of the appellate trial only had an elementary school education and tended to make barely more than minimum wage.\n\nDatafolha's poll, the first since both Lula's second conviction and the entry of former president Fernando Collor de Mello into the race, revealed shocking levels of comfort with corruption in government. Lula remains the front-runner in the race, for example, despite 80 percent of respondents saying that they believe Lula was aware of Operation Car Wash while in office. More than half of those polled said they wanted to see Lula in prison.\n\n47 percent of Brazilians, including current President Michel Temer, said they would like Lula to have a chance to be on the 2018 ballot.\n\nPersonally, regarding the political field, I think that if he could participate in elections and eventually be defeated, that would be the best for the country, Temer told reporters in an interview in January.\n\nOther Brazilian officials have called the persistence of the Lula campaign a surreal situation for the country.\n\nDatafolha found that, without Lula on the ballot, conservative legislator and military veteran Jair Bolsonaro would likely win the first round of voting, but without the majority necessary to keep a run-off vote from happening. Brazilian law requires anyone not winning the first round by a majority to enter a run-off with the second-most popular presidential choice.\n\nBolsonaro has run a campaign largely centered around social conservatism—his campaign slogan includes the phrase God above everyone and he has made opposition to LGBT issues a pillar of his policy—in a nation known as among the world's most socially liberal. Bolsonaro is, however, the only candidate making a significant dent in the polls who has never been accused of corruption.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
Tuesday on ABC's The View, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said it is fantastic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is challenging the status quo, with policy proposals reflecting the ideology of the socialist left.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMCCAIN: I wanted to ask you. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on 60 Minutes this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she's promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car should be eliminated within the next eleven years. Everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly and this ideology of the socialist left could splinter your party?\n\nHARRIS: No. You know, I think she's challenging the status quo. I think that's fantastic. I think that. You know, I used to teach, before, especially before, the last few years. And the thing I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it's good for the party. I frankly think it's good for the country. Let's look at the bold ideas. And I'm eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend the status quo, then do it. If there's not merit, let's explore new ideas.
MSNBC's Joy Reid said Tuesday on her network's New Hampshire primary coverage that to defeat President Donald Trump, the 2020 Democratic nominee will have to fight like a Republican.\n\nReid pointed to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg because he is a Republican, or used to be, anyway.\n\nReid said, He still sounds like a Republican to a lot of people. So it's a weird coalition. I have to tell you — if this is an exhaustion election, which I think it is. An exhaustion election means people just want to sleep at night.\n\nShe continued, I know Republicans who — they don't mind the fiscal policies of Trump. They like that, but they also want to sleep at night. If you're a Republican and still want Republican policy but don't want the tweets and the madness, you might go to him. If you're a Democrat that just wants to beat Trump at all costs, you see Trump as just this force of evil, and you just want the money that it's's going to take to defeat him, and you think this guy will spend $2 billion to beat him, you might vote for him.\n\nCo-host Nicole Wallace said, That is something I pick up anecdotally is you want the guy that is going to fight high and low. This is a compliment, not an insult to Democrats. They follow the rules. You can't follow the rules and beat Donald Trump. He cheats at everything. He asked Ukraine to help him. There's a sense that Bloomberg not that he will break any rules, but he'll go high, and he'll go low. He talked about porn and a cheeseburger and a putter being in his brain.\n\nReid said, Number one, you can't beat showbiz without showbiz. Democrats don't understand showbiz, even though all of showbiz is on their side, Hollywood, but they don't understand showbiz. And the other reality is if you want a Democrat to win, they have to know how to fight like a Republican. He is a Republican, or used to be anyway.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Asylum applications in the UK have hit an all-time high, sailing past 5,000 in the month of October alone – more than double the number arriving per month at the beginning of 2015. Critics have called the figure another nail in the coffin of the government's migration targets.\n\nMore than a million migrants have arrived in Europe by sea or air over the last twelve months, swarming in from the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia in a bid to begin a new life in the west. Many more have headed west from the Balkan states, leading to Germany registering more than one million asylum claims alone during 2015. Sweden and France have also seen high levels of immigration.\n\nAnd the UK is no different. According to official figures from Eurostat, October saw 5,095 migrants and their dependents claim asylum in the UK. That represents the highest figure in a single month since the statistic was first recorded in 2009, up from 2,270 a month at the start of 2015, The Telegraph has reported.\n\nThe figures come just days after a think tank called on Prime Minister David Cameron to admit that his target to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands was effectively dead. It urged Mr Cameron to be honest with the British public and admit that even if he achieves reform to migrant benefits as hoped, numbers are unlikely to be significantly affected.\n\nSunder Katwala, British Future's director, said: Most people now know that being in the [European Union] with free movement means high immigration. It's better to have real-world plans to manage the impacts of migration – on welfare costs, housing, public services and integration – than promises that are unlikely to be kept or believed.\n\nKeith Vaz MP, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs committee reiterated that the figures are a death knell to the tens of thousands immigration promise.\n\nThese statistics are another nail in the Government's commitment to reduce migration to the tens of thousands, he said.\n\nIt is important that we know where these applications are coming from, and that the Government develops a coherent, defensible and transparent policy in processing asylum requests.\n\nDespite attempts by pro-immigration voices to equate the recent immigration influx with the war in Syria, the statistics showed that only ten percent of the newcomers were registered as Syrians. Nearly one in eight were from Eritrea. Mr Cameron has promised to take in a further 20,000 Syrian migrants directly from the Middle East by 2020.\n\nIn total, more than 150,000 asylum applications were made in Europe in October. The vast majority, 54,870, were lodged in Germany. Sweden was the next most popular destination, with 39,055 applying for asylum there in October alone. Britain was the eighth most popular destination, but is arguably harder to reach thanks to the English Channel.\n\nThe European Union has predicted that three million more migrants will arrive in Europe in 2016.\n\nResponding to the British figures, the Home Office explained that Eurostat's figures were higher than its own figures because they included dependants seeking asylum, not just the main applicants.\n\nA spokesman said: The United Kingdom has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to those who genuinely need our protection.\n\nAll claims for asylum are considered on their individual merits, and where people establish a genuine need for protection from persecution, refuge will be granted.\n\nHowever, if people do not need our protection they are expected to leave the UK and we may remove them if they do not go voluntarily.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, told reporters at a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on Tuesday that his country and its allies will fully set our differences aside with Qatar, ending a virtual blockade that has endured for over three years.\n\nThere is a desperate need today to unite our efforts to promote our region and to confront challenges that surround us, especially the threats posed by the Iranian regime's nuclear and ballistic missile program and its plans for sabotage and destruction, explained Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) after the six member states of the GCC signed a document expressing their Gulf, Arab, and Islamic solidarity and stability.\n\nThe foreign minister of Kuwait, which has acted as a mediator throughout the dispute, announced on Monday that Saudi Arabia would reopen its land and sea borders to Qatar after closing them in 2017. MBS was filmed embracing Qatari ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani when the latter's plane arrived for the GCC summit:\n\nMBS then took al-Thani on a tour of historic sites in Al-Ula, the city where the GCC summit was held.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and growing too close to Iran when they launched the embargo in 2017. They gave Qatar a list of 13 demands to fulfill, including ending support for the Muslim Brotherhood and shutting down Qatar-based news network Al Jazeera.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Qatar accepted any of the demands previously listed by Riyadh and its backers in order to achieve the compromise announced on Monday. So far, Qatar did not publicly move on any of the issues, Deutsche Welle wrote on Tuesday, tallying up the scorecard.\n\nUAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said on Tuesday that the 13 demands were a maximalist negotiating position and should not be used to judge the success of the standoff with Qatar.\n\nI think what we end up with today is general outlines that basically govern relations between states that are party to the same organization. These are what I would call general outlines of how this relationship will move on, and I think we're very satisfied with this and we want to build on it, Gargash said.\n\nAl Jazeera, still in business as of Tuesday, reported various Middle Eastern powers welcoming the reconciliation announcement, including Iran.\n\nCongratulations to Qatar for the success of its brave resistance to pressure and extortion. To our other Arab neighbors: Iran is neither an enemy nor threat. Enough scapegoating, especially with your reckless patron on his way out. Time to take our offer for a strong region, tweeted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.\n\nThe reckless patron Zarif referred to is U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration presented the end of the Qatar feud as a result of American diplomacy. An administration official told Reuters on Monday that President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, helped negotiate the deal and was working the phones on it until the wee hours of Monday morning.\n\nThe official hailed the agreement as a massive breakthrough that would lead to more stability in the region.\n\nDeutsche Welle quoted Middle East expert Samuel Ramani theorizing that Saudi Arabia ended the blockade of Qatar because it is worried about the realignment of U.S. foreign policy under the Biden administration.\n\nBiden views Mohammed bin Salman as a destabilizing force in the region and Saudi Arabia is desperate to shed this negative image. Ending the blockade against Qatar suggests that Saudi Arabia is interested in contributing to regional stability, Ramani said.\n\nFrance24 News noted there are still some lingering conflicts between Qatar and its neighbors, prominently including Egypt's security concerns:\n\nIn a sign that hostilities continue to simmer, Qatar protested to the UN Security Council last month that Bahraini fighter jets violated Qatari airspace in early December. Bahrain, meanwhile, has accused the Qatari coast guard of arbitrarily detaining dozens of Bahraini fishing vessels. Ahmed Hafez, the spokesman for Egypt's Foreign Ministry, said last week that Cairo supports efforts to reach a resolution that respects non-interference in internal affairs in an apparent reference to Qatar's backing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The conflict in Libya is also a contentious issue, with Egypt and the UAE supporting militias fighting a Tripoli-based bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar.\n\nEgypt has reportedly submitted its own list of demands to Qatar via Kuwait and has agreed in principle to reopen its airspace for Qatari flights while it awaits a response.
DALTON, Georgia — President Donald Trump at a rally Monday told Republicans they have gotta swamp the Democrats at the polls on January 5, speaking on the eve of Georgia's Senate runoff election day as more than three million votes have already been cast.\n\nTrump reminded a crowd of thousands at Dalton Municipal Airport it was imperative Republicans turn out to the polls on Tuesday as they must compensate for Democrat gains in early voting numbers. Democrats have historically been stronger in early voting, while Republicans have performed better in day-of voting.\n\nYou're going to show up at the polls in record numbers. You've gotta swamp 'em, Trump said.\n\nDespite the president repeatedly harping on voter fraud throughout the evening and alleging the November 3 general election was rigged, he warned that Republicans must still participate in Tuesday's election to retain the Senate majority. You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can't steal it or cheat it away, Trump said.\n\nSens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) are facing Democrat candidates Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock in dual runoff races Tuesday, and if both Democrats were to win, their party would take control of Congress's upper chamber.\n\nTrump described the election as one of the most important elections in history. It's a biggie, he said, as he pitched Perdue and Loeffler as senators who share Georgia values and lambasted Ossoff and Warnock as fringe extremists.\n\nThe choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear, Trump said. He touted Perdue, who is seeking his second term in the Senate, as an ally who voted in favor of Trump's tax cuts, led a charge to secure relief for workers and farmers after Hurricane Michael ravaged southwest Georgia in 2018, and has supported immigration policy that favors American jobs.\n\n***Live Updates*** Trump Holds Georgia Rally for Sens. Loeffler, Perdue https://t.co/dZf2vmcOPY — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 5, 2021\n\nTrump called Loeffler a fantastic champion for Georgians, raving that she staunchly supports the military and police, believes in protecting Second Amendment rights, and voted in favor of appointing Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump added both Perdue and Loeffler stand with him in their desire to deliver $2,000 direct payments to Americans as part of the federal government's coronavirus relief efforts.\n\nBy contrast, the president said Ossoff and Warnock would serve as agents to implement a Democrat agenda in Washington that includes massively raising taxes, gutting the military — military installations like Fort Benning and Fort Gordon would be on the chopping block — surrendering the American manufacturing industry to China, and opening borders to illegal immigrants, which would make the country one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and overwhelm schools and hospitals.\n\nTrump concluded that America as you know it will be over if Ossoff and Warnock win.\n\nOther speakers featured at the rally included Georgia GOP chairman David Shafer, state Rep. Vernon Jones (D), Trump's children Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA).\n\nPolls will be open for the runoffs statewide in Georgia from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Tuesday, and most polling for both races has indicated the outcome will be a toss-up.\n\nWrite to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.
A male student at Dartmouth College is facing a significant backlash to an op-ed he wrote in a student newspaper criticizing a campus program that hires mostly female students.\n\nDartmouth College Student Ryan Spector wrote a column in the Dartmouth College student newspaper, criticizing the college's Trips program — which helps incoming students adjust to college life — for its nearly 5 to 1 hiring imbalance in favor of women.\n\nThis year, the Trips directors' obsession with diversity verges on the inane. Described as 'majority female' in The Dartmouth, this year's directorate, excluding Pierson and Rodriguez-Caspeta, is nearly 80 percent female, Spector wrote. Yes — of the 19-person Trips directorate, there are merely four males on the staff.\n\nSpector provided a quote from the Trips program directors who claimed that all hiring decisions were made based on merit alone.\n\nCredentials matter not, but skin tone, womanhood, and claims of marginalized status do, Spector continued. [the program's directors] may believe in merit, but it is a twisted form of it, a pernicious theory that sees race, gender and identity as dictating qualification. In the eyes of genuine, concerned progressives, this is called prejudice. This is what it looks like to systematically devalue minorities, to reduce them to nothing but a plate on the diversity buffet.\n\nI support affirmative action-style policies, Spector added. But I do not support the extreme application of a diversity policy. And I do not support a directorate that is unrecognizable as representatives of Dartmouth's student body.\n\nSpector immediately faced a backlash for his column. Close to 40 student organizations published statements condemning Spector for his op-ed. A column in the Dartmouth student newspaper penned by two professors of government listed some of the terms that had been used to describe Spector. One student even accused Spector of endangering lives.\n\nYet in their criticism of the column, and of The Dartmouth for publishing it, many (though not all) Dartmouth organizations escalated the rhetoric further, decrying Spector and his column as hateful, toxic, vicious, privileged, ignorant, patriarchal, white supremacist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, oppressive and endangering lives.\n\nAs a result of the backlash, the editorial team at the Dartmouth distanced themselves from Spector's column, claiming that it does not represent the team's views. Guest columns, and any column published in The Dartmouth not under the authorship of 'The Dartmouth Editorial Board,' do not represent the views of the newspaper or the editors who worked to bring it to publication, they wrote.
The Algemeiner reports: The umbrella group that represents leading Jewish organizations in the US issued on Thursday a stinging rebuke to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas for his defiant confirmation that the policy of so-called martyr payments — monthly donations to approximately 35,000 families of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists that are higher than the average wage in the PA — will not be halted.\n\nWe are appalled by widespread media reports that President Abbas and other officials of the Palestinian Authority have recently made statements in Palestinian social and other media reaffirming their commitment to continue payments exceeding $300 million annually to reward terrorists and their families for attacking and killing Israelis, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations Chairman Stephen M. Greenberg and Executive Vice Chairman and CEO Malcolm Hoenlein said in a joint statement.\n\nEarlier this week, the Israeli monitoring organization Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) highlighted a statement in Abbas's name on the Facebook page of the PA, in which the 82 year-old Palestinian leader said he would not bend on the issue, even if it cost him his job.\n\nRead more here.
(AP) — Israeli leaders hoping President Donald Trump would be a rubber stamp for the Jewish state are hearing plenty of reassuring rhetoric at this week's annual gathering for the unbreakable alliance.\n\nMissing from the agenda: Concrete steps advancing the Israeli government's top priorities.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal, so despised by Israel, is solidly in place. The U.S. Embassy is no closer to moving to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government wants. As it has under past presidents, Washington is still telling Israel to slow settlement construction.\n\nIt is making for an unusual American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, one relieved of the strains that marked the last years of President Barack Obama's tenure but also filled with significant uncertainty.\n\nNetanyahu on Monday called the U.S.-Israeli relationship stronger than ever.\n\nHis ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, said a day earlier that for the first time in years or even decades, there is no daylight between our two governments.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said he and Trump stand without apology for Israel and we always will.\n\nBut it's too early to tell whether Trump will ultimately fulfill Israel's wishes. And there are indications he's reconsidering several stances adopted during the campaign.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump repeatedly vowed to be the president to finally relocate the embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital. As Pence said Sunday, that unequivocal promise has morphed into Trump now giving serious consideration to moving the American Embassy.\n\nThough Trump in the campaign said he'd renegotiate or dismantle the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel fiercely opposes, as president he's continuing to implement the accord while examining whether it should stand and hitting Iran with other, non-nuclear sanctions. GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, rather than urging that the deal be terminated, told AIPAC that the U.S. must vigorously enforce the deal and tighten the screws on Iranian compliance.\n\nNetanyahu has taken some reassurance from the fact that Trump's budget proposal safeguards every penny of Israel's $3.1 billion in U.S. assistance, even as it seeks to slash foreign aid overall. And while the Obama administration stung Israel by allowing a U.N. resolution critical of Israel to pass in Obama's final weeks, new U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has pledged not to let that happen again.\n\nWe said, 'The days of Israel-bashing are over,' Haley told AIPAC on Monday.\n\nThe biggest question mark may be Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.\n\nOn that matter, Obama and Netanyahu struggled to speak with a unified voice. Trump has shown significant flexibility — stunning many last month when he broke with decades of U.S. policy by saying the U.S. could live with a one-state solution, rather than a two-state solution involving Palestinian statehood, if both Israelis and Palestinians agreed.\n\nNow Trump and the Israeli leader are both speaking vaguely of a broader Middle East package. Israel's Arab neighbors, who traditionally opposed Israel but have realigned because of common concerns about Iran — would serve as guarantors.\n\nThe common dangers faced by Israel and many of our Arab neighbors now offer a rare opportunity to build bridges towards a better future, Netanyahu said.\n\nTrump's diplomacy in the region appears to be gaining speed. As Netanyahu spoke to the AIPAC conference by video from Jerusalem, White House envoy Jason Greenblatt was headed to Jordan to attend an Arab summit, according to a U.S. official who wasn't authorized to discuss the trip publicly and requested anonymity.\n\nGreenblatt, Trump's longtime business attorney, will be an observer at the summit, but plans to use his visit to discuss the type of regional approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Netanyahu and Trump have floated. While in Amman, Greenblatt plans to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan and Algeria, the U.S. official said.\n\nAnother issue central to the conflict — settlements — remains a work in progress for Israel and Trump. The president's softer campaign tone about Israel's construction of Jewish homes in east Jerusalem and the West Bank has been replaced by Trump's suggesting in his first White House meeting with Netanyahu to hold back on settlements for a bit.\n\nAt that meeting, Trump and Netanyahu voiced confidence they could work out an understanding, while providing few hints how.\n\nA visit by Israeli officials last week ended with a public statement saying Israel would take Trump's concerns into consideration and pledges by both countries to keep talking.
LONDON (AP) — Virgin Trains will once again sell the Daily Mail newspaper after complaints about its decision to stop offering passengers the popular tabloid.\n\nRichard Branson said Monday he only learned of the decision not to sell the Daily Mail after it became a media issue last week.\n\nHe says the company must not be seen to be censoring what our customers read and influencing their freedom of choice.\n\nThe newspaper had accused Virgin Trains of censorship because it was no longer selling the title. Some legislators also criticized the decision and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called the ban pompous.\n\nAn internal Virgin Trains memo in November said the newspaper's editorial position on some policy matters were not compatible with the Virgin brand.\n\nIt cited issues including immigration, LGBT rights and unemployment.
Leading Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has said an indefinite Brexit 'transition' period would be a perversion of democracy, slamming a leaked government proposal containing no provision for immigration controls.\n\nRees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group (ERG), also claimed the negotiating strategy, reported Wednesday, has been disowned by Ministers as not representing Government policy.\n\nIndeed, the Telegraph reports that the Cabinet did not agree to an indefinite 'transition', during which Britain would effectively remain inside the European Union but lose it's voting powers in the European Parliament and Council.\n\nAccording to the paper, senior ministers, including Boris Johnson, learned of the position paper less than a day before it was published, and a number of them were furious about the new negotiating position.\n\nContinuing the 'transition' for an extended period could stop Britain from striking trade deals and keep its borders open, as the document contains no mention of Theresa May's promise to stop Free Movement after Brexit day.\n\nRees-Mogg Tory Group Send Clean Brexit 'Ransom Letter' to Appeaser Theresa https://t.co/NxJYJk3EkA — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2018\n\nIt has been disowned by Ministers as not representing Government policy, wrote Mr. Rees-Mogg in the Telegraph. Transition must be time-limited, the European Union itself has suggested twenty-one months to the end of the multiannual financial framework.\n\nHe added: Additionally, there is no mention of our having the ability to apply immigration controls. Concern over lost control over migration was a significant issue in the referendum.\n\nWhoever compiled this document proposes no changes to it for an indefinite period and would thereby let down millions of voters for whom this was an important issue.\n\n'Brexit Betrayal at Its Contemptible Worst' – Appeaser Theresa Asks EU for INDEFINITE 'Transition' Period https://t.co/ytO8UyPm6R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2018\n\nThe document reportedly says the duration of the 'transition period' should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes.\n\nFormer Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, another member of the ERG, also said Cabinet ministers had not been given the chance to approve the document.\n\nI am deeply concerned that a policy document turns out not to be an agreed Government position, he said.\n\nThere are genuinely deep concerns about policy areas, particularly around not being able to sign trade deals.
Despite record worldwide shipments of 403.1 million smartphones in the last quarter of 2015, Apple's iPhone suffered its first year-end sales decline in history, according to the world's leading tech advisory firm.\n\nApple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) sales of iPhones to customers dropped 4.4 percent to 71.5 million from the prior year's 74.8 million. As a result, Samsung's market share jumped from 19.9 percent in 2014 to 20.7 percent in 2015, while Apple's share plunged from 20.4 percent to 17.4 percent, according to Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT).\n\nGartner's numbers are far below the 74.77 million sales of iPhones that Apple, Inc. reported for the three months ending December 26. But Apple employs the controversial accounting policy of reporting shipments into dealer hands as sales for accounting purposes.\n\nIn the tech business this is sometimes referred to as channel stuffing and can seriously distort the true picture of customer demand. If iPhones go unsold on dealer shelves, they can be returned to Apple for a refund or serve as stranded inventory that clogs up reorders by dealers.\n\nIf Gartner is correct, Apple's suffered almost a 15 percent loss of market share compared to 2014, and sales of iPhones to customers dropped for the first time–in the typically booming last three months of a year.\n\nBreitbart News reported in July that Wall Street's Love Affair with Apple May Be Over. With the stock trading within pennies of the all-time-record price of $132.54, it was clear that the upgrade cycle for the newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was only about 20 percent, almost a third lower than previous cycles after two quarters. We added, It would appear that the Apple iOS ecosystem is being challenge.\n\nWith 80 percent of Wall Street analysts calling the stock a buy, and an average target price of $165, such talk by Breitbart at the time was considered tech blasphemy. But the stock closed on Feb. 18 at $96.26, down 27 percent since Breitbart's warning.\n\nMichael Blair at Seeking Alpha estimates that Apple added 2 million iPhones to channel inventory from July through September, and another 3.3 million iPhones to channel inventory during the holiday quarter from October through December. He believes the current iPhone channel inventory is about 21.8 million, up from 16.45 million in July.\n\nApple has stated on conference calls that that its plan is to sell 4 million iPhones per week and carry five to seven weeks of inventory. But a 5.3 million increase in channel inventory indicates Apple has a significant shortfall in customer sales. That would more than justify Gartner's call that iPhone customer sales and market share are shriveling.\n\nChannel stuffing has led to numerous corporate scandals in the tech world. The biggest recently was the shake-up at Toshiba Corporation, where legendary CEO Atsutoshi Nishida, and his successors Norio Sasaki and Hisao Tanaka, are alleged to have pushed division heads to achieve unrealistic sales and earnings targets, according to Reuters.\n\nTo keep their jobs, Toshiba division leaders employed an array of questionable accounting tactics for at least seven years, according to an investigation by Japan's Securities Exchange and Surveillance Commission. Toshiba is expected to soon admit it used channel stuffing as a tool for accounting fraud and erase years of profits by restating them as earnings losses.
A report generated by the State Department on the threat posed by leaks to the media was leaked to Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, according to his commentary published on Friday.\n\nRogin, who does not provide the memo or a link to the February 20 memo in his commentary, did give a link to the State Department official who allegedly wrote the memo, Richard Visek, acting legal adviser at the agency.\n\nThe State Department legal office prepared a four-page memo for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warning of the dangers of leaking by State Department employees, Rogin wrote. It promptly leaked, to me.\n\nThat's only the latest sign that the relationship between the Trump administration political appointees and the State Department professional workforce is still very much a work in progress, Rogin wrote.\n\nThe memo was entitled SBU: Protecting Privileged Information, according to Rogin.\n\nThe SBU stands for Sensitive But Unclassified, a designation used on documents that are not technically secret but also not supposed to be shared, Rogin wrote. The memo itself is marked SBU and begins with detailed explanation of how and when Tillerson has the privilege of protecting certain types of information from public disclosure, such as anything that has to do with internal State Department deliberations.\n\nBut the bulk of the memo is devoted to arguments for clamping down on unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information, also known as leaking, Rogin wrote.\n\nRogin provided wording from the memo: When such information is leaked … It chills the willingness of senior government officials to seek robust and candid advice, which ultimately is to the detriment of informed policymaking and the reputation of the institution from which the leak emanated.\n\nThe memo makes the case for plugging leaks wherever they be found., Rogin wrote.\n\nIf the Department is going to be able to influence policy deliberations, we need to have a reputation for engaging responsibly in those deliberations, the memo states.\n\nRogin also cites unnamed State Department bureaucrats who don't feel that they are able to affect policy through the normal channels due to what they see as lack of communication coming from Trump's and Tillerson's people.\n\nThere's so much that's not being communicated inside the building and it's a huge problem that effects everybody, one career State Department official said, according to Rogin. Posts are calling us and asking us, 'What are we supposed to say?' We don't know what to tell them.\n\nRogin wrote that his Washington Post colleagues have reported those bureaucrats are unhappy with Tillerson.\n\nHe hasn't attended key meetings, crucial foreign policy issues have been delegated to senior White House advisers, Tillerson has been largely out of the public eye and the department has not held a news briefing since the inauguration, Rogin said.\n\nTillerson and his team should do to more to build trust with the State Department workforce and bring them along, rather than worrying about stamping out leaks, Rogin asserts. Most State Department officials would prefer to influence policy through the proper channels, if that is an option.
On Thursday's broadcast of MSNBC's The Beat, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) reacted to John Bolton replacing H.R. McMaster as National Security Adviser by criticizing the way the change was made and the lack of clear direction in the policy realm and stated that this points to danger signals.\n\nBlumenthal said, As important as the change, Ari, is the way it was made, lack of explanation, an indication of continuing churn and chaos and deep division in this White House, and the lack of any clear direction from the president on policy. You're absolutely right, John Bolton is known as a hardliner, clearly different than others in the administration now on the Iran agreement, for example, and it points to danger signals.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the Medical Supply Chain Security Act on Thursday to combat potential American drug shortages created in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China and to reveal America's reliance on Chinese manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\n\nSen. Hawley said in a statement that the legislation would provide the country with the information necessary to secure the medical supply chain. He explained:\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China has highlighted severe and longstanding weaknesses in our medical supply chain. This is more than unfortunate; it's a danger to public health. Our health officials need to know the extent of our reliance on Chinese production so they can take all necessary action to protect Americans. This legislation will give us the information we need to better secure our supply chain and ensure that Americans have uninterrupted access to life-saving drugs and medical devices.\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus throughout China has exposed the deep vulnerabilities in the U.S. medical supply chain as well as the country's dependence upon China producing pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\n\nAxios reported that the coronavirus outbreak has jeopardized the American supply of roughly 150 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, generics, and brand-name drugs. Some of these drugs do not have alternatives on the market.\n\nChina exports 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of active ingredients used to make drugs in America. America is losing its ability to make pharmaceuticals because of Chinese dumping of low-price products into the global market.\n\nPublic health officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently have limited resources for assessing supply chain vulnerabilities. The FDA recently asked Congress for more statutory authority to require that manufacturers notify the agency when they discover circumstances that may lead to shortages in essential medical devices. Giving the FDA more authority would allow the agency to ensure that they can take the necessary steps to mitigate potential shortages of life-saving drugs and medical devices.\n\nHawley's legislation would:\n\nRequire that manufacturers report imminent or forecasted shortages of medical devices to the FDA as they currently do for pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nAllow the FDA to expedite the review of essential medical devices that require pre-market approval in the event of expected shortages reported by a manufacturer.\n\nGrant the FDA additional authority to request additional information from manufacturers of essential drugs or devices regarding their manufacturing capacity, including sourcing of component parts, sourcing of active pharmaceutical ingredients, use of raw materials, and any other details the FDA might find relevant to assess the security of the American medical supply chain.\n\nHawley's legislation follows as the Missouri populist wrote a letter this week to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, asking Hahn what actions he and the agency can take to ensure that American citizens do not face shortages of life-saving drugs and medical drugs.\n\nThe Missouri senator said Tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak has proved that America needs to stop relying on China for our critical medical supply chains.\n\nIf the #Coronavirus crisis makes anything clear, it's that we need to stop relying on #China for our critical medical supply chains. I will introduce legislation this week to jump start that effort. Details to follow https://t.co/7B5kbaiViZ — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) February 25, 2020\n\nRosemary Gibson, the author of China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine, recently told Breitbart News Tonight host Rebecca Mansour that the United States should pursue an industrial policy to renew domestic manufacturing of medicines and medical products in the homeland.\n\nGibson said:\n\nI would have our federal government invest in helping to rebuild our industrial base using advanced manufacturing technology that can produce our medicines much more cheaply, safely, with less environmental footprint, and fully, from soup to nuts from those core raw materials to finished drug in one location all here in the United States.\n\nHawley also said Tuesday that the Donald Trump administration should consider additional travel restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus throughout the United States.\n\nThis is a no-brainer. It's not just China any longer. With the rise of cases in Europe & Asia, we need to take additional steps to protect Americans, Hawley tweeted.\n\nThis is a no-brainer.

On Breitbart News Sunday, host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon interviewed Ronald Reagan historian Craig Shirley about the the death of Nancy Reagan. Shirley has authored a number of influential books on Reagan, including his latest, Last Act: The Final Years and Enduring Legacy of Ronald Reagan. Bannon and Shirley spoke about how important Nancy was to Ronald Reagan's career.\n\nShirley said that long-time Reagan aide Mike Deaver claimed if it wasn't for Nancy Reagan, Reagan would have never been Governor of California, never would have been president of the United States. She really was his helpmate, his soul mate, his best friend.\n\nAs far as the great American presidential love stories, Shirley puts Ronald's relationship with Nancy in the realm of the Washington and Adams couples.\n\nShirley said that while Nancy rarely involved herself in policy, she did play a major part with the personnel around America's 40th president. She played a role in the firing of Reagan campaign strategist John Sears in the 1980 presidential election, which in part sparked his sagging GOP primary run.\n\nOne of the most important roles Nancy played, according to Shirley, was having a radar about people. She could detect who would use Ronald Reagan and who his real friends were.\n\nShe was much better at sizing up people and judging people than he was, but she didn't act as a kind of West Wing guardian as some recent books have tried to suggest, Shirley claimed.\n\nNancy's largest role, however, was advancing Ronald Reagan's legacy as he succumbed to Alzheimer's in the later stages of his life. She not only took care of him, but secured the building of the Reagan Presidential Library and preserved numerous documents that were attached to his life. Shirley said that all the projects to preserve Reagan's memory to posterity bear her fingerprints.\n\nBannon and Shirley also discussed how the Reagans brought glamor back to the White House. However, Shirley said there was a deeper meaning to this than one might believe because Reagan didn't like the way [Jimmy] Carter had downgraded the White House. Reagan wanted Americans to be proud of their president.\n\nListen to the full audio of Shirley's interview on Breitbart News Sunday below:
Joe Biden has not even taken office yet, but he appears to be jettisoning his promise to restore bipartisanship in Washington, DC—at least according to the makeup of the president-elect's cabinet.\n\nBiden, who has pledged to create an era of bipartisan cooperation, announced the final makeup of his cabinet last week, with high-profile choices to helm the Departments of Commerce and Labor, respectively. For those posts, the president-elect picked two respected elected officials, Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-RI) and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D), from his own party.\n\nThis team will help us emerge from the most inequitable economic and jobs crisis. … They will work tirelessly to ensure every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead, Biden said when announcing the appointments.\n\nSince being declared the winner of the 2020 contest, Biden has moved quickly to name the senior members of his cabinet. The quick pace has been a result of a desire of the incoming administration to immediately tackle the dual crises of the novel coronavirus pandemic and its economic fall out.\n\nAlthough Biden and his running-mate, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have promised their response to the crises will prioritize equity for all Americans, it appears that not everyone will have a voice in the new administration. Biden's cabinet, in fact, will be the first since President Bill Clinton's initial term to not have a member of the opposing party at the head of an administrative department.\n\nIn comparison, the past three administrations have had members of the opposing party in high-ranking White House and cabinet positions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, for instance, upon taking office in 2017, named two Democrats, Gary Cohn and Peter Navarro, to his staff. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Democrat donor, was tapped by Trump as director of the national economic council, a position with wide purview over economic decision making. Navarro, an economist who had previously run for local office in San Diego, California, as a Democrat, was appointed to serve as the White House's trade and manufacturing czar—a post he holds to this day.\n\nSimilarly, President Barack Obama had several high-ranking Republicans in his administration. During his first term, Obama appointed then-GOP congressman Ray Lahood, a fellow Illinoisan, to the post of transportation secretary. Obama also kept on President George W. Bush's defense secretary, Robert Gates, in order to ensure continuity in national security matters. The retention of Gates was followed up by the appointment of two well-known Republican elected officials, then-Rep. John McHugh (R-NY) and Gov. Jon Huntsman (R-UT), to the posts of secretary of the army and ambassador to China, respectively.\n\nObama likely would have had a further Republican in his first term-term cabinet if his initial choice for commerce secretary, former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), had not withdrawn before the confirmation process had begun.\n\nAt the time of the appointments, Obama was applauded for an unprecedented show of bipartisanship. The praise continued throughout Obama's tenure, even though appointees such as Lahood later resigned after coming to the conclusion the White House was never committed fully to a genuine bipartisan approach to policy making.\n\nWhile Bush's cabinet was not as bipartisan as that of Obama, the president did appoint several Democrats to high-ranking administration posts.\n\nUpon taking office in 2001, Bush tapped Norman Mineta, a former California congressman and Clinton Commerce Department official, for the post of transportation secretary. Mineta would go on to serve in the post until August 2007, becoming the longest-serving secretary of transportation in the department's history. Apart from Mineta, Bush also appointed Democrats to the office of secretary of the army, as well as several prominent ambassadorships.\n\nEven though Biden had previous administration's as a guide, the president-elect chose to depart from that bipartisan tradition when deciding on his cabinet appointees. While Biden has picked respected and well accredited nominees for the four most senior cabinet positions—including former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for treasury secretary and Judge Merrick Garland as attorney general—the rest of his choices are better known for political, rather than administrative accomplishments.\n\nFor the position of transportation secretary, in particular, Biden has picked Pete Buttigieg, his onetime rival for the 2020 Democrat nomination turned supporter. Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has little prior experience in either infrastructure or transportation matters. In fact, during his tenure as mayor, Buttigieg struggled to come up with proper solution to the persistent pothole problem plaguing his city's streets.\n\nBiden, likewise, has tapped other Democrat elected officials with little direct policy experience for top cabinet posts. One of the most notable of such appointments has been California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as secretary of health and human services. Becerra, a former long serving congressman and ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has raised concerns from many over his lack of expertise on health-related topics.\n\nI'm not sure what his Health and Human Services credentials are, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) told Bloomberg in December. It's not like [current Health Secretary] Alex Azar who used to work for pharma and has a health-care background.\n\nIn attempting to defend Becerra from such criticism, allies on the left have only been able to point to the lawsuits he filed as California's attorney general to uphold Obamacare.\n\nOther Biden nominees, including former Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D-MI) as energy secretary, have also drawn criticism for their lack of experience. Granholm, who left office in 2011, has best been known in recent years for her punditry as a CNN contributor, a post she used to push theories of Russian collusion.\n\nBiden's decision to fill his cabinet with partisan allies stands in direct contrast to the promises made on the 2020 campaign trail.\n\nBut while I'll be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president, Biden said when accepting the Democrat nomination in August 2020. I'll work hard for those who didn't support me, as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me.\n\nThat's the job of a president, to represent all of us, not just our base or our party, Biden added at the time.
BERLIN (AFP) – German local officials on Thursday sent a bus with 51 Syrian refugees on board to Chancellor Angela Merkel's office in Berlin, in a protest against her migrant policy.\n\nThe district administrator behind the road trip, Peter Dreier, said his rural area was buckling under the strain of a mass influx that brought 1.1 million refugees and irregular migrants to Germany last year.\n\nThe coach, filled with refugees aged 21 to 45, left the Bavarian town of Landshut around 0900 GMT for the 570 kilometre (350 mile) trip to the capital and was expected to arrive at the chancellory building in the late afternoon.\n\nLocal citizens had told him it's time we set a limit, he said on news TV channel N24. We are trying to help these people integrate. But that won't work if this year we face another wave of one million, or even more.\n\nThat's why it's time to take a stand, so that politicians change their tune, he said, adding that he had warned Merkel about his plans for such a journey in a phone call last October.\n\nLook at what is happening abroad, other EU member countries are turning away from us, it can't go on like this, he said.\n\nThe head of refugee support group Pro Asyl, Guenther Burkhardt, charged that with the trip, people are being exploited for the sake of media footage.\n\n'Ability to cope'\n\nThis doesn't solve the problems… this is a stunt that misuses the plight of refugees to send the message 'We want to close the borders'.\n\nDreier said in a statement his district was running 66 migrant facilities, including shelters for unaccompanied minors.\n\nThe 51 Syrians on the bus, all of whom had been granted asylum status, had volunteered to join the trip, he said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the Syrians would stay in Berlin or return to Bavaria.\n\nThey were legally free to live anywhere in Germany but now had to find apartments, which would be tough in prosperous Landshut, the district said in a statement.\n\nSpeaking to public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, Dreier said: There is no end in sight to the wave of refugees, and our country's ability to house them in a dignified way is deteriorating rapidly. And I don't see new apartments being built for the immigrants.\n\nMerkel has been praised for opening Germany's doors to those fleeing war and misery, but has also weathered harsh criticism, especially from southern Bavaria state, the main gateway for arriving migrants.\n\nThe mood in Germany has darkened further since New Year's Eve, when hundreds of women were groped and robbed in a throng of mostly Arab and North African men outside the main railway station of the western city of Cologne.\n\nDreier said that more and more people have lost confidence, even before the events at New Year's Eve in Cologne, in their state and its institutions' ability to cope.\n\nIf we don't finally take the concerns and needs of our citizens very seriously, the social peace in our country is at risk.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley slammed a UN report documenting 206 companies with ties to Israeli settlements as evidence of an anti-Israeli obsession in the organization.\n\nCategorizing the 16-page work of the Human Rights Council as a waste of time and resources, Haley said Wednesday the document could lead to a blacklist of businesses that Israeli officials fear would be targeted for an international boycott.\n\nThis whole issue is outside the bounds of the High Commissioner for Human Rights office's mandate and is a waste of time and resources, Haley said in a statement.\n\nThe 47-member Human Rights Council, which both the U.S. and Israel have criticized repeatedly for its anti-Israel bias, was established in 2006. It replaced the Human Rights Commission which itself drew frequent critizism for its acceptance of members with dubious human rights records.\n\nIt voted last year to compile a blacklist of companies that do business in Israeli settlements, meaning Jewish communities in the West Bank or eastern sections of Jerusalem. The resolution called on the rights office to create database of companies found to engage in any of 10 activities, either explicitly linked to the settlements or supportive of them.\n\nThe move, pushed by the Palestinian delegation, typifies the anti-Israeli boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement of pro-Palestinian activists.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley has made cracking down on the UN's anti-Israel bias a top priority since taking her position last year. In March she won a significant victory when, after complaints from the U.S., the UN withdrew a report that called Israel an apartheid state.'\n\nIn particular, Haley has put focus on the Human Rights Council for its anti-Israel bias and a membership that includes countries such as Venezuela, Cuba and Saudi Arabia. In June she called the Council a haven of dictators.\n\nNow she wants the UN to desist from naming countries that do business in Israeli settlements.\n\nWhile we note that they wisely refrained from listing individual companies, the fact that the report was issued at all is yet another reminder of the Council's anti-Israel obsession, said Haley.\n\nThe United States will continue to aggressively push back against the anti-Israel bias, and advance badly needed reforms of the Council, she added.\n\nOf the 206 companies under review, 143 are based in Israel or in the settlements, 22 in the United States, seven in Germany, five in the Netherlands and four in France.\n\nEugene Kontorovich, head of International Law at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative think-tank in Jerusalem, said no international law was being violated by countries who do business in settlements, and said Israel was being singled out unfairly.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights Council is supposed to be about human rights, not Israeli wrongs, so to create a report just about Israel seems to go against its own mission, he said.
Britain left the European Union in name in January 2020, but remained subject to the EU, its judges, and its migration regime through a so-called transition period. It left in a real sense on at 11 pm on December 31st — according to supporters of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's exit deal, at least. But how did the country get here?\n\nThis is part three of a three-part series. Read part one here and part two here.\n\nWith the fall of Theresa May in June 2019, Tory MPs had at last turned to the Brexiteer king over the water, Boris Johnson, to deliver them from electoral annihilation at the hands of Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.\n\nJohnson had delayed his entry into the EU referendum campaign, missed his moment when he unexpectedly won it, and hesitated to move against May when fellow Tory Brexiteers had begged him to move against her — he had even voted for May's turd deal on her third attempt to get it through Parliament, fearing, like many Brexiteers, that if he did not accept her fake Brexit then the Remain establishment in Parliament would ensure there was no Brexit at all.\n\nThe Brexit Party had now more or less gifted him the succession, however, and with it the keys to 10 Downing Street — but what could he do with his newfound power?\n\nJohnson's administration was much less disagreeable to Tory Brexiteers than May's, but faced the same fundamental problem: the House of Commons was dominated by Remainers, who would neither agree a Brexit deal nor allow a no-deal Brexit to take place.\n\nThe Article 50 negotiating period, supposed to expire in March 2019, had already been extended twice. Johnson found he had no effective means to break the deadlock. Some alterations were made to May's deal in an effort to force Remain diehards to agree at least some form of Brexit, with the substance of the changes being the subject of fiery debate at the time but so minor that few now remember the details — they were not sufficient to convince the DUP that Northern Ireland was being sold out, at any rate.\n\nRemain MPs did not play along, however — and they did not allow Johnson to force a no-deal by running down the clock, either, with the Tony Blair-created Supreme Court overturning a move to prorogue (temporarily suspend) Parliament before the deadline in a highly dubious and possibly unconstitutional use of their powers.\n\nMPs also forced Johnson to request a third Article 50 extension, with the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, altering parliamentary procedure at will to aid them.\n\nThree times Johnson attempted to call a general election so the people could break the impasse — and three times MPs refused to grant one, fearing the verdict of an angry public on their shenanigans. Once, they would not have been able to do so, with the power to call elections being, like the power to prorogue, an executive prerogative — but David Cameron and his Lib Dem cohort Nick Clegg had made early elections conditional on two-thirds of MPs backing one.\n\nWhat Johnson's warmed up version of Mrs May's deal did achieve was MPs' agreement that, with the country essentially without a government heading into 2020, a general election should be held.\n\nFirmly in control of British politics, it now seems unbelievable that they changed their minds on giving Johnson his election — possibly their long string of parliamentary victories and the anti-Brexit mood among street activists in multicultural London had persuaded them they were fighting from a position of strength.\n\nAll Over by Christmas? Boris Holding Calls with Eurocrats to Deliver Deal Farage Warned Is 'Brexit in Name Only' https://t.co/1I6nipX3sn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 23, 2020\n\nBrexhaustion Sets In\n\nThey were wrong. Remain politicians who drank their own Kool-Aid on the question of the public having changed their minds on Brexit as a result of the years of chaos since 2016 got a rude awakening in the December 2019 snap election.\n\nJohnson, aided once again by Nigel Farage, who opted to stand Brexit Party candidates only in some constituencies, for the most part where they would be likely to take votes away from Labour rather than the Conservatives, won an 80-seat majority under the slogan 'Get Brexit Done'.\n\nDominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, and other bow ex-parliamentarians with a big name in the Westminster bubble but no name (or a bad name) among the general public passed into the footnotes of Brexit history with remarkable speed.\n\nBut what did Boris Johnson, the man who had derided the EU's colonial demands, and now the first prime minister since Gordon Brown or arguably Tony Blair with a strong and reliable Commons majority, do with new power?\n\nStep one, apparently, was passing his amended version of the May deal.\n\nThe 40-billion-plus euro divorce bill, and suggestions it might not be paid if the EU did not negotiate in good faith, rapidly disappeared from the public discourse. It would be paid in full.\n\nThe Northern Ireland protocol was also agreed, with the British province subordinated to Single Market rules and divided from the rest of the United Kingdom by a partial customs border. Brexit was to get done in January 2020 with the passage of this Withdrawal Agreement — except not really, as it came with a transition period lasting right up to the end of the year.\n\nDuring this, Britain would remain subject to EU control and EU migration and trade policy in every respect — although it would no longer have a vote in the bloc's decision-making bodies — while a trade agreement would, at last, be negotiated.\n\nNevertheless, the people celebrated this not-Brexit as best they could in January, with Nigel Farage organising a mass rally at Parliament Square after Johnson's government opted not to do anything.\n\nLeavers knew they had left in name only, but they had already waited years for Brexit Day, and believed that the transition, at least, had a definite expiry date, and that they now had a Parliament which would not attempt to pull a fast one on them.\n\nMore than anything, people simply wanted the process to be over. May's withdrawal agreement had been excoriated as a con job, but Johnson's passed largely unremarked.\n\nSimilarly, people seemed insufficiently concerned when Johnson's summer deadline for the EU to agree a trade agreement or else face no-deal came and went — their minds now increasingly preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic which emerged from China and the lockdowns which had followed it.\n\nRemainers even used the Made-in-China disaster as an opportunity to push for the transition to be extended — but on this, at least, Johnson could not be budged.\n\nAs the weeks and months went by, however, many new final deadlines seemed to come and go, right up until December, leaving Britons with business or other concerns in the EU with no certainty about their future.\n\nRemainers and Leaver alike were baffled. The impasse between Britain and the EU had remained fairly constant: the EU wanted Britain to submit to its regulations and state aid rules essentially in perpetuity, via what it called a level playing field, as well as a guarantee that Britain would not escape to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nMost controversially, Brussels demanded that the EU's control over Britain's fishing waters should continue, as they had long awarded the majority of the fisheries there to European fleets which had come to depend on them.\n\nJohnson, for his part, had always insisted Britain would not compromise on controlling its own laws and its own territorial waters. The red lines of the two sides left no room for compromise.\n\nAt least, that was the case right up until Christmas Eve, when a deal was produced — and Britain's red lines seemed to disappear.\n\nFishermen: Boris 'Bottled It', Brexit Deal 'A Defeat' for 'Sacrificed' Industry https://t.co/UMLmq053aZ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 28, 2020\n\nStrung Up: Kippers\n\nJohnson had won free trade in goods — where the EU enjoys a massive advantage over the British. Similar trade in services, where the advantage is Britain's, was not covered by the deal.\n\nThe level playing field was more or less there, as well, with Britain agreeing that the EU could move to cancel free trade if the British adopted rules not sufficiently similar to its own.\n\nThe EU had also retained the right to bid for public contracts on largely the same terms as before — terms which had seen British shipbuilding jobs and even the manufacture of the new EU-free blue British passports farmed out to Continental Europe.\n\nJohnson had also agreed that Britain, unlike, say, Norway and Iceland, would continue with more or less the current fisheries arrangements for at least five-and-a-half years, with British fishermen on their knees from decades of EU plunder receiving only a meagre increase in their quota share, phased in little by little over the course of this new transition.\n\nClaims that full control will be returned after this period appear to be misleading, as the text of the deal refers to quotas continuing from mid-2026 onwards — or else the EU is entitled to compensation.\n\nBritain had also agreed it would remain subject to the European Court of Human Rights, or else the EU can terminate swathes of the deal — meaning the country will still be subject to the whims of foreign judges.\n\nAnd, of course, the divorce settlement was still to be paid in full, and Northern Ireland effectively separated from the rest of the United Kingdom — the EU even announced it would be posting its own officials to the province as enforcers\n\nSimilarly, Johnson allowed the EU to cut the British territory of Gibraltar out of his deal at the request of Spain, which has resulted in a last-minute side deal which will see Spain and/or an EU agency put in charge of monitoring sea and air travel.\n\nThese and other, less headline-grabbing downsides of the deal have elicited little objection, however. A tired public do indeed seem to want Brexit to be done, and are willing to accept spin they would never have entertained from Theresa May — or are willing to believe that the humiliating concessions on Northern Ireland, fishing, and so on, are only temporary.\n\nWhether the British people will ultimately notice any difference between Johnson's Brexit and no Brexit remains to be seen. One thing he has secured is an end to the Free Movement of People — but as his government is presiding over massive increases in non-EU immigration and record levels of effectively unchecked illegal immigration, it is likely that the overall net inflow of people will continue to rise.\n\nNew trade deals with non-EU countries the EU did not previously have deals with may provide more tangible benefits — although the most lucrative, with the United States of America, may already have slipped away, as the Tories have squandered pro-Brexit Donald Trump's entire term.\n\nIt may be the case Britain ultimately finds itself fighting the same old battles, with politicians saying they can't protect this steel plant or prevent that contract from going abroad not because the EU ties their hands, but because the EU deal does.\n\nIn any event, the war is, at least notionally, over. But it was in the end marked by an exhausted, distracted, and locked down public not with a bang, but a whimper.\n\nBow Group: Leavers Pretending Boris Got a Good Deal Are Kidding Themselves https://t.co/LkegGLYPMf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 31, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomery
Former Senate Democrat leader Tom Daschle (SD) on Tuesday warned against impeaching President Donald Trump over last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nBloomberg reports:\n\nDaschle called impeachment at a moment that party control of the Senate is so tenuous a mistake, saying it would first galvanize Trump's supporters and then delay work on crucial issues. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has favored proceeding, even with the coming 50-50 split in the chamber. An impeachment mechanism is just not the right course at all if they want to hold the president accountable, Daschle said at a forum Monday with Lott held by the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nThe House of Representatives will meet Wednesday morning to consider articles of impeachment against President Trump, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) announced during a House Democrat's caucus call on Monday.\n\nEarlier Monday, three House Democrats — Reps. David Cicilline (RI), Ted Lieu (CA), and Jamie Raskin (MD) — introduced a single article of impeachment, accusing President Trump of inciting his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday.\n\nThe impeachment article states: [I]ncited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had addressed, in an attempt to … interfere with the Joint Session's solemn constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 Presidential election, unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts.\n\nPresident Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transfer of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States, the article continues.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Trump blasted Democrats' attempt to impeach him, saying the effort is creating tremendous danger to our country.
Wednesday on CNN's New Day, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) weighed in on the ongoing partial government shutdown over border wall funding, claiming President Donald Trump is using immigration as a talking point to rev people up.\n\nKaine also urged Trump to reopen the government before negotiating a deal.\n\nI concluded [Trump] does not care about the policy on this, Kaine told host Alisyn Camerota. He wants immigration as a talking point to rev people up and he's willing to say anything. 'Mexico will pay for it,' that was a lie. 'Democrats are for open borders,' that's a lie. 'Democrats won't cooperate with me,' that's a lie. There is a deal to be had here, but first, we've got to reopen government.\n\nHe continued, It is so unfair to punish farmers who want ag loans, small businesses who want loans, families trying to go to national parks. We're going to punish all of them? No. Reopen government and then we'll find a border security and immigration deal.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Chinese education officials are aggressively recruiting male teachers to serve as assertive and manly role models to young boys as a means to counter the trend of increasing numbers of timid and effeminate young males.\n\nPrompted by reports from Chinese news media of a need to salvage masculinity in schools, officials are seeing a stepped-up debate about gender equality and social identity just as government leaders are seeking a labor market that first rewards achievement and ability over fairness.\n\nSixth grade teacher Lin Wei, 27, one of few male teachers at the primary school level in Fuzhou, China, teaches, Men have special duties. They have to be brave, protect women and take responsibility for wrongdoing, reports the New York Times.\n\nChina's longstanding one-child policy has produced a population where boys far outnumber girls. Yet teachers are predominantly female and boys have consistently fallen behind in academic performance – with disparities in performance seen as early as third grade – causing concern for many parents who are now pressing for more assertive male role models in classrooms. The recruiting effort – that has included relaxing college admissions requirements and providing full scholarships with job guarantees to male applicants – has been labeled, by some, as sexist.\n\nThe effort to raise less effeminate boys is visible in Zhengzhou, where schools have asked boys to sign pledges to act like real men. Similarly, in Shanghai, boys only classes for martial arts, computer repair, and physics are offered. Educators in Hangzhou have launched a summer camp–called West Point Boys–that offers taekwondo classes and touts the motto, We bring out the men in boys.\n\nThe backlash against the endeavor, however, has been heard.\n\nIf women go into architecture, shouldn't the government give them a free education too? Xue Rongfang, a student at Fujian Normal University, asked. Why should men get this benefit?\n\nOthers deny the negative influence of a plethora of female teachers on boys.\n\nWe have a more intuitive sense of children's needs, said Li Yue, 36, a kindergarten teacher in Fuzhou. It isn't the responsibility of schools to teach boys to be boys. It's the responsibility of parents.\n\nZhou Jiahao, 18, a senior at Shanghai No. 8 Senior High School, disagrees that China faces a masculinity crisis, but said boys feel more confident in all-male classes.\n\nIn classes with female students, we might not dare speak out, he said. When it's just boys, we feel much freer.\n\nAs the Times observes, wages are a problem in recruiting more male teachers. The average salary of a public school teacher in 2013 was approximately $17,000.\n\nIn addition to salary concerns, however, some young men express concern about perceptions that male teachers are not trustworthy and that the choice to become a teacher is an indication of homosexuality.\n\nJiang Weiwen, 19, a university student, said friends and relatives wondered why he would choose a career in teaching.\n\nThey asked, 'Why would a man want to be a teacher?' he said. They think men should be ambitious, and that it's so stable and bland to be a teacher.
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a dramatic procession across the U.S. Capitol, House Democrats carried the formal articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate late Wednesday, setting the stage for only the third trial to remove a president in American history.\n\nTrump complained anew it was all a hoax, even as fresh details emerged about his efforts in Ukraine.\n\nThe ceremonial pomp and protocol by the lawmakers prosecuting the case against Trump moved the impeachment out of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Democratic-run House to the Republican-majority Senate, where the president's team is mounting a defense aiming for swift acquittal.\n\nToday we will make history, Pelosi said as she signed the documents, using multiple pens to hand out and mark the moment. This president will be held accountable.\n\nMoments later the prosecutors walked solemnly through the stately hall, filing into the Senate back row as the Clerk of the House announced the arrival: The House has passed House Resolution 798, a resolution appointing and authorizing managers of the impeachment trail of Donald John Trump, President of United States.\n\nThe Senate will transform itself into an impeachment court at noon Thursday. The Constitution calls for Chief Justice John Roberts to preside at the trial, administering the oath to senators who will serve as jurors and swear to deliver impartial justice.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to have the Senate rise above the petty factionalism and factional fervor and serve the long-term, best interests of our nation. He called it a difficult time for our country.\n\nTechnically, the House was simply notifying the Senate of its delivery of the articles, with a more formal presentation Thursday. Opening arguments are to begin next Tuesday after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the House voted 228-193, almost entirely along party lines to deliver the charges. The split reflected the deeply divided nation at the start of this presidential election year. It came one month after the House impeached Trump alleging he abused his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Trump was also charged with obstructing Congress' ensuing probe.\n\nThis is what an impeachment is about,″ Pelosi said before the vote. The president violated his oath of office, undermined our national security, jeopardized the integrity of our elections.\n\nTrump's political campaign dismissed the House effort as just a failed attempt to politically damage President Trump leading up to his reelection.\n\nThe top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy of California, said Americans will look back on this sad saga that tried to remove the president from office with the weakest case.\n\nThe president's team expects acquittal with a Senate trial lasting no more than two weeks, according to senior administration officials unauthorized to discuss the matter and granted anonymity.\n\nThat's far shorter than the last presidential impeachment trail, of Bill Clinton, in 1999, or the first one, of Andrew Johnson, in 1868.\n\nAs McConnell sets the rules for the trial, Trump has given mixed messages about whether he prefers lengthy or swift proceeding, and senators are under pressure with the emerging new evidence to call more witnesses for testimony.\n\nThe seven-member prosecution team was led by the chairmen of the House impeachment proceedings, Reps. Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee and Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, two of Pelosi's top lieutenants.\n\nThe president gravely abused the power of his office, Nadler said. He did all this for his personal political gain.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's session, Schiff released new records from Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, about the Ukraine strategy, including an exchange with another man about surveilling later-fired Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nSchiff said the new evidence should bring more pressure on McConnell, who is reluctant to allow witnesses to testify and prefers swift acquittal.\n\nThe challenge is to get a fair trial, Schiff said in an interview with The Associated Press. It shouldn't be a challenge — if the senators are really going to live up to their oath to be impartial, they'll want a fair trial. That's obviously not where Mitch McConnell is coming from.\n\nTrump's trial will be only the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, and it comes against the backdrop of a politically divided nation in an election year.\n\nThe managers are a diverse group with legal, law enforcement and military experience, including Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Sylvia Garcia of Texas, Val Demings of Florida, Jason Crow of Colorado and Zoe Lofgren of California.\n\nTwo are freshmen lawmakers — Crow a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Garcia a former judge in Houston. Demings is the former police chief of Orlando and Jeffries is a lawyer and member of party leadership. Lofgren has the rare credential of having worked on the congressional staff investigation of then-President Richard Nixon's impeachment — he resigned before the full House voted on the charges — and then being an elected lawmaker during Bill Clinton's.\n\nFor the roll call, all but one Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, voted to transmit the articles. All Republicans voted against. One former Republican-turned-independent, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, joined Democrats.\n\nMcConnell faces competing interests from his party for more witnesses, from centrists who are siding with Democrats on the need to hear testimony and conservatives mounting Trump's defense.\n\nSenate Republicans signaled they would reject the idea of simply voting to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Trump, as Trump himself has suggested. McConnell agreed he does not have the votes to do that.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine is leading an effort among some Republicans, including Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee to consider Senate witnesses. She told reporters she was satisfied the rules will allow votes on that.\n\nRomney said he wants to hear from John Bolton, the former national security adviser at the White House, who others have said raised alarms about the alternative foreign policy toward Ukraine being run by Giuliani.\n\nThose four senators could force votes. Republicans control the chamber, 53-47, and are all but certain to acquit Trump. But it takes just 51 votes during the trial to approve rules or call witnesses. It also would take only 51 senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Trump.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and other Republicans want to subpoena Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine, Burisma, while his father was vice president.\n\nMcConnell prefers to model Trump's trial partly on the process used for Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. It, too, contained motions for dismissal or calling new witnesses.\n\nMcConnell is hesitant to call new witnesses who would prolong the trial and put vulnerable senators who are up for reelection in 2020 in a bind with tough choices. At the same time, he wants to give those same senators ample room to show voters they are listening.\n\n—-\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Alan Fram, Matthew Daly, Andrew Taylor, Mary Clare Jalonick, Laurie Kellman, and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report.
The sanctuary state of California previously freed from police custody an illegal alien MS-13 Gang member who went on to murder a woman in front of her daughter, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency reveals.\n\nHerbert Nixon Flores, a 46-year-old illegal alien MS-13 gang member from El Salvador, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Irving, Texas, after he appeared to murder his ex-girlfriend, 35-year-old Karen Ruiz, in front of her three-year-old daughter outside of her babysitter's home.\n\nFlores had been charged with murder and police were looking for him after home surveillance video captured him chasing down Ruiz outside her babysitter's home and fatally shooting her on the doorstep.\n\nICE agents revealed this week that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which enforces a strict sanctuary policy to shield illegal aliens from arrest and deportation, freed Flores from their custody last year despite a long criminal history and their insistance for him to be turned over to their custody.\n\nWe offer our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Karen Ruiz, who was senselessly killed last week near her 3-year-old daughter, ICE official Andre Quinones said in a statement.\n\nLike so many other tragedies, this case illustrates the threat posed by the egregious and often recidivist criminal offenders our agency identifies, targets, and seeks to apprehend and remove, and is another example of how California's sanctuary policies lead to violence against innocent victims while protecting illegal aliens who have no authority to be in our country, Quinones continued.\n\nICE confirmed that Flores had been ordered deported from the United States 10 times since 1990 but continuously re-entered illegally, likely through the U.S.-Mexico border. Flores had a criminal record and convictions dating back more than 30 years, including:\n\nCarrying a concealed weapon, trespassing, burglary, disturbing the peace, possession and transportation of a controlled substance, impersonation, driving under the influence, driving without a license, driving with a suspended license, resisting arrest, vandalism, criminal threats and illegal entry.\n\nHis most recent arrest came in September 2020, when he was charged with domestic violence by the LAPD. ICE officials issued a detainer for Flores the following day — which is a request for law enforcement to turn illegal aliens over to federal immigration agents for arrest and deportation — but LAPD instead released him back into the community.\n\nFive months later, Flores murdered Ruiz.\n\nThis horrific act of violence that has now claimed two lives and left a child without her mother might have been avoided if the suspect had been handed over to our officers months ago, Quinones said.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nTrump announces that U.S. troops will deploy near to D.R. Congo\n\nD.R. Congo delays releasing election results again\n\nEbola outbreak spreads more slowly than feared in D.R. Congo\n\nTrump announces that U.S. troops will deploy near D.R. Congo\n\n\n\nAmerican soldiers in a combined training exercise with Senegalese troops in Thies, Senegal, on July 25, 2016 (AFP)\n\nPresident Trump announced that U.S. troops will be sent to Gabon, in anticipation of violent demonstrations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) if and when the results of the December 30 presidential election are announced.\n\nThe announcement came in a Friday evening letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi:\n\nDear Madam Speaker: United States Armed Forces personnel have deployed to Libreville, Gabon, to be in position to support the security of United States citizens, personnel, and diplomatic facilities in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. This deployment of approximately 80 personnel is in response to the possibility that violent demonstrations may occur in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in reaction to the December 30, 2018, elections there. The first of these personnel arrived in Gabon on January 2, 2019, with appropriate combat equipment and supported by military aircraft. Additional forces may deploy to Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the Republic of the Congo, if necessary for these purposes. These deployed personnel will remain in the region until the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo becomes such that their presence is no longer needed. This action was taken consistent with my responsibility to protect United States citizens both at home and abroad, and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct United States foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148). I appreciate the support of the Congress in these actions.\n\nThe letter indicates that the U.S. is concerned with the safety of American officials and facilities in Congo, not with the DRC electoral situation itself. A State Department travel warning was issued in mid-December, urging Americans to reconsider travel to DRC due to crime and civil unrest.\n\nGabon is a small country on the northwest border of DRC. Libreville is the capital city. White House and CBS News and CNN\n\nD.R. Congo delays releasing election results again\n\nThe president of CENI, the election commission of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), indefinitely postponed the release of the preliminary results of the December 30 presidential election, saying that it was not yet clear when the results would be ready for release.\n\nThe election was originally supposed to take place in December 2016. Joseph Kabila, the incumbent president, is not permitted to run again, according to the constitution, and so he has postponed the election several times. The last postponement was from December 23, 2018, to December 30, when the election finally took place.\n\nIn the week prior to the election, Kabila's election commission said that the election will still be held, but will be delayed until March in three cities: Beni, Butembo, and Yumbi. The reasons given for Beni and Butembo are that there are Ebola outbreaks in those cities and that voting would be dangerous. However, voting has not been delayed in other cities with Ebola outbreaks. What these three cities have in common is that they are strongholds for anti-Kabila opposition. On election day, the local government of Beni held its own elections, just to prove that voting was not dangerous.\n\nPreliminary results were to be released today (Sunday, January 6), until the CENI announcement on Saturday, delaying the release.\n\nThere are widespread suspicions that Kabila is trying to find a way to rig the vote count so that the winner will be his hand-picked successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Many people believe that if Shadary wins, then he will just be a puppet with Kabila as the puppetmaster.\n\nKabila has shut down the internet all week, supposedly to prevent the incitement of riots. Kabila has made it illegal for any organization to announce election results before CENI does. It is believed that these laws were specifically targeted against the Catholic Church, which had sent more than 40,000 observers to polling stations across the country.\n\nOn Thursday, the National Episcopal Conference Of Congo (CENCO) released a lengthy statement about its conclusions. It listed several irregularities in the voting procedures and then reached a startling conclusion: From its own data, CENCO knows who won the election but will not announce the name, in keeping with the law against announcing election results.\n\nCENCO called on the election commission to do the following:\n\nIn order to respect the will of the People and to dispel any suspicion, CENCO proposes the following scheme for the integrity of the results which will have to be published: 1 Only take into account the results from manual counting that were published and posted in front of the polling and counting stations; 2 Ensure that the consistency check at the Local Results Compilation Centers (CLCR) is carried out in the presence of observers and witnesses. 3 Publish the results polling station by polling station.\n\nCENCO did not name the purported election winner, but reports indicate that it was the main opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu.\n\nThe capital city Kinshasa is very tense right now. There were almost full-scale riots in December 2016, but the Catholic Church intervened and quieted the situation. If CENI continues to delay announcing the election results, or if it announces that Shadary is the winner, there may be widespread riots again.\n\nThe situation is so serious that it is believed that this is the reason that President Trump announced the deployment of troops to Gabon, available to protect the safety of American officials and facilities in DRC. Reuters and Guardian (London) and CENCO (DRC Catholic Church)\n\nEbola outbreak spreads more slowly than feared in D.R.

Health officials are still investigating 54 suspected infections.\n\nAccording to Tedros Adhanom, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), the DRC Ebola outbreak would have been much worse without the use of Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV.

Georgetown University students who recently held a community dialogue event on a new proposal to arm campus police told their white peers that they weren't permitted to attend.\n\nThe event, which was highlighted by Robby Soave at Reason Magazine, took place at the end of April and was hosted by the student group, Georgetown United Against Police Aggression.\n\nThe event's description on Facebook explicitly stated that white students would not be permitted to attend, even those white students who share the group's beliefs about police aggression as a political issue, who the group describes as allies.\n\nIt's time to talk. All of us have a story about GUPD. All of us know someone who has been targeted. Let's do something about it. Come this Tuesday for community and discussion. This space will center the voices and experiences of students of color, allies for the safety of students of color, allies are not welcome to attend this preliminary dialogue.\n\nGeorgetown United Against Police Aggression is currently engaged in a battle with school officials to kill a proposed policy that would involve arming campus police at the private university. The group argues that arming campus police officers would pose a threat to minority students. Although Georgetown cops are commissioned officers, some private campuses are starting to consider operating their police departments without guns.\n\nOthers students are pushing for armed officers on campus in light of recent school shootings. Another student group, the Georgetown Advocates for Responsible Defense, wrote a letter to the university's president demanding that he arm the school's police department so that they are better equipped to handle a potential shooter situation.\n\nIn light of recent events, a reasonably prudent person would make sure the campus police department, like virtually every other police department across the country, had properly trained and armed officers, the letter reads.
LONDON (AP) — The Bank of England revised up its economic growth forecasts for the British economy for the coming three years, crediting much of the improvement to the government's decision to ease up on austerity in the wake of the country's vote to leave the European Union.\n\nThe rosier projections were widely anticipated given the British economy has proven more resilient than many feared following June's Brexit vote. The bank increased its growth forecasts to 2 percent this year, 1.6 percent in 2018 and 1.7 percent in 2019. Those are up from November's predictions of 1.4 percent, 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent.\n\nGrowth has held up because of a combination of factors including the sharp fall in the pound following the vote, which boosts exports, and the Bank's own efforts to stimulate the economy. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the British economy expanded by a quarterly rate of 0.6 percent, making it one of the fastest-growing major economies.\n\nThe Brexit journey is really just beginning, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in his opening remarks. While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way.\n\nCarney was speaking after the bank kept interest rates on hold – again as expected. How long they will stay on hold will likely depend on how long rate-setters can overlook rising inflation. Rate-setters have a difficult balancing act – how to set policy to meet a legal mandate to keep inflation at 2 percent against the need to support economic growth.\n\nConsumer price inflation is expected to reach 2.8 percent early next year due to the pound's sharp decline since the referendum, the bank said in its quarterly economic projections. The lower pound, while helping exporters, makes imports, such as oil and raw materials, more expensive.\n\nThat projection, all other things being equal, would likely prompt the bank to raise interest rates. However, growth, despite the upgrades, is set to remain below the British economy's long-run average and that could keep a lid on such things as wage rises. Even with the improved outlook, the central bank said GDP will still be 1.5 percent lower in two years than was forecast before the referendum.\n\nStill, Carney said the improved growth outlook compared with last November was underpinned by four factors, chiefly looser budgetary policy by the government, announced last November.\n\nIn addition, he credited the bank's stimulus package in August, which included a cut in the benchmark interest rate to the record low, as well as a stronger global economy and the continued willingness of U.K. consumers to spend despite a predicted squeeze on incomes.\n\nThe minutes to the committee meeting suggested some policymakers may find it hard to justify keeping rates at their present levels despite the current exceptional circumstances.\n\nThere are limits to the extent that above-target inflation can be tolerated, the minutes said. The continuing suitability of the current policy stance depends on the trade-off between above-target inflation and slack in the economy.\n\nInflation, which currently stands at an annual rate of 1.6 percent, has picked up over recent months and is expected to continue to do.\n\nWhile analysts interpreted Thursday's report as a signal that the central bank's next move will be to raise interest rates, they also said that move is likely to be a long way off.\n\nConcerns about inflation clearly are not severe enough for any member to think higher rates are warranted immediately, said Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe core view at the bank remains that domestically-generated inflation, especially wage growth, will remain too weak to justify raising rates over the next year, a view we share.
Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) told Breitbart News exclusively that Democrat challenger Jon Ossoff's pledge to grant amnesty to every illegal alien in America is a threat to American workers struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and, as such, would be unfair to American citizens and legal immigrants.\n\nAppearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend, Perdue lit into Ossoff's pledge to grant a blanket amnesty to all illegal aliens in America, deeming it an affront to legal immigrants and struggling American workers alike.\n\nHe not only wants to give them amnesty, but he said he wants illegals to be able to vote, Perdue told Breitbart News. He doesn't see anything wrong with undocumented people in this country voting and having access to benefits. He has said he will give a blanket amnesty. So, what does that say to the millions of people who have come to our country and gone through our immigration protocol properly and done it the right way and earned their citizenship? I know hundreds of people who just here in Georgia did that and they're outraged by his position because it totally denigrates what they did. The second thing is it's a threat to the American worker right now. We've got a situation where we've got to grow our economy and we've got to get over Covid [Chinese coronavirus], and a blanket amnesty just opens the door.\n\nIn addition to the economic devastation an open borders policy that Ossoff champions — which he laid out at a LatinX for Ossoff event last week — would create, Perdue said the public safety concerns with the leftist vision of defunding police combined with sanctuary cities is a recipe for disaster for Georgians who should want checks and balances in the U.S. Senate rather than a blank check to the open borders lobbyists.\n\nCombine that with what they want to do with open borders, sanctuary cities, and defunding the police, Perdue said. Explain to me how that makes our cities safer. If you want to see what Georgia would look like, and you've said this before, under a Democratic regime in Washington, just go to California. Look at the anarchy in the streets of Portland, Oregon, today. Atlanta is now tied with Chicago as the murder capital of the world on a per capita basis. This is not something Democrats will own up to, that they do not want to talk about, so he is pandering to that Latino community and my question is the same thing I would ask the African American community: What have they done for you lately? President [Donald] Trump has just passed tremendous things that help both communities. We passed opportunity zones, which brings millions of dollars into these economically challenged areas in both the Latino and the African American communities. We've funded HBCUs, our historically black colleges and universities, and we passed a criminal justice reform act that we've been trying to do forever to correct the Joe Biden bill from 1994. The Latino community is smarter than these Democrats think. We did very well with them in the general election and we're going to do well with them on Tuesday. We've just got to get all Republican voters out on Tuesday. It is absolutely essential that every person who's concerned about the future of America must hold the line here. If we win Georgia, we indeed save America.\n\nPerdue faces off against Ossoff on Tuesday, while Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) faces Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock, in the Georgia Senate runoffs. These seats will determine control of the U.S. Senate, as Republicans currently have at least 50 seats and Democrats currently have at least 48 seats. If the Democrats take both of these seats, then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate — and Democrats would control the Senate floor and all the committees. The importance of these races is highlighted by the fact that both President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden are heading to Georgia on Monday, the day before the election, to give last-minute boosts to their parties' candidates.\n\nThe most dramatic thing I can tell your listeners is if we lose these two seats in Georgia, then [Sen.] Bernie Sanders [I-VT] would be chairman of the Budget Committee, Perdue said. It doesn't get much further left than that. But the Senate, if we hold these seats, we can be the balance of power in Washington that keeps the Democrats from perpetrating this leftwing leftist agenda that's too dangerous for our country. We get to advise and consent on all nominees. That's Justice nominees, that's cabinet members, a lot of people that go into an administration have to come through the Senate to get confirmed. So we can control and get some of the more radical people out of the government. That's why you have checks and balances. It's worked in our country extremely well for 230 years. Democrats now just believe that America is wrong. Obama apologized for America all during his administration. So what is at stake here is if they get these two seats they will perpetrate the agenda and load up the cabinet with very liberal people who have no idea how this economy works and want to perpetrate their own agenda and then the courts will be absolutely decimated. They will stack the courts and not just the Supreme Court but the appellate courts and federal judges and they want to increase the number of seats until they get the balance that they want. We won't ever get that back. They'll change the filibuster rule which as you know is very difficult and we'll never be able to get that back and that means they are creating a single-party system. This is what was tried in Cuba and Venezuela and North Korea and Iran and all the places we know it's failed. They want total control. AOC said that 'we want to win these two seats so we don't have to negotiate.' Then, defund the police, open borders, sanctuary cities, amnesty, higher taxes, socialization of our healthcare, and the Green New Deal. All of this becomes our reality if in fact we don't hold these two seats.\n\nPerdue did express some confidence, too, that Republicans will be successful if the GOP base turns out to vote on Tuesday.\n\nWhat's at stake here is absolutely critical. We are holding the line here for the country to maintain a balance of power, Perdue said. If you look at what we have to do, it's simply to get our vote out. Five million people voted in November. There were nefarious activities that went on allegedly, and we have done a lot to add to the integrity of that by putting poll watchers in and we've got cameras on these drop boxes, so on and so forth. We're doing everything we can to make sure every vote is counted legally and accurately on Jan. 5. But what we've really got to do, we've only gotten 3 million out to vote so far. That's off from where we were in November — I think some 3.6 million had voted already by this point in November. So we've got a ways to go but we've got to get our vote out. We also know that Republicans win on election day. If there's any Republicans out there, any conservatives out there, any independents or libertarians out there who haven't voted it, they owe it to their children and grandchildren to help us hold the line against this radical socialist agenda. That's what's at stake here, pure and simple. I know that sounds like trite words, but this is not the typical election where you can just correct it in two or four years. If these things get done, we will not be able to help self-correct this. We have to maintain a balance of power in Washington to avoid this left-wing agenda that the Democrats are trying to perpetrate.\n\nLISTEN TO SEN. DAVID PERDUE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:
Chinese marines have begun training on land, in the western deserts of Xinjiang, days after China passed legislation that allows its military to be deployed overseas on counterterrorism operations for the first time, reports Reuters.\n\nMilitary commanders in China are trying to assemble a military that resembles the best and most powerful in the world, analysts reportedly say.\n\nThey study what the Americans have done very carefully and it's the mirror image effect, said Leszek Buszynski, a visiting fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defense Studies Centre, according to Reuters.\n\nChina's global security posture is becoming more active, added Zhang Baohui, a mainland security expert at Hong Kong's Lingnan University. And this seems to fit that policy.\n\nIn late December, China passed a new counterterrorism law aimed at protecting its burgeoning international commercial and diplomatic interests.\n\nThe continuing drills are an indication, analysts say, that the marines, who have traditionally trained for amphibious assault missions, are being honed into an elite force capable of deploying on land far from mainland China, notes the report.\n\nChina's limited means to respond to threats abroad were highlighted by two incidents in November: when Islamic State executed a Chinese hostage, and the killing of three executives by Islamist militants who attacked a hotel in Mali, it adds.\n\nThe Chinese marines are being subjected to cold weather training in an effort to improve their ability to conduct long-distance mobilization in unfamiliar regions, said Li Xiaoyan, deputy chief of staff of the Navy's South Sea fleet, in a Ministry of Defense statement released earlier this month.\n\nAs part of their training, the marines are expected to travel nearly 3,700 miles via air, truck, and rail beginning in southern China's Guangdong province.\n\nCiting state media, Reuters reports that it will be the longest range maneuvers ever conducted by the force.\n\nThe exercises are the latest in recent years that show the efforts China is making to boost its expeditionary force capabilities, notes the report. In 2014, the marines conducted their first training in the grasslands of the northern landlocked Inner Mongolia region. At the time, the exercise was seen as unusual for the south China-based force more proficient in beach landings.\n\nChina's marine corps is a roughly 15,000-strong force that operates under the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's South Sea fleet. Since it began its first drills on land, the branch appears to be settling into a new function.\n\nThey never really had a major strategic role, as force projection wasn't something the PLA was willing, or able, to think about even ten years ago, said Gary Li, an independent security analyst in Beijing, according to Reuters.\n\nThe main advantage of playing around with the marines is that they have a higher concentration of specialists, act well as light infantry, have good esprit de corps, and are nimble enough to be deployed over long distances if needed, he added.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinping has vowed to build a more modern military force. Reuters points out, the global profile of China's armed forces is on the rise.\n\nAlready, the South Sea fleet, which is based on the mainland coast near the island of Hainan, has been used on operations far from the South China Sea, it adds. The fleet's vessels have ventured to the Middle East and Mediterranean after deployments on international anti-piracy patrols around the Horn of Africa.\n\nIn November, Chinese officials announced plans to build a permanent military base in Djibouti to expand Chinese naval operations, which would be the China's first off-shore military facility. The African country houses several foreign military bases, including U.S., French and Japanese naval facilities.\n\nWhile China has been getting more involved diplomatically in trouble spots like the Middle East, it is adamant that it does not interfere in the affairs of other countries, and is the only permanent member of the U.N. Security Council which has not taken military action in Syria, notes Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. has expressed concern over China's territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nChina has been building thousands of acres of artificial islands, airstrips, hangars, and ship berths in the South China Sea, an estimated 660 miles from its shores.\n\nThe move that has ignited territorial disputes with other nations in the region, but China has repeatedly defended its rights and interests to create the new land.\n\nIn May 2015, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter declared that the United States would not be deterred by China's military activity in the Asia-Pacific region, criticizing Beijing's artificial island construction in the South China Sea. While China is expanding its military capabilities, the United States is downsizing its military force.
The spending bills proposed by House Democrats to end the partial government shutdown offer no funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, but provide over $12 billion more in foreign aid than the Trump administration requested, according to a statement on Thursday from the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThe statement warned the new House Democrat majority of President Trump's intention to veto the bills, noting that the administration cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation's urgent border security needs.\n\nThe statement reiterated President Trump's request for at least $5 billion for border security and asserted that the Democrats' proposal does not come close to providing these necessary investments and authorities.\n\nThe White House then highlighted the billions in funding the Democrats are offering for unnecessary programs at excessive levels beyond what the Trump administration requested, including:\n\n$12 billion more for international affairs programs, including $2.9 billion more for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review.\n\n$700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restored funding for the United Nation's Population Fund, which would undermine the administration's Mexico City Policy that bars the use of taxpayer dollars for foreign organizations that promote or perform abortions.\n\nApproximately $2 billion more than requested for the Environmental Protection Agency\n\n$7.1 billion more than the administration requested for Housing and Urban Development programs\n\nThe statement's full passage regarding the Democrats' additional funding reads:\n\nThe six bills provided for under H.R. 21 provide funding at levels nearly 20 percent higher than the President's FY 2019 Budget. For instance, H.R. 21 provides $12 billion more for international affairs programs, 29 percent higher than the President's request. This includes $2.9 billion more than the request for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review. It includes $700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restoring funding for the United Nations Population Fund. The bill would also undermine the President's Mexico City Policy (Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017), which prohibits the funding of foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform abortions. Further, H.R. 21 includes approximately $2 billion in excessive Environmental Protection Agency funding, providing funds beyond the Agency's core mission and including funding for programs that can and should be executed at the local level. The bill also includes substantial unrequested funding for HUD programs, including $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for HUD rental assistance programs. These and other excessive spending items makes the lack of adequate border funding in the combined package all the more unacceptable.\n\nThe administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the Nation's borders and get the federal government back to work for the American people as soon as possible, the statement concluded.\n\nUpdate: The Democrat spending bills passed the House on Thursday night. The first bill, a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8, passed by 239-192. The bill would keep border security funding at $1.3 billion, providing no new funding for the barrier along the southern border, the Hill reports. The second bill to fund the other six agencies through September passed by 241-190.

The nominee to become the next United States Trade Representative (USTR), Katherine Tai, says U.S. trade policy must benefit regular Americans and is vowing a worker-centered trade policy.\n\nIn a speech to the National Foreign Trade Council, Tai hinted at the guiding principles she is set to focus on as the successor to USTR Robert Lighthizer, who has praised the nominee for her involvement in whipping Democrat support for President Trump's United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nThe president-elect's vision is to implement a worker-centered trade policy, Tai said, according to the Wall Street Journal. What it means in practice is that U.S. trade policy must benefit regular Americans, communities, and workers. And that starts with recognizing that people are not just consumers. They are also workers and wage earners.\n\nTai praised the USMCA as notable for incorporating groundbreaking labor and environmental provisions, including enforcement mechanisms that address longstanding wounds and grievances suffered by regular working people, and said the rules of the agreement now must be rigorously enforced.\n\nLike Lighthizer, Tai could face off against a barrage of free traders and economic globalists who are likely to stack the ranks of President-elect Joe Biden's administration. Lighthizer, as well as White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, faced opposition and reluctance to their tariffs plans by advisers like Gary Cohn and Larry Kudlow.\n\nLighthizer pleads with incoming Biden officials to keep U.S. tariffs on China while free trade globalists admit they've failed. https://t.co/Y35dkKgkmm — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) January 12, 2021\n\nCohn initially entered the Trump administration in opposition to U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, while Kudlow continuously only saw tariffs as a negotiating tactic rather than long-term policy to reshore manufacturing and production back to the U.S., as Lighthizer and Navarro intended.\n\nAlready, the big business lobby and corporate interests are looking for a return to Washington, D.C.'s free trade consensus that reigned for about three decades before Trump's election on a fierce economic nationalist agenda.\n\nSince 2001, U.S. free trade with China has eliminated at least 3.4 million American jobs. In 1985, before China entered the WTO, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $6 billion. In 2019, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled more than $345 billion.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy, as every one manufacturing job supports an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The gender pay gap is largely the result of women's choice to have children, writes Claire Cain Miller in a recent column for The New York Times.\n\nIn a column titled, The Gender Pay Gap Is Largely Because of Motherhood, Miller argues that motherhood plays a significant role in creating the pay gap between men and women in the United States.\n\nThe big reason that having children, and even marrying in the first place, hurts women's pay relative to men's is that the division of labor at home is still unequal, even when both spouses work full time. That's especially true for college-educated women in high-earning occupations: Children are particularly damaging to their careers.\n\nResearch suggests that women are also likely to earn less due to women being more likely to either move or stay in a certain area due to the greater importance the couple places on the husband's job. Sari Kerr, an economist at Wellesley College, argues that because the spouse who earns is likely to do more of the household work, the gender pay gap is self-reinforcing.\n\nThat reinforces the pay gap in the labor market, and we're trapped in this self-reinforcing cycle, Kerr said.\n\nExperts argue that the most efficient way to reduce the wage gap would be to encourage employers to put less emphasis on asking their employees to work long hours and to allow them to work remotely. Progressive economists, like Kerr, also argue that government-subsidized childcare could lift women out of the self-reinforcing cycle of the wage gap.\n\nTo achieve greater pay equality, social scientists say — other than women avoiding marriage and children — changes would have to take place in workplaces and public policy that applied to both men and women. Examples could be companies putting less priority on long hours and face time, and the government providing subsidized child care and moderate-length parental leave.\n\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

Prominent leaders of the Democratic Party once fiercely endorsed border security, and had even voted to secure a border fence along the nation's southern border.\n\nThese stringent calls for tougher border policy appear to have ceased since Donald Trump took office as President of the United States.\n\nIn 2006, Senate Democrats — including then-senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, and Joe Biden — voted to secure a fence along the United States southern border. Check out the instances in which prominent leaders of the Democratic Party championed the border fence and stronger border security overall.\n\n1. Barack Obama\n\nThe bill before us will certainly do some good, said then-Senator Obama in 2006, adding that the Secure Fence Act would provide better fences and better security and that it would make headway against the tide of illegal immigration in this country.\n\nReal reform means stronger border security, said Obama several years later as president, during his 2013 State Of The Union.\n\nIndependent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost one trillion dollars in the next two decades, said Obama during his 2014 State Of The Union, bringing up his alleged concern about stopping illegal immigration once again.\n\n2. Hillary Clinton\n\nLook, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in, and I do think you have to control your borders, said Clinton, referring to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, We need to secure our borders, I'm for it, I voted for it, I believe in it.\n\n3. Bill Clinton\n\nA decade earlier, Hillary Clinton's husband and then-president Bill Clinton affirmed his own beliefs that illegal immigration should be stopped in his 1995 State Of The Union, stating that all Americans were right to be disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering [the United States], adding that illegal aliens impose burdens on [U.S.] taxpayers.\n\n4. Chuck Schumer\n\nSchumer, who also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act, elaborated on his pro-border security stance a few years later in a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center, in which the senator told his audience that referring to illegal aliens as undocumented is unacceptable.\n\nIllegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple, said Schumer, When we use phrases like 'undocumented workers,' we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose.\n\nIf you don't think it's illegal, you're not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it, added the senator.\n\n5. Dianne Feinstein\n\nDemocrats are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence, said Feinstein of the Secure Fence Act of 2006.\n\n6. Nancy Pelosi\n\nIn 2013, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to border security as a basic principle, and urged congress to support legislation that she claimed would secure the U.S. border.\n\n7. Vice President Joe Biden\n\nWe [President Obama and I] felt so strongly, from the day we took office, for the need for immigration reform, said Vice President Biden in 2014, who had also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act when he was a senator.\n\nBiden continued, by criticizing those who choose to enter a foreign country illegally:\n\nImagine — you say, 'I got a good idea, let's gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes to take us to a country that doesn't want us, drop us off in God knows where, we don't [know] anybody, we leave everything that's familiar to us. Let's go, isn't that going to be a great idea?' These are horrible decisions these people are making.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's America's Newsroom, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) said a covert counter-terrorism operation is underway to stop a Islamic State (ISIS) attack in Turkey on Jewish children.\n\nMcCaul said, You look what happened in Pakistan, 70 women and children killed in a park by terrorists and in Turkey, ISIS is targeting Jewish children at schools, sufficient enough to pull our servicemen and family members and diplomat family members to evacuate out of Turkey. The State Department is following that warning about travel to Turkey. The world is on fire.\n\nHe continued, Well, we have both a covert counter-terrorism operation in Turkey to try to — there is an active plot underway I should say, this is imminent threat. We had six operatives taken into custody. ISIS operatives from the caliphate who basically have been talking about this imminent threat and plotting it. So right now in Turkey what is underway is an attempt to stop this plot. This gives you insight into what the president is talking about—the sort of sinister nature of ISIS and terrorists and Taliban—they would go after little children and kill them in the name of their religion. I think it really shows you what we're at war with right now. And why we need to win this war.\n\nHe added, The failed foreign policy—when you fail in foreign policy and national security, this is what you get. You get chaos and killings and ISIS now spreading throughout the region.\n\nTuesday the Obama administration advised U.S. military officials , diplomats and families to leave Turkey and the State Department discouraged Americans from traveling to Turkey because of security fears.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker suddenly and unexpectedly quit Tuesday after he admitted in a statement that he discussed confidential information with an analyst in 2012.\n\nLacker's role in the 2012 leak of sensitive information to an analyst at Medley Global Advisors came to light as part of a federal investigation. His resignation comes as part of a deal worked out with investigators, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nOnce our Bank's Board of Directors learned of the outcome of the government investigations, they took appropriate actions, the Richmond Fed said.\n\nI deeply regret the role I may have played in confirming this confidential information and its dissemination to Medley's subscribers, Lacker said.\n\nLacker, who has been the head of the Richmond Fed for 13 years, stopped short of admitting that he was the source of the information and said that it was not his intention to reveal confidential information in his conversation with the analyst. CNBC's Steve Liesman reported Tuesday afternoon that an attorney for Lacker said that federal authorities have said no charges will be filed against his client.\n\nMedley disclosed to its clients previously unknown details about the Fed's plans for the third round of asset purchases, known as QE3, according to sources familiar with the matter. The leak has been under investigation internally by the Fed, by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York ,and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The federal prosecutors and CFTC have been investigating possible insider-trading in connection with the leaks.\n\nLacker said that the analyst brought up an important non-public detail about the Fed's plans. Instead of ending the call, Lacker continued the conversation. The following day, Medley published its report containing the sensitive information.\n\nIt remains unclear how the Medley analyst originally obtained the information that Lacker says he confirmed. But the report was so detailed that it left little doubt it was based on non-public information.\n\nThe report came after the Fed announced in September 2012 its plans to attempt to boost economic growth by buying $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities each month.\n\nMedley's October 3rd report said Fed officials had discussed adding monthly purchases $45 billion of Treasury bonds, a policy which the Fed didn't announce until the following December. It also said that Fed officials had discussed assuring market actors that the central bank wouldn't consider raising interest rates until unemployment fell below 6.5% or the medium-term outlook for inflation rose above 2.5%. Those numerical triggers weren't formally adopted by the Fed until later that year.\n\nOther intriguing details from the Medley report include a report that staff members were working past midnight to prepare for the central bank's meeting and that the minutes from the meeting would include a reference to a staff meeting. Those minutes were published by the Fed the day after Medley's report.\n\nIn addition to admitting that he confirmed some of the Medley analysts non-public information, Lacker also said that he did not initially tell the Fed's investigators that the analyst was in possession of that information during the call. Instead, he only disclosed this fact in 2015 when he was interviewed as part of the investigation by federal prosecutors, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.\n\nI regret that in this instance I crossed the line to confirming information that should have remained confidential, Lacker said.\n\nLacker had previously announced his intention to retire this fall. Under the Fed's rotating schedule, the Richmond Fed president will not become a voting member of the 12-person interest rate setting board until 2018.\n\nLacker has been an advocate for the Fed to adopt a faster pace of rate hikes. He has dissented over a dozen times to the Fed's interest rate decisions during his term, consistently arguing for a less accommodative monetary policy stance. He opposed the use of the Fed's balance sheet to buy mortgage bonds during the financial crisis.
This column originally appeared on Geert Wilders' official page:\n\nOn the last day of 2015, Germany faced the consequences of the irresponsible policy in recent years to allow thousands of immigrants with an Islamic culture to enter the country.\n\nOn New Year's eve, in Cologne and other cities, such as Hamburg and Stuttgart, dozens of women were assaulted, robbed and raped by groups of men with Arab and North African features. According to the police, the men knew each other and acted in groups. Cologne Police Chief Wolfgang Albers speaks of a whole new dimension of violence.\n\nThe testimonies of the victims are terrible. Women and girls were attacked, robbed and subjected to disgusting and extremely traumatizing behavior. A victim said: They surrounded us and began to grope us. Their hands were everywhere. I had fingers in every bodily orifice.\n\nThe perpetrators acted as abhorrent testosterone bombs. When I used the word testosterone bomb in a parliamentary debate on September 17th last year, I was rebuked by the Prime Minister. He said that it was a terrible word. But it is not the term that is terrible; it is the reality that is terrible. And this reality is the responsibility of politicians, such as Mrs Merkel in Germany and our Mark Rutte, who leave our borders open.\n\nRead the full story at Geert Wilders' page.
Indian-administered Kashmir is facing widespread unrest involving violent clashes between student protesters and Indian police, the beheading of a man by Pakistan-linked terrorists, and deadly gunfights pitting security forces against militants, all of which ultimately prompted authorities to impose travel restrictions.\n\nPakistan, its ally China, and their rival India all have competing claims to the predominantly Muslim Himalayan region of Kashmir.\n\nIndia's Outlook magazine reports, referring to Easter Sunday:\n\nIndian security forces on Sunday gunned down 13 militants in three counter-insurgency operations that also claimed the lives of three Army [soldiers] and four civilians in Anantnag and Shopian districts of [India-controlled Kashmir].\n\nThe situation in the portion of the Kashmir controlled by India prompted Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif to accused India of trying to resolve the Kashmir dispute through the barrel of the gun.\n\nOn Friday — Kashmir Solidarity Day observed in Pakistan —Minister Asif declared, The recent killings of 20 unarmed civilians in Indian Kashmir are again a manifestation of the Indian policy of trying to resolve the dispute through the barrel of the gun.\n\nAlthough India describes some of the men gunned down by Indian troops as militants, Pakistan describes them all as civilians.\n\nDespite a 2003 ceasefire, India and Pakistan have repeatedly clashed along the Line of Control (LoC), the border that separates the regions they respectively control in Kashmir.\n\nChina is known to primarily stay in the shadows of the disputes between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, but it provides Islamabad with military and economic support.\n\nWhile India accuses Pakistan of backing Islamic terrorists in Kashmir, Islamabad blames New Delhi of violently oppressing pro-Pakistan separatists.\n\nThe killing of civilians at the hands of Indian troops also fueled the violent clashes that erupted between student protesters and Indian police across the city of Srinagar in Indian-held Kashmir.\n\nAl-Jazeera reports:\n\nIndian security forces fired tear gas at demonstrators on Thursday as they were protesting against the recent killings of 20 people, including separatist fighters and civilians by government troops in south Kashmir's Shopian district.\n\nOn Friday, authorities in Indian-controlled Kashmir recovered the decapitated body of a 24-year-old man, a day after suspected militants affiliated with the Pakistan-linked Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist group abducted him, reports Hindustan Times.\n\nMoreover, the Indian army in Kasmir killed an unidentified militant on Friday, reports India's Firstpost news outlet.\n\nThe unrest has driven authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir to imposed travel restrictions as a precautionary measure to maintain law and order in view of protests called by separatists and strike by trade bodies, points out the Press Trust of India (PTI).\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed concern over the situation in Kashmir.\n\nThe secretary-general has expressed and will continue to express his concern at the situation. I think we spoke about it earlier in the week, reminding all parties of the need to protect civilians, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for the U.N. chief, said on Thursday, acknowledges PTI.
Populist movements against ruling elites have been the big political story of the past five years. But at the very moment when elites appear to be winning political battles again, a new threat to their power emerges — this time aimed at Wall Street rather than Washington.
An internal police report reveals the level of chaos that existed in Cologne on New Year's Eve as hundreds of intoxicated men robbed people and groped dozens of women while police struggled to respond.\n\nThe report, written by a senior police official and obtained by Der Spiegel, states, Women, accompanied or not, literally ran a 'gauntlet' through masses of heavily intoxicated men that words cannot describe.\n\nOfficers were overtaxed and struggled to respond to what the report calls chaos. Security forces were unable to get all of the incidents, assaults, crimes, etc. under control. There were simply too many happening at the same time, the report states.\n\nWhen people in the crowd called for help, officers found they could not work their way through to reach them because of groups of men blocking their way. When officers ordered members of the mob to disperse, they were ignored.\n\nThe report also leaves little doubt about who was involved in the chaotic scene, describing the perpetrators as male migrants. Some offenders in the crowd even tore up their residence permits in front of police. One of these individuals reportedly grinned at an officer and said, You can't touch me. I'll just go back tomorrow and get a new one.\n\nAnother man reportedly told police, I'm a Syrian! You have to treat me kindly! Mrs. Merkel invited me. Germany's Justice Minister indicated on Thursday that asylum seekers found guilty of sexual assault could be deported.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel, who pushed for Germany's open borders policy to nearly a million Middle Eastern and African immigrants in 2015, has condemned the chaos in Cologne.\n\nAt least 150 reports have been filed with police, and the Telegraph reports three-quarters of those are women alleging sexual assault. That includes two cases of alleged rape. Several women involved in the chaos have already come forward to describe their experiences.\n\nDespite the unprecedented chaos that transpired that night, police reported on January 1st that the tone of the evening had been relaxed. No clear explanation for that unfounded assessment has been offered, but police have since admitted it was incorrect.
Five Republican Senators reintroduced the WALL Act Tuesday, a bill to fully fund a wall along the U.S. southern border.\n\nTheir legislation, first introduced last December, is also the first bill that will fund the wall by identifying specific funding sources, read a Tuesday announcement from the five senators. The five are Senators are Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Mike Rounds (R-SD), John Kennedy (R-LA), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA).\n\nWe need to build the wall, said Inhofe. Over the past two weeks, Democrats have refused to secure our border from drugs, human trafficking, and crime all because they are determined to oppose any policy of President Trump—even policies they have supported in the past.\n\nInhofe said the Wall Act fully funds the wall by assessing penalties on illegal immigration and closing loopholes that allow unauthorized immigrants to receive federal benefits, protecting the integrity of hardworking American citizens' tax dollars. It's that simple.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the federal government is the defense of our nation, which includes strong border security, said Sen. Rounds. The WALL Act pays for the wall by closing existing loopholes that allow illegal immigrants to receive federal benefits and increasing fines for illegal border crossings and visa overstays, he added. By funding the wall through increased fines, we prevent any risk of dipping into Department of Defense (DoD) funding, which is already stretched thin.\n\nSen. Kennedy said the taxpayers will save $33 billion. If you want to receive food stamps and other benefits, then you should prove your citizenship, said Kennedy. If you cross the border illegally or overstay your visit to this country, then you should pay a stiff penalty.\n\nSen. Cruz said the WALL Act would stop the flow of illegal immigration with border security. He said the bill would close existing loopholes that provide illegal immigrants with federal benefits and tax credits, without affecting the benefits and tax credits used by Americans.\n\nThis isn't just about illegal immigration, and it isn't just about stopping dangerous gang members from coming into our country. It's also about stopping the flow of drugs coming across our border, killing Americans in communities across the country, said Sen. Cassidy. It's time we uphold our responsibility to secure the border and protect Americans. It's a national security priority, it's a health priority, it should be an American priority.\n\nThe release stated that the WALL Act would provide $25 billion in funding for President Donald Trump's plan for a wall along the southern border. It identified specific ways this money would be obtained, Require a work-authorized Social Security Number (SSN) to claim refundable tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit.\n\nThe bill is built to compliment the Asylum Abuse Reduction Act. The release noted that Inhofe introduced this complimentary legislation in August 2018 to target immigration loopholes to improve the integrity of the asylum process.\n\nMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News — follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook
The H-2B visa program, whereby businesses are allowed to import foreign workers every year, has dragged down the wages of blue-collar Americans, a new study reveals.\n\nEvery year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut.\n\nThe latest study by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) finds that throughout Fiscal Year 2018, blue-collar Americans in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, construction industry, and fishing jobs have had their wages dragged down by foreign workers imported through the H-2B visa program.\n\nWhen CIS researchers reviewed wage data comparing the wages of H-2B foreign workers to the national wage average for each blue-collar industry, about 21 out of 25 of the industries offered lower wages to foreign workers than Americans.\n\nIn the construction industry, wage suppression is significant, with H-2B foreign workers being offered more than 20 percent less than their American counterparts. In the fishing industry, foreign workers were offered more than 30 percent less for their jobs than Americans in the field; and in the meatpacking industry, foreign workers got 23 percent less pay in wages than Americans.\n\nDespite the H-2B visa program keeping working-class Americans' wages down, the Democrat and Republican political establishments have joined the business lobby to push a plan that would give U.S. industry an unlimited supply of low-skilled foreign workers through the H-2B visa program.\n\nThe plan would cut poorer and working-class Americans completely out of the U.S. labor force by replacing them with foreign workers.\n\nThough President Trump signed his Buy American, Hire American executive order in early 2017, his Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretaries, General John Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen, have each approved an additional 15,000 foreign workers for business to import in 2017 and 2018.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.\n\nThe Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates, as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.
LONDON (AP) — With smoke still swirling around the charred remains of Grenfell Tower in west London, residents and community leaders demanded to know Wednesday how a ferocious fire could have swept through the high-rise apartment block with such speed that it killed at least 12 people.\n\nThe anger was particularly strong since activists had warned just seven months ago that fire safety procedures were so lax that only a catastrophic blaze would bring the scrutiny needed to make the building safe.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nFire and police officials have not specified what went wrong, but extensive video footage shows the flames climbing the exterior of the building at a remarkable pace.\n\nI've never seen a fire like that in my life, said Joe Ruane, the former deputy chief fire officer for U.S. Air Force bases in Britain. I've never seen that in a residential block.\n\nThe 24-story public housing complex is owned by the local government council in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea and was completed in the 1970s. It is managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, which spent 10 million pounds ($12.8 million) refurbishing the building over the last two years.\n\nThe renovation project included installation of insulated exterior cladding, double-glazed windows and a communal heating system. Investigators need to look at what materials were used in the project and who approved their use, Ruane said. But he said the speed with which the fire spread suggests that more than one fire protection safeguard failed.\n\nIt's not just one thing, Ruane said. It's multiple issues.\n\nWHAT WAS THE FIRE PROCEDURE AT THE BUILDING?\n\nSome residents suggested that Grenfell Tower's policies were to blame for the disaster.\n\nA newsletter put out by the building's tenant organization told tenants to follow a stay put policy and remain in their apartments during a fire unless the blaze was inside their apartment or in their hallway or until they were told to evacuate by officials.\n\nThis policy is in place because Grenfell was designed according to rigorous fire-safety standards, according to the 2014 newsletter about the renovation project. New front doors in each apartment could withstand a fire for up to 30 minutes, which gives plenty of time for the fire brigade to arrive, the newsletter said.\n\nThat policy, often followed in high-rise hotels, may be effective in lesser fires. In this case, however, the fire seemed to climb the exterior of the tower so quickly that it overwhelmed protective systems like fire doors. People who initially remained in place may have been unable to escape later because the hallways and fire escapes were filled with heavy smoke and flames.\n\nThe London Fire Brigade said crews were on the scene within six minutes of the first reports of the fire, but they were unable to reach people on higher floors to prevent fatalities.\n\nWHO IS TO BLAME?\n\nWhile investigations are underway to determine what went wrong, tenants said repeated complaints were ignored. Survivor Edward Daffarn said the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, or KCTMO, which manages the Grenfell Tower as well as other buildings in the area, is responsible because it ignored numerous warnings.\n\nThe management organization's annual accounts for the year ending March 31, 2016, indicate that the company has been cited for fire-safety issues in the past.\n\nFollowing an October 2015 arson fire at one of the buildings it manages, the 14-story Adair Tower, the London Fire Brigade issued an enforcement notice to install self-closing devices on the front doors of all 78 apartments and to improve fire safety in staircases used for escape, the organization said in the report.\n\nThe Fire Brigade issued a similar notice for another KCTMO-managed building, Hazelwood Tower. The upgrades were scheduled to be completed by 2016, the report said.\n\nThe Grenfell Tower disaster is uncomfortably similar to a fast-moving blaze at another London-area public housing project, Lakanal House, that killed six people, including three children, eight years ago. In that July 2009 fire, smoke and flames quickly engulfed the 14-story building. A coroner's inquest found that a series of failures contributed to the loss of life and made a number of recommendations to help prevent future disasters.\n\nInvestigators probing the Grenfell Tower fire will have to look at which of those recommendations were implemented in the building and which were not, said Jim Fitzpatrick, a former firefighter who now serves in the House of Commons.\n\nThese will be matters for the scientists and the engineers … to find out exactly how the fire started, why it spread so quickly and what could have been done to prevent it, Fitzpatrick told Sky News.\n\nA local community organization, the Grenfell Action Group, had warned about fire dangers at the building since 2013. In a series of blog posts, the group raised concerns about testing and maintenance of fire-fighting equipment and blocked emergency access to the site.\n\nAll our warnings fell on deaf ears, and we predicted that a catastrophe like this was inevitable and just a matter of time, the group said in a blog post Wednesday.\n\nKCTMO said it is cooperating with investigators and that it was aware of tenant complaints. We always take all concerns seriously and these will form part of our forthcoming investigations, it said in a statement.\n\nThe Kensington and Chelsea Council promised a full investigation into Wednesday's tragedy and a public accounting. The UK government also ordered checks at tower blocks that have had or are going through similar renovations as those at Grenfell Tower.
Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of Yemen's Shiite Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee, asserted on Monday that the Chinese coronavirus is created by the U.S.\n\nAl-Houthi's proclamation, for which he added no verifiable information, follows similar claims by Iranian and Chinese officials that the virus, which originated in Wuhan and first began infecting people in November, was somehow manufactured in an American laboratory. Chinese government media outlets have gone as far as to accuse a U.S. Army facility in Maryland of creating the virus, without evidence and no explanation for how the virus traveled across the world without infecting anyone.\n\nThe Houthi Shiite movement controls much of Yemen – including the capital, Sana'a – and has been attempting to wrest control from the legitimate government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who enjoys the support of the government of Saudi Arabia. The Shiite government of Iran has lent its support to the Houthis, creating a proxy war situation since the civil war began in 2015 that has led to a dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe Houthis are a jihadist organization whose slogan is God Is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, a Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam.\n\nCoronavirus is created by the US, and those killing the Yemeni nation with their weapons feel no compunction about killing Yemenis at a lower cost, al-Houthi reportedly posted to his Twitter account Monday, according to Iran's Tasnim News Agency. The US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and their allies must accept responsibility for the consequences of outbreak of the coronavirus in Yemen and also for the consequences of war and blockade.\n\nIn other remarks published by the Iranian state Mehr News Agency, al-Houthi also implied that the United States and Saudi Arabia were deliberately allowing flights to land in Yemen to spread the disease.\n\nHe pointed out that allowing four commercial planes to reach Yemen with a total of 1,000 passengers is a dirty tactic by the US-Saudi aggression, while only two flights have been allowed per week since the beginning of the aggression. He explained that sometimes months pass by without allowing any flights to land in Yemen, Mehr relayed.\n\nAfter killing the people of Yemen with weapons Saudi-led aggression will not refrain from killing them at the lowest cost with viruses, al-Houthi reportedly said. The countries leading the aggression, deliberately, in the occupied territories, don't take any precautionary, emergency or quarantine measures.\n\nMehr noted that the conspiracy theory that Saudi Arabia and the United States are attempting to flood Yemen with Chinese coronavirus carriers is not new and that at the beginning of the month, other Yemen officials had claimed that they had evidence that anti-Houthi forces were attempting to send carriers into the country through the port city of Aden, where Hadi's government has been exiled to.\n\nContrary to the Houthis' claims, the Hadi government, which is backed by the alleged conspirators to spread the virus in the country, moved to suspend all flights into and out of Yemen for two weeks beginning on Wednesday. On Saturday, when the government revealed the new policy, the Houthis demanded more restrictions on distributing life-saving humanitarian aid in the country.\n\nWhile Yemen has no documented Chinese coronavirus patients, it has endured an extensive famine as a product of the civil war between the government and the Houthis, one exacerbated by Houthi jihadists blocking aid into the country. The result has been the creation of a country in which the vast majority of people are reliant on humanitarian aid to live, but tons of food rot in ports because the Houthis block aid workers from distributing it.\n\nThe Houthi movement joins the governments of Iran and China in claiming the virus is somehow an American invention. While al-Houthi did not go into any specifics as to how Washington is somehow responsible for a virus originating in China, Beijing has been more specific.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lijian Zhao floated the possibility that the United States created the novel coronavirus in a biological weapons lab last week. The Global Times, a Chinese government publication, later accused a U.S. army facility in Maryland as having been the original home of the Wuhan virus.\n\nIn Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week that there is evidence that the Chinese virus is a military attack by unspecified enemies, but did not divulge any of the alleged evidence. Iranian military officials similarly claimed that the outbreak was a biological attack, specifically implicating the United States and Zionists for its creation.\n\nIn reality, the virus had never before been identified in human beings until November 17, 2019, in Wuhan, China. There is no evidence of the virus existing anywhere else before that day.\n\nIt absolutely came from Wuhan, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, confirmed last week. There's no doubt about that.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
The economic catastrophe triggered by nearly two decades of socialist policies in Venezuela has rendered the nation's political landscape unrecognizable.\n\nIt has also, however, deformed the face of the nation's apolitical media, which are forced to cater to the needs of a population desperately trying to make ends meet. What were once among the most carefree pages of the nation's newspapers—the lifestyle, health, fitness, and women's interest sections—now boast life hacks designed to help families struggling to find basic goods like oil and flour.\n\nNewspapers use their social media accounts to crowdsource the discovery of rare medications for families whose children are dying. For women fearing the potential arrival of another mouth to feed, outlets share DIY pregnancy tests they admit are not approved by science. For home cooks, newspaper share tips for how to avoid eating poisonous tubers when scavenging empty markets for what is left. For any Venezuelan trying to flee a country with a passport shortage, outlets share immigration and travel shortcuts on how to get out.\n\nLast year, Venezuelan radio host Daniel Lara Farías tweeted, It is so true that communism is hunger that a communist country has never developed a recipe. A Twitter user joked back, Except those in El Nacional: 'how to make cake without flour,' 'how to make delicious pumpkin arepas.'\n\nSolo las de El Nacional: Cómo hacer una torta sin harina…, Cómo hacer deliciosas arepas de auyama… https://t.co/TAY2dA9XBU — Carlos G Trujillo C (@cgtrujilloc) May 8, 2017\n\nOne recently shared recipe, carried over from the women's site Eme de Mujer, teaches how to prepare a delicious chocolate cake without flour, sugar, or butter. Get excited to try it and surprise your family! The recipe substitutes cornstarch for wheat flour and uses creamed rice for texture. While corn flour, a common ingredient in Venezuela's popular arepas, has been on the list of most scarce basic food products in the country for years, cornstarch has taken its place and the place of many other goods, such as baby formula.\n\nEme de Mujer also suggests mixing cornstarch with carrot juice, yogurt, and water to create an economic and effective beautifying face mask.\n\nFor those who cannot find any starch or flour for their baked goods, another newspaper, El Diario de Caracas, published a recipe for bread without flour. If you did not have time to go to the bakery, if yesterday's bread wasn't enough for today, or if you just prefer home cooking, this alternative can save your morning coffee or breakfast, the recipe suggests. The recipe uses powdered milk and baking powder as a substitute for flour.\n\nEl Nacional has been sharing and promoting creative food content for years. In December 2016, for example, it shared a listicle of cheaper, easier to access foodstuffs that could help Venezuelans eat better for their money. The list included sardines, cheap mortadella, and yuca, a starchy tuber that is a staple of Caribbean and some African cuisine.\n\nThe listicle was published by the BBC before poisonous bitter yuca killed dozens of Venezuelans relying on the vegetable to survive. By March 2017, at least 28 had died of consuming bitter yuca, a species of yuca that is inedible and causes a complete deterioration of the digestive system and vital organs. The tragic deaths triggered a wave of helpful life hack-style articles on how to identify bitter yuca. El Nacional suggested biting into a tiny raw piece at marketplaces to ensure it had no raw flavor (edible raw yuca should taste essentially like flour) and not eating yuca that is difficult to peel or takes too long to soften while boiling.\n\nOn social media, El Nacional shares not only recipes for food and household products, but seeks out individuals who possess basic drugs that families cannot find on the market. A typical El Nacional medical tweet will read like this:\n\n#ServicioPúblico Familia de bajos recursos. Señora de tercera edad muy humilde, necesita la siguiente pastilla de Quimioterapia AROMASIN DE 25 Miligramos favor comunicarse con el número. 04141271100 URGENTE. — El Nacional (@ElNacionalWeb) February 8, 2018\n\n#PublicService Underprivileged family. Elderly woman, very humble, needs the following chemotherapy pill AROMASIN 25 milligrams please contact 04141271100 URGENT.\n\nOther publications have shared life hacks that do not necessarily feed any mouths. This week, the aggregation site La Patilla shared an article from October with a hack that allegedly uses toothpaste to reveal whether a woman is pregnant. If the toothpaste creates foam and changes color after being mixed in with a woman's urine, she is pregnant, according to the trick. La Patilla is quick to note, despite the growing popularity of this method, science denies its efficacy. The toothpaste tends not to change color, even if you are pregnant, while the foam appears in most cases due to contact between the acidity of the urine and alkalinity of the toothpaste.\n\nThe hack also presents one more problem: toothpaste is hard to come by regularly in Venezuela—easier to find than pregnancy kits, birth control, or any pharmaceutical supply, but not guaranteed. In January 2016, the nation's health minister told Venezuelans to become accustomed to brushing their teeth once a day, a sign the product had already been hard to find.\n\nThe dire situation the country faces has led many to find a way to leave the country. Venezuelan media have tips for that, too, particularly given that Venezuela ran out of paper and ink to print passports in October (suspiciously, whistleblowers contend that Venezuela had enough ink and paper to print thousands of passports for terror-tied Middle Eastern nationals out of its regional embassies for years).\n\nFor those seeking a way out without a passport, Venezuela al Día recommends going to Perú. Perú is becoming an ideal destination for Venezuelans because minors can use basic health services, either in public hospitals or low-cost public programs. Maduradas, another anti-regime site, merely lists the most enjoyable things to do in Venezuela before you leave.\n\nFree Venezuela—the one before Hugo Chávez—developed a reputation as a tropical paradise known for its beauty queens and delicious food. Political activism, both within its borders and by the Venezuelan exile community, highlights the dramatic change in national character that socialism has triggered. Its lifestyle and society writers, struggling to impose normalcy in a time of chaos, prove just how deep the political wounds go, deforming far more than ideological affiliations and policy preferences.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
The impact is worst in McAllen, but it's everywhere, federal public defender for the Southern District of Texas Marjorie Meyers told the Times. She called it an explosion. She said the impact is being felt in all four divisions of the district, including Corpus Christi, which is located more than 120 miles from the Mexican border.\n\nAnother public defender, Miguel Andy Nogueras, said the Southern District of Texas has always been one of the busiest in the nation. Now its ridiculous, Nogueras said.\n\nThe Times reported that of the 92 facing prosecution on this one day, 65 had a previous criminal history. Ten of those in court were parents who saw their children removed from them after they crossed. The Trump Administration implemented a policy to remove the children from the parent's custody when they are arrested at the border.\n\nThe article states that most of the migrants plead guilty to the charge and are sentenced to time served. However, the misdemeanor conviction means that if they are deported and subsequently return to the U.S., they could face felony prosecution with a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Ormsby processed each criminal case individually and asked each of the migrants if they understood their rights and if they had spoken with an attorney. The judge admonished the migrants that further returns to the U.S. would result in stronger sentences.\n\nThe Times reporter returned to the court the following day and found 70 more illegal immigrants awaiting the same process. She wrote that 66 of these had no previous criminal record and 18 were separated from families.
During a discussion at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden stated that the 2nd Amendment has been interpreted badly and the nation has decided it can't ignore the prostitution of the amendment.\n\nBiden said, I think there's a 2nd Amendment. I think the 2nd Amendment is being very badly interpreted. It's not consistent with what they're — our founders intended, in my view. You saw Justice John Paul Stevens say that we should — because it's been so prostituted, we should repeal the 2nd Amendment. It was about a standing militia. It's a long story. I won't go into all the legal side of that having taught it in law school. But there's rational or irrational policy.\n\nHe added, What's happened here is, the nation as a whole has decided it can no longer, in my view, continue to turn a blind eye to the prostitution of the 2nd Amendment here, and no longer can turn a blind eye to the enormous damage being done, not just in our schools, but on our streets, right here in Philly and Wilmington, Delaware, where I'm from, every night.\n\n(h/t CBS News)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
U.S. Army Combat Engineer Francois Clerfe made it to the hospital on the day his daughter was born.\n\nIt was fun and exciting at the same time, you know the thrill of thinking the 'what-ifs,' Clerfe joked. Over the course of 48 hours, Clerfe had traveled from his Iraq deployment, all the way to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, in Monterey, California. He joined his wife, Natalia Svistunova, on New Year's Day. Kuwait, to Turkey, to Turkey to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Baltimore, Baltimore to Atlanta, he recounted. Seven connections, and more than 1000 miles worth of flying time later, he was home.\n\nAs it happens, his rush home was exceptionally fortunate: His daughter Julia was also in a hurry, arriving at 9:53 a.m. on the day of his arrival, more than a week earlier than her January 9 due date. I'm glad baby Julia waited for me, he said. But Julia's mother was never in doubt. You know I had the feeling that he would make it because he really wanted to be here, next to us, she told WCVB.\n\nLike many new fathers, Clerfe was overwhelmed by the event. You can't explain, but inside of you is just jumping for joy, he said. Clerfe will enjoy a month at home with his new daughter, thanks to a policy in his battalion. And while 2018 has gotten off to a rocky start for many in the United States, the soldier's daughter brought something else along with her sudden arrival: Hope. That moment, having a first kid into the world [on] the very first day of the New Year, I think that it's going to be a very good year, Clerfe said.\n\nLittle Julia Clerfe is not the only remarkable birth story of New Year's Day 2018. A set of twins was born at the Delano Regional Medical Center, just far enough apart to have their birthdays in different years. The first was a boy born in the last minutes of 2017; his sister would not arrive for another twenty minutes, just after the new year began.\n\nYou can find Nate Church being a huge nerd @Get2Church on Twitter.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Sunday defied international warnings and launched a long-range rocket that the United Nations and others call a cover for a banned test of technology for a missile that could strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nThe rocket, fired from North Korea's west coast and tracked by the governments in South Korea and Japan, came about two hours after an eight-day launch window opened Sunday morning. It follows North Korea's widely disputed claim last month to have tested a hydrogen bomb. Washington, Seoul and their allies will consider it a further provocation and will push for more tough sanctions in the United Nations.\n\nA South Korean defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of office rules, said the launch from the North's west coast launching pad was made between 9:30 a.m. and 9:35 a.m. local time, but gave no other details. Japan's NHK broadcaster reported that debris from the launch was believed to have fallen about 250 kilometers (155 miles) off the southwest coast of the Korean Peninsula into the East China Sea about 14 minutes after the launch.\n\nNHK also showed footage of an object visible in the skies from the southern island of Okinawa that was believed to be the rocket.\n\nJapanese chief Cabinet spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters that no debris fell on Japanese territory.\n\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye convened an emergency national security council meeting after the launch.\n\nNorth Korean rocket and nuclear tests are seen as crucial steps toward the North's ultimate goal of a nuclear armed long-range missile arsenal. North Korea under leader Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse Kim's government.\n\nThe global criticism began almost immediately.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the North Korean rocket launch and the recent nuclear test violations of U.N. agreements.\n\nWe absolutely cannot allow this, he told reporters at the prime minister's residence. We will take action to totally protect the safety and well-being of our people.\n\nKim Jong Un has overseen two of the North's four nuclear tests and three long-range rocket tests since taking over after the death of his father, dictator Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. North Korea says its rocket launches are satellite missions, but the U.S., South Korea and others say they are a covert test of ballistic missile technology. The U.N. Security Council prohibits North Korea from nuclear and ballistic missile activity. Experts say that ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology.\n\nThe Jan. 6 nuclear test has led to another push in the U.N. to tighten sanctions. North Korea in 2013 also did a nuclear test and then unnerved the international community by orchestrating an escalating campaign of bombast, including threats to fire nuclear missiles at the U.S. and Seoul.\n\nThe Korean border is the world's most heavily armed and the rivals' navies occasionally trade gunfire near a disputed boundary in the Yellow Sea.\n\nNorth Korea has spent decades trying to develop operational nuclear weapons.\n\nIt is thought to have a small arsenal of atomic bombs and an impressive array of short- and medium-range missiles. But it has yet to demonstrate that it can produce nuclear bombs small enough to place on a missile, or missiles that can reliably deliver their bombs to faraway targets.\n\nStill, the North's nuclear tests and steadily improving long-range rocket launches push its nuclear aims further along.\n\nNorth Korea has said that plutonium and highly enriched uranium facilities at its main Nyongbyon nuclear complex are in operation. The country is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs but there is debate about whether it is capable of building warheads small enough to mount on a missile that could threaten the United States.\n\nNorth Korea has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage, long-range rocket. After several failures, it put its first satellite into space with a long-range rocket launched in December 2012.\n\nSix-nation negotiations on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for aid fell apart in early 2009.\n\nUnder Kim Jong Un, a February 2012 deal for the United States to provide 240,000 metric tons of food aid in exchange for a freeze in nuclear and missile activities collapsed after a rocket launch by the North that April.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim and Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul; Yuri Kageyama and Eric Talmadge in Tokyo contributed to this report.
In audio aired on Tuesday's broadcast of MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Reports, White House chief of staff John Kelly told reporters on Capitol Hill that some DREAMers were too lazy to get off their asses and register for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.\n\nWhile discussing the number of people who might qualify for immigration legislation compromises that could including a path to citizenship, Kelly said, The difference between 690 and 1.8 million were the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy get off their asses but didn't sign up.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
China's Global Times state-run newspaper urged the Chinese Communist Party to impose military pressure on Taiwan, a sovereign state that China claims as a rogue province, on Sunday following President Tsai Ing-wen's reelection on the island this weekend.\n\nTsai won with an overwhelming lead against Kuomintang Party opponent Han Kuo-yu after receiving over eight million votes, the highest total for any presidential candidate in Taiwan's history and over 2.5 million more than Han. Turnout in the election surpassed 75 percent.\n\nTsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opposes growing Chinese pressure to abandon Taiwan's sovereignty and promotes the use of diplomacy to encourage the world to defend Taiwan's democratic values. Tsai particularly opposes One Country, Two Systems, a policy in which China would acquire sovereignty over Taiwan, but be legally barred from imposing communism. One Country, Two Systems is the current policy in Hong Kong, where millions have taken to the streets protesting China's routine attempts to impose communist laws.\n\nThe Hong Kong protest movement had a significant impact on Taiwanese voters who, polls showed, have grown increasingly concerned about a Chinese attempted takeover of their government. Chinese dictator Xi Jinping has attempted to exacerbate these fears by threatening a military invasion of Taiwan. In October, he vowed that all who opposed a Chinese takeover would have their bones ground to powder.\n\nDespite China's insistence on claiming control of Taiwan, the island has never been under the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. Taiwan possesses its own military and civilian facilities and institutions; no Beijing official has power over any part of the Taiwanese state.\n\nThe Times published a list of suggestions for Beijing moving forward to help contain growing international awareness of the Communist Party's belligerence towards Taipei in light of Tsai's commanding victory. Among the suggestions was a call to encourage Tsai to ease her cross-Straits policies and not to further antagonize the Chinese mainland [the land legally within Chinese borders that does not include Beijing's illegally claimed territories].\n\nMeanwhile, we need to plan to crack down on Tsai's new provocative actions, including imposing military pressure, which is an unbearable option for Taiwan authorities, the newspaper urged.\n\nThe Global Times also demanded Beijing strengthen the right to define the situation of the Taiwan Straits and work to deny Taiwan the right of self-determination. This means that we can ignore some of the messages that they want to highlight, and we can harshly stop the acts that they want to slip through unpunished, it suggested.\n\nAmong its other recommendations was a harsh stance against any Western country that supports Taiwan at America's urging.\n\nOnly 15 nations in the world recognize the reality of Taiwan's statehood; the United States is not one of them, but it does provide military and civilian support to the country. The state newspaper predicted that America will get up to more little tricks on the Taiwan question in the coming years, condemning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for congratulating Tsai on her election victory.\n\nThe American people and the people on Taiwan are not just partners — we are members of the same community of democracies, bonded by our shared political, economic, and international values, Pompeo said in a statement congratulating Tsai. We cherish our constitutionally protected rights and freedoms, nurture private sector-led growth and entrepreneurship, and work to be positive forces in the international community.\n\nThe United States thanks President Tsai for her leadership in developing a strong partnership with the United States and applauds her commitment to maintaining cross-Strait stability in the face of unrelenting pressure, Pompeo continued. Under her leadership, we hope Taiwan will continue to serve as a shining example for countries that strive for democracy, prosperity, and a better path for their people.\n\nTsai also met personally with the head of the American Institute in Taiwan, the representative office for Washington there, Brent Christensen, on Sunday.\n\nThe Taiwan-US partnership has already grown from a bilateral partnership to a global partnership. In the future, we will continue to build on the foundation we have created over the past three years to strengthen our cooperation on global issues, Tsai said of the meeting.\n\nWhile praising Tsai, Pompeo's statement is significantly less than she received when she was first elected – in 2016, the same year as President Donald Trump. Tsai called the president-elect to congratulate him in November of that year and he accepted the call, breaking decades of precedent in Washington to disregard the president of Taiwan and outraging Beijing.\n\nIn addition to the scolding from the Global Times, the Chinese Foreign Ministry published an official statement from spokesman Geng Shuang demanding nations that maintain diplomatic ties to China stop congratulating Tsai.\n\nWe oppose any forms of official ties between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China, Geng said, according to the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China. China urged those countries to earnestly abide by the one-China principle, refrain from having any official ties or exchanges with Taiwan, deal with Taiwan-related issues properly and with caution, and avoid sending any wrong signals to the 'Taiwan independence' forces, the newspaper quoted Geng as saying.\n\nThe People's Daily listed Japan and the United Kingdom alongside the United States as having reached out to Tsai.\n\nIn her acceptance speech on Saturday, Tsai thanked the Taiwanese people for participating in the democratic process.\n\nWith each presidential election, Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free, democratic way of life, and how much we cherish our nation: the Republic of China, Tsai said, using the official name of the island nation. This election has shown that the Taiwanese people hope the international community will witness our commitment to democratic values and will respect our national identity. We also hope that Taiwan will be given a fair opportunity to participate in international affairs, she said. Tsai also demanded an end to China's violent threats.\n\nOver the past three years, our administration has been firm on our bottom line on Taiwan's sovereignty, but we have also been willing to maintain healthy exchanges with China, Tsai said. In the face of China's diplomatic pressure and military threats, we have maintained a non-provocative, non-adventurist attitude that has prevented serious conflict from breaking out in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
A crowd of angry Chinese parents gathered outside the Licheng Health Center in Jiangsu province on Friday and demanded answers about the seemingly bottomless vaccine scandal that saw thousands of children receiving substandard or expired doses of vaccine.\n\nScuffles erupted between protesters and police as parents demanded accountability for the scandal and hard information about which children were injected with expired doses.\n\nA viral video caught a Health Center official surrounded by an enraged mob chanting Beat him! Beat him! The official does, in fact, appear to take a few punches during the incident:\n\nFriday's protest was hardly the first incident of public unrest over vaccines. A smaller and less physical group of parents dared to protest in Beijing over the summer, demanding justice for the victims of corruption and incompetence in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. A series of scandalous revelations rocked China over the past year, with each new outrage erupting as soon as the previous one began to subside. This reinforced the public sense of distrust in both medical companies and government regulators, an attitude most unhelpful to Communist Party leader Xi Jinping's effort to rebrand China as a high-tech powerhouse and triumph of centralized economic policy.\n\nXi clearly appreciates how unhelpful this is because vaccine activists are beginning to disappear, stuffed into unmarked cars by the same type of plainclothes goon squad that makes uppity campus Marxists vanish. Protesting parents have been told it would be best for their children if they muted their criticism of the government. Online forums created by concerned parents have been censored. Activists sardonically note that locking them up is apparently easier than cracking down on corrupt and incompetent officials.\n\nFriday's protests were sparked by the latest outrageous revelation: at least 145 children in Jiangsu province were given expired doses of polio vaccine. Although local officials gave assurances the vaccine would be only slightly less potent than fresh doses and there was no reason to fear harmful side effects, some parents reported adverse reactions from their children.\n\nThe expired vaccines were discovered by a concerned parent, not government regulators, according to AFP. This does not reflect well on the central government's copious promises to overhaul the vaccine industry after a massive rabies vaccine scandal made headlines last year.\n\nThe South China Morning Post recounted the experience of one father whose child had a visible reaction to the expired vaccine:\n\nWu Youjin, a Jinhu native who works in Beijing, said his 15-month-old daughter was given polio, leprosy and DPT (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) vaccines when they visited home in May last year. He said his daughter had developed a rash afterwards but they did not connect the symptoms to the vaccine at the time. After he learned about the latest news, he immediately checked the validity of the vaccines through an online system. He was unable to find any information, which led him to question whether the vaccines were legitimate and safe. He said some of the vaccines that his daughter received did not carry any serial numbers and he had no channel to verify if they have been expired. The government has not provided complete and systematic solutions on what measures we should take and what can we do if we have been given the [expired] shots, and what the consequences are, he said.\n\nThe SCMP quoted Chinese state media reports that 17 officials from Jinhu County have been put under investigation, sacked, or expelled from the Communist Party over the scandal. At the national level, a new Vaccine Management Law is under consideration that would allow citizens to sue pharmaceutical companies if death or serious illness results from faulty vaccines.
Beijing has approved a measure ordering Muslim communities within its borders to uphold the sinicization of their religion during the next five years, which refers to making Islam more Chinese by instilling Communist Party values, China's state-run Global Times reported this week.\n\nGlobal Times revealed:\n\nChina will soon release an outline on the sinicization of Islam, with Islamic communities urged to uphold the sinicization of their religion by improving their political stance and following the Party's leadership. Representatives from local Islamic associations from eight provinces and regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hunan, Yunnan and Qinghai provinces, discussed a five-year (2018-22) outline on the sinicization of Islam at a seminar in Beijing on Saturday. They agreed that the outline is the basic policy for Islamic sinicization for the next five years, according to a statement published on the China Islamic Association's website.\n\nGlobal Times noted that China approved a draft of the mandate in December 2017.\n\nGao Zhanfu from the Beijing-based China Islamic Institute reportedly indicated that the sinicization of Islam is not about changing the beliefs, habits, or ideology of Islam but to make them compatible with socialist society.\n\nGlobal Times' report came as China invited the international community to visit Xinjiang province, believed to house hundreds of re-education camps that the U.S. and United Nations say are used to subject the region's predominantly Muslim Uighur (or Uyghur) population, as well as Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, to communist indoctrination, systemic torture, disappearances, executions, and arbitrary detentions, among other crimes.\n\nArguing that the camps are vocational and educational centers aimed at combatting terrorism and religious extremism, China has repeatedly denied that Beijing is mistreating the detainees at the facilities, also known as mind transformation centers and concentration camps.\n\nOn Monday, China's Foreign Ministry extended its invitation to visit the centers to any party who abides by China's laws and regulations and does not interfere with its internal affairs, Global Times noted in a separate article, echoing other news outlets.\n\nShohrat Zakir, the chairman of the People's Government of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, reportedly revealed on Monday that diplomats from 12 countries — including Russia, Indonesia, India, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan — have already visited the mind transformation centers, at the behest of China.\n\nXinjiang is an open area and we welcome all parties, including UN officials, to visit the region and respect Chinese laws, Lu Kang, a spokesperson for the Ministry, told reporters.\n\nA group of foreign media, including Reuters and TASS, visited the centers January 3-5, Global Times noted.\n\nMuslim-majority Pakistan, one of China's top allies, recently defended Beijing's torture of Islam adherents.\n\nCiting sources and recent activity in the region, the Epoch Times reported last week that Chinese officials are drastically intensifying efforts to conceal evidence of hundreds of tortuous re-education centers for Muslims in Xinjiang in advance of potential inspections.\n\nUnder Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, persecution against Christians, Muslims, and other religious groups in China has escalated.\n\nIn 2017, Xi stressed that all religions must be 'Chinese-oriented,' as part of his effort to 'Sinicize religion,' or make it more Chinese, by instilling socialist core values, Newsweek reported.\n\nGlobal Times acknowledged that Xi introduced the sinicization of Islam concept in 2015, adding that it has since matured.
TEL AVIV – Hamas has warned Israel against provoking another violent conflict, saying the movement is ready to fight.\n\nTop Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh declared earlier this week that the movement's military wing will stun the whole world with its power of resistance.\n\nWe're building our strength above and below the ground, beyond the enemy lines, in the air, sea, and land, and not just to defend Gaza because, despite the siege, the Strip is liberated, Haniyeh said during a ceremony marking 20 years since the elimination of the movement's explosives expert, the engineer Yahye Ayash, by Israel.\n\nWe're doing it for the sake of the whole of Palestine. Al Qassam Brigades, who stunned the entire world in the last war, will do it again whenever they face the enemy.\n\nAlthough Hamas regularly threatens Israel, several sources in the movement told Breitbart Jerusalem that Haniyeh's speech reflects the group's increased confidence following successful tests of new missiles and rockets that have recently been smuggled into the Strip or developed in the Hamas-controlled territory.\n\nHamas' efforts to rebuild its military power have been boosted thanks to Hamas' cooperation with Welayat Sinai, the local branch of the Islamic State.\n\nBreitbart Jerusalem previously reported that Shadi al-Menai, one of the leaders of Wilayat Sinai, visited Gaza in a bid to mediate between Hamas and local Salafi groups after clashes erupted, resulting in the arrests of dozens of jihadists by Hamas forces.\n\nNow, a leading Salafi source reveals that Menai mediated a deal whereby Hamas would give the Gaza Salafi opposition groups more leeway in exchange for Wilayat Sinai's help in bypassing the Egyptian army's restrictions on smuggling rocket parts into Gaza
NFL players may soon get a reminder of how the other half lives, at least when it comes to travel.\n\nAccording to Forbes, American Airlines suspended its charter arrangements with six NFL teams. The teams that will no longer fly American are the Cardinals, Ravens, Colts, Jaguars, Dolphins, and Steelers.\n\nHowever, weirdly, American will continue to provide charters for the Cowboys, Panthers, and Eagles.\n\nAmerican cites a lack of machinery as the reason for the discontinuation of service. According to Pro Football Talk, the charter suspension issue, …extends beyond American Airlines. Delta is believed to be doing the same thing, and United could be next. The source said that roughly 20 teams currently don't have a charter provider for the coming season, and that it could become a 'real issue' for the league.\n\nHow amazing that in a league where every owner, and even some athletes, use their own private planes, that chartering flights when traveling for work could become an issue. However, it seems that's the case.\n\nThere is no question that players will have hard time making the adjustment from charter travel to commercial. Just wait until they find out about United's reaccomodation policy.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn
A new poll set to be released Thursday shows that two-thirds of American veterans and a majority of military families support ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and bringing all U.S. troops home.\n\nThe poll, from Concerned Veterans for America/YouGov and obtained exclusively in advance by Breitbart News, shows that 67 percent of veterans would support the president withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan, and 68 percent would support withdrawing all troops from Iraq.\n\nA broad majority of military households would also support withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan (59 percent) and from Iraq (61 percent).\n\nFifty-four percent of the general public are also in support of withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan, and 53 percent support withdrawing all troops from Iraq.\n\nThe poll was conducted between December 22 through January 6 and came after President Donald Trump announced in mid-November he was reducing the U.S. troop presence to 2,500 in both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nCVA Executive Director Nate Anderson told Breitbart News in an interview that one of the things that immediately jumps out from the polling is the increase of support around individuals who support a full withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq from previous years.\n\nThe change in opinion over the past couple of years is pretty significant, he said.\n\nThe U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan is slated to go down to zero by May if the Taliban adheres to a peace agreement brokered by the U.S., but the agreement's future is unclear under the incoming Biden administration.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said he favors keeping a small footprint in Afghanistan of several thousand people. The poll shows he will have to make an argument as to why he wants a continued U.S. presence.\n\nOn foreign policy, they are going to be immediately faced with a decision point — as per the U.S.-Taliban agreement in Doha, where we're looking at a drawdown deadline early this spring, and so they need to decide if that's something they're going to keep faith with, Anderson said.\n\nAnd the public's opinion around our continued involvement after 20 years in Afghanistan is no secret at this point, he added. I can't tell you what's going to happen if they decide that a presence and involvement in Afghanistan or Iraq is going to continue … they have to make a very strong compelling case if they decide if that was the best thing for the administration to pursue.\n\nThe poll also showed there was a plurality of support from veterans, military families, and the general population for a more diplomatic versus a military approach to Iran. That could be good news for the Biden administration, which wants to reduce tensions with Iran.\n\nThe poll also found that veterans and military households see access to health care as their top concern and support being able to use VA health care benefits outside of the VA system, as was allowed under the VA MISSION Act. A large majority — 87 percent — supported being able to do so, even if it cost a little more out of pocket.\n\nNine out of 10 veterans feel that they want healthcare choice from the VA. That's something that's consistent over the past several years, he said. Add to that the fact that health care was one of the most important issues when polled to this community.\n\nVast majorities of the veteran, military household, and general population polled also saw federal government spending of taxpayer dollars and the $27 trillion dollar debt as a threat to national security.\n\nIn regard to defense spending, majorities in all camps thought it should be decreased or kept about the same.\n\nThe incoming Congress and the executive administration are going to have to make some significant decisions that will also carry significant implications, not just for the veteran community but for the whole country and that's why it's important to look at these opinions, because these are the people who are most deeply affected by these issues and that's a good indicator for policy makers as they make decisions, Anderson said.\n\n20210113 CVA Survey by Kristina Wong on Scribd\n\nFollow Breitbart News's Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.
The following is an exclusive excerpt from Austin Ruse's new book Fake Science: Exposing the Left's Skewed Statistics, Fuzzy Facts, and Dodgy Data.\n\nSurveying Security instead of Hunger\n\nStarting in 1995, the USDA has conducted a regular survey of food security that measures food choices, intakes, shortages, and budgetary constraints. The 1995 report ties the lack of food security to lack of funds—an important fact to remember, in light of how the food insecure spend their money.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2006, the USDA defined four broad categories of food security: food secure, food insecure without hunger, food insecure with moderate hunger, and food insecure with severe hunger. In 2006, they changed their categories to persons with low food security and those with very low food security. They dropped food insecurity with hunger because not enough respondents reported that they felt hunger at any point during the reporting year. This ought to be a tip-off that something is fishy with government hunger numbers.\n\nThe USDA reports that the eating patterns of one or more house- hold members were disrupted and their food intake reduced at least some time during the year because they couldn't afford enough food. Those households reported cutting back on intake—but also eating unbalanced meals or relying on cheaper food. Wait a minute. Is this really hunger? Who hasn't had an unbalanced meal from time to time, or decided to go with the cheaper option on the menu?\n\nOther stats from the survey do seem alarming at first. One in thirty adults in the United States is said to have experienced very low food security. One in thirty-five was hungry for at least one day because there was not enough money for food in the household. One adult in a hundred did not eat for a whole day because of a lack of money for food. But keep that lack of money for food in the back of your mind—more on it later.\n\nAccording to the government, one child in 165 experienced very low food security. One child in 125 went hungry for at least one day because of a lack of money for food. One child in 250 skipped at least one meal because of a lack of food resources. One child in a thousand did not eat for an entire day because there was not enough money for food. Feeding America claims that thirteen million children are food insecure. But in fact the one-in-165 USDA statistic yields a total less than one tenth of that number. And the one child in a thousand who spent a whole day without eating equals about seventy-four thousand kids in the whole country. Even one hungry child is a tragedy. But the anti-hunger lobby is grossly exaggerating the scope of the problem—and proposing the wrong solutions.\n\nIt should be clear that though children are usually trotted out as at most risk of hunger, it is really adults who are most exposed to food insecurity. Only 4 percent of the food insecure are kids. About 7 percent are elderly, and a whopping 89 percent are non-elderly adults.\n\nIn congressional testimony in the summer of 2015, Heritage Foundation hunger and poverty expert Robert Rector said, For Americans to go without food for an entire day represents a social problem, but it is a problem that is limited in scope, and it requires a well-informed policy response.\n\nHow is it possible for Americans not to be able to feed themselves? Rector pointed out, In fact, filling a stomach is quite cheap; 1,000 calories of rice, purchased in bulk, costs only 30 cents. In a pinch, an adult can fill his stomach and meet all his daily calorie needs with healthful but inexpensive foods for a dollar a day.\n\nThe culprit is adults' bad choices. Cigarette smoking is a major cause of very low food security, Rector told Congress. He is not a no-smoking scold; he is concerned about the cost of the habit. Very low food security adults are much more likely to smoke than are food-secure adults, and money that is spent on cigarettes cannot be spent on food.\n\nAccording to Rector, 45% of adults with very low food security during the year smoked cigarettes during the 30 days before the survey.\n\nUsing data from the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey, Rector pointed out that 62 percent of adults who reported they 'did not eat' for at least one whole day during the last 30 days before the survey because 'there was not enough money for food,' had smoked cigarettes during the month. Lesson: stop smoking, eat, and feed your family. Rector figured that very low food security smokers consumed nineteen packs of cigarettes per month, at an average cost of $112 per month. That's 63 percent of the cost of food for a single adult under the USDA's Thrifty Food Plan.\n\nBesides money wasted on cigarettes, there is the belief, particularly harmful to the poor, that fast food is a cheap way to eat. But fast food is not the poor man's friend. Nothing could be further from the truth. A regular diet of fast food not only makes you fat and can kill you, but it's also far more expensive per calorie than cooking and eating at home.\n\nRector pointed out that a nutritious meal of rice and beans cooked at home provides around 2,200 calories for each dollar of food spending; by contrast, a Big Mac provides 138 calories for each dollar spent, as well as a lot of unhealthy fat. Traditional food stuffs are far cheaper per calorie than fast food. All-purpose flour provides 4,717 calories per dollar; rice provides 3,599; rice and beans, 2,178; peanut butter, 1,750.\n\nSadly, low food security households spend 25 percent of their food budget at fast food restaurants or at vending machines.\n\nAnd then there are the sugary soft drinks that make you fat and also cost a lot. Very low food security adults drink an average of two sodas per day. Presumably they buy them at $1.00 or $1.25 per can out of vending machines. This can run north of $70 per month.\n\nEliminating smokes and Cokes would put almost $200 more in the family food budget every month—just from cutting one person's wasteful habits. Double that for a couple.\n\nFood insecurity is a question of money. Folks spend unwisely, run out of money by the end of the month, and end up skipping a meal, eating less, or being worried about food. The vast majority of food insecurity— even very high food insecurity—could be alleviated by simple changes in behavior.\n\nBut the answer the massive food lobby favors is quite different: more and more money. They lobby for ever-more government spending, and they work feverishly to convince Americans to kick in yet more private donations as well. Lobbying and fundraising is where they spend a sizable chunk of their vast fortune. They also spend some of their lucre on food pantries and food banks, of which there are something like thirty thousand in this country. Rector, though, calculates that only a third of very low food secure families avail themselves of food banks or pantries. Two-thirds say they don't have access to them.\n\nAnd the anti-hunger lobby is only one part of the vast complex of charitable professionals and federal bureaucrats making a comfortable living off poverty in America.
Donald Trump has delivered on a key promise that many economists said was impossible: manufacturing jobs boomed in 2018.\n\nThe manufacturing sector added 284,000 positions over 2018, its best year since 1997.\n\nThe revival of American manufacturing was a cornerstone of Trump's 2016 campaign promise to Make America Great Again. Many economists derided the idea that manufacturing could boom in the U.S., insisting that a combination of automation and globlization meant that factory jobs were gone for good. Some even accused Trump of attempting to con the American people with promises of manufacturing jobs.\n\nPerhaps the highest profile attack on Trump's manufacturing jobs promise came from then-President Barack Obama.\n\nWell, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? There's no answer to it, Obama said. He just says, 'Well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.' Well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.\n\nPres. Obama on Donald Trump: The answer is he doesn't have an answer. #POTUSonNewsHour https://t.co/0XtuCDJvAx — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) June 2, 2016\n\nObama's skepticism is perhaps understandable. On the campaign trail in 2012, Obama pledged to create 1 million manufacturing jobs in his second term. Instead, the U.S. economy added only 549,000 jobs in manufacturing over the following four years. In his final year in office, manufacturing employment actually contracted. For an administration staffed by people who regarded themselves as the smartest economics minds on the scene, the failure to revive manufacturing jobs likely made it seem like an impossible task.\n\nIn fact, in Obama's entire eight-year term, the economy never added as many manufacturing jobs as it did last year. In Obama's very best year, the economy added 211,000 manufacturing jobs–and that was building from a very low base because so many jobs had been destroyed by the Great Recession.\n\nThe 2018 performance is all the more remarkable because it was not a rebound from a recession. In fact, last year the economy added 207,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nTo put it into perspective, Trump's economy added nearly as many manufacturing jobs in its first two years than Obama's economy added in his entire second term.\n\nThe manufacturing jobs boom also defies the predictions that tariffs and trade disputes would weigh on domestic manufacturers outside of steel and aluminum. Instead, manufacturing added jobs at a faster clip than the broader economy. And far from being crushed, data in January shows that export manufacturing has not only continued to grow but the rate of growth is accelerating.\n\nThese are good jobs making lasting products. About two-thirds of 2018's new manufacturing jobs are in durable goods, which includes machinery, autos, airplanes, and other big-ticket items.\n\nEconomists will no doubt spend years figuring out exactly what gave rise to the Trump manufacturing boom and why so many forecasts were so far off-base. No doubt trade policy, tax cuts, and regulatory reform all played a role. But a good deal of the manufacturing revival is likely based on something less tangible but no less real: the revival of hope. People who believe we can make America great again are hiring, starting new businesses, and returning to the workforce.\n\nMaybe Obama's magic wand comment was not so far off. But he should have called it a MAGA Wand.
Granma, the official state newspaper of the communist government of Cuba, has published a column calling the father of violinist Luis Haza, who played The Star-Spangled Banner at President Donald Trump's address last week, a murderer and Batista henchman.\n\nAuthor Sergio Alejandro Gómez's bitter screed also accused Haza, a Grammy-award-winning violinist and world-renowned music educator and human rights advocate, of playing the American national anthem off-key and President Trump himself of delivering an erratic address.\n\nTrump traveled to Miami to announce major reforms to the country's Cuba policy, which the Obama administration had modified in 2014 to greatly benefit the Castro regime.\n\nThe Granma piece does not identify author Gómez or specify his musical credentials in judging the quality of Haza's performance.\n\nFrom an off-key violin come the notes of the United States anthem. An erratic Donald Trump dusts off the rhetoric of the Cold War, the author writes, describing the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association as the old terrorist guard that killed in the name of the CIA and was left waiting for the American boat that would take them back to Cuba.\n\nThe 2506 Brigade – the Bay of Pigs Veterans – are a group of Cuban-American patriots who attempted to liberate the island from the yoke of the Castro regime in the 1960s. President John F. Kennedy doomed the operation by first promising the Cubans air support in their operation, then denying it after encouraging the fighters to land on the island.\n\nGranma routinely refers to the Bay of Pigs freedom fighters as terrorists, while embracing leadership of the wealthiest non-jihadist terrorist organization in the world – the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) – as freedom fighters.\n\nThe Bay of Pigs veterans offered President Trump their first-ever presidential endorsement before the general election last year.\n\nThe Granma column on Trump's Cuba address last week reserves a particular bitterness towards Haza, however, condemning Trump's decision to showcase his talent. Trump, the column reads, chose to bring to the stage, violin in hand, the son of a Batista henchman from Santiago de Cuba, a murderer who was involved in the death of Frank País.\n\nPaís was an anti-Batista operative largely considered the mastermind of the overthrow of the president. País was killed at age 22, just as the ideological rift between himself and Fidel Castro, who had fled the true battle against Batista in the cities to impress the New York Times with a Sierra Maestra camping trip, began metastasizing.\n\nIt was Frank who was in front of the [anti-Batista] organization throughout the island, a Miami Herald column on their relationship explained, while Castro ran the incipient guerrilla that, for many months, depended on País for its survival. Had País survived, many Cuban historians have speculated, Fidel Castro – who never won an election in his life – would not have had a clear path to totalitarian rule on the island.\n\nGranma not only fails to tie Haza's father to Frank País's death and mention that País did not support communism, it also leaves the pertinent detail unsaid that Haza's father initially supported Castro before it became clear that he was a communist. According to Town Hall:\n\nBy the time Fidel Castro rode victoriously into Santiago, the prevailing belief (including among the island's business leaders) was that Castro's overthrow of Batista would lead to democracy and free elections. Col. Haza believed democracy was Cuba's destiny and stood with Castro on a stage soon after. But it became evident that Castro neither believed in nor would support democracy; Col. Haza withdrew his support. Within a few days, Col. Haza was forced into a dark cow pasture where he and 70 other prisoners were executed under the direction of Raul Castro, Fidel's younger brother and now Cuban president.\n\nGranma was not the only Cuban government outlet to make this accusation. CubaDebate, for example, blamed Haza's father directly for País's death while calling his violin performance horrendous and off-key.\n\nIn Miami on Friday, President Trump announced that his government would eliminate the individual people-to-people travel option for U.S. citizens, which had been subject to abuse by wealthy would-be American tourists willing to fund the Castro regime through its tourism properties.\n\nTrump used the opportunity to praise Cuban pro-democracy dissidents, freedom fighters, and victims of the brutal Castro regime. Trump made clear his goal was to starve the Cuban military, limiting its ability to repress its own people and support rogue allied states like Iran, Venezuela, and North Korea.\n\nThe Cuban government responded with a screed condemning the United States for alleged human rights violations and claiming that the Cuban people enjoy fundamental rights and liberties.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the nearly 2 million Americans who have dropped Obamacare this year in a Tuesday speech to employees at U.S. Health and Human Services ahead of meetings with lawmakers at the White House and on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Vice President called the ongoing collapse of Obamacare — the death spiral — one of the most pressing issues facing Americans today. This will be the North Star of our Administration, Pence said of improving the healthcare system.\n\nWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, he said, citing the broken promises of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile discussing the promise that premiums would go down, Pence referenced a report that revealed premiums have instead skyrocketed under Obamacare — more than doubling for the average American.\n\nWhile costs are soaring…choices are plummeting. Insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right, said Pence. A chart displayed above Pence read, Only 10 million enrolled, 28 million still uninsured.\n\nHe also referenced the 1.9 million Americans that signed up for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, but have not followed through on paying their premiums. This figure comes from a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report released on Monday, detailing the 10.3 million who have paid their premiums as of March 15, out of the 12.2 million who have signed up.\n\nPence described meeting Julie Champine on a recent trip to Wisconsin. He recalled her story of losing health insurance and her doctor while she faced health issues. She was forced to sign up for an Obamacare plan which in 2016 cost more than $9,000 in premiums for her family and carries a $13,000 deductible. Champine's plan premium increased another $2,600 this year, said Pence. Julie told me that her Obamacare health insurance plan costs more than her mortgage and she can't even afford to use it, said Pence. A few months back she dropped her plan for a few months in order to afford Christmas presents for her kids.\n\nPence remarked how important the men and women who serve in U.S. Health and Human Services are and thanked them for their service.\n\nHHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price said before introducing Pence, that the work of HHS goes beyond the border of the United States and recalled a recent trip to Liberia. He lauded U.S. efforts to beat back Ebola in Africa. Price remarked of the challenges Americans face when it comes to obtaining quality health care. He voiced the goal of getting us to a healthcare system where Americans can afford health care and health coverage. He spoke of stabilizing markets, opening up enrollment options and … with the goal of installing a more patient-centered healthcare system.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act took a lot of power away from the states, added Price who said they are continuing to make progress on innovations.\n\nIn early May, health insurer Aetna pulled out of yet another state's individual market, Virginia. CNN Money reported that the company cited massive losses under Obamacare as the reason why. Within days, Fox Business reported that Aetna would pull out of Obamacare exchanges completely by 2018.\n\nAfter passing through the U.S. House of Representatives, the American Health Care Act sits waiting for a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The bill is designed to roll back much of President Barack Obama's signature health insurance mandate. The bill has been presented as the first of several phases to dismantle Obamacare.\n\nPresident Trump has often stated that Obamacare is in a death spiral under which healthcare premiums continue to skyrocket. He has promised to repeal Obamacare.\n\nFollowing his speech, the Vice President is traveling to the White House for lunch with President Trump and members of Congress. Afterward, Pence will join lawmakers for the Senate Republican Policy lunch and hold additional meetings.
The National Center for Public Policy Research's Project 21 warns that Starbucks' plan to shutter thousands of its stores on May 29 to train 175,000 employees in implicit bias could violate workers' civil rights.\n\nThe move comes after the April 12 arrest of two black men who were reportedly loitering at a Starbucks in Philadelphia.\n\nProject 21 is asking the federal government to look into whether blanket assumptions by an employer in such situations constitute a violation of employees' civil rights.\n\nNot only does implicit bias training on the part of employers eat up valuable time that could be spent training employees on safety, teamwork and building morale, the targeting associated with bias training is divisive, Project 21 co-chairman Stacy Washington said in a press release distributed to the media.\n\nWhen employees are trained to focus on their differences, the camaraderie necessary to work together is destroyed, Washington said. Mistrust in fellow coworkers is sown, and those the training is intended to help are actually harmed in the long run.\n\nOn Monday, Project 21 co-chairman Horace Cooper signed and sent letters to John M. Gore, acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, and acting chairman Victoria Lipnic at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nThe letters question the troubling implications of workplace practices focusing on 'implicit' or 'unconscious' bias.\n\nSpecifically, the letter asks whether the training violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, national origin, and religion.\n\nThe letter states, in part:\n\nEmployers are increasingly adopting so-called implicit bias training, which targets employees by race or gender. Not only are the tests associated with unconscious bias well short of meeting scientific standards, but because they purport to aid employers in targeting employees primarily based on their race or ethnicity and/or their gender they potentially allow employees to be assessed, disciplined or promoted on the basis of race or gender activity which Title VII specifically bars. Whether based on good intentions or not, an employer's plan to hire, promote or advance employees who are minority and/or female using implicit bias as a motive disadvantages non-minority and male employees.\n\nThe letter also states that Project 21 believe[s] that this employment technique is a violation of civil rights law and that the federal government should probe the matter to see if implicit bias programs conflict with Title VII protections.\n\nWorkplace discrimination dressed up as tolerance is still illegal, Cooper said. All Americans are protected regardless of race or gender, and the Feds need to make that clear before this troublesome trend spreads.\n\nProject 21 has been a leader in the black conservative movement for 25 years.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in Riyadh on Monday to discuss the civil wars in Yemen and Syria, threats posed by Iran, the dispute with Qatar, and the murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Pompeo met with the Saudi royals separately, spending 35 minutes with the king and 45 with the crown prince, who is the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia on most policy issues.\n\nPompeo told the crown prince that his Middle East journey, which has taken him to Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, had been good so far. I want to talk to you about a couple of places we've been. We think we learned a lot along the way that will be important going forward, he said. The prince replied that the Saudis would try to add more positivity, as much as we can.\n\nWe certainly talked about our effort to counter Iranian malign influence, but we spoke about all the issues in the region, ranging from the continued efforts of Hezbollah; we talked about the fact that the – the work that was done in Sweden on Yemen was good, but we need both sides to honor those commitments. To date, the Iranian-backed Houthis have chosen not to do that, Pompeo said at a press conference in Riyadh on Monday.\n\nPompeo said he discussed Iranian support for extremism with the king and MBS, positioning an independent Iraq as an important check against Iran's regional ambitions:\n\nSo this all – step back and this all starts with extremism in whatever form you find it. In this case you have Iranian-backed Houthis, Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq, Iranian-backed forces in Syria, and in each case the root of the challenge stems from the revolutionary nature of the Islamic regime and their efforts abroad. And so they're focused on doing the things they can do. I talked to – I shared with the crown prince and with the king, if I recall correctly, my conversations to help Iraq as well. We want an Iraq that is independent, sovereign, and how it is we might do that – there are lots of economic things we can do to assist Iraq in getting back on its feet, which will permit them to be more independent and have more control and be more sovereign. I shared with the crown prince my conversations when I traveled to Iraq.\n\nPompeo said his current trip to the Middle East has included similar conversations with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates about doing everything possible to help Iraq build out its sovereignty and get on its feet after the war against the Islamic State. He confirmed part of this strategy will involve beefing up Iraqi government forces to reduce the reliance of certain areas on Iran-backed Shiite Muslim militia, a strategy that he also encouraged for Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.\n\nIt's a five-capital strategy, right? This has been the – this is the history of Iran's efforts: five capitals, Pompeo said. And our effort is to make sure that the Iranian people get control of their capital and that it becomes a nation that is normal and isn't conducting terror campaigns that are unrivaled anyplace else in the world.\n\nThe secretary said he made U.S. expectations on human rights clear to the Saudis, including women's rights and accountability for those involved in the October murder of Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. He said the Saudi government's assurances that justice will be done in the Khashoggi killing remain constant, asking the press to give the Kingdom time to work through its fact-finding process.\n\nAt one point in his remarks to the press, Pompeo implied there has been some pushback from the Saudis against U.S. demands for better answers about Khashoggi's murder. Asked about criticism in Washington for the crown prince and lingering questions about his possible role in the killing, Pompeo replied:\n\nI spoke with the ruler in Saudi Arabia, the king, and the crown prince, and the foreign minister, and we spoke about a wide range of issues. And where we're working closely together and being successful we want to redouble our efforts, and where friends think the other one is falling short I was very clear and candid about those things where America is not satisfied, where they're not meeting our expectations. And they – and they appreciate that. By the way, you should know they shared places they think America may not be doing everything. I mean, this is – this is how friends engage. You have conversations where you're not always exactly in the same place, and each tries to ensure that the other understands their position and why it is they're there, and then you do your best to move forward together.\n\nPressed on whether MBS should be chastened over the Khashoggi killing, the Saudi intervention in Yemen, and the abduction of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri in late 2017, Pompeo cited the deep long-standing relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to explain that the Trump administration understands the Saudis will act in their country's interest but has shared with them places we think that the kingdom isn't doing what it is we wish that they would do.\n\nObliquely referring to the ongoing isolation of Qatar by other Gulf Cooperation Council nations and Egypt, Pompeo said all parties involved are figuring out how they can put [the GCC] back together.\n\nWe can certainly provide assistance and support, but at the end of the day, those countries have to get back together. My conversation with them was to share places where it diminishes our capacity to all work together, and I, for that reason, have a keen interest and America has a keen interest in putting those countries back in a better place together, he said.\n\nPompeo concluded by addressing the administration's efforts to secure the freedom of Americans held by Middle Eastern countries, prominently mentioning Iran and former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who disappeared there 11 years ago. He included a reference to Egypt's refusal to pay the medical expenses of American tourist April Corley, who was severely injured in 2015 when Egyptian forces mistakenly bombed her tour group. Military aid to Egypt has been delayed over Egypt's actions in the Corley case:\n\nYes on the April Corley case, and with respect to conversations about prisoners, there are few things that occupy more of my mind than getting Americans back from everyplace, and the Iranian regime has been particularly brutal with respect to the unlawful detention of Americans. I mean, Bob Levinson goes back now years. I don't want to say more than to say that we are very focused. We have the whole team, certainly at the State Department but across the entire United States Government, that night and day tirelessly is working to return Americans wherever they're wrongfully detained. And that certainly includes folks that are held inside the Islamic Republic of Iran as well.\n\nThe State Department announced on Monday that Pompeo would cut his Middle East trip short and cancel a planned visit to Kuwait because he must return to the United States to attend a family funeral. Sources told Reuters the death occurred in the family of Secretary Pompeo's wife, who has been traveling with him.
U.S. tech giant Facebook has responded to an urgent request by the British Parliament that CEO Mark Zuckerberg appear before a committee, replying they would instead send a deputy, states Bloomberg.\n\nThey report:\n\nFacebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he will not appear before a U.K. parliamentary committee to give evidence in the wake of allegations that information on millions of its users was misused.\n\nDamian Collins, the head of the committee that is also investigating the impact of social media on recent elections, had invited Zuckerberg to answer for a catastrophic failure of process.\n\nMr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person, Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of U.K. public policy, said in a statement Tuesday. She said Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox would be well placed to answer questions.
President Donald Trump may want to send Fed Chair Jerome Powell a belated Christmas card thanking him for backing off his hawkish stance on monetary policy.\n\nSpeaking on a panel in Atlanta, flanked by predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, Powell said the Fed's monetary policy is flexible. He acknowledged the December stock market sell-off, saying central bank officials are listening carefully to financial markets.\n\nIt was a change of tune for Powell. Less than a month ago, Powell appeared to brush off the downturn in stocks as a little volatility.\n\nFriday's panel appeared to be designed to reassure markets. Powell had remarks written down on a piece of paper despite the informality of the panel setting. That seemed to indicate that he had chosen his words carefully.\n\nAs always, there is no preset path for policy, Powell said. And particularly with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.\n\nPowell also said that the Fed could be flexible on its balance sheet reduction, the unwind of the enormous pile of bonds that it accumulated through its quantitative easing program. Last month, he had desribed the balance sheet reduction as being on auto pilot.\n\nPowell Now vs Then: we wouldn't hesitate to make a change if we came to the view that that balance sheet normalization…was part of the problem, we wouldn't hesitate to make a change Dec 19: we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot — Sara Eisen (@SaraEisen) January 4, 2019\n\nIt worked. Stocks rose sharply after the panel. The Nasdaq Composite, which had been down sharply on Thursday, rose by more than 4 percent.\n\nFriday was Powell's second attempt to reassure markets and businesses that the Fed would not go overboard in its rate hikes. In mid-December, following the Fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time in 2019, Powell sounded somewhat less certain about future rate hikes than he had in an interview in October. That interview with Judy Woodruff is widely seen as sparking the recent stock market volatility.\n\nTrump has been saying for several months that he does not think the Fed should be raising rates. Trump and Fed officials have often appeared to disagree on how fast the economy should be growing. Trump wants it to grow at 3 percent or more for several years. Many Fed officials think the economy has been growing faster than its long-term potential and see their role as creating conditions for a soft-landing in which growth falls back toward 2 percent.\n\nBut with inflation very low despite extremely low levels of unemployment and stronger-than-expected growth, many now think the Fed should rethink its model. The economy appears to be able to grow at a faster rate and unemployment to fall further than Fed economists thought was possible without inflation getting out of control. This suggests potential growth may be greater than the Fed believed.\n\nPowell's comments hinted that he may be moving toward that idea–or at least to being patient and letting more evidence come in.\n\nWe will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and use all of our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate, he said.\n\nOddly enough, Powell was asked if he would resign if Trump demanded it. He said he would not. But after Friday's comments and the market's reaction, that scenario now seems even less likely than it ever did.
On Thursday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling against President Trump's immigration order was a disgraceful conclusion, because what they did, is they substituted their judgment, as to what constitutes a threat to American security for the president's.\n\nKrauthammer said, I think this is a disgraceful conclusion, because what they did, is they substituted their judgment, as to what constitutes a threat to American security for the president's. Now we were all interested in what they think, but that is irrelevant to the case. The case was, does the president have the authority to do it? And if he does, it's his judgment to make. And that's the plain reading of the law. It's he plain understanding of the Constitution. I think the policy was unwise, but that's irrelevant. I think it's very clearly legal.\n\nHe added that the order's chances at the Supreme Court isn't a slam dunk, and could end up a 4-4 where the 9th Circuit's ruling is upheld.\n\nKrauthammer further stated that he thought the government's arguments in front of the court were exceedingly weak. And the administration wasn't prepared to defend the case in court.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to Chinese state television Saturday in which he credited the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party with defeating the coronavirus pandemic and celebrated the incoming Biden administration in America as a new window of hope for relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nWang said the sudden onslaught of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] has accelerated the once-in-a-century transformation in an increasingly fluid and changing world, presenting the Chinese system as a model for the world to follow:\n\nHere in China, the CPC [Communist Party of China] Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has rallied the nation behind a common purpose, and secured major strategic gains in the fight against COVID-19. We have also scored decisive successes in the three critical battles against poverty, pollution and potential risks. The whole country is on course to fully build a moderately prosperous society. The recent Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee set a great vision for China's development in the coming years and charted the course for national rejuvenation. The unity and perseverance of the Chinese people have impressed the world. The resilience and dynamism of China's development have won global recognition.\n\nWang claimed China was able to build a strong defense against the virus at our borders without mentioning Beijing's implacable opposition to other nations defending themselves against the virus during the crucial months of spread in the late winter of 2020. Instead, he credited China with helping to erect an international bulwark against the coronavirus and said his government has made more friends in the world during the pandemic it unleashed.\n\nWe have been firm in safeguarding our national interests. We have responded resolutely and rationally to unjustified moves by the United States. We have handled issues relating to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet with justified, strong and proportionate countermeasures and won one fierce battle after another in international organizations, vigorously safeguarding China's sovereignty, dignity and development interests, Wang said, delivering a jaw-dropping defense of China's authoritarian atrocities.\n\nWang was comparably shameless in praising China for swiftly reporting coronavirus cases to the world — the exact opposite of the Communist Party's deadly campaign of secrecy and its vicious oppression of heroic whistleblowers.\n\nWhen hit by an unknown coronavirus, China took immediate actions to carry out epidemiological investigation, identify the pathogen and publicize key information including the genome sequencing of the virus. All this sounded alarm bells across the world, he said.\n\nWang bemoaned the serious misconceptions of U.S. policymakers about China and hoped the change of U.S. administrations would stave off America's plan to start a new Cold War:\n\nIn recent years, China-US relations have run into unprecedented difficulties. Fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of US policymakers about China. Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy based on this misperception is simply wrong. What has happened proves that the US attempt to suppress China and start a new Cold War has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. Such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail. China-US relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening. We hope that the next US administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation.\n\nChina's state-run Global Times analyzed Wang's interview as a strong signal to other countries, especially the new US administration, that China's foreign policy has always been continuous and stable as China always hopes to return to a mutually beneficial and win-win track.\n\nIf the Biden administration understands China's determination to shape a healthy bilateral relationship and carry out a rational China policy, there is hope that the two countries can overcome the difficulties that the Trump administration has brought and reach cooperation in many areas that will positively affect long-term diplomacy, the Global Times wrote.\n\nThe analysis quoted various Chinese experts to the effect that China's plan for win-win cooperation through projects like the Belt and Road Initiative would move the Communist nation into a position of global leadership, while the remains of the Trump administration's unilateralism and protectionism are eliminated.
Even before President Donald Trump has left office, Wall Street and Washington bureaucrats are moving to patch things up with China's state enterprises.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange has withdrawn plans to delist shares of three Chinese state-owned phone carriers. The shares were to be removed under an order from President Donald Trump, a move Beijing had warned might lead to retaliation.\n\nThe exchange cited further consultation with regulators but its announcement late Monday gave no other details. Many analysts think the move reflects the expectation of a softening of the stance of U.S. policy toward China when president-elect Joe Biden takes office.\n\nYou've got to think it has more to do with who is going to be in office come January 20th, CNBC anchor Becky Quick said on Squawk Box Tuesday.\n\nWith Trump's days in the White House coming to an end, the deep state panda huggers are feeling empowered once again, said one former administration official.\n\nChina's foreign ministry on Tuesday criticized Washington for suppressing foreign companies but made no direct comment on the NYSE announcement.\n\nThe NYSE said Thursday it would remove China Telecom Corp. Ltd., China Mobile Ltd. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. under Trump's November order barring Americans from investing in securities issued by companies deemed to be linked to the Chinese military.\n\nThe order added to mounting U.S.-Chinese tension over technology, security, and spying accusations.\n\nThe Trump administration has imposed export controls and other sanctions on some Chinese companies, visa curbs on members of the ruling Communist Party and other restrictions.\n\nThe suppression will have very limited impact on Chinese companies, but it will damage the national interest and image of the United States, said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Han Chunying. She expressed hope Washington will do more to maintain the order of the global financial market and protect investors.\n\nWhile some political analysts say they expect little change in policy under Biden, many on Wall Street and in Beijing expect a warming of relations between with the U.S. and China despite widespread frustration with China's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.\n\nWhatever the political analysts say, Wall Street thinks China is open for business again and the NYSE's move is trumpet announcing it, the former official said.\n\nTrump's November order bars Americans from investing in securities issued by companies deemed by the Defense Department to be part of efforts to modernize the Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army.\n\nThe 2 million-member PLA is one of the biggest and most heavily-armed militaries. It is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles, and other advanced weapons.\n\nThe Pentagon has added 35 companies to its blacklist. In addition to the phone carriers, they include telecom equipment giant Huawei, China's biggest maker of processor chips, three state-owned oil producers and construction, aerospace, rocketry, shipbuilding, and nuclear power equipment companies.\n\nHong Kong-traded shares in the three phone carriers surged Tuesday. China Telecom rose 3.4%, China Mobile jumped 5.7% and China Unicom surged 8.5%. Shares in all three have fallen recently.\n\nThe Chinese government has accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and has warned that Trump's order would hurt U.S. and other investors worldwide.\n\nOn Saturday, the foreign ministry said Beijing would take unspecified necessary countermeasures to protect its companies.\n\nThe government made the same announcement following previous U.S. sanctions without taking action.\n\n–The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The Chinese Communist Party is using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to crack down on Christians, even arresting some for attending online services via Zoom, David Curry, the CEO of the Christian charity Open Doors, told Breitbart News in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nOpen Doors released on Wednesday the 2021 edition of its annual World Watch List – a ranking of the world's most dangerous places to practice the Christian faith. Open Doors is dedicated to aiding Christians in parts of the world where they face persecution, either from the government or from civil society.\n\nIn 2021, North Korea ranked the top most dangerous place in the world for Christians for the 20th year in a row due to systematic persecution, including execution, of Christians by the totalitarian communist government, which uses force to command popular worship of the nation's founder, Kim Il-sung, and his family.\n\nChina ranked 17 among the world's persecutors of Christians, lower than several nominal democracies such as India and Nigeria due largely to a lack of civil-society-driven mob attacks on Christian communities. The ranking this year, nonetheless, represented a six-spot rise for China between 2020, when it ranked 23, and 2021.\n\nIn just three years, the country has risen 26 places, reflecting a rapidly deteriorating situation for Christians in the country, Open Doors noted.\n\nChina has definitely cracked down on religion. They're returning what I call the 'government is God' philosophy that they had when they were connected with the Soviet Union years ago, Curry told Breitbart News. What's unique about China is that they have the capacity and the will to roll out this very sophisticated surveillance system against Christians. And, of course, with COVID [the Chinese coronavirus], people are forced to watch church online.\n\nCurry explained that the use of online tools to congregate with other Christians has resulted in easier surveillance by the Communist Party, although the pandemic itself may not directly have resulted in increased persecution.\n\nThey're taking advantage of COVID to restrict people's ability to meet, some of which is, of course, understandable. But we have cases, documented cases, where they're arresting people who are attending Zoom church, where they're monitoring church online, Curry explained. So China is cracking down. It's not related to COVID, but they are certainly using COVID as a justification to intensify the persecution.\n\nAmong the highest-profile examples of Zoom-related church arrests were a series of raids in April 2020 on members of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Chinese communist authorities arrested members of the church during an Easter Sunday online service.\n\nChristianity is technically legal in China. China allows only five legal religions – Christianity, Catholicism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Islam – but only allows the practice of each under the auspices of patriotic, state-controlled institutions. Chinese Catholics cannot legally be part of the Roman Catholic Church, only of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Similarly, non-Catholic Christians in China can only partake in practices led by the Three-Self Patriotic Church, a communist entity. Communism is by definition an atheist political ideology, which has made the vast majority of Christians reject communist-led Christian services.\n\nEstimates suggest that, including the millions of Chinese Christians not participating in legal Christian activity, China is home to one of the largest Christian populations on earth, consisting of as many as 100 million people.\n\nCurry explained to Breitbart News that the crackdown on Christianity in China has occurred in tandem with significant repression of all religions and ethnic minorities, perhaps most intensely the repression of majority-Muslim Uyghur people. As of April 2020, the U.S. government believes that as many as two million Uyghurs and other ethnic minority Muslims are trapped in government-run concentration camps in their native Xinjiang region, in northwest China.\n\nThe strategy that they're rolling out, the way they're scoring Christian behavior, attendance of church, not allowing young people under the age of 18 to go, monitoring online behavior, they're just very sophisticated how they're cracking down on religious practice, Curry said. I have to point out, it's not just against Christians. The Uyghur Muslims – religious and ethnic Muslims in the northwest of the country – have faced enormous hardships and human rights abuses at the hands of China.\n\nCurry also noted that Christians exist all over the country of China.\n\nThere are Uyghurs who are Christians, as well, so you do have intersections in these communities. But you have a different ethnicity in the northwest of the country separate from the Han Chinese, and the government of China seems to be threatened by that, he explained, and they're using some very unique tactics – maybe not unique, but intense tactics – detention, sterilizations, all on the premise that this is a dangerous terrorist group.\n\nThese are, by and large…the massive majority of the people detained are professionals. These are professors and doctors, but they have an ethnicity and/or religion that China is cracking down on, he noted.\n\nCurry told Breitbart News he hopes President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration will use its position to build on the progress that has been made in the Trump era in prioritizing religious freedom in foreign policy.\n\nEssentially, what we'd like to see is that they continue what the State Department has done, bringing together – I think it's now 32 countries – through a ministerial on religious freedom to set some standards worldwide, Curry noted, referring to the annual conferences founded by the Trump-era State Department to give foreign ministers a venue to discuss how to bolster religious freedom at home. But I also think you look first to those people we have international relationships with, like India. If China wants to be part of the international community – that is a big question mark – but if they do, we have to have some standards of human rights that are agreed upon.\n\nThe ability to practice people's faith peacefully, I think, is pretty fundamental. It's that ability to choose your own faith, to decide what you think in these partnership arrangements, he explained.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with members of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's administration following his inauguration on Monday. The two sides discussed their planned approach to isolating socialist dictatorships in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua.\n\nWe have an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes, Pompeo told reporters after meeting with Brazil's new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo.\n\nPompeo's remarks came after he attended Bolsonaro's inauguration alongside other foreign leaders including Israeli and Hungarian Prime Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu and Viktor Orban and Bolivian strongman Evo Morales. In his inaugural address, Bolsonaro promised to liberate Brazil from socialist ideology, while shifting his focus to the promotion of conservative values.\n\nBrazil will return to being a country free of ideological constrictions, he declared. I will divide power in a progressive, conscientious and responsible way.\n\nWe have a unique opportunity before us to reconstruct our country and rescue the hope of our compatriots, he continued. We are going to unite the people, rescue the family, respect religions and our Judeo-Christian tradition, combat genre ideology, conserving our values.\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to the remarks on Twitter, lauding it as a great inauguration speech.\n\nCongratulations to President @JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech – the U.S.A. is with you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 1, 2019\n\nDear Mr. President @realDonaldTrump, I truly appreciate your words of encouragement, Bolsonaro responded shortly after. Together, under God's protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people.\n\nDear Mr. President @realDonalTrump, I truly appreciate your words of encouragement. Together, under God's protection, we shall bring prosperity and progress to our people! https://t.co/dplAFNJGdA — Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) January 1, 2019\n\nThe isolation of leftist regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua are reportedly a high priority for both administrations. While the U.S. has imposed a range of economic sanctions, Bolsonaro rescinded invitations to his inauguration to governments from all three countries, citing their anti-democratic positions.\n\nBolsonaro has previously spoken about how Brazil has an obligation to support and embolden anti-communist movements around the world, although his willingness to do so may be at odds with the interest of Brazil's economy. Despite his apparent hostility, Bolivia's Morales and Chinese Communist Party envoys were present at Tuesday's ceremony.\n\nThere is little doubt that Bolsonaro's control over Latin America's largest country will be received well in Washington, as his administration is planning to align Brazil's foreign policy closely with that of the White House on issues such as pushback against China the and recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nLast month, Trump's National Security adviser John Bolton traveled to Rio de Janeiro to meet with Bolsonaro, where he celebrated the historic opportunity for Brazil and the United States to work together [on] a whole host of areas [including] economics, security and a range of others.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
While much of President Trump's attention has been focused on illegal immigration and the soaring level of border-crossers at the United States-Mexico border, reforms to the country's legal immigration system remain one of the key tenets of his America First agenda.\n\nThese are five legal immigration reforms that Trump can readily follow through on in 2019 to fulfill his campaign promises ahead of 2020.\n\n1. Reduce Legal Immigration Levels to Raise U.S. Wages\n\nEvery year, the U.S. admits about 1.1 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants, many of whom immediately become low-wage competition for America's working and middle class. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau marks a nearly 108-year record high of immigration to the country. In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants.\n\nThat 44.5 million includes roughly 22 million naturalized citizens, 11 million other residents – including more than 1.5 million foreign temporary visa-workers – plus at least 11 million illegal aliens.\n\nThe Washington, DC-imposed policy of mass immigration is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of each occupation's labor force reduces those Americans' hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans' overall wages by 0.8 percent.\n\nMuch of the inflow comes from the process known as chain migration, whereby newly arrived naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S., so Trump could drive up wages rather quickly for American workers by ending the category; ending the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which imports about 55,000 random foreign nationals every year; and implementing mandatory nationwide E-Verify to cut down on foreign competition in the U.S. labor market.\n\nAs Breitbart News has extensively reported, Since 2005, 9.3 million foreign nationals have been able to resettle in the U.S. through chain migration. This huge inflow outpaces two years of American births, which amount to roughly four million babies every year.\n\nThe number of extended-family foreign nationals who have resettled in the U.S. in the last decade is greater than the total combined population of Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland.\n\n2. Crackdown on American Job Outsourcing via H-1B\n\nUSCIS has been considering a plan since April to massively reform the country's largest American job outsourcing scheme, the H-1B visa program.\n\nEvery year, more than 100,000 foreign workers considered high-skilled are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. This program gives hundreds of thousands of good white-collar jobs to foreigners instead of young American scientists, software developers, engineers, chemists, graphic designers, investment analysts, and accountants.\n\nAmericans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News. More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Worse, the H-1B system allows U.S. companies to hire inexperienced foreigners who will work in exchange for getting green cards from the government, instead of allowing U.S. graduates to develop their skills in the job market.\n\nThe USCIS regulatory change that has yet to be implemented would narrow the definition of specialty occupations, keeping big business and outsourcing firms from importing cheaper foreign workers for high-paying, white-collar jobs that American citizens could do. Additionally, the change would increase the annual wage requirement for the foreign imports, driving up wages for Americans in the process.\n\nThe plan would only approve H-1B visas for foreign workers who have perfected a foreign style in fashion design, marketing managers with expert knowledge of foreign markets, and doctors and software designers who are considered extraordinary.\n\nImplementing the change would be a promise kept to the laid off, replaced, and forgotten American workers who rallied with Trump against all odds in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n3. Convert the J-1 Visa to an Economic Engine for Inner-City Youth\n\nIn August 2015, then-candidate Trump released his immigration policy papers which, among other things, demanded an end to the J-1 visa in favor of an economic opportunity program for inner-city youth.\n\nThe J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner-city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program, the Trump immigration policy paper stated under a section header calling for a jobs program for inner-city youth.\n\nThe J-1 visa, brings up to 300,000 foreign youths to the U.S. every year, Breitbart News has noted, to take American jobs at summer resorts, national parks, and tourist destinations.\n\nThus far, the J-1 visa has remained in place, unreformed, though the new year brings a new opportunity for the Trump administration to tackle the small, but essential reform.\n\n4. Enforce Modern 'Public Charge' Rule\n\nTrump's United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seems to be planning to implement a modern public charge rule that would protect American taxpayers' dollars from funding the mass importation of welfare-dependent foreign nationals.\n\nThe USCIS rule provides that legal immigrants would be less likely to secure permanent residency in the U.S. if they have used any forms of welfare in the past, including using Obamacare, food stamps, and public housing.\n\nEssentially, foreigners in the U.S. would not be allowed an adjustment of status to become green card holders unless they can show they will not be a burden on other Americans.\n\nThe immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the majority of the more than 1.5 million immigrants entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native-born American household. Overall, immigrant households consume 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizen households and 44 percent more in Medicaid dollars.\n\nThis straining of public services by a booming 44.5 million foreign-born population translates to the average immigrant household costing American taxpayers $6,234 in federal welfare.\n\nSuch a rule would even likely shift migration to the U.S. away from the poorest regions of the world — like Mexico and Central America — towards more middle class areas in Europe and Japan.\n\n5. Sign Executive Order Ending Birthright Citizenship\n\nIn October, Trump announced that he was readying a plan to end the country's birthright citizenship policy whereby the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are rewarded with American citizenship despite their parents having arrived unlawfully.\n\nNow, how ridiculous–we are the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits? It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous–and it has to end, Trump said at the time of ending birthright citizenship.\n\nThe children of illegal aliens are commonly known as anchor babies, as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. There are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the country, a population that exceeds the total number of annual American births. Roughly 300,000 anchor babies are born every year.\n\nPoll: Vast Majority of GOP Voters Want U.S. Anchor Baby Policy Endedhttps://t.co/dhbcZbU56J — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) November 6, 2018\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.\n\nAdditionally, as Breitbart News reported, there are nearly 62 million immigrants and their U.S.-born children — given birthright citizenship — living across the U.S. There were 17.1 million U.S.-born minor children of immigrants in the country as of 2017, according to the latest data by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe U.S. is nearly alone in granting birthright citizenship to the children of foreign nationals. For example, the U.S. and Canada are two of the only developed nations with birthright citizenship. On the other hand, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, and Germany all have either outlawed birthright citizenship or never had such a policy to begin with.\n\nTrump has yet to sign the executive order.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The New York Times has been accused of spreading false information about the United Kingdom's coronavirus vaccine guidelines, after publishing a reportedly misleading article and post on social media.\n\nIn an article entitled Britain Opens Door to Mix-and-Match Vaccinations, Worrying Experts, New York Times writer Katherine J Wu claimed that the UK has quietly updated its vaccination playbook to allow for a mix-and-match vaccine regimen.\n\nThe editor of the British Medical Journal, Fiona Godlee, denied this claim and urged the left-wing American paper to promptly issue a highly visible correction, according to the BBC.\n\nMs Godlee went on to characterise the New York Times report as seriously misleading and requires urgent correction and that there is currently no recommendation from the government to mix and match different coronavirus vaccines.\n\nContradicting the NYT's claims, the head of immunisations for Public Health England, Dr Mary Ramsay, said: We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines — if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa.\n\nDr Ramsay said that while there may be extremely rare occasions when the second dose of a vaccine is unavailable or if it is unknown what vaccine the patient initially received, it might be better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all.\n\nThe British government's Green Book for coronavirus vaccinations states that every effort should be made to ensure patients receive the same vaccine for the second dose. It does go on to note that: For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule.\n\nFar from responding to the BMJ's claims, the NYT subsequently published a second article, retreading their previous position. Other news outlets like the Guardian and Reuters also subsequently reported the stories, but citing UK government officials rejecting the NYT's claims that the advice constituted official policy, as they did so.\n\nThe controversy comes as the British government is planning on rolling out the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine this week, following the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was introduced in the UK in December.\n\nWhile both vaccines require two doses, they use different methods. The Oxford jab is based on traditional vaccine methods and the Pfizer/BioNTech injection operating off of a new mRNA technology.\n\nThe post on Twitter by The New York Times has been widely shared since it was published on January 1st, with over 3,000 retweets. Despite the outcry from British officials, Twitter has not removed the post or labelled it as misleading, in apparent contravention of the social media's own stated coronavirus misinformation policy.\n\nThe silicon valley tech giant has been quite active in censoring or labelling posts on the coronavirus it deems to be misleading, in particular posts from President Donald Trump, as well as from Breitbart News.\n\nThe account for the British magazine The Spectator poked fun at this inconsistency, sharing the New York Times post with the comment: This claim is not based on fact and is being shared by an unreliable source.\n\nNot since Nazi Germany have we seen something like what NYT is guilty of, which is an establishment news organization openly normalizing the idea of choosing who lives and who dies, not on need, but on race and skin color. Wither the Hippocratic Oath. https://t.co/Y9YEQIrr2D — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 19, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulka
The Times of Israel reports: Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat on Monday called on foreign dignitaries in Israel and around the world to stay away from next week's opening of the new US Embassy in Jerusalem, so as not to endorse what he called Washington's flagrant violations of international law.\n\nSome 800 mostly American and Israeli visitors are expected at the May 14 inauguration of the new embassy, though few officials from other countries have been invited to the event.\n\nAs Washington pursues a policy of encouragement of international anarchy and disregard for organizations and international law, we call upon all diplomatic corps, civil society organizations, and religious authorities to boycott the inauguration ceremony of the US embassy in Jerusalem, lest they lend legitimacy to an illegal decision and to continued Israeli policies of occupation, colonization, and annexation, Erekat said.\n\nRead more here.
Rome (AFP) – Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini is to stand trial on charges of illegally detaining migrants at sea, after senators voted Wednesday to strip him of his parliamentary immunity.\n\nA court in Sicily recommended that former interior minister Salvini stand trial for blocking migrants from disembarking from a coast guard boat last July.\n\nBut ministers cannot be tried for actions taken while in office unless their parliamentary immunity is revoked.\n\nThe Senate voted 152-76 in favour of removing the legal protection that had shielded the chief of the anti-immigrant League party, giving magistrates the go-ahead to charge him with abuse of power and illegal detention.\n\nThe former deputy premier faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty. A conviction could also bar him from political office.\n\nI have defended Italy. I have full and total faith in the justice system, Salvini said after the vote.\n\nI am not worried at all, and I'm proud of what I've done, he said, adding he would do it again when I get back into power.\n\nSalvini refused to allow 116 rescued migrants to leave the Gregoretti coast guard boat — where they had been languishing for about a week in insalubrious conditions — until a deal was reached with other European states to host them.\n\nA Catania court accused him of abuse of power in blocking them on board from July 27 to July 31 last year, and of illegally detaining them.\n\nSalvini insists the decision had the backing of the government and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.\n\n– 'Head held high' –\n\nBefore the debate began, Salvini took to Facebook to say he had his head held high, with the calm conscience of those who have defended their land and people.\n\n'If a man is not ready to fight for his ideas, either his ideas are worthless, or he is', Salvini wrote, quoting Ezra Pound, a 20th-century American poet known for his fascist sympathies.\n\nThe Gregoretti on July 25 took on board 140 migrants who were trying to make the perilous crossing from war-torn Libya to Europe — the same day 110 migrants drowned off the Libyan coast.\n\nSome migrants in need of urgent medical care were taken from the coastguard vessel but 116 of them remained on board for almost a week.\n\nThe then-interior minister's closed ports policy, aimed at stopping migrant arrivals from Libya, saw his popularity numbers shoot up.\n\nItaly has long complained that its European partners have abandoned it to deal alone with migrant arrivals.\n\nUnder Italy's constitution, parliament can block legal proceedings if lawmakers feel the minister was performing his job and in the national interest.\n\nThe interior minister can limit or forbid entry into or transit through Italy's waters on public security grounds — except in cases involving military vessels or ships in non-commercial governmental service like coast guard boats.\n\nSalvini's League party joined a coalition government as the Five Star Movement's junior partner in 2018 but gained popularity largely thanks to his tough anti-immigrant stance.\n\nConte, who has remained prime minister while Salvini provoked his own ousting from government in August last year, says he was not the one to decide whether the migrants should be allowed into port.\n\nThe minister (Salvini) had a new decree approved which strengthened his powers, Conte said in January. He claimed the right to decide if and when to disembark the people aboard the Gregoretti.\n\n– Second trial? –\n\nSalvini managed to avoid trial in a similar episode, in which he prevented 177 rescued migrants aboard the coast guard vessel Diciotti from disembarking for several days in August 2018.\n\nThen, the League-M5S coalition government agreed it was a joint decision and the Senate subsequently blocked Salvini from facing trial.\n\nSalvini, whose party recently lost a key regional election in Emilia Romagna, faces yet another hurdle on February 27.\n\nA Senate committee is to decide on lifting his immunity for forcing the charity rescue vessel Open Arms to remain at sea for days off the coast of Lampedusa in August last year.\n\nGiven the slow pace of the Italian justice system, Salvini faces no immediate risk.\n\nHowever, if he is eventually convicted he would be barred from politics for six to eight years.
New York's attorney general wrote the NFL expressing serious concerns about league scouting events that may violate New York State law concerning sexual orientation discrimination.\n\nEric Schneiderman's missive comes in the wake of an Atlanta Falcons coach asking Ohio State cornerback Eli Apple at the NFL Combine: So, do you like men? A coach at the Senior Bowl also allegedly asked Michael Sam's agent in 2014 if he had seen [Sam] around girls. Sam subsequently revealed his homosexuality well in advance of that year's draft.\n\nSchneiderman demands that the league provide him an inventory of reports of similar odd questions and incidents, chronicle discipline meted out, and provide a detailed summary of steps taken by the NFL to curb discrimination against homosexuals.\n\nThis incident highlights the need for the League to, at minimum, require head and assistant coaches, as well as franchise scouts, to complete an enhanced training on the League's non-discrimination policy, Schneiderman maintained about the Apple questioning, including sexual orientation non-discrimination, and their responsibilities to abide by and enforce the policy.
After a violent government takeover on Friday, Turkish newspaper Zaman has published its first print edition: an ode to Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's infrastructure projects and the Turkish soldiers fighting Kurds in the nation's south.\n\nZaman journalists are protesting that they had no input in Sunday's new print edition and that government-appointed trustees froze them out of decision-making. Zaman, one of Turkey's largest newspapers, had developed a reputation for also being among the most critical of the president.\n\nIn the latest edition of the newspaper, however, there is little pushback on the Erdogan presidency. Instead, the cover story alleges historic excitement over Erdogan's plans for a new bridge across the Bosporus, one he may eventually name after himself upon the completion of construction.\n\nAustralia's ABC notes the cover also contained images of the funerals of 'martyrs' killed in the military clashes with Kurdish rebels in the south-east, which some suggest is a sign of support for attacks against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terror group. The newspaper also uses a favorable photo of Erdogan attending a pro-woman's event, holding hands with an elderly woman.\n\nTurkish newspaper Zaman gets pro-Erdogan makeover after police raid newsroom https://t.co/gyLFmPWKCG pic.twitter.com/Y2zC8q3Asq — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) March 6, 2016\n\nThe Turkish government's takeover of Zaman on Friday turned violent rapidly, as police fired tear gas and water cannons on protesters holding up editions of the newspaper.\n\nPolice installing barricades around #Zaman newspaper building, turning it into de-facto prison for staff & journos pic.twitter.com/ifQaTlND51 — Abdullah Bozkurt (@abdbozkurt) March 5, 2016\n\nThe takeover is a result of a Turkish court ordering that a court-appointed board of trustees run the Feza Media Group, which owns Zaman. Erdogan's government has accused the writers at Zaman of having ties to the cleric Gulen, formerly a Justice and Development Party (AKP) ally now considered a terrorist by Erdogan's government. Turkey announced an in-absentia trial against Gulen in October for terrorism charges, as Gulen is currently exiled in the United States. He has also faced legal troubles in America, accused of running a corrupt charter school system feeding into an Islamist cult. The FBI raided a number of Gulenist charter schools in 2014.\n\nZaman has a circulation of 650,000, according to Vice, largely the product of providing an alternative view of current affairs from pro-government publications. Journalists at Zaman were warned that the newspaper would experience a change in editorial policy after its editor-in-chief was forced out of his job, but were assured the newspaper would remain unbiased and objective, neutral. Doubting this, they released a statement on Friday calling the takeover the darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press, which is a major benchmark for democracy and the rule of law.\n\nAs all of you know we are being governed by a regime that has no respect for our constitution, rule of law, or democracy, English-language Today's Zaman editor-in-chief Sevgi Akarcesme remarked. Today's Zaman's Twitter account has been deleted, and it does not appear to have published any new material since the takeover. Its articles on the seizure itself remain, however, providing a straightforward interpretation of events and promoting a petition against the takeover.\n\nMustafa Edib Yılmaz, a journalist who returned to work on Sunday, describes his office as being run under close police surveillance. He tells France24 the protesters have returned with him, too. Outside of my office window, I can see at least 500 and 600 people, chanting and singing slogans. … I can see conservative women in headscarves out there protesting with five or six-year-old children. He laments that he does not believe the international community will protest the takeover. There have been some statements from the European commission, saying something along the lines of 'we note with high concern,' which is like the dictionary definition of 'we are not going to do anything.'\n\nThe government has previously attempted to change leadership within Zaman. In November, the Turkish government issued an arrest warrant against Ekrem Dumanlı, who had stepped down from his position as the newspaper's editor-in-chief a month prior. Dumanlı had cited unlawful pressure on press and my personality from the government as part of his reasoning for stepping down. He was wanted for attempting a coup for having alleged ties to Gulen, according to the charges.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has said that his country will defend Europe against a wave of illegal mass migration as it had done in 2015 during the first migrant crisis.\n\nSpeaking to the media at a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Orbán said while his country and the EU should give all the help we can to Greece to stop the migrant flows, It won't be enough just to defend the Greek-Turkish border.\n\nAs a last resort, as in 2015, there are the Hungarians, he said during the summit with leaders of the three other central European Visegrád countries, adding: Even if Greece's attempt is successful, the EU border must be defended… which Hungary will do.\n\nLast week, Ankara broke the 2015 agreement with Brussels in which it would stop the illegal flow of migrants through Turkey in exchange for money and continuing EU accession talks, and opened the gates which resulted in thousands of migrants amassing on the near-east country's land border with Greece. The migrants are reportedly from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n\nTurkey's Islamist president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared on Monday that the doors are now open, telling the EU to take your share of the burden. There are some 3.6 million migrants living in Turkey.\n\nOver the weekend, unmarked white coaches were seen driving migrants from Istanbul to the border with Greece, free of charge. People smugglers in the border region have said that they have been given free rein by Erdoğan's government, with one telling media that it was his patriotic duty to get migrants out of Turkey so that his country's economy can improve.\n\nErdogan Tells Europe: Expect 'Millions' of Migrants via Turkey https://t.co/EDBTZiJX5w — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2020\n\nGreece was the main entry point into Europe for Middle Eastern migrants and asylum seekers during the 2015 migrant crisis, which saw hundreds of thousands march along what became known as the Balkan route, through Hungary, and onwards to wealthy, northern-European countries like Germany and Sweden that have generous welfare packages.\n\nHungary vowed to stop the flows into Europe by building a border fence, increasing border guard patrols, and enacting zero-tolerance on illegal migrants. A report from September 2017 revealed that the central European nation's common sense approach to stopping mass migration worked, slashing illegal immigration by 99 per cent, the numbers falling from 391,000 in 2015, to just 1,184 in 2017.\n\nA leaked report from Frontex, the EU's border agency, warned of mass migration flows to Greece that will be difficult to stop this time around. European leaders like Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz have called Turkey's action an attack on Greece and Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited the border with Turkey and said that the bloc would show solidarity with Greece.\n\nThe word solidarity in the EU has become tainted for Conservatives and populists, owing to it evoking the response of Brussels and Berlin to the 2015 crisis. After German Chancellor Angela Merkel flung open the doors of Europe to unlimited migrants, she then demanded other countries — who had not been party to the decision to suspend asylum rules in the first place — show their 'European solidarity' and take their 'fair share' of migrants. If member states did not, the EU threatened punishment. The ultimatum caused a rift in the EU between Western and Eastern Europe, with countries like Hungary and Poland flatly rejecting asylum seekers.\n\nWhile Brussels and the bloc's liberal-progressive members have pushed for an EU-wide asylum policy — which seeks to dole out arrivals to member states and fails to increase security — Hungary has said the superstate should instead take her lead and fortify Europe's external borders as well as focusing on supporting refugees in their own countries and regions.\n\nOne smuggler said it was his patriotic duty to help get the migrants over the border into Europe, as their presence was slowing down the Turkish economy… https://t.co/YKc6f3gcrD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2020\n\n–Hungary suspends admission of illegals to transit area due to threat of coronavirus —\n\nOn top of the new migrant crisis, Europe is also grappling with the threat of the China-origin coronavirus. Hungary has changed its already robust asylum rules in light of the spreading virus, with the country's national security advisor Gyorgy Bakondi announcing on Sunday that because of the related risks of uncontrolled movements of people and infection, Hungary has indefinitely suspended access to border transit areas for asylum seekers.\n\nWe observe a certain link between coronavirus and illegal migrants, Mr Bakondi said in comments reported by euronews.\n\nThe national security adviser continued that there is particular concern over illegals arriving from, or who have travelled, through Iran, a virus epicentre.\n\nIn the UK, the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 85. The situation is worse in Italy, where some 2,260 people have contracted coronavirus and there have been 80 deaths. On Wednesday, the Italian government announced that schools will be closed in an attempt to halt the spread of the deadly virus.
The Roman Colosseum set a new record for visitors in 2018 as Italian counter-terrorism forces have sent a convincing message that citizens and tourists will be protected and have nothing to fear.\n\nOver 7.6 million people visited Rome's iconic Flavian Amphitheater, or Colosseum, during the course of the year, according to Italy's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, an increase of 7.4 percent over 2017.\n\nAn average of some 21 thousand people visited the landmark each day with a peak attendance recorded during the months of March and June, the ministry noted.\n\nItaly has stood out among the nations of the European Union for its successful efforts to prevent terrorist attacks, earning it the title of a model of counter-terrorism for other countries to follow.\n\nOver the last several years, France, Belgium, Germany, and the UK have been struck repeatedly by deadly acts of Islamic terror, while Italy has remained relatively unscathed, with not a single death by a jihadist on Italian soil.\n\nThis remarkable record has come about despite the stated wish of Muslim extremists to attack Italy. In its propaganda literature, the Islamic State has declared open war on Rome and the Vatican, declaring its intentions to destroy the capital of Christianity.\n\nIn one of its videos titled Meeting at Dabiq, the Islamic State depicted its vision of the end of the world culminating in an epic battle in Rome between Islam and the West. The film showed Islamist militants marching toward the Roman Colosseum and foretold of a final battle for world domination to be fought in Rome between Islamists and western crusaders.\n\nIn a 2017 report, the Guardian asked: Why has Italy been spared mass terror attacks in recent years? In its response, the UK daily proposed that one factor was Italy's relatively small Muslim population as compared with other European nations.\n\nThe main difference is Italy doesn't have a big population of second-generation immigrants that have been radicalised or could potentially be radicalised, said Francesca Galli, an assistant professor at Maastricht University and an expert in counter-terrorism policies.\n\nItaly's Muslim population is about half that of France, both as a percentage of its overall population and in absolute terms, according to the Pew Research Center. The percentage of Muslims living in Italy is also substantially lower than it is Germany, Belgium, or Great Britain.\n\nA smaller population means that ghettoized areas that have become seedbeds of Islamic terror in Paris' St. Denis area or the Molenbeek district of Brussels simply don't exist in Italy.\n\nItaly has also adopted more aggressive counter-terror policies, including a greater willingness to profile potential terrorists and to immediately deport foreigners who pose a terror threat.\n\nItaly's interior ministry boasted in 2017 that counter-terrorism units had stopped and questioned 160,593 people between March 2016 to March 2017, as well as interrogating some 34,000 people at airports and arresting around 550 suspected terrorists. They also shut down more than 500 websites while monitoring nearly half a million more.\n\nIn September, Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini introduced a sweeping migration decree eliminating residency permits for humanitarian reasons and increasing funding for deportation centers.\n\nThe decree, which received unanimous approval in the Italian cabinet, combines aspects of migration policy along with other security provisions to tackle far-left occupier activists as well as the Italian mafia.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Leaked documents reveal that the federal government gave nearly 80 million dollars of taxpayer money to overseas abortion provider EngenderHealth over six years ending in 2019.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded two separate 5-year grants to EngenderHealth in 2013 and 2014, which originated during the Obama years but continued to be paid out during the first three years of the Trump administration.\n\nAccording to the leaked documents obtained by Breitbart News, EngenderHealth received $74,490,086 over five years beginning in 2013 and ending in 2018 for its Fistula Care Plus Project and another $4,999,562 for its Reproductive, Maternal and Newborn Health Program between 2014 and 2019.\n\nFounded as The Sterilization League of New Jersey, EngenderHealth today focuses on reproductive rights and women's health. The organization was founded by the notorious eugenicist Marian Stephenson Olden, who began to promote compulsory sterilization of persons with traits considered to be undesirable while working for the Princeton League of Women Voters.\n\nIn 1937 Olden founded the Sterilization League of New Jersey, which later changed its name to the Sterilization League for Human Betterment in 1943. It was again renamed Birthright, Inc. in 1943 with the stated goal of improving the biological stock of the human race. In 1950, Birthright was renamed the Human Betterment Association of America (HBAA) and in 2001, the organization again changed its name, this time to its current title of Engenderhealth.\n\nAccording to its website, EngenderHealth supports comprehensive abortion care (CAC), including safe induced abortion, emergency treatment of abortion-related complications, and postabortion contraception.\n\nWe also work within communities to reduce abortion-related stigma and increase awareness of unsafe abortion as well as aid civil society organizations that advocate for conducive policies and systems, the site states. In 2019 alone, we helped to avert a total of 1.4 million unsafe abortions.\n\nIn early 2017, EngenderHealth protested the Trump administration's reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, which denied federal funding for overseas abortions.\n\nIt is a fundamental right for all women and girls to be allowed access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care, said Ulla Müller, President and CEO of EngenderHealth. The Global Gag Rule effectively strips them of this right to make decisions in their private lives that will empower them to lift themselves out of poverty and enable them to live up to their full potential.\n\nEngenderHealth has been described as a prime example of how the modern U.S. family planning movement was shaped by three overlapping social forces, namely the eugenics movement, the movement for reproductive rights and the population control movement.\n\nThe organization received USAID funding to promote women's health in foreign countries and was explicitly prohibited from funding distribution of equipment intended to be used for the purpose of inducing abortions as a method of family planning.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
A 25-year-old college graduate with a degree in English literature was fired from Yelp soon after she posted a blistering open letter to Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman complaining that she was underpaid.\n\nTalia Jane's rambling complaint, as reported by the Huffington Post, was titled, An Open Letter To My CEO, and posted on Medium. It bemoaned her inability to pay for her $1,245-per-month rent and her lack of food on her bi-weekly $733.24 wage. She also moaned about the company's policy to make her wait one year before she earned a promotion, writing, A whole year answering calls and talking to customers just for the hope that someday I'd be able to make memes and twitter jokes about food.\n\nTalia Jane acknowledged that the company offers great benefits, but then complained about the $20 copays, saying, I haven't bought groceries since I started this job. Not because I'm lazy, but because I got this ten pound bag of rice before I moved here and my meals at home (including the one I'm having as I write this) consist, by and large, of that. So here I am, 25-years old, balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn't involve crying in the bathtub every week.\n\nNoting the snacks you make sure are on every floor, Talia Jane added, By and large, our floor pummels through those snacks the fastest and has to roam other floors to find something to eat. Is it because we're gluttons? Maybe. If you starve a pack of wolves and toss them a single steak, will they rip each other to shreds fighting over it? Definitely.\n\nOther complaints: I can't afford to buy groceries. Will you pay my phone bill for me? I haven't even gotten an oil change since I started this job (in August). But maybe I could find someone on Craigslist who won't mind all of that because they'll look at the dark circles under my eyes and realize I need the cash more than they do. Have you ever drank (sic) a liter of water before going to bed so you could fall asleep without waking up a few hours later with stomach pains because the last time you ate was at work?\n\nAt the end of her diatribe, Talia Jane posted: My PayPal is paypal.me/taliajane, my Venmo is taliajane (no hyphen). Square Cash is cash.me/$TaliaJane.\n\nAfter she was fired, Talia Jane, who calls herself Lady Murderface on Twitter, tweeted:\n\ni love to get fired because i said out loud that i can't afford to pay my rent, this has solved all of my problems! — Lady Murderface (@itsa_talia) February 20, 2016\n\nmy manager and Natalia in HR (convenient!) said the letter violated terms of conduct & is why I was let go. explain? https://t.co/uDAiXiTqYb — Lady Murderface (@itsa_talia) February 20, 2016\n\nStoppelman wrote on Twitter:\n\n1/5 Late last night I read Talia's medium contribution and want to acknowledge her point that the cost of living in SF is far too high. — Jeremy Stoppelman (@jeremys) February 20, 2016\n\nA Yelp spokesman told the Huffington Post that Talia Jane's letter was, an important example of freedom of speech, adding:\n\nWe do not comment on personnel issues. However, we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane's post and we viewed it as her real, personal narrative about what it's like to live in the Bay Area. We agree with her comments about the high costs of living in San Francisco, which is why we announced in December that we are expanding our Eat24 customer support team into our Phoenix office where [we] will pay the same wage.\n\nOne commenter on Talia Jane's post wrote bluntly, I'm going to be brutally honest. You do in fact, like many others have pointed out, sound like a stereotypical, entitled, and whiny millennial. The reason why you were/are in the predicament you are now is because you put yourself there. You made poor financial decisions because you wanted to live in a fancy apartment that you could not afford.\n\nTalia Jane's description of herself on Twitter says it all: Talia jane comedy • writing • better at thinking about things than actually doing them.
The U.S. Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments Tuesday morning in a high-level free speech case involving a Christian student who was barred from sharing his faith on his college campus.\n\nA convert to Christianity, Chike Uzuegbunam was peacefully sharing the gospel with fellow students on Georgia Gwinnett College campus in 2016 when campus police stopped him and told him he needed to make an advance reservation to speak in one of two tiny campus speech zones that were only open a few hours a week.\n\nThe young man obediently got his permit to speak and went to the school's speech zone at the appointed time but campus police stopped him from speaking for a second time. The officials told him that someone had complained about Chike's religious speech and then threatened disciplinary action if he should continue speaking about Jesus.\n\nChike and a second student sued Georgia Gwinnett College under the First Amendment seeking an end to the policy as well as nominal damages (Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski). Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), they challenged the college's policies as unconstitutional while the school argued that Chike's speech deserved no constitutional protection. It later changed its policy but claimed it should be exempt from any penalty for violating Chike's free speech rights.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta ruled that Uzuegbunam was moot, but Chike appealed to the high court, contending that nominal charges are important to pursuing civil rights claims and that changing policy can still result in denying one's constitutional rights.\n\nWithout nominal damages, universities and schools can violate students' rights with impunity, without clarifying the law, and with the cover of qualified immunity, lawyers told the court.\n\nThe Court needs to make it clear that colleges cannot violate a student's rights, then simply amend their unconstitutional policies after getting sued to avoid the consequences, ADF noted in an article on its website. These policies hurt real people. People like Chike. And we are grateful that the U.S. Supreme Court is willing to give him another chance at obtaining justice.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced in July that it would hear Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski and began with oral arguments Tuesday.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened the program by reacting to Sen-elect Mitt Romney's (R-UT) public critique of President Donald Trump.\n\nCarlson reminded viewers of Romney's path to prosperity at Bain Capital and how his exploitation of the finance-based economy had implications on real Americans. Carlson said it was indicative of the broader problem of how the ruling class is harming the country overall, which led to the election of Trump.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nGood evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\n\nRomney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\n\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\n\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\n\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?\n\nThese are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\n\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\n\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\n\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\n\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\n\nThere was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.\n\nTwo different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\n\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\n\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\n\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.\n\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\n\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.\n\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\n\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\n\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\nInternalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\n\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first.
PARIS – France's cautious approach to its virus vaccine rollout appears to have backfired, leaving just a few hundred people vaccinated after the first week and rekindling anger over the government´s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is holding a special meeting with top government officials Monday afternoon to address the vaccine strategy and other virus developments.\n\nIn France, a country of 67 million people, just 516 people were vaccinated in the first six days while Germany´s first-week total surpassed 200,000 and Italy´s was over 100,000. Millions, meanwhile, have been vaccinated in the U.S. and China.\n\nThe slow vaccine rollout is being blamed on mismanagement and staffing shortages during end-of-year vacations – as well as a complex consent policy designed to accommodate broad vaccine skepticism among the French public.\n\nDoctors and opposition politicians pleaded Monday for speedier access to vaccines.\n\nIt´s a state scandal, said Jean Rottner, president of the Grand-Est region of eastern France, where infections are surging and some hospitals are overwhelmed. Getting vaccinated is becoming more complicated than buying a car.
Testifying before Congress on Thursday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen the demands of enforcing ObamaCare for poor customer service and cybersecurity.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reports Koskinen told the House Appropriations Committee his agency was underfunded for dealing with the challenge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, even though committee chair Hal Rogers (R-KY) noted that Congress increased funding specifically for taxpayer services in 2014 and 2016.\n\nKoskinen said it didn't matter where Congress intended the money to go, explaining the agency had pulled funding for customer service and cybersecurity in order to ensure compliance with the ACA, the Examiner writes.\n\nThis week brought a sobering reminder of the cybersecurity challenges the IRS faces, as identity thieves used 460,000 stolen Social Security Numbers to attack the Internal Revenue website. Fortunately, they were unable to force the IRS website to generate most of the PIN numbers they needed to file fraudulent tax returns.\n\nThe agency reveals that 101,000 PINs were successfully generated during the attack, but the IRS claims it blocked the attack and no personal information was compromised or disclosed, reports the Consumerist. The victims have been notified their Social Security Numbers were stolen, and their accounts have been flagged to prevent future efforts at tax fraud.\n\nThe jury is out on whether this particular attack should be chalked up as a win or loss (the Washington Examiner describes it as a successful attack, because 101,000 PIN numbers were generated by the hackers), but a raid on IRS systems last year was able to purloin information on 330,000 taxpayers from an agency database containing old tax returns.\n\nKoskinen said $900 million has been pulled from cybersecurity, and customer service hasn't been fully funded for the past three or four years, resulting in some eight million unanswered calls to the IRS customer service line.\n\nPresident Obama's last budget proposal included a 9 percent hike in the IRS budget, bringing it from $10.9 billion up to $12.2 billion, and allowing it to hire another 4,000 employees, according to Government Executive. The IRS received a $290 million budget hike in the two-year budget deal reached last fall.\n\nIn addition, the plan promises to make IRS operations more efficient and combat identity theft. The plan would ensure compliance with the Federal Records Act to implement an electronic document retention policy – a sore point for lawmakers in recent years during probes of alleged political bias in the IRS's Exempt Organizations division, GovExec writes.\n\nThe Hill reports pushback against Koskinen's budget request from House Republicans. Subcommittee chair Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) said it was sometimes difficult to take budget requests seriously when the IRS again asks for an unrealistically high amount that doesn't make customer service a priority and fails to adopt some of the good government reforms that we added.\n\nCrenshaw noted that in Obama's budget increase for the agency, less than 20 percent of the increase was for taxpayer services, cybersecurity, and identity-theft protection.\n\nEach year we learn that customer service diminishes, Crenshaw said to Koskinen. You may argue it's because the IRS budget has been cut, but I'm going to argue that it's because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences.\n\nRep. Rogers further criticized the Obama budget proposal for adding more funding to implement ObamaCare, a measure Congress has repeatedly rejected, and for removing administrative provisions that would prevent repeats of the Tea Party targeting scandal, or the IRS wasting money on ridiculous training videos.
THOMASVILLE, Georgia — Before a small crowd gathered at the Thomas County, GA Republican Party headquarters on Sunday, former Gov. Haley Barbour (R-MS), also the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, stressed the importance of Tuesday U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia between Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and Democrat Raphael Warnock, and Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and Democrat Jon Ossoff.\n\nThe veteran campaigner and politician declared the two U.S. Senate races to have higher stakes than any campaigns with which he had ever been involved.\n\nWe've talked about campaigns that I've been involved in since 1968, and I will tell you sincerely, and without any hesitation, the stakes of this election are higher than any I've ever worked, including races for the presidency, Barbour said. Why? If you can imagine — 52 years in politics, how many times have I been asked the question: What do you worry about most about government and politics? And it is very simple — I worry my children and grandchildren are not going to inherit the same country I inherited. For the first time, I believe that could be actually happening because if you look at the left's agenda — what they say publicly they want to do. I mean, they want to do away with the rules of the Senate that keep you from just having a simple majority to pass things. And they would pass the rules to end the filibuster and make the Senate like the House.\n\nIf you've got 50 Democrat Senators and 50 Republican Senators, the Democrat [vice president] could break the tie, and that's it, he continued. That is not the way the system works that we have operated on for decades and decades and decades.\n\nBarbour said the consequences of Republican losses in both contests could impact the judiciary and policy profoundly.\n\nWhat is on their agenda? Well, pack the Supreme Court, Barbour explained. Add three more Supreme Court justices, to make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico states — by a simple majority vote. They want to do that. Their agenda for energy is very plainly stated. They want a carbon-free economy. You know, a carbon-free economy — not gasoline cars, not natural gas cars. They want electricity to be generated in some way, through solar and that sort of stuff. If you look where it is actually happening in the United States — the volume is nowhere near what it takes in this country for energy generation.\n\nThe former Mississippi governor reiterated his warnings about the high court and the end of the U.S. Senate filibuster, which would make it easier for Democrats to force through legislation. He suggested Republicans not rely on moderate Democrats, like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), and opt to elect Loeffler and Perdue.\n\nThis is high stakes, he added. And for whatever reason, it got dropped in Georgia's lap. And it is literally going to be up to 5 million or so Georgia voters as to not whether we are going to keep the deal that we have had with the other states and the other people in the country for decades. Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court in 1937 and failed. Otherwise, the Supreme Court, which by the way — the Constitution doesn't say how many justices there are. It has been just by agreement for decades, and most of us think it ought to stay that way. There are some Democrats, just like Joe Manchin, who say they won't get rid of the filibuster. But the way to make sure is to vote for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
A California woman is suing Walmart, claiming that the store's policy to lock certain products subject to a higher rate of shoplifting inside glass cases is racist.\n\nEssie Grundy is taking a Walmart in Perris, California, to court, saying she felt like a second-class citizen because items popular with black customers were locked behind glass doors, CBS Los Angeles reported.\n\nGrundy explained that she originally bought a small comb in another Walmart outside her neighborhood and wanted to get more as gifts, but when she went to the location near her, she found the 50-cent items inside locked glass cases.\n\nI noticed all of the African American products was locked up under lock and key, Grundy said at a press conference spearheaded by activist lawyer Gloria Allred.\n\nGrundy claimed she confronted the local Walmart manager and asked to have the lock-and-key policy changed, but the manager refused the request.\n\nThe mother of five children said she feels African Americans are being treated like thieves and criminals by having their most sought-after products locked up.\n\nGrundy wants an apology and wants the courts to force Walmart to stop its secure stocking practice.\n\nWalmart said it would review the woman's complaint but also noted that the shelving policy is in place for a legitimate reason.\n\nWe're sensitive to this situation and also understand, like other retailers, that some products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics, and other personal care products are subject to additional security, Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson said.\n\nThose determinations are made on a store-by-store basis using data supporting the need for heightened measures.\n\nIn a further public comment, Walmart said:\n\nWe do not tolerate discrimination of any kind at Walmart. We serve more than 140 million customers weekly, crossing all demographics, and are focused on meeting their needs while providing the best shopping experience at each store. We're sensitive to this situation and also understand, like other retailers, that some products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics, and other personal care products are subject to additional security. Those determinations are made on a store-by-store basis using data supporting the need for the heightened measures. While we've yet to review a complaint, we take this situation seriously and look forward to addressing it with the court.\n\nThe lawsuit inspired a string of posts on social media by blacks outraged by the shelving policy:\n\nIf Walmart is gonna lock up hair products they need to do it for all of them not only the ethnic hair products pic.twitter.com/XcnajuNNsV — SophsticatedBitterQueen👑 (@Kadia2_) January 22, 2018\n\nhttps://twitter.com/not_thiel/status/957107263352786944\n\nWhen did walmart start locking up black haircare products?

TEL AVIV – The tectonic plates are shifting here in the Middle East with U.S. influence on the decline and Russia quickly fulling the power vacuum, especially in Syria, declared Breitbart Jerusalem bureau chief Aaron Klein in a radio interview.\n\nKlein warned Russia has nearly taken over in Syria and explained that traditional U.S. allies in the Gulf, spurned by President Obama's successful efforts to sign an international nuclear deal with Iran, are now forging fresh alliances with Russia, creating a new Moscow-aligned axis in the Middle East.\n\nKlein was speaking during his weekly segment on John Batchelor's popular national radio show.\n\nClick below to listen to the full interview.\n\nWhat we are seeing is Russia take over in Syria, Klein stated. What we are seeing is the Saudis…bringing Russia now into the Gulf axis that traditionally for a long time, for decades, was heavily influenced by America. All of course because of the larger rapprochement between the United States and Iran.\n\nLooking at the grander scheme here, added Klein. it's Russia now with the Saudis taking over basically in Syria. You see new alliances now being created…This leaves Turkey in political and soon maybe militarily chaos.\n\nKlein downplayed Russian President Vladimir Putin's unexpected announcement on Monday ordering the withdrawal of most of his military forces from Syria.\n\nOthers in the international news media have reacted with similar skepticism regarding Russia's alleged withdrawal from Syria.\n\nWriting at CNN.com, Leon Aron, Director of Russian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, opined, Short of the tiger turning herbivore, Putin is not leaving Syria. To paraphrase Churchill, as far as Syria is concerned, Russia's involvement is not at an end, not even at the beginning of an end. It's just the end of the beginning.\n\nThe BBC's Moscow correspondent, Steve Rosenberg, remarked, Russian TV may be trumpeting it as Operation Return with live coverage of bombers leaving Syria and emotional homecomings for the Russian pilots. But Moscow is not pulling out all its forces.\n\nDon't be fooled: The withdraw from Syria is another propaganda win for Russia, was the title of a piece at Business Insider by Anna Borshchevskaya of the Washington Institute For Near East Policy.\n\nCommentary magazine dubbed it Russia's Faux Withdrawal from Syria.
Brian Kolfage, a triple amputee Air Force veteran who started a crowdsourcing campaign to raise money to pay for a border wall, told Breitbart News Saturday media reports the effort has failed are fake news.\n\nThe formation of a non-profit announced on Friday is the next step toward putting the more than $20 million Americans have donated to get the project done to use.\n\nFollowing Kolfage's announcement about the 501(c)3, We Build The Wall, Inc., the leftist media said all of the money donated to the GoFundMe campaign would be refunded.\n\nIn fact, the spokesperson for the fundraising website said that the donations would be automatically refunded if the campaign doesn't reach its $1 billion goal, unless donors specifically direct their contribution to the new organization.\n\nThe money is not being refunded, Kolfage told Breitbart News Washington Editor Matt Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday. I made a promise to everybody if we didn't hit one billion we would refund the money.\n\nI'm giving people the chance to opt out of this and get their money back if they don't want to move forward in building the wall to protect the American people, Kolfage said, adding that 100 percent of the money collected on the GoFundMe site or through the non-profit would go for construction of the wall.\n\nKolfage said the dream team that's been assembled is working with people on the border to achieve border security that the federal government has failed to put in place.\n\nWe're going to build the wall mile by mile on private property for half the cost of what the government is currently paying, Kolfage said.\n\nWe have farmers, ranchers, landowners who want the wall and they are lining up for us to build the wall on their property right now, Kolfage said. And that is what we're doing.\n\nKolfage also denied the media claim that his intention is furthering his own fortune.\n\nI am taking zero salary and zero compensation on this entire project, Kolfage said.\n\nThe dream team includes experts on immigration and in other relevant fields.\n\nThe new 501(c)4 called We Build the Wall, Inc., has formed a board of directors that Folgate will lead and a team of advisers 'to provide critical guidance on the project's legal, engineering, contracting, environmental, accounting, maintenance, and real estate issues and serve on the advisory board and or the construction, finance and or audit committees', a Business Wire press release said.\n\nKolfage also said that the GoFundMe campaign is also still collecting donations with some $200,000 raised since he announced the new strategy.\n\nKolfage told Breitbart News Saturday that although this mission is not like a military one, it is to serve the country and its citizens.\n\nI gave three limbs for this nation and I feel deeply invested, Kolfage said. I want to make sure that my children and my grandchildren have everything that I have today and I'm fighting for that.\n\nThose on board with Kolfage's latest venture named in a Business Wire press release include:\n\nKris Kobach — Secretary Kobach served as the Secretary of State of the State of Kansas from 2011-2019.

A group of thirty-three illegal boat migrants made a last-minute dash across the English Channel on New Year's Eve, in order to land on British shores before the end of the Brexit transition period.\n\nThe illegal migrants were brought ashore by the UK Border Force after they set sail from France under the cover of darkness in the early hours of the morning.\n\nDespite freezing temperatures in the Channel, the migrants were witnessed arriving at the Port of Dover wearing little more than shorts and flip flops, according to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nWith the departure from the EU, the United Kingdom should be able to begin rejecting asylum claims from migrants intercepted at sea — although time will tell whether a more robust policy is actually implemented, as the Tory government has promised.\n\nBritain has also left the Dublin III Regulation, which sets asylum policy across Europe.\n\nThe regulation determines which countries in the bloc are responsible for granting asylum to migrants, which is typically supposed to be the first safe country the migrant sets foot in. This, however, has not been the case with France and Britain, with nearly 9,000 illegal migrants landing in England in 2020 and scant deportations back to the wealthy European nation — because it is not the first safe country they passed through, for the most part.\n\nThough the United Kingdom has left the Dublin III Regulation, it has not secured an agreement with the EU or any individual country in the bloc as for the return of illegal immigrants following Brexit.\n\nTake Back Control? 2020 Saw the Europe Migrant Crisis Land on British Shores https://t.co/q3AaPkMbFl — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 28, 2020\n\nSpeaking before the House of Commons in September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he has a great deal of sympathy with those who are so desperate [to leave France] as to put their children in dinghies or even children's paddling pools and try to cross the Channel.\n\nBut I have to say what they're doing is falling prey to criminal gangs and they are breaking the law. They're also undermining the legitimate claims of others who would seek asylum in this country.\n\nThat is why we will take advantage of leaving the EU by changing the Dublin regulations on returns and we will address the rigidities in our laws that makes this country, I'm afraid, a target and a magnet for those who would exploit vulnerable people in this way, Mr Johnson concluded.\n\nIn November, Home Secretary Priti Patel agreed to send £28 million to France to increase patrols of beaches used by migrants to set sail for England.\n\nSince 2014, the UK has sent some £192 million to France to reduce illegal immigration, without success.\n\nThe Home Secretary has also pledged to reform the United Kingdom's fundamentally broken asylum system, vowing to introduce legislation for the biggest overhaul of the system in decades.\n\n37,000 Migrants Lost After Skipping Bail or Fleeing Detention Centres https://t.co/kJfZOa4rlY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 22, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulka
A group of illegal immigrants brought Latin American street-politics to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's office today, where they demanded amnesty and respect as they aggressively shouted down an office staffer.\n\nThe leader of the Soros-funded United We Dream group loudly explained her demand for amnesty — including amnesty for illegals who dropped out of taxpayer-funded American high-schools — while she was surrounded by roughly 20 supporters, many with video cameras:\n\nIt is such a disgrace how my friend Jose who never qualified DACA because he had to drop out, in order to support his single mother. came to this office and spoke with Senator Rubio's immigration staffer, and they looked him in the eye and said they would vote for Bridge [an amnesty act which provides work-permits, but no green cards]. And I remember how angry Jose was when he told me this, and I was so angry I was ready to slug somebody in the head because I could not believe that somebody had disrespected my friend like that, had looked him in the eye and told him he is not worthy of protection, of living a life with dignity on this world, and this country.\n\n🔴 LIVE from Marco Rubio's office! We will continue fighting. Democrats failed us in the Senate by passing a CR without Dream Act. Republicans have been trying to obstruct conversations to protect young immigrants from deportation. You will hear us: we need a #DreamActNow!SIGN and SHARE our petition: unitedwedre.am/2Dso9Yx Posted by United We Dream on Tuesday, January 23, 2018\n\nThe Gang of Six amnesty in the Senate would offer residency or citizenship to roughly 8 million illegals, plus chain-migration relatives, according to the White House. The illegals would likely have won that prize if Rubio's Gang of Eight amnesty had not been rejected by voters in 2014.\n\nA Rubio staffer walked into the group to ask them to leave, saying Excuse me …\n\nBut the leader of the group immediately began shouting over the staffer's voice, prompting a well-trained call-and-reply refrain from the group:\n\nUndocumented Unafraid Undocumented Unafraid We are the immigrants We are the immigrants The mighty, mighty immigrants The mighty, mighty immigrants Fighting for justice Fighting for justice Everywhere we go Everywhere we go People want to know People want to know Who we are Who we are And we tell them And we tell them We are the immigrants We are the immigrants\n\nThe group then lapsed into Spanish slogans, spotlighting the evidence that roughly one-quarter of 'dreamer' illegals do not speak English.\n\nIn fact, very few of the roughly 3.25 million illegals — perhaps as little as 1.7 percent — hold four-year college degrees. Data provided by the Migration Policy Institute shows that roughly 90 percent work in unskilled jobs and would rely on welfare and aid for most of their lives.\n\nOther pro-amnesty groups, including the investor-funded FWD.us, have been more successful in recruiting some of the few college-trained illegals to front their campaign to import more low-wage white-collar workers for jobs sought by American graduates. Nationwide, roughly 2 million foreign college grads have short-term visas which allow them to hold white-collar jobs in the United States.\n\nOnce the Rubio staffer retreated from the small mob, the leader began complaining that she dislikes her illegal status until she was guided out of the office by Capitol Hill police, not by immigration enforcement officers.\n\nI'm tired of being criminalized. I'm tired of having police being called on me, I'm tired of having to come here every day, share my stories, having to cry every day because I can't contain this emotion, this exhaustion.\n\nThe organizer did not say that she would return to her homeland. The organizer is likely Marianne Baesa.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting 1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nThe cheap labor policy has hit college graduates, not just blue-collar workers.\n\nThe cheap-labor policy has also reduced investment and job creation in many interior states because the coastal cities have a surplus of imported labor. For example, almost 27 percent of zip codes in Missouri had fewer jobs or businesses in 2015 than in 2000, according to a new report by the Economic Innovation Group. In Kansas, almost 29 percent of zip codes had fewer jobs and businesses in 2015 compared to 2000, which was a two-decade period of massive cheap-labor immigration.\n\nBecause of the successful cheap-labor strategy, wages for men have remained flat since 1973, and a large percentage of the nation's annual income has shifted to investors and away from employees.
There should be a referendum on the future of the monarchy in the wake of the Woke Royals developments, a contender in the race to replace Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, as anti-monarchists scrabble to capitalise on the Royal family's woes.\n\nThe comments came from leadership contender Clive Lewis, who said at his campaign launch Friday that he wanted the public to have a discussion about what a modern state looks like, and whether there would be a place for the monarchy in it.\n\nResponding to questions from the floor, Mr Lewis expressed sympathy for Prince Harry and Meghan, who this week dropped a proverbial bombshell on the Queen and nation by announcing they would be withdrawing from UK public life to pursue their own goals in North America. Mr Lewis also repeated claims made by others that Meghan Markle had suffered from racism in the United Kingdom and that this could be a contributing factor to her departure.\n\nThe would-be Labour leader — and hence a candidate to be the next leader of the United Kingdom, an office that serves the monarch as her Prime Minister, Lewis said: I think a lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled-down… so why not have a referendum in this country on the future of the Royal family? We're a democracy.\n\nI'd rather see us as citizens than subjects in the 21st century. Let's talk about what a modern state looks like, and what the role of the Royal family would be, if it had one.\n\nAbolishing the monarchy has long been a pet project of the hard-left in Britain. Present Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been an outspoken supporter of abolition for decades — described as a lifelong republican, he has previously supported moves in Parliament to remove the Queen and has refused to sing the national anthem given its pro-monarchy themes.\n\nYet these are positions he has been silent on since becoming Labour leader in 2015, the matter proving too controversial for even the newly hard-left Labour party to speak about in public in a nation where support for the Queen and the institution remains high.\n\nIn bad news for would-be Labour leader Clive Lewis who appears to have decided not to let the crisis go to waste in using the present news cycle to float his anti-monarchy ideas, repeated and frequent polling in the UK shows sustained support and popularity for the Queen and monarchy. 2018 surveys found just 16 per cent of Britons said there should be no monarchs in future after Queen Elizabeth II dies, and seven-in-ten supported having a monarchy in future.\n\nThe figures suggest that should a referendum go ahead, the British people would vote overwhelmingly in favour of the Queen, and that a policy of questioning the monarchy under Clive Lewis could go down as well with voters as Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit did in recent UK elections.
None of the Democratic presidential candidates picked up the key endorsement of the UNITE Here! Culinary Workers' Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, Nevada on Thursday afternoon.\n\nWe're not going to endorse a political candidate, said Local 226 Secretary-General Geoconda Argüello-Kline.\n\nWe are going to work … to defeat President Trump, she said, to cheers from union members.\n\nLocal 226, which represents 60,000 workers, including many in hotels and casinos, also sees itself as an immigration activist organization, is thought to be among the most influential political forces in the city.\n\nUnions are particularly influential in the Democratic Party's caucuses in Nevada, and the competition among candidates for union endorsements — and among unions for their respective candidates — can be fierce.\n\nLocal 226 had signaled this week that it would not support Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), describing his policy of Medicare for All as a threat to the health insurance plans that workers have won through collective bargaining.\n\nThe union's announcement Thursday was eagerly anticipated: whichever candidate it chose could enjoy a boost at the polls. And with Sanders out of the picture, the other frontrunners could have benefited from a unique opportunity to challenge him.\n\nLocal 226 had held several town halls and meetings with the Democratic contenders.\n\nBut in the end, the union simply decided to endorse its issues.\n\nIt invited the media, and all Democratic candidates, to attend a protest outside the Palms Hotel before the Democrat debate next Wednesday.\n\nJoel B.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is helping U.S. graduates by ending the lottery for H-1B foreign workers that has allowed Fortune 500 CEOs to import mid-skilled, poorly-paid foreign graduates for the starter jobs needed by U.S. graduates.\n\nThe new process will allocate the annual supply of 85,000 H-1B visas to corporations that offer the highest pay. The ranking system will end the economic incentive to hire mid-skilled H-1B foreign workers instead of younger American graduates. Currently, companies, universities, and hospitals keep roughly 1 million H-1B non-immigrant contract workers in jobs which sidelined, unemployed, or underpaid American professionals need.\n\nWhat this new policy will do is encourage companies to only ask for H-1Bs to fill higher salary jobs, not to fill the starter and mid-career jobs needed by Americans, said Kevin Lynn, the director of U.S. Tech Workers. Under her current [lottery] system, we encourage companies to recruit the lower-wage workers, so denying jobs to new U.S. graduates, he said.\n\nThe policy may help employers in lower-cost states, help sidelined American medical graduates get jobs, reduce universities' ability to get foreign students into U.S. jobs, and also exclude all of the lower-skill, lower-wage foreign workers who got H-1Bs in prior years, according to Greg Siskind, a prominent immigration lawyer who opposes the new rule.\n\nHowever, the beneficial reform may be trashed before it reshapes the huge H-1B graduate outsourcing program because it faces fierce opposition from Democrat-allied immigration lawyers, as well as many of President-elect Joe Biden's allies in the Fortune 500, on Wall Street, and in the university sector.\n\nThe reform does not cover the 2021 award of 85,000 new visas because it was processed so late in President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nThe H-1B temporary visa program has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs, said Joseph Edlow, the policy director at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency. He continued:\n\nThe current H-1B random selection process makes it difficult for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the program to compete for the best and brightest international workforce, and has predominately resulted in the annual influx of foreign labor placed in low-wage positions at the expense of U.S. workers.\n\nA USCIS statement added:\n\nThe final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. DHS previously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on Nov. 2, 2020, and carefully considered the public comments received before deciding to publish the proposed regulations as a final rule.\n\nThe rule was applauded by Daniel Costa, at the left-wing Economic Policy Institute.\n\nThis rule comes from an admin we all hate, he tweeted, but the substance takes a lottery that randomly allocates H-1B visas & instead prioritizes them for the highest-paid workers, which incentivizes better pay for migrants. Someone will have to explain to me why that's bad. Notably, Costa did not discuss the possible benefits for American graduates.\n\nThe H-1B visa, however, is just one part of a huge pyramid of imported labor that is used by U.S. investors to spike stock values and to corral their control over the technology sector.\n\nThe imported labor force exists because Congress allows companies to provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign workers each year. As a result, at least 1 million foreign graduates are competing in U.S. workplaces for those green cards or are waiting for promised green cards.\n\nThis foreign labor force, which is dubbed the Green Card Workforce, is often preferred by executives because the dangled green cards ensure that the foreign workers will work long hours for lower wages. In addition, the workers have no legal protections in the workplace and have no professional authority to disagree with CEOs, who can also gain personally when Wall Street welcomes each outsourcing decision.\n\nCompanies also crimp and slow technological domestic competition by hiring visa workers instead of American graduates. In the early 2000s, the federal government broke up an illegal no-poaching cartel by tech companies who were trying to prevent their American workers from changing jobs and so sharing their expertise with rival companies. This strategy is legal if the workforce consists of H-1B workers who cannot change jobs without their managers' permission.\n\nMany U.S. and Indian employees tell Breitbart News that American graduates are excluded from competing from many Fortune 500 jobs so that the jobs can be traded by hiring managers to foreign workers who want to win green cards.\n\nIn 2011, for example, a California-based health insurance company fired 40 Americans to hire a larger and more expensive workforce of H-1B workers, according to testimony from a company employee in a subsequent lawsuit. In 2020, Facebook was sued by the federal government for hiring policies that discriminate against American graduates.\n\nThe labor pyramid includes H-1Bs hired by the companies and by their subcontracting companies. The categories of workers also include J-1s, TNs, OPTs, B-1/B-2s, and foreign graduates who overstay their visas. Most work for Fortune 500 companies, but they are also prominent in tech firms, universities, and increasingly in the healthcare sector.\n\nThis huge imported workforce ensures that executives rarely have to compete for American graduates by offering higher wages, even when profits are growing. A 2020 report by the Federal Reserve said median salaries for U.S. graduates fell by two percent from 2016 to 2019 as blue-collar salaries rose amid President Donald Trump's border policies.\n\nThere is some evidence that the increasing use of visa workers is reducing U.S. technological capability, even as Chinese companies take the lead from investor-driven U.S. companies.\n\nThis growing use of this Green Card Workforce is ignored and misunderstood by the largely powerless white-collar reporters in the corporate media. Many media companies — such as the Washington Post — are owned by firms or investors who want to grow the Green Card Workforce. Other white-collar reporters choose to view the visa workers via the lens of progressive immigration politics, even though the H-1B workers are foreign contract workers who replace white-collar Americans and who do not become immigrants until they receive a green card.
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is set to receive nearly $141 million merger pay following Verizon's purchase of the company, despite the SEC launching an investigation into whether Yahoo intentionally covered up a widespread hack and leak of its users data for nearly two years.\n\nOne thing at Yahoo is likely to remain safe even if its users' info and emails weren't: CEO Marissa Mayer's enormous nearly $141 million merger payday, declared Fortune in its report. In the wake of the financial crisis, regulators and lawmakers have pushed companies to adopt so-called 'claw back' policies for executive pay. The clauses are design to safeguard companies against paying bonuses and other incentive-based compensation to executives who earned it through fraudulent behavior.\n\nWhat's more, the policies are supposed to discourage that behavior in the first place. Clawbacks still aren't invoked all that much, but they have come up lately. Earlier this year, two Wells Fargo (WFC, +1.42%) executives gave back some of their pay amid the bank's recent phony accounts scandal, the publication continued. Yahoo has a clawback provision, and Mayer's pay is covered by it. But the company's policy only permits Yahoo to recoup executive pay 'in the event of a restatement of incorrect Yahoo financial results' — basically accounting fraud, and that's it. Not covered by a clawback: Allegedly covering up two hacking incidents so you can complete a multi-billion sale of your company's main business.\n\nMayer was previously predicted to receive just $55 million in severance pay.\n\nIn December, it was revealed that over one billion Yahoo users had been affected by a hack, just months after a previous hack was announced and reportedly covered up by the company.\n\nIn both incidents, users had their names, email addresses, dates of birth, security questions and answers, phone numbers, and hashed passwords stolen by hackers, including the details of over 150,000 government employees.\n\nYahoo was reportedly aware of the first large hack, which led to over 500 million account details being stolen, in 2014. However, they failed to announce the incident to the public until late 2016.\n\nOn Monday, Breitbart News reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Yahoo in response to the security breaches that took place at the company, and whether they notified investors in a timely manner.\n\nThe SEC's investigation looks into whether Yahoo disclosed information about the data breaches in timely enough fashion, wrote USA Today on the subject. SEC rules require companies to disclose data breaches and cyberattacks as soon as it is determined the incidents could have an effect on investors.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the SEC last month requested documents from Yahoo, they continued. The agency has been seeking a model case for cybersecurity rules it issued in 2011.\n\nMayer's reign as CEO of Yahoo has often been controversial, with the CEO facing a lawsuit last year that claimed she purposely purged male employees, and with several employees of Tumblr, the popular micro-blogging platform owned by Yahoo, also claiming that Mayer and her management were responsible for the decline of the social network.\n\nIn January 2016, Mayer also faced a backlash after making a joke to employees about the number of layoffs at the company.\n\nNo layoffs… this week! joked Mayer, in response to questions raised by concerned employees.\n\nA New York Times report also claimed that Mayer had denied repeated requests for additional investment in Yahoo's cybersecurity, with the security team allegedly derisively referred to as paranoids inside the company.\n\nFollowing both hacking incidents, and the revelation that Yahoo had been secretly scanning user emails for U.S. intelligence agencies, Verizon reportedly sought a significant discount on its purchase of the company, though the exact figure is currently unknown.\n\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Foreign workers are continuing to make significant employment and job gains over native-born Americans, newly released Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals.\n\nIn December 2018, foreign-born worker employment increased 5 percent compared to the same time last year, adding an additional more than 1,300 workers. Meanwhile, native-born Americans saw an employment increase of only 1.2 percent year-to-year, five times less job growth as their foreign worker competitors.\n\nThe foreign-born workforce — those who are employed and looking for work — also had sharply higher gains than native-born Americans. Last month, the number of foreign-born workers in the labor force increased 4.5 percent. At the same time, native-born Americans in the labor force increased only 1 percent.\n\nForeign-born workers' unemployment rate has dropped five times as much as native-born Americans' unemployment rate.\n\nIn December 2018, foreign-born workers unemployment rate fell 13 percent compared to the same time the year before. Native-born Americans, meanwhile, fell only 2.6 percent year-to-year.\n\nThe foreign-born labor participation rate increased about 1.1 percent last month while native-born Americans' labor participation rose less than 0.5 percent.\n\nThe fast-growing employment of foreign-born workers over American citizens — which was evident in November 2018 as well — is exacerbated by the country's wage-crushing national immigration policy whereby about 1.5 million mostly low-skilled legal and illegal immigrants are added to the U.S. population every year.
Italian authorities have managed to detain around 1,500 illegal migrants at the eastern border following the tougher border controls enacted by populist Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini last year.\n\nSalvini, who acts as Minister of the Interior, set up the tougher controls along the eastern border near the city of Trieste last year with support from the governor of Friuli, Massimiliano Fedriga. Police managed to catch 1,494 illegal immigrants trying to cross into Italy via the old Balkan route, Il Giornale reports.\n\nA total of 3,975 patrols were able to check 17,604 vehicles and identify 55,276 people, with 300 of the identified illegal migrants being sent directly back across the border to Slovenia.\n\nOf the total migrants detained at the border, 95 were arrested on various charges, including 29 who were arrested and charged with aiding people-smuggling efforts. The number of illegals stopped at the border in 2018 is triple the number for the previous year and the number of arrested traffickers doubled overall.\n\nBoat Migrants Down 80 Percent in Populist Italy, up 350 Percent in Socialist Spain https://t.co/V2uBtPajYg — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 1, 2018\n\nThe number of migrants is said to have increased since last May, with most migrants originating from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Several other nationalities were also present, however, including Syrians, Iraqis, Turks, and Bangladeshis.\n\nThe figures mark the latest success for Salvini, who made it a campaign promise to greatly reduce the number of illegal crossings into Italy. Reports revealed that following his policy to turn away migrant transport NGO vessels the number of illegal migrants entering the country was reduced by up to 80 percent by July of last year.\n\nAnother report released over the weekend showed that the number of drownings in the Mediterranean Sea had also dropped, despite alarms from migrant transport NGOs that drownings would increase under the new policy. Figures from the UNHCR showed there to have been 2,269 migrants deaths at sea in 2018, down from 3,139 the previous year.
The city of Laredo, Texas, is becoming a turnstile for Cubans seeking asylum in the U.S. Hundreds of Cuban refugees coming from Central America to Mexico are being passed through into Texas will little, if any, screening. Hispanics in South Texas appear to be resenting the special treatment of the Cubans.\n\nBreitbart Texas reported on Saturday that thousands of Cubans who have been stranded in Costa Rica since Nicaragua closed its border to the refugees are now being flown directly to Nueva Laredo, Mexico. At that point they can easily cross into Texas and apply for adjustment to their alien status. Once this happens, they are free to travel across the United States and are immediately eligible for government benefits.\n\nThe numbers of Cubans crossing into Texas is rising on a daily basis, according to the New York Times' Julia Preston. The hundreds of Cuban refugees seem to get little, if any, screening. Once they cross the border, they are processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and released within hours, the article states.\n\nTensions appear to be rising in the South Texas border city. Congressman Henry Cuellar told the New York reporter, The people here are starting to feel resentment. They are asking, is it fair that the Cubans get to stay and the Central Americans are being deported?\n\nOfficials from the City of Laredo have warned the Cubans not to be loitering in town.\n\nWe make everyone from Central America wait in line, while the Cubans walk in even though they are not refugees, Gabriel Lopez, a Mexican-American Navy veteran who is president of the group of veterans who have been protesting the Cubans in Laredo, told reporters. We are saying, don't open the borders to Cubans and give them instant benefits while we have American veterans living on the streets.\n\nBreitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported the spike in Cubans heading for Texas appears to be a direct result of the President's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Castro-lead government in Cuba. Cubans fear the special adjustment in immigration afforded to them under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 may soon come to an end and they would then be treated like any other illegal alien.\n\nThe rumors are unfounded, Alan Bersin, assistant homeland security secretary, told Preston in an interview. The Cuban Adjustment Act is still in effect and is part of the overall immigration policy and there is no intent presently to change that.\n\nWhile the Cubans appear to receive routine criminal and terrorism background checks that anyone else crossing the border might go through, there are no medical checks or immunization requirements Preston reported.\n\nBob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

Controversial addition to the Grassroots Out rally, George Galloway, has ripped into the childish and tabloid BBC for asking him to come into studio to discuss the European Union, but then launching a personal 'gotcha' attack on him demanding he defend his appearance at the event.\n\nMr. Galloway was invited to appear on today's Daily Politics show on BBC2, but alleges he was misled by producers. He told interviewer Jo Coburn:\n\nNot for the first time, you've misled me by asking me to come in and talk about the referendum but instead wanting to talk about me… If you had told me that I was coming in to discuss me, I would have said there are much bigger issues that the British public are occupied by than six, or however many voxpops you had.\n\nMr. Galloway was the controversial special guest at Friday night's Grassroots Out rally in Westminster. As Breitbart London reported his invitation to address Brexit activists led to a walkout from some members of the audience.\n\nAccording to Nigel Farage the inclusion of Mr. Galloway was a way to reach certain parts of the British public that no UKIPer, Tory, or even Kate Hoey-esque Labourite can reach that might not make everyone on stage or in the audience comfortable but is nevertheless one way for the Leave campaign to reach certain people especially since the long-standing anti-EU Jeremy Corbyn has been stifled by his union paymasters.\n\nHaving tried to get back to subject of the referendum Mr. Galloway was again challenged to defend his appearance by Ms. Coburn. He refused to indulge the question, declaring:\n\nI don't want to defend me at all. You're not my judge, you're not fit to be my judge.\n\nMs. Coburn did not leave her line of questioning there, leading to Mr. Galloway describing it as such childish discourse. For him, the question of the European Union (EU) is bigger than all issues affecting the lives, the future, of all of our people, for the rest of time.\n\nMore than halfway through the interview Mr. Galloway was exasperated to note that he still had not been asked his opinion of the EU, at which point Ms. Coburn returned to the personal line of questioning. He said:\n\nPlease stop this, please stop this. You misled me into coming in here today and every question you have asked has been about me. I'm campaigning amongst my one million followers on social media, on the radio, on television, on platforms, on the streets, for Britain to leave for a series of important reasons to which you have not yet turned.\n\nChallenged by the interviewer, when have you ever not wanted to talk about you?, Mr. Galloway replied:\n\nBecause it's so childish, it's so tabloid, it's so Daily Mail.\n\nTowards the end of the short interview he was able to state his case for Brexit, stating:\n\nI am convinced that Britain should leave. So is Boris Johnson for his own reasons, so is Nigel Farage for his own reasons… Because I believe in democracy.\n\nI believe that Britain should control its own events. Who comes into our country, who can be told to leave our country, what our foreign policy should be, what our economic policy should be, should be decided by the British people in a British parliament.\n\nIt's not rocket science.
WASHINGTON (AP) — As the stock market convulses, airline schedules buckle and businesses worry their overseas supply lines will snap, President Donald Trump is looking on the sunny side of an economy clouded by the coronavirus.\n\nFor several weeks he's played down the consequences of the public health emergency even as his agencies scramble to manage it. Now he's suggesting that a robust jobs report might be explained in part by the prospect that Americans are hunkering down and focusing more of their spending in their own country. There's no evidence that the virus has juiced jobs.\n\nTrump's plentiful and sometimes inaccurate comments on the outbreak this past week prompted the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., to suggest that Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stand back and let the experts do the talking. Trump paid that advice no heed.\n\nA sampling of the past week's rhetoric on the virus and other matters and how it compares with the facts:\n\nCORONAVIRUS\n\nTRUMP: We're going to have Americans staying home instead of going and spending the money in other countries. And maybe that's one of the reasons the job numbers are so good. — remarks to the press Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That is not one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.\n\nThe government's report Friday showing employers added a healthy 273,000 jobs last month was compiled before the coronavirus had spread through multiple states.\n\nEven so, the report showed employment at hotels was flat. Restaurant hiring jumped by more than 50,000, but most economists attributed that to relatively warm weather. Now, with many businesses restricting their employees' travel, airlines are already getting hit: United Airlines said Wednesday it has instituted a hiring freeze.\n\nTrump is probably correct that fewer Americans will go abroad and spend money while the outbreak is active. The flip side is that fewer foreigners may come to the U.S. and spend their money here.\n\n___\n\nWHITE HOUSE: The President is no longer traveling to Atlanta today. The CDC has been proactive and prepared since the very beginning and the President does not want to interfere with the CDC's mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency. — statement Friday about Trump's planned visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, the White House rationale for canceling the trip was contradicted a short time later by Trump, who said he postponed because a CDC employee in Atlanta was thought to have contracted the infectious disease and because of the one person, they didn't want me going. It was not about staying out of the way of CDC employees,\n\nHe said it turned out that the person was not infected. He visited the CDC after all.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: A lot of people will have this, and it's very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don't even see a doctor … So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better. – Fox News interview Wednesday.\n\nTRUMP: I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News. — tweet Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He seems to be suggesting that people with COVID-19 can go to work if they have minor symptoms, contradicting the guidance of his federal health officials. Regardless of how sick people may or may not feel, people are advised to stay home.\n\nThe CDC states that people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who do not need hospitalization should restrict their activities and stay home except to get medical care.\n\nDo not go to work, school or public areas, it states.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on developing tests for coronavirus in patients: The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. — Wednesday at the White House.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The last administration asserted FDA jurisdiction over testing and the development of tests like this. … The president changed that on Saturday so that now, as I spoke to several governors this morning, the states now have the ability to actually conduct the coronavirus test in state labs, university laboratories. — Wednesday at the White House.\n\nTRUMP: And now we have tremendous flexibility. Many, many more sites. Many, many more people. And you couldn't have had that under the Obama rule, and we ended that rule very quickly. — Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: They're trying to blame Barack Obama for something his administration didn't do.\n\nIt's not true that an Obama-era rule limited laboratories run by companies, universities and hospitals from developing and running tests for the coronavirus during an emergency. No such regulation existed.\n\nThe Trump administration's action last Saturday only undid a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place. The new action lets labs develop and use coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them. Previously, the FDA had only authorized use of a government test developed by the CDC.\n\nFDA guidance drafted during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of so-called laboratory-developed tests, a market traditionally not overseen by the agency. But that guidance was not brought into effect. Even if it had been, it would not have applied to public health emergencies such as the coronavirus.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: We're talking about a vaccine. Maybe a cure is possible. But we're talking about a vaccine and they're moving along very quickly, all of the pharmaceutical companies, are moving along very quickly. — remarks Monday.\n\nTRUMP: The U.S. may have a vaccine relatively soon and something that makes you feel better … sooner. — North Carolina rally Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: That's misleading, given the far more cautious pronouncements of federal public health officials and scientists. They say a vaccine is probably more than a year away at best and there are no special treatments for COVID-19. The notion of a quick cure is not in their vocabulary as they focus on trying to help people avoid getting the disease in the first place.\n\nWhat's actually happening: Studies have begun in COVID-19 patients in parts of the world to see if certain antiviral medications could help treat the infection.\n\nToday, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus, as well as an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola. In the U.S., the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans who were found to have COVID-19 after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan.\n\nIt's not known how soon such studies will answer whether any of the drugs help. And many patients recover without needing any treatment. The biggest concern is how to help the fraction who become severely ill.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: The U.S. is ranked by far No. 1 in the world for preparedness — North Carolina rally.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not by far.\n\nHe's referring to a report coauthored by Johns Hopkins Centers for Health Security. Hopkins experts on Monday said the U.S. got a grade that overall was highest by a few points among a variety of high-income countries that are all at about the same level of preparedness.\n\nBut the report's overall finding: No country is fully prepared for an epidemic or pandemic, cautioned Hopkins' Jennifer Nuzzo, who coauthored the report.\n\nIt's difficult to say from the report that a country that scores two points higher than another is going to fare much better, she added.\n\nIn the U.S., the biggest worry is access to that health care. If fear of the cost of health care is a deterrent, that could create a bad situation where people stay at home, potentially infecting others, she said.\n\n___\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nTRUMP: Preexisting conditions, 100% we take care of. — Fox News town-hall show Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Far from it.\n\nPeople who have medical problems or a history of them are protected in the health insurance marketplace because of Obama's Affordable Care Act, which Trump is trying to dismantle in and out of court.\n\nWhen Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum challenged Trump's familiar and false assurance about preexisting protections, Trump obliquely acknowledged he has not delivered on his promise — and apparently won't before the election.\n\nRepublicans have all pledged that people with preexisting conditions will have their insurance protected, he said, but for that to happen, we have to hold the Senate. We have to get the House. We have to, obviously, keep the White House.\n\n___\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP: We got Choice. Nobody thought we were going to get Choice. They've been trying to get Choice for over 40 years. — Fox News interview Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Yet another false telling of how the program to let some veterans get private health care at public expense came about. It's a staple of his rhetoric. The Choice program was achieved by Obama. Trump expanded some of the conditions for qualifying for it.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Lauran Neergaard, Christopher Rugaber and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck
An amnesty would generate more taxes for the government and more cheap workers for businesses, according to a pitch from a construction executive and various Koch network activists that sidelines the interests of American employees.\n\nStan Marek, the owner of Marek Brothers, a Houston-based construction firm that has employed many illegal migrants, is pushing the ID & Tax Proposal amnesty:\n\nLet's face it: those 11 million [illegal migrants] are not sitting on their duff. They're working somewhere. They may be working under a fake Social [Security Number], they may be working as an independent subcontractor, but they're working and they've got skills. A lot of these workers working in the underground economy, used to work for [construction company] people like me. They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they're 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they're working for cash and not paying taxes.\n\nThe fix is an adult DACA: We know it works because it works for 800,000 people, said Marek, who has long complained about the No-match letters.\n\nThis is crony capitalism … business partnering with government to increase its profits [by cutting Americans' wages] while dumping the costs on taxpayers, responded Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. By legalizing the illegal immigrants, the benefit to employers is greater because there's more of the cost of [cheap labor] immigration that taxpayers can be forced to bear.\n\nMarek's DACA refers to President Barack Obama's 2012 award of work permits to roughly 800,000 young illegal migrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The DACA work-permit giveaway has not been approved by Congress, partly because many millions of Americans are worried about their families' jobs, income, and health in an increasingly elite-controlled economy. It's not amnesty, Marek wrote in 2014. It is a sensible program aimed at identifying people and taxing them for working in the United States. That's the kind of border security we need.\n\nThe corporate demand to hire illegal migrants instead of Americans comes amid a housing boom that could otherwise help pull many sidelined Americans back into jobs and the middle-class. But Marek's video excludes any talk about Americans' current or future role in their own nation's economy.\n\nThe children of migrants are our future workforce, said Marek, as the video shows migrants working in jobs needed by Americans such as cleaning hotel rooms, driving, construction, and laying bricks. The video also shows many jobs where employers prefer to use cheap migrant labor instead of investing in labor-saving machinery. So the video shows migrants cutting weeds with prehistoric tools, milking cows, picking fruit by hand, and delivering food by bicycle.\n\nSeveral investor-funded activists echoed Marek's call for cheap labor in the video.\n\nDeporting illegal migrants would be an economic tragedy, said Daniel Griswold, the immigration policy director at the Koch-funded Mercatus Center. Think of the workplaces that would be disrupted, he lamented.\n\nBecause 95 percent of the undocumented residents in this country are employed, it means that the market can bear it, said Tony Payan, from the James A. Baker Institute at Rice University. I think the immigration system in the United States has a huge gap — we don't have [work] visas for the kinds of workers that our very dynamic economy often needs.\n\nPayan's call for endless visa worker inflows echoes the any willing worker plan pushed by President George W. Bush — and dodges the question of whether the United States should adopt a two-tier society of citizens exploiting powerless foreign workers.\n\nThe video did not mention that companies are free to hire employees away from other companies by offering higher wages and benefits.\n\nThis video sympathy helped Marek and other speakers to offer progressives and government employees a share of the potential benefits from the mass amnesty of illegal migrants.\n\nWe think over half of the undocumented are uninsured, said Ken Janda, an adjunct professor of healthcare management at Rice University. That's a challenge because if they don't have the cash to pay, those costs are shared by the rest of the community. Either tax dollars pay for them, or … those costs have to be pulled out of insurance premiums and insurance dollars from other sources.\n\nThe amnesty pitch was wrapped in a soft-focus video, which portrayed the illegals as the victims, even though the illegals voluntarily enter the United States, break laws, and extract wages away from Americans' labor market. For example, Marek offered sympathy for the poor migrants who accept low wage jobs from construction executives:\n\nThe jefes that run big crews, the labor brokers who violate every principle and law, yeah, they're making a lot of money. But if you take the typical worker out there walking on that truss, that are working as independent contractors, they're living in poverty, most of them. They don't have workman's comp, and if they get hurt most of them are going to just suck it up. If they get hurt, they're going to go to the ER [hospital emergency room]. And if they go to the ER, it's expensive and we have to pay for it.\n\nMarek and his allies repeatedly blamed Americans for not welcoming an uncapped inflow of migrants that would push the Americans out of jobs, cut their wages, spike their housing costs, and crowd their children's' schools.\n\nWe have not given the [illegals] the opportunity or [the] certainty to be able to fully contribute to the country, said Jorge Lima, the senior vice president of policy at the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group. That is not just hurting them, but that's hurting us.\n\nThis is us who becomes the obstacle, said Robert Sanborn, president of Children at Risk. a Houston, Texas, advocacy group for migrants. I worry about all these kids [of illegal migrants] that could be tremendous economic assets for us … they're always going to be underperforming.\n\nOur legal immigration system has failed for years to keep up with the demand of our economy, said Ali Noorani, the president of the National Immigration Forum.Since there are very few legal pathways for people to enter the country, [migrants] make a decision to overstay a visa, to enter without inspection and hence, we're faced with this population of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThe video ignored the impact of the cheap-labor migrant workforce on the employment and income of American workers. In 2018, Breitbart reported:\n\nBlaine Taylor, the whistleblower, said the construction industry in California once offered a starting wage of about $45 an hour in the late 1980s. Fast-forward to 2018 — nearly two decades into when illegal aliens began flooding the industry — he now says that wages have fallen by more than half, standing at just $11 an hour.\n\nTaylor continued:\n\nThe reality is that a person that was hired as a laborer in 1988, I paid $15 an hour and within a month if I could leave him on the job alone, he got $20 an hour. If I hired somebody that already knew how to do certain types of labor or certain types of operations, they would get $20 an hour. Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. And much of that, if they're not being paid by the hour at less than $11 an hour, they're being paid per piece — per piece of plywood that's installed, per piece of drywall that's installed. Now, the subcontractor can circumvent paying them as an hourly wage and are now being paid by 1099, which means that no taxes are being taken out.\n\nMarek's pitch to progressives is the latest example of employers trying to globalize the American labor market so they can hire anybody they want from abroad and break the bargaining position of American workers, said Krikorian. He continued:\n\nThere's not that many unions, generally speaking, but American workers in a tight labor market have bargaining power, even as just individuals. But if the labor market is expanded to include in effect the entire world, then there can never be a tight labor market. It becomes effectively impossible. That puts employers in the driver's seat and takes away any [marketplace] bargaining power that American workers would have, even those who aren't in unions or have any kind of formal organization.\n\nIn a tight labor market, they still have market power [to demand higher wages]; With a globalized labor market, American workers lose that market power, he added.\n\nMany polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first. In April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak? Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.
England's first state-funded Muslim secondary schools – that segregated boys and girls and had books promoting domestic violence and marital rape – is to be taken over by the Government.\n\nThe Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham, which became state-funded in 2001, was put into special measures last summer after the pro-rape texts were found in the institution's library and a child died from an allergic reaction.\n\nIn a report published in May, the inspector Ofsted also identified bullying, said the playground was chaotic, teaching was poor, pupils were not safe and some staff did not know what to do in medical emergencies. The school was given an inadequate judgment, the lowest ranking.\n\nThe damning report also criticised the school's policy of segregating boys and girls, sparking a lengthy legal battle, which is still ongoing. The school attempted to suppress the report's findings with funding from Birmingham city council.\n\nThe appeal court judges were asked last week to make a definitive ruling in the case. If Ofsted wins, up to 20 faith schools that teach boys and girls separately will be reinspected and may have to change their arrangements.\n\nAccording to The Times, Amanda Spielman, chief inspector at Ofsted, has now said the school is to be taken over by an independent academy trust on the orders of the Department of Education.\n\nI am deeply concerned about the idea that total segregation of children within a mixed school is acceptable, she told the paper.\n\nSegregating boys and girls in a mixed school feels as though it is depriving both boys and girls of a big part of the benefits of school.\n\nWe have single-sex schools and I am not challenging that, but the idea that you have a mixed school, and yet you do not have social development, stimulation, all the things that come from mixing the sexes, makes me uncomfortable.\n\nBirmingham city council has said both it and Al-Hijrah's interim executive board were co-operating fully with the Department of Education to find a suitable Academy sponsor for the school.
President Donald Trump told reporters he wants technology companies to import and hire more foreign graduates for prestigious white-collar jobs sought by American graduates.\n\nBut Trump also used the same press conference to celebrate the rising blue-collar wages caused by his Hire American policies in his expanding economy. Those policies are pressuring companies to hire Americans instead of imported visa-workers or cheap illegal migrants.\n\nThe zig-zag policy comes as the rising blue-collar wages boost Trump's Midwest ratings for 2020, while the stalled white-collar salaries hurt his suburban ratings in 2018 and 2020.\n\nIf Trump allows Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Intel, and other leading-edge companies to hire even more foreign graduates, they will hire fewer American graduates and pay them less before the 2020 election.\n\nIt is contradictory that Trump wants to raise wages for American and also bring in more workers who will cut salaries, an American technology professional told Breitbart News. It is political suicide … because the tech workers believed [in 2016] he was the only one who stood up for them, said the professional, who fears he will be blackballed by major companies' subcontractors if his identity is revealed.\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to reform the H-1B program. Since then, business-first appointees in his administration have blocked proposed reforms by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services division of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nCompanies use various visa worker programs to keep roughly 1.5 million non-immigrant foreign graduates in the United States. Many of those foreign workers are employed by small contracting firms to fill a series of short-term contracts, so minimizing the major companies' payroll costs.\n\nTrump's showed his zig-zag policy in the January 4 press conference just after the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that wages rose by 0.4 percent in January, setting the stage for a 4 percent rise in wages throughout 2019. Trump praised the wage growth and the resulting return of sidelined Americans to the job market:\n\nOne of the things that is so beautiful to watch is 3.2 percent wage growth. That hasn't happened in so long for our country. That's an incredible thing. That means people are actually getting more money, taking home more money, and that's something that is really nice to see. A lot of you have been following me when we were on a thing called the campaign — that was an exciting campaign, a great campaign — and I used to talk about wages going down, not going up, but going down for years. Nineteen years. And now they went up 3.2 percent and yet there's no inflation because other things are going down, like the price of your gasoline at the tank. It is low and that doesn't happen by luck. I worked hard on that. That's like a tax cut for people. So a lot of good things are happening. Labor participation rate increased to 63.1 [percent]. That's an incredible number also.\n\nBut Trump also then reversed himself and said companies should be allowed to hire the foreign graduates from U.S. universities:\n\nWe need people. We have to have people because we have all these companies coming in. We need great people. But we want them to come in on a merit basis. They have to come in on a merit basis. They can't come in the way they've been coming in for years. I get calls from the great tech companies and they're saying we don't allow people at the top of their class at the best schools in the country, we don't allow them to stay in our country. So they end up going back to China and Japan and so many other countries all over the world, and we don't keep them. They get educated at our finest schools and then we don't allow them to – through a various set of circumstances — to have any guarantees of staying. So we lose out on great minds. We can't do that. We have companies, if we don't change that, and we're working on that and we discussed that with the Democrats and I think they agree. We're working on that. But we don't want to lose our great companies because we have a ridiculous policy that we won't accept smart people. So call it politically correct or not, but we have to let these great, brilliant companies have the smartest people in the world.\n\nThe 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty included a stealth provision which allowed companies to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates of U.S. universities. If that plan had been implemented, U.S. employers and universities would have permanently flooded the white-collar labor market with millions of very cheap foreign graduates.\n\n\n\nRoughly 1.5 million foreign visa-workers hold college-graduates jobs in the United States via the various H-1B, OPT, CPT, L-1, J-1, E-3, H4EAD, TN, and O-1 visa programs. Companies are allowed to hire these foreign workers no matter how many young Americans are applying for the same jobs.\n\nDespite corporate claims, the vast majority of these foreign workers are lower-skill graduates performing starter jobs that could help Americans launch their careers. In fact, the huge H-1B and OPT programs have created an army of staffing contractors which is used by many Americans companies to lock many American graduates out of starter jobs in software, science, and engineering.\n\nWorse, these foreign workers — most of whom are employed as contractors by little-known foreign-0wned staffing companies — usually accept lower wages than Americans because they hope to be paid by winning the hugely valuable deferred bonus of green cards from the U.S. government. Americans cannot get that federal bonus because they are already citizens.\n\nMany of the foreign workers are mid-tier graduates doing work that can be easily accomplished by experienced U.S. graduates.\n\nOnly a small percentage of the visa workers are elite people who cannot be replaced even if U.S. companies tried to hire similar American experts away from other Americans companies.\n\nSome of these elite workers are imported via the 0-1 visa program which has no cap. The O-1 visa rules say:\n\nThe O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics … … To qualify for an O-1 visa, the beneficiary must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.\n\nThe companies' demand to hire the best foreign graduates is belied by their mass hiring of lower-skill and mid-tier foreign graduates, said the U.S. professional. If the best-ranked foreign graduates are really that good, they can meet the O-1 requirements, he said, adding they are not the best and brightest … [because companies] want the indentured workforce and the cheap labor.\n\nIn 2016 testimony to the Senate, Howard University professor Ron Hira testified that:\n\n41 percent of the [H-1B] workers approved [in 2015] by the government were at wage Level 1 [which is defined as] a basic understanding of the occupation. These employees perform routine tasks that require limited, if any, exercise of judgment … Level I wages are typically 40% below the average wage. Almost another forty percent of approved H-1B applications were at second lowest wage level, Level II, which is typically 20% below the average wage for Americans in those occupations. So, nearly 4-in-5 H-1B applications were approved by the U.S. Department of Labor for the lowest two wage levels, providing large discounts to employers.\n\nThe companies' massive use of H-1B workers can be tracked at H1Bfacts.com, MyVisaJobs.com, and at some government sites. For example, Google sought to hire 4,875 H-1B workers in 2018, sponsored 764 other foreign employees for green cards, and employed 1,501 foreign OPT workers in 2017, even as top managers developed plans to block conservatives' use of the Internet.\n\nThe 1.5 million foreign workers are heavily used by major technology companies and many software companies, banks, insurance companies, universities, consulting companies, accountancy, and engineering firms. The employers are concentrated in California, Texas, and New York, but are also used through the country. For example, many visa workers are being used by banks and insurance companies in Connecticut and North Carolina, even as middle-aged U.S. workers are being fired.\n\nExecutives at brand-name companies, including the fiercely-anti-Trump executives at the information technology companies, are pleading with Trump to let them import more workers, and are fighting against plans to eliminate the H4EAD visa-worker program for 100,000 spouses of visa workers.\n\nTech Billionaires urge fast-track green cards for 400,000 contract visa-workers – and many more later. Just guessing here, but maybe most Americans prefer fewer visa workers for biz & higher salaries for their families? https://t.co/yXhMswXOXK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 8, 2018\n\nTheir pleas come as rising salaries eat into corporate profits and stock values. In January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that salaries for information workers rose by 5.7 percent from December 2017 to December 2018. That rate was much higher than the 3.2 percent rise for all workers.\n\nThese visa worker programs are little recognized by most voters but are very unpopular among white-c0llar professionals who have seen their colleges get replaces by foreign workers. That unpopularity helped defeat Kansas GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder in November after he alienated college graduate voters in his suburban district by supporting a back-door country caps expansion of the visa worker programs.\n\nGOP Reps. are still pushing Rep. Yoder's middle-class outsourcing bill to put 600K Indian visa-workers & families on fast-track to US jobs/voting. It would help CEOs import more Indians for US college-grad jobs – w/o any benefit for US workers or even GOP. https://t.co/LD8q3SjYRg — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 3, 2018\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
A Mexican national who was deported three times pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from an undercover DEA sting.\n\nOn January 18, triple deportee Saul Bustos-Bustos, 38, and Irepan-Juanchi-Salgado, also from Mexico pleaded guilty to federal drug charges after a sting on November 28, 2017.\n\nAccording to a recent release from the United States Department of Justice, Bustos-Bustos and Juanchi-Salgado pled guilty in January for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine.\n\nAccording to court records, both defendants met with an undercover DEA Agent in Miami on November 28, 2017, with the intention of selling five kilograms of crystal methamphetamine for the agreed price of $14,500 per kilo. The deal and subsequent meeting were set up during an undercover phone call between the DEA agent and the brother of Irepan-Salgado who was identified as Luciano Salgado, a meth-dealer in Georgia and New York. Luciano Salgado negotiated the wholesale price with the undercover DEA agent and then directed him to complete the transaction with Irepan-Salgado.\n\nWhile at the meeting location, the transaction was completed after both defendants transferred the drugs from their vehicle to the undercover officer's. Both defendants were subsequently arrested.\n\nAccording to the press release, Bustos-Bustos also pled guilty to illegal re-entry after being previously being deported at least three times. Records indicated that Bustos-Bustos was deported on April 13, July 6, and July 19, 2017.\n\nBustos-Bustos and Juanchi-Salgado face potential prison sentences of up to life imprisonment, to be followed by supervised release terms of at least five years on their respective narcotics convictions. Bustos-Bustos also faces a maximum term of three years imprisonment; to be followed by up to three years supervised release for his immigration violation. Bustos-Bustos is scheduled to be sentenced before United States District Judge K. Michael Moore on March 29, 2018. A sentencing date for Juanchi-Salgado has not been set.\n\nThe investigation and prosecutions were carried out by members of the South Florida High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Task Force. The South Florida HIDTA, established in 1990, is made up of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies that, cooperatively target the region's drug-trafficking and money laundering organizations. The South Florida HIDTA is funded by the Office of National Drug Control Policy which sponsors a variety of initiatives focused the nation's illicit drug trafficking threats.\n\nRobert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs.

WASHINGTON—On Monday the Supreme Court threw out a major transgender lawsuit, sending the case back to a lower federal court in light of the Trump administration's rescinding of an Obama policy implicated by the lawsuit.\n\nHigh school student G.G. (later revealed as Gavin Grimm) is a biological teenage girl who calls herself a boy and dresses as a boy, supported in her transgender identity by her mother. They asked her teachers and the staff at her school in Gloucester County, Virginia, to likewise treat her as a male student.\n\nSchool officials tried to accommodate G.G., calling her by her preferred boy's name Gavin, but asked that she use the unisex bathroom in the nurse's office rather than use the boys' bathrooms and locker rooms alongside biological boys and adult men.\n\nEncouraged by her lawyers from the ACLU, G.G. demanded the school allow her to use the boys' bathrooms and locker rooms at the same time that biological males are using those facilities. The school board instead adopted the policy that everyone must either use facilities matching their biological sex or single-person unisex bathrooms.\n\nG.G. sued, arguing that Title IX of federal law requires schools to allow everyone to use whichever facilities they identify with. Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary James Ferg-Cadima from Barack Obama's Education Department agreed with her position.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sided with the Obama administration, holding that the term sex in federal law is ambiguous, and that courts should defer to Ferg-Cadima's private letter as an authoritative declaration of law.\n\nSubsequent to Ferg-Cadima's letter, Obama's Justice Department and Education Department issued a joint Dear Colleague letter as an official policy, declaring that both Title IX and Title VII—which generally prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex—require all schools and employers to embrace transgender policies, and that anyone declining to do so can be sanctioned for violating federal law.\n\nHowever, on Feb. 22, 2017, the Trump administration rescinded the Dear Colleague letter.\n\nEvidently thinking it likely that this policy change nullifies Ferg-Cadima's letter, the Supreme Court has now vacated the Fourth Circuit's decision, sending the case back to the Fourth Circuit for further proceedings.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

The University of Michigan is reviewing 11 female-only programs offered by the institution after they were the focus of a recent Title IX complaint.\n\nTitle IX forbids certain forms of gender discrimination at institutions receiving government funding. According to Mark J. Perry, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, Flint, several female-only programs at the University of Michigan violate Title IX provisions against gender discrimination. Perry's efforts were highlighted in a recent report by the Washington Examiner.\n\nPerry highlighted programs like the Girls Code Camp and The Och Initiative for Women in Finance, Math and Sciences. He argued that the programs are illegally granting preferential treatment for cis women and illegally discriminating against men and gender non-conforming students, faculty and patients.\n\nJust this week, Breitbart News reported that the U.S. Education Department was investigating possible discrimination against men at both Yale University and the University of Southern California. Kursat Christoff Pekgoz, a doctoral student at the University of Southern California, argued that certain female-only programs are unlawful because women make up the vast majority of degree earners.\n\nEarlier this month, Breitbart News reported on Perry's research on the University of Michigan's diversity office. As a part of his investigation into the school's female-only programs and initiatives, Perry found that the University of Michigan's diversity office features almost 100 employees and a payroll of $11 million before benefits.\n\nPerry also notably highlighted a new Stanford policy that bans men from the gym at times during the week. In February, Stanford announced Women's Only Training hours would be offered to help female students feel more comfortable and safe at the gym.
A preview of an interview set to air on Sunday's 60 Minutes that Charlie Rose conducted with Sean Penn was broadcasted on Friday's CBS This Morning. During that preview, Penn discussed his controversial interview with recently captured Mexican drug lord Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.\n\nPenn insisted the motivation for his interview was to spur a conversation about the so-called war on drugs.\n\nThis is somebody who — upon whose interview could I begin a conversation about the policy of the war on drugs. That was my simple idea, Penn said. 'We're going to put all our focus — forget about blame — we're going to put all our focus, all our energy, all our billions of dollars on the 'bad guy,' and what happens? You get another death the next day the same way.\n\nWhen asked if he had any regrets, Penn said that although he didn't regret the interview itself, he regretted it didn't inspire the conversation on the war on drugs and for that, he said the article had failed.\n\nI have a terrible regret … I have a regret that the entire discussion about this article ignores its purpose, which was to try to contribute to this discussion about the policy in the War on Drugs. Let's go to the big picture of what we all want. We all want this drug problem to stop. We all want them — the killings in Chicago to stop. We are the consumer. Whether you agree with Sean Penn or not, there is a complicity there. And if you are in the moral right, or on the far left, just as many of your children are doing these drugs, just as many. And how much time have they spent in the last week since this article come out, talking about that? One percent? I think that'd be generous. My article has failed. Let me be clear, my article has failed.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
Columnist Charles Krauthammer slammed Presidet Obama for going on an ideological holiday trip in Cuba, while the world burns on Tuesday's Special Report on the Fox News Channel.\n\nKrauthammer said, I thought the whole story of this presidency, and its foreign policy, was seen in the split screen. On one side, you had the video footage of the attack in Belgium. This is the real world, and on the other side was Obama, in the fantasy world he inhabits, where Cuba is of some geopolitical significance, in his mind, but none in the real world. If Cuba disappeared tomorrow, in a volcanic eruption…nobody would notice, geopolitically. But Obama had to go, because this is legacy. This is settling the Cold War arguments, of the academic left, of Obama's Columbia University days, the people who worship the Cuban Revolution, the Sandinistas. Obama had his picture taken in front of a relief of Che Guevara, which sort of stated his worldview of his adolescent days, and now he does it as president. And the one hand, is the real threat to the world…this is hair-raising stuff, that the Belgians are completely outmanned. The Europeans have no way of tracking, and that we are completely in the blind. We don't know what we don't know. That's the real world. Obama calls it the JV team. He pretends it's contained and controlled, it is not. Instead, he does this sort of ideological holiday trip in Cuba, while the world burns.\n\nHe added, I don't think a president should cut short his trip, because it is sort of handing over a victory to the terrorists. Moreover, the trip to Argentina is important. … But he should never have been on the trip in the first place, and he needs to make a speech, about world terrorism, and what he's going to do.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Cut tax rates, create cash flow, You've got to allow people to make money, Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX) told Breitbart News this week in an exclusive interview on tax reform.\n\nThe only way we're going to get to four percent growth and to lower unemployment is to allow people to hire people and… hire people when they make money, so you know you gotta begin by cutting the rates, said Williams. He pointed out the use of the term revenue neutral as one that isn't used in the private sector.\n\nThe congressman emphasized the importance of tax reform leading to generating cash flow in the private sector. Give them the tax cuts… let them make money, he said.\n\nGovernment's gotta find a way to reduce the debt, but let Americans cash flow our country. Williams said you do that by doing the things we're talking about, as he referred to his Jumpstart America plan released last summer. He added that he has been talking about tax reform his entire time in congress.\n\nWilliams went on to say:\n\nLet's cash flow the country and then let government get real serious about things like massive cuts in government… let repatriation royalties on drilling on federal lands, more taxpayers, and repatriation, let that begin to be the pay to offset revenue they thought they might lose.\n\nThe American public didn't put us in a $20 trillion dollar debt — the federal government did, he said.\n\nWilliams stated that he wouldn't be opposed to a multiple-step plan so long as government didn't cut rates but then follow up by raising them back up. He specifically mentioned not wanting to see a border tax that raises the rates back up.\n\nThe congressman agreed with the intention floated on Monday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, that a tax plan could pay for itself.\n\nAsked if he expected to see a gap of time between when rates are first cut and when a potential plan would begin to pay for itself, Williams said, I'm sure you might have a dip 'til everybody can begin to believe what we're doing is really true, but it will eventually catch, it will catch up with itself.\n\nThe Texas native is a second generation business owner and has been in business for 45 years. He recounted many trials, such as skyrocketing interest and economic problems of the 1980s, that he said many people haven't experienced what he has.\n\nWhen you turn the economy over to Main Street America and business, the economy grows, but the way we are going now, we can never catch up with the spending… We gotta quit spending. Quit spending, that's what businesses do, that's what families do, and we need to do that in federal government, the congressman said.\n\nRepealing the inheritance death tax is one of eight points in Williams' own Jumpstart America tax plan. While he said it is not a make-or-break, he brought up when the U.S. House had passed legislation to repeal the death tax, but it stalled in the U.S. Senate. Having experience with the tax himself, he said, an asset doesn't mean you have cash and people have already paid taxes on this.\n\nWe've done studies and we've seen studies and if you do away with the inheritance tax you can add hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and the reason being is because some people are saving money each month to pass to their kids or maybe they have an insurance policy they make a premium on. If you do away with the inheritance tax they don't need to save the cash, they don't need to make the insurance premium, they can build their home, they can give to their church, they can build their business and pass net worth onto the next generation. And isn't that what we should do in America instead of passing cold cash down or insurance policy? Let's pass net worth on.\n\nHe spoke of how the inheritance tax hurts the ability of families to carry on a family businesses.\n\nWilliams said that he has not seen any official plan being worked on by House Republican Leadership or the White House, but he has offered his input to the Trump Administration. He noted that he had also testified for the Ways and Means Committee, chaired by his good friend Rep. Kevin Brady, about the Jumpstart America tax plan.\n\nThe congressman did say that he hears some of what Ways and Means is talking about for a tax plan and some of it scares me. He later adjusted the use of the term scares to mean disagree with. Asked what items those include he quickly cited the border tax, The border tax I disagree with. That's a tax increase. He said that tax raises the cost of goods and services to the consumer. He also wants to see businesses to be able to interest expense.\n\nHe added that to the best of his knowledge his plan is the only one out there getting any traction.\n\nAsked about a timeline for a tax reform package to be completed, Williams strongly cautioned against putting a timeline on such a package as was done recently with attempts to pass healthcare reform. He did however, saythe end of the year is a very realistic timeline for a package to be completed.\n\nTo me this should, if sold right, be an easier sell than healthcare because a lot of people understand this, said Williams, adding it could be made retroactive for the 2017 tax year.\n\nBut we need to get it right, said Rep. Williams. He again mentioned the border tax among other items that he said, is not something I can support, but I can support supporting small business, giving an opportunity to cash flow with the understanding that government would do their thing. He said he wants to see government get smaller and curb spending.\n\nWilliams was asked about other points of his Jumpstart America tax reform plan such as preserving LIFO accounting and allowing for 100% expensing of fixed asset purchases. He said 100% expensing would not affect everyone, but would help the economy as people are freed up to buy more things. On LIFO, he noted that for years the Obama Administration said the LIFO carry forward as money, but countered that it is a legitimate tax issue that if hit at around 40%, most businesses would not have the cash and it would hurt Main Street America.\n\nHe added that among the things that concern him are, I have a concern that there's talk about taking companies from cash accounting to accrual accounting.\n\nHe said it seems like government is always penalizing people.\n\nWilliams was asked if passing tax reform would take away some of the uncertainty in not knowing what tax changes may come. He responded, We need some certainty, but it's got to be the right kind of certainty. He said you can't cut people's taxes in one place and raise it in another, or take away the way they've accounted for their business for 40-50 years.\n\nHe suggested to pass tax reform and let Main Street America run with it, while the government finds other revenue sources, cuts the size of government, just like every home does, just like every business does when they have a shortage.\n\nI think President Trump, he thinks in those terms, because we're business people, said Williams. And this is a business that has 50 small businesses, has 300 million customers, why don't we try to take care of them?\n\nWilliams said that he hopes the White House tax reform framework set to come out on Wednesday is reflective of what he's saying about tax reform.\n\nWe need to get it right. We don't need to be in a hurry. We need to get it done this year.\n\nHe said that if the federal government could cut personal and corporate tax rates and allowed 100% expensing of fixed assets for businesses, that would be a good start.\n\nIt doesn't have to be done in a chunk, but we we do need to cut rates, we need to, I think 100% expensing is important, he said, re-emphasizing the importance of not placing an added burden on taxpayers.\n\nCongressman Williams is now serving his third term as a member of the Financial Services Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. His eight point tax plan Jumpstart America includes: personal tax brackets cut to 20% and 30%, corporate tax rate lowered to 20%, repatriation tax holiday at 5% rate, payroll tax cut for employers and employees of 2%, cut the Capital Gains and Dividends tax to 15% or 0%, eliminate the Inheritance tax, make bonus depreciation permanent at a 100% level and keep LIFO Accounting. Williams represents Texas' 25th congressional district. He was previously appointed as Texas Secretary of State by then Gov. Rick Perry. He also served as regional finance chairman for then Gov. Bush in 1994 and 1998 and North Texas Chairman for the 2000 and 2004 Bush/Cheney presidential campaigns.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana
Presidents Day 2015 comes in the midst of an upheaval about the state of U.S. foreign policy, and particularly regarding the State of Israel, whose Prime Minister will arrive in two weeks to deliver what will amount to a rebuke of President Obama's negotiating stance on Iran. As this particular holiday lends itself to ranking the presidents from best to worst, it is worth considering how they compare on relations with Israel, which has been–despite ups and downs–a staunch ally since 1948.
Hungary become the first European Union member state to join the new International Religious Freedom Alliance launched by U.S. President Donald Trump, announced Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó on Wednesday.\n\nWe are proud that Hungary became the first European country to join the new international alliance set up by the United States, he said. The organization — a network of like-minded countries fully committed to advancing freedom of religion or belief around the world — held its inaugural meeting Wednesday in Washington, DC.\n\nWhile left-wing economist Jeffrey Sachs was berating the Trump administration for its unilateralism in the Vatican at the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was chairing the Washington inaugural event with representatives of the 26 countries that have joined the new international alliance.\n\nHungary shares the conviction of the new alliance that more must be done to protect members of religious minority groups and combat discrimination and persecution based on religion and does not accept that international organizations turn a blind eye to the persecution of Christian communities around the world, Szijjártó said.\n\nHungary has been a Christian state since its foundation more than a thousand years ago and as such carries a responsibility for persecuted Christian communities around the world, Szijjártó said, while noting that Hungary has provided 50 million dollars of aid to communities in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nLast fall, Hungary hosted its second international conference on aid to persecuted Christians, emphasizing the need to assist the faithful where they are rather than encouraging them to abandon their homelands.\n\nAt that conference, Szijjártó noted that Christianophobia is the last acceptable form of discrimination in the world.\n\nWhen I go to my monthly meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union, Szijjártó said, they tell me not to mention Christian communities because it is discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the EU presses for its 'Global Compact for Migration' as if mass migration were a good to be encouraged, Szijjártó said.\n\nBut what about the right to national identity, to national security, to culture — fundamental rights never addressed by the Compact, Szijjártó concluded, eliciting a spontaneous round of applause.\n\nLast year, Szijjártó told Breitbart News that Hungary disagrees with the European Union policy of getting rid of national identity and Christian culture.\n\nOur position is no, the European Union can only be strong, and Europe as such can only be strong again, if the member-states are themselves strong, and in order to be strong you need to stick to heritage and you need to be proud of your roots, he said.\n\nAlong with the United States, 26 nations have joined the international alliance: Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Gambia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Togo, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
Saudi Arabia has sentenced a journalist to five years in prison after he insulted the kingdom's rulers on Twitter while supporting the right of women to drive.\n\nAmnesty International reported that the kingdom also issued an eight-year travel ban for Alaa Brinji and fined him 50,000 riyals ($13,300).\n\nThe sentencing of Alaa Brinji to a five-year prison term is utterly shameful. He is the latest victim of Saudi Arabia's ruthless crackdown on peaceful dissent, where the aim appears to be to completely wipe out any and all voices of criticism, declared James Lynch, Deputy Director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Program.\n\nHe added: Putting someone behind bars for peacefully exercising his legitimate right to freedom of expression, and defending the rights of others to do so, is a complete distortion of the very notion of justice. The authorities must ensure his conviction is quashed and release him immediately and unconditionally.\n\nAuthorities arrested him on May 12, 2014, and have kept him behind bars since. They denied him access to a lawyer while in solitary confinement. The Specialized Criminal Court (SCC), Saudi Arabia's counter-terrorism court, convicted Brinji on these charges: insulting the rulers of the country, inciting public opinion, accusing security officers of killing protestors in Awamiyya, ridiculing Islamic religious figures, and violating Article 6 of the Anti-Cyber Crime Law.\n\nAmnesty noted the Saudi kingdom has sentenced many activists and dissidents to lengthy prison terms, and even to death, after grossly unfair trials since 2014.\n\nIn December, journalist Qunan Al-Ghamdi accused the kingdom of promoting extremism and pushing the youth to become criminal murderers in the ranks of ISIS.\n\nOur sons are still marching en masse to become cannon fodder in civil wars and [to serve as] criminal murderers in the ranks of ISIS in every war or terrorist crime around the world, he wrote. [Saudi youths] form the majority in every arena of so-called jihad. The wellsprings of extremism and fanaticism still [exist] everywhere in our country, to the extent that some boys and girls in our schools accuse other boys and girls of heresy or of straying from the right path just for mentioning some pictures [they liked] or some movies they saw.\n\nThe kingdom banned a National Geographic issue in September 2015 for cultural reasons. The publication chose a picture of Pope Francis for the front cover.\n\nSaudi censors might have also seen dangerous implications for the Wahhabi state in how National Geographic framed its coverage, as the cover referred to Francis leading a 'quiet revolution' to reform the Catholic Church, wrote Foreign Policy.
There's a great deal of misinformation surrounding Alison Rapp being removed from her Product Marketing Specialist position at Nintendo of America's Treehouse localization studio.\n\nFollowing an online furor regarding an employee discussing underage pornography working for a corporation that has spent decades marketing itself as a family-friendly company, the controversial Alison Rapp has been terminated. Still — and this is a point that several outlets seem to have missed or rushed to print in order to push a narrative before the facts were established — that's not actually why she was let go.\n\nInstead, Rapp lost her position due to extracurricular moonlighting activities. In a statement made to Mashable, Nintendo clearly states:\n\nAlison Rapp was terminated due to violation of an internal company policy involving holding a second job in conflict with Nintendo's corporate culture. Though Ms. Rapp's termination follows her being the subject of criticism from certain groups via social media several weeks ago, the two are absolutely not related. Nintendo is a company committed to fostering inclusion and diversity in both our company and the broader video game industry and we firmly reject the harassment of individuals based on gender, race or personal beliefs. We wish Ms. Rapp well in her future endeavors.\n\nRapp is crying foul, claiming that moonlighting is supported and even encouraged at Nintendo of America.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/715362408227713025\n\nShe has made no comment on the particulars of the second job she held as being compatible or not with Nintendo's corporate culture, however, which involved racy photo shoots, including one that appears to feature one of her now-former employer's products. She claimed that the work was done anonymously, using a fake name.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alisonrapp/status/715362489441984512\n\nThe claim rings a bit hollow, considering the repeated public teaser images of herself that she posted to social media.\n\nIn the end, Nintendo's decision reflects nothing more than their prerogative when assessing an employee's compatibility with the image they want to present to the world. It's unsurprising that Nintendo as a family-centric brand would want to separate itself from an individual who has claimed that child porn constitutes free speech and believes that sexual consent laws for children should be loosened.\n\nNevertheless, this seems less the result of a harassment campaign than the most obvious result of Alison Rapp being accountable for decisions in her own life, and Nintendo's right to make decisions for their business.\n\nFollow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.
Soaring house prices and crowded cities have combined to convince a clear majority of Australians that the country's immigration push must end.\n\nJust 30.4 per cent of Australians now believe the country needs more people, according to a poll conducted by the Australian National University (ANU).\n\nThis was compared to 69.6 per cent who felt Australia did not need more people, a dramatic increase since a similar poll was done in 2010.\n\nThe collapse in support was most prominent among males with just 32.8 percent supporting a bigger Australia compared to 53.4 percent in the 2010 poll.\n\nMost Australians support the notion of cultural diversity but did not want population growth to come at the expense of the quality of life of the majority, according to the survey.\n\nThe results confirm previous calls by local politicians for the country's conservative coalition government to end mass migration:\n\nEND MASS MIGRATION | Gov, Labor & Greens refuse to acknowledge the dangers of mass migration #auspol MEDIA RELEASE https://t.co/LScQyndXAP pic.twitter.com/9zQeTzLtd5 — Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) October 20, 2017\n\nLead researcher Nicholas Biddle said that crowded cities and the high cost of housing were the most common reasons given for not increasing Australia's population.\n\nNearly nine out of 10 people nominated the cost of housing being too high as a reason for not increasing Australia's population, while 84 per cent of people said that cities are too crowded and there is too much traffic, he said in a media statement.\n\nThe policy and social context will always influence Australians' views on population growth. Most people are now supportive of cultural diversity as a by-product of population growth.\n\nOn the other hand, geopolitics, defence and population pressures overseas are less likely to factor into someone's decision than they might have in the past.\n\nAustralia's population growth is the largest it has experienced since colonisation.\n\nIn 1981 the Australian population was around 14.9 million people. By June 2018 it had reached 25.0 million, with the last five million of that growth occurring since December 2004.\n\nLast year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he intended to cut Australia's permanent migration intake by about 30,000 people, citing public concern about congested cities.\n\nThey are saying: enough, enough, enough, Mr Morrison told the 2018 Bradfield Oration in November.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has intensified an assault on all human rights against every group and individual in China, Britain's Conservative Party Human Rights Commission has alleged in a report, which claims to show evidence that the actions carried out by the regime are indicative of the crime of genocide.\n\nIn the report, The Darkness Deepens: The Crackdown on Human Rights in China 2016-2020 — an advance copy of which was seen by Breitbart London — the Commission detailed the stunning growth of authoritarianism in China carried out by the dictatorship in Beijing.\n\nThe report documented the implementation of mass surveillance systems, mass instances of modern-day slavery, torture, organ harvesting, the dismantling of promised freedoms in Hong Kong, and the crimes committed against ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang.\n\nThe Commission said that evidence shows that between one and three million Uyghur Muslims have been detained in concentration camps in the Western Chinese province of Xinjiang, known also as East Turkestan by the local inhabitants.\n\nEvidence presented to the Commission demonstrated the mass internment, forced labour, torture, mass surveillance, severe violations of freedom of religion or belief and forced sterilisation in Xinjiang.\n\nDr Joanne Smith Finley, Reader in Chinese Studies at Newcastle University, told the Commission of a conversation she had with a Uyghur man in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, on July 18, 2018, who told her that people are taken for small things, not necessarily always because of religious practice.\n\nThe man said that he had never heard of anyone leaving the internment camps, with the exceptions of those who fell ill, saying: Some people were given 'medicine' to change their thinking, 'for their minds'. When this made them mentally ill, only then were they released.\n\nTwo days prior to the conversation, a Han Chinese man — the dominant ethnic group of China — told Dr Smith Finley that detainers are just there to have their thinking changed.\n\nOne Uyghur woman who provided testimony to the Commission said that the CCP was attempting to wipe out three types of Uyghur: intellectuals, the rich, and the religious.\n\nShe said that 15 of her extended family members were interned in the camps for these reasons, including both of her parents, for not cooperating with the Communist Party of China and for performing pilgrimage, being religious, being rich, and having more children.\n\nShe said that one of her family members died as a result of the torture carried out by the communist regime.\n\nMy youngest uncle has two children, and when he and his wife were taken away, the regime took his children away and put them in the children's concentration camps, the woman testified.\n\nSpeaking to the Commission, Dr Adrian Zenz said that by 2019, Xinjiang authorities had planned to subject at least 80 per cent of women of childbearing age in the rural southern four minority prefectures to intrusive birth prevention surgeries (IUDs or sterilisation), with actual shares likely being much higher.\n\nDr Zenz said that between 2015 and 2018, population growth rates fell by 84 per cent in the two largest Uyghur Muslim prefectures, with birth rates continuing to fall. He said that in 2020, one Uyghur region saw an unprecedented near-zero population growth.\n\nThese findings provide the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's policies in Xinjiang meet one of the genocide criteria cited in the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Dr Zenz said.\n\nThe Conservative Party Human Rights Commission added: We believe that the CCP is committing mass atrocity crimes against the Uyghurs and others in [Xinjiang]… and that is evidence indicative of the crime of genocide.\n\nExclusive Video — 'Torture and Rape': Uyghurs in London Protest Communist China's Concentration Camps https://t.co/NOEFHdAqq8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 9, 2019\n\nReligion as a whole has increasingly become a target of the communist regime, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) stating that under Xi Jinping, there has been a new focus on religion at the highest levels of government.\n\nWhile the persecution of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang currently draws the most international attention, the CCP has systematically targetted Buddhists and Falun Gong practitioners as well as Christians, of both Protestant and Catholic denominations.\n\nCSW said that there has been a fresh emphasis placed on the requirement that all religious communities in China 'sinicise' by becoming 'Chinese in orientation' and adapting to socialist society and to bring all religious activities under state control.\n\nThe China Aid Association said that the Chinese Communist Party intends to bring Christianity under the full control of the government.\n\nBoth registered and unregistered Protestant churches have been individually and collectively penalised for peaceful religious activities, the CSW said.\n\nRegistered churches under the Three-Self Patriotic Movement have been forced to sing national and pro-Communist songs during services, to fly the national flag and remove religious images. Across the country, churches have had their crosses removed, and many report that under-18s are now banned from attending religious activities, the Christian human rights group added.\n\nChristian Solidarity Worldwide also told the Commission that so-called unregistered churches have been forcibly shut by the government, with their property confiscated by the state and their leaders have been subject to detention and even sentenced to prison terms.\n\nFalun Gong, a spiritual Chinese religious movement in the Buddhist tradition, was outlawed by the CCP in 1999, with the government classifying the religion as an evil cult, prompting decades of persecution from the state.\n\nI have to make it very clear the Falun Gong is an evil cult, then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the architect of the Tiananmen Square massacre, said in 2001.\n\nThe Falun Dafa Association UK told the Commission that while it is unknown how many Falun Gong practitioners have disappeared in the country, they believe the number is in the tens of thousands. The group said that many of the missing Falun Gong members are believed to have met horrible deaths as a victim of state-run organ harvesting.\n\nChina Is Like 'Nazi Germany', Say British MPs Who Allege Systematic 'Ethnic Cleansing' of the Uyghurs https://t.co/5Mbfux6kFK — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 11, 2020\n\nThe Independent Tribunal into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience — known as the 'China Tribunal' — established by British barrister Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, has estimated that there are between 60,000 to 90,000 organ transplants carried out per year in China.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that in 2017, there were only 5,146 eligible registered donors, representing an incomprehensible gap between the number of registered operations and the true number, meaning that it is likely the gap was filled by forced organ transplants.\n\nWhile the Tribunal stopped short of accusing the regime of genocide, the report said the Tribunal has no doubt whatsoever that physical acts have been carried out that are indicative of the crime of genocide, specifically in the case of Falun Gong practitioners and the Uyghurs.\n\nAside from being subjected to internment in concentration camps, torture, and forced organ harvesting, the Commission reports that Uyghurs have been used as modern-day slaves on a massive scale by the CCP.\n\nThe report cited a 2020 study from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which found that Uyghurs have been used as slave labour in factories that supply at least 83 well-known global brands. The ASPI estimated that between 2017 and 2019, alone, over 80,000 Uyghurs were shipped out of Xinjiang to work in factories across China.\n\n'Setback for the Free World': EU Trade Deal with Communist China Draws Harsh Criticism https://t.co/CktU0dsAnG — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 5, 2021\n\nIn oral testimony provided to the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the two authors of the Australian study, Vicky Xiuzhong Xu and Nathan Ruser, said that it is a policy of the central government to send Uyghurs to other provinces to work in factories.\n\nThey claimed that the government has embarked on a campaign that sees tens of thousands of people pushed out of their homes every year and sent to eastern provinces to work in supply chains of international brands, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei, Nike, Samsung, Sony, and Volkswagen.\n\nThe Uyghur workers are then allegedly forced to attend Mandarin Chinese language classes and political indoctrination classes and are monitored by guards in the factories who report daily on the thoughts of the Uyghurs and guard against spontaneous mass instances.\n\nThe Commission called on the British government to end all goods imported from China found to be using slave labour and to introduce sanctions on businesses found to be involved in the modern slave trade.\n\nSir Iain Duncan Smith MP, the former leader of the Conservative Party, said: The UK Government must lead the free world by sending a clear message that China must stop these abusive behaviours.\n\nExclusive: 'Freedom and Autonomy in Hong Kong is Dead' Says HK Watch Founder https://t.co/Xksx9OY0pd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 28, 2020\n\nThe Commission also went onto accuse the Chinese Communist Party of committing a grave violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, the treaty between the CCP and the UK following the 1997 handover of the former British colony.\n\nWith the introduction of the draconian national security law, which the Commission noted was fast-tracked by the regime in Beijing without any scrutiny, debate, or accountability, the CCP has infringed on the basic rights and freedoms guaranteed to the city under the Joint Declaration.\n\nThe report claimed that in the brutal crackdown of the pro-democracy movement in the city, police brutality has become persistent, widespread, systematic and has been carried out with impunity.\n\nThe mass arrests against the pro-freedom movement have seen over 10,148 people in Hong Kong detained, with over 2,300 charged, according to the report.\n\nIn testimony provided to the Commission, The Democratic Party of Hong Kong alleged that cases of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment were commonly seen during the protests carried out by the Hong Kong Police Force.\n\nThe Progressive Lawyers Group also reported of abuses committed against arrestees during police custody, including physical abuses (eg severe beatings resulting in hospitalisation), sexual assaults and obstruction of legal access.\n\nProfessor Victoria Tin-bor Hui, an associate professor in political science at the University of Notre Dame, said that the arrest of the founder of the Democratic Party, Martin Lee, alongside 14 other in April of last year should send the unmistakable signal that Beijing is reaching the end goal of its version of 'one country, two systems' — capitalism without freedom — on Hong Kong.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: UK Consulate Employee Kidnapped by Chinese Communist Party Speaks to Breitbart https://t.co/P6JbpMODX6 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 9, 2020\n\nThe Commission noted that while the world has increasingly focussed on the oppression carried out in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, it is vital we do not forget Tibet.\n\nAccording to testimony submitted from the Tibet Post International, Tibet has fewer foreign journalists than in North Korea and Reporters Without Borders lists Tibet 176th out of 180 on its Press Freedom Index.\n\nThe report said that since 2016, the repression in Tibet has continued and intensified, resulting in the further detention of monks and nuns and severe restrictions on freedom of expression and belief as well as on other human rights.\n\nEvery aspect of Tibetan life is under siege and Tibetans have even fewer civil and political rights than Chinese people also ruled by the Communist Party. The regime enforces its control over every aspect through the threat and use of arbitrary punishments, at times including severe violence. Any act deemed to threaten its rule becomes a criminal offence, Tibet Post International told the Commission.\n\nProfessor Dibyesh Anand, the head of the School of Social Sciences at the University of Westminster and an expert on Tibet, said that organised protests have become impossible due to heavy surveillance, with cameras observing every house.\n\nAnand said that as a result, self-immolations continue because other gatherings are not allowed. He noted, however, that news of ritual suicides is often suppressed and said that entire villages are punished as a result.\n\nSince 2009, at least 155 Tibetans have self-immolated (set themselves on fire), according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nFarage: 'The Chinese State Has Conducted Murder on a Vast Scale' https://t.co/v72JKC2qQF — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 21, 2020\n\nWriting in the Spectator, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission and founder of Hong Kong Watch, Benedict Rogers, said that the Beijing dictatorship's development and deployment of mass surveillance technologies lie at the heart of its intensifying repression.\n\nChina's technology companies are at the very centre of this operation, Rogers added, with the report pointing to Chinese tech companies such as Huawei, which has been accused of being involved in the mass surveillance of Xinjiang.\n\nDr Yang Jianli of the NGO Initiatives for China told the Commission: China's weapons of mass surveillance have already shown its ability to exert absolute control of populations… The system uses cutting-edge technologies to control almost every aspect of people's lives.\n\nIn response to the report, the last Governor of Hong Kong and a former Chairman of the Conservative Party, Lord Patten of Barnes, said it demonstrated a terrifying view of the cruelty of Xi Jinping's brutal regime.\n\nTo try to preserve its grip on power the Chinese Communist Party has assaulted any sign of dissent and has set about building a totalitarian surveillance state beyond George Orwell's imaginings, he said.\n\nThe report demonstrates exactly why we must be on our guard in democracies to protect our freedoms and values, Lord Patten concluded.\n\nTom Tugendhat MP, the chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said: The use of abhorrent practices such as the imprisonment and torture of dissidents, mass surveillance, organ harvesting, and the use of slave labour shows the Chinese Communist Party for what it is.\n\nIt is clear that the Golden Era is over and the UK, and our allies, need to rethink our relations with China's dictatorship.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: UK Must Not Be 'Bullied' by Chinese Communist Party, Says Last British Governor of Hong Kong https://t.co/xtvqmosE8E — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulka
The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed a complaint against the state's assault weapons ban on Friday and expressly described similar bans as constitutional.\n\nThe court explained its decision to dismiss the complaint by stating that the AR-15 and its analogs, along with large capacity magazines, are simply not weapons within the original meaning of the individual constitutional right to 'bear arms.'\n\nBecause a ban on the AR-15 and large capacity magazines is, in its opinion, constitutional, the court ruled that the question of whether a ban exists is one to be decided by legislatures, not judges.\n\nThe court added:\n\nIn the absence of federal legislation, Massachusetts is free to ban these weapons and large capacity magazines. Other states are equally free to leave unregulated and available to their law-abiding citizens. Their policy matters are simply not of constitutional moment. Americans are not afraid of bumptious, raucous, and robust debate about these matters. We call it democracy.\n\nWhereas the District Court says AR-15s and large capacity magazines do not fall within the original meaning of the individual constitutional right to 'bear arms,' Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch used his confirmation to stress that the test for constitutional protections of a given firearm is whether it is in common use.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

This month marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most destructive books of the last century, The Population Bomb, by Paul Ehrlich.\n\nThe 1968 doomsday bestseller generated hysteria over the future of the world and the earth's waning ability to sustain human life, as Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich offered a series of alarming predictions that turned out to be spectacularly wrong, creating the enduring myth of unsustainable population growth.\n\nEhrlich prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans), that already-overpopulated India was doomed, and that most probably England will not exist in the year 2000.\n\nIn conclusion, Ehrlich warned that sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come, meaning an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.\n\nIf these musings had been received for what they actually were—the wacky theories of a crackpot academic—all would have been well. But The Population Bomb sold some 3 million copies and influenced an entire generation.\n\nIdeas have practical consequences, and Dr. Ehrlich did not leave his followers guessing as to what they ought to be.\n\nIn the course of his illustrious career, Ehrlich has defended mass sterilization, sex-selective abortion, and infanticide. In his call for radical population control, Ehrlich has said he would prefer voluntary methods but if people were unwilling to cooperate, he was ready to endorse various forms of coercion.\n\nTo allow women to have as many children as they want, Ehrlich said, is like letting people throw as much of their garbage into their neighbor's backyard as they want.\n\nThose who had the coercive power to put Ehrlich's theories into practice bear witness to just how horrifying they were.\n\nTo reduce its population, China instituting a draconian one-child policy, which has now left the country (through sex-selective abortions) with a horrific gender imbalance, with yearly births of some 120 boys born for every 100 girls. As a result, 30 million more men than women will reach adulthood and enter China's mating market by 2020.\n\nMany nations—including the United States—began attaching population control measures to aid packages to third-world countries, meaning that the amount of aid received became conditioned by the state's ability to coercively reduce its own population.\n\nThe tragic fact is that as a credentialed scientist—a biologist lecturing at Stanford University—Ehrlich's proclamation of the end times as well as the means to confront them struck many as the plausible theory of an expert.\n\nAs Bill McGurn argues in the Wall Street Journal Monday, in his day, Dr. Ehrlich's assertion about the limited 'carrying capacity' of the Earth was settled science. Never mind that it is rooted in an absurdity: that when a calf is born a country's wealth rises, but when a baby is born it goes down.\n\nA few brave souls resisted the urge to jump on the population explosion bandwagon, urging calm and rationality. One was economist Julian L. Simon, who later noted that whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster.\n\nIn 1981, Simon published The Ultimate Resource, underscoring man's ability to adapt to new circumstances and overcome obstacles through ingenuity and creativity. It is the human mind, rather than coal, trees, or iron, that is the ultimate resource—one that suffers no risk of depletion.\n\nAnother population expert, Fred Pearce, has more recently noted that birthrates are now below long-term replacement levels nearly everywhere, a trend he examined in his 2010 book, The Coming Population Crash and Our Planet's Surprising Future.\n\nThe baffling mystery is how Ehrlich—despite his utterly failed forecasts—can continue to be hailed today as a serious scientist with something important to say to the world.\n\nIn early 2017, the Vatican invited Dr. Ehrlich to speak at an academic conference titled 'Biological Extinction, sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Academy of Science and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nThe conference addressed issues of biodiversity, great extinctions of history, population and demographics, and Ehrlich was invited to speak on Causes and Pathways of Biodiversity Losses: Consumption Preferences, Population Numbers, Technology, Ecosystem Productivity.\n\nThe enduring power of alarmist theories such as Ehrlich's, which somehow survive being exposed as utterly false, should give people pause before embracing similar theories and their practical corollaries, even when based on settled science.\n\nIn a 2015 article, The New York Times observed that worrying about an overcrowded planet has fallen off the international agenda and has now been replaced by climate change and related concerns.\n\nWhile perhaps failing to observe the irony of its own reporting, the Times juxtaposed the thoroughly discredited population explosion theories of the 1970s with the (equally alarmist) global warming predictions of our day.\n\nAs scientists themselves are beginning to recognize, doomsday theories—including those surrounding global warming—must learn to factor in the astounding resilience of human intelligence and the ability of human beings to react to changing scenarios in remarkably ingenious ways.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) faces multiple ethics complaints for threatening Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch on the steps of the high court.\n\nSchumer declared at a Center for Reproductive Rights rally last Wednesday that the two conservative judges will pay the price if they vote against pro-choice advocates in a case regarding a Louisiana abortion law.\n\nOver the last three years, women's reproductive rights have come under attack in a way we haven't seen in modern history. From Louisiana, to Missouri, to Texas, Republican legislatures are waging a war on women, all women, and they're taking away fundamental rights, he warned. I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you, if you go forward with these awful decisions.\n\nFollowing blowback from Republicans, the New York Democrat offered a non-apology, saying he shouldn't have used the words I did while claiming conservatives were manufacturing outrage over the statement.\n\nOn Friday, the National Legal Policy Center filed complaints against Schumer with both the Senate Ethics Committee and New York bar.\n\nIt strains credulity to believe that, regardless of his Brooklyn pedigree, Sen. Schumer, who is a Harvard-educated lawyer, Senator minority leader, and vocal opponent of both Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, did not intend to choose the exact words he spoke as he turned and pointed to the Supreme Court behind him to further emphasize his point, the NLPC's complaint reads. In short, his non-apology is a lame excuse for inexcusable conduct.\n\nThe Landmark Legal Foundation, which is chaired by conservative talk radio host Mark Levin, also submitted a complaint to the upper chamber's ethics panel Thursday.\n\nThe Senate must immediately reprimand, if not censure, Sen. Schumer for his outrageous and dangerous attack on Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, said the complaint, alleging that the lawmaker's comments could amount to improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate.\n\nIn a separate complaint, attorney Joseph Gioconda wrote to New York's Grievance Committee for the Second Judicial District: At a minimum, Attorney/Senator Schumer's statements appear to be improper conduct that reflects upon his character and fitness to practice law in New York.\n\nSchumer's remarks prompted a rare rebuke by Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, who called the New York Democrats' threat both inappropriate and dangerous.\n\nJustices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter, he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also took aim at Schumer, calling for him to face severe punishment.\n\nThis is a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer. If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. Serious action MUST be taken NOW! the president tweeted. There can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a United States Senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced a motion last Thursday to censure Schumer, with the support of 14 other Republican senators.\n\nSenator Schumer has acknowledged that threatening statements can increase the dangers of violence against government officials when he stated on June 15, 2017, following the attempted murder of several elected Members of Congress, 'We would all be wise to reflect on the importance of civility in our [N]ation's politics' and that 'the level of nastiness, vitriol, and hate that has seeped into our politics must be excised,' the resolution reads.
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has introduced a series of sweeping foreign policy bills, including one that would let Congress limit the president's power to place international sanctions and declare national emergencies.\n\nOmar describes the legislative package, titled Pathway to PEACE (Progressive, Equitable, and Constructive Engagement), as a bold progressive vision to rethink the country's approach to foreign policy by centering human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America's engagement in the world, and making military action a last resort in a press release. I believe in a world where there are no young girls living through war, and no nations that are being destroyed, she declared in the statement.\n\nEndless war is not making our country safer. It is costing lives, destroying futures, and damaging our reputation in the world. Today, I'm introducing the #PathwaytoPeace, a new vision for American foreign policy based on peace and diplomacy. https://t.co/TpG8oqk1X7 — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 12, 2020\n\nShe spoke about the bills at a panel discussion on Capitol Hill Wednesday, framing them as a globalized approach to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThese sets of bills are not about a single country or singling out one particular country, said Omar, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It's about setting a common set of standards for the world.\n\nOne of the bills, the Congressional Oversight of Sanctions Act, would give Congress power to limit the executive branch's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare national emergencies and place economic sanctions.\n\nWe need to restore congressional oversight, Omar said. She explained that the bill requires an explanation for what foreign policy goal is supposed to be achieved with the given sanction and what the process for delisting an individual, entity or country should be.\n\nOmar has telegraphed her practical aims for this particular policy. In the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as Iran and Venezuela. Last April, she accused President Trump of declaring a fake emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allowed him to direct funding towards the construction of physical barriers.\n\nThis is a fake emergency! Donald Trump is lying about the border in order to build his monument to racism. https://t.co/hVOVzLYDHw — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) April 3, 2019\n\nOne of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.\n\nAnother bill redirects defense spending – something Omar refers to as military intimidation and coercion – and gives it to the State Department.\n\n[The] Global Peace Building Act… would authorize a one-time transfer of $5 billion dollars from the Pentagon's Overseas Contingency Operation budget to the State Department to create a new multi-lateral peacebuilding fund, she said.\n\nHer press release does not specify this entity's relationship to the United States Institute of Peace, created in 1984 and funded annually by Congress. The institute describes its work as  a vital investment in reducing violent international conflicts that threaten U.S. national security in its latest budget justification letter sent to Congress.\n\nTwo more bills would require the United States to cede authority and sovereignty to global institutions.\n\nOmar called it an international embarrassment that the United States has not signed onto the controversial United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nHowever, that agreement would severely undermine U.S. sovereignty, as explained in a legal white paper from Americans United for Life in 2010:\n\nUnder Article VI of the United States Constitution, all treaties made shall be the supreme Law of the Land. Therefore, ratification of the UNCRC will make the document binding under American law and it would supersede any relevant, existing federal or state laws. This will also ultimately limit United States sovereignty by placing American family law and parental rights under international regulation and scrutiny.\n\nOmar also called on the United States to join the International Criminal Court, a global entity that President Donald Trump blocked from launching an investigation into alleged atrocities committing during the war between 2003 and 2004, including by U.S. troops, Afghan forces, and the Taliban.\n\nTrump has denounced the ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes court, for its 'broad, unaccountable, prosecutorial powers,' Reuters reported. Washington revoked travel visas for ICC personnel in response to its work on Afghanistan.\n\nOmar's press release touts support for the bills from left-wing heavyweights like Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor to Barack Obama.\n\nCongresswoman Omar is putting forward an ambitious and comprehensive package that outlines progressive approaches to some of the most important issues facing the United States and our world today, Rhodes said.\n\nHuman Rights Watch's Andrea Prasow praised Omar as a leader on the subject:  With an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that Congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.\n\nOmar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nMore recently, Omar has been mired in more personal controversies. In late 2019, she filed for divorce from Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her children, amid swirling reports of an affair with Democratic operative Tim Mynett. She is now facing scrutiny for alleged campaign payments to his consulting firm. Likewise, long-simmering questions about her marriage to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009 — which critics have alleged was a marriage to her brother for immigration purposes — have reportedly reached the FBI.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
The National Security Council (NSC) is on track to reach its policy staff reduction goal and may cut even more than originally planned, according to the agency's spokesman.\n\nWe remain on track to meeting the rightsizing goal Ambassador O'Brien outlined in October, and in fact may exceed that target by drawing down even more positions, said NSC spokesman John Ullyot in an email to Breitbart News on Tuesday.\n\nNational Security Adviser Robert O'Brien announced last year in an op-ed that he planned to reduce the size of the NSC's policy staff to under 120 positions by early 2020 — a size more in line with previous administrations before more than doubling under the Obama administration to over 200 staffers.\n\nNSC policy staff are typically filled with staffers from other national security agencies, such as the Pentagon. Their function is to coordinate policy, but increasingly took on policymaking roles under the last administration.\n\nO'Brien told Fox Business Network last week that the size of the NSC will go somewhere in the 115 to 120 area by the end of the week.\n\nDuring that interview, he also said President Eisenhower had 70 NSC policy staffers, and President Kennedy dismissed all of them upon coming into office and replaced them with 12 political loyalists, who did a good job advising him. He said reductions have come through staffers returning to their home agencies.\n\nHe added that this reduction was in the works long before NSC staffers Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his twin brother were removed earlier this month. Vindman testified in the House impeachment inquiry that he reported the president's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president to the NSC general counsel, and likely reported his concerns to the whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment effort.\n\nAs his new national security adviser, I have commenced changes to the National Security Council staff designed to assist the president as he continues to execute his foreign policy vision for the country, O'Brien wrote on October 16, 2019, in the Washington Post. He continued:\n\nCongress created the National Security Council to assist presidents in managing the complexities of this expansion of the federal government. The 1947 law establishing the NSC, which originally consisted of the president, vice president, and the secretaries of state and defense, stated: 'The function of the Council shall be to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security.' The word 'advise' is fundamentally important. While the statutory members of the NSC, in some cases, run departments that execute foreign policy, the NSC staff at the White House was intended to coordinate policy rather than run it. My job as the national security adviser is to distill and present to the president the views and options that come from the various departments and agencies. The NSC then ensures that those agencies actually execute the president's decisions. This is the 'honest broker' model of the national security adviser, best personified by Brent Scowcroft, who held the post during both the Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush administrations. During the Obama administration, the NSC ballooned to well over 200 policy staffers. By comparison, a mere 12 NSC policy staffers helped President John F. Kennedy deal with the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. As President Jimmy Carter handled multiple crises in the late 1970s, the NSC staff totaled just 35 professionals. During the first term of the George W. Bush administration, with two major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underway, the policy staff was about 100 people. After consulting several of my predecessors and analyzing the NSC's current configuration, I have determined that the agency can and should be streamlined, and am in the process of restoring the NSC to its historical mission. With the president's approval, we will reduce the NSC staff, making it more effective by reaffirming its mission to coordinate policy and ensure policy implementation. The NSC staff should not, as it has in the past, duplicate the work of military officers, diplomats or intelligence officers. With that in mind, we will be able to reduce 174 policy positions to under 120 by early 2020.\n\nFollow Breitbart News's Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.
Business-first Republican advocates want the president to trade away his Hire American policy to get border wall funding, while pro-American advocates say he can win by trading concessions in healthcare, trade, and infrastructure.\n\nPresident Donald Trump needs a strategy … and the strategy has to be to trade something that is not immigration, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe chances of a broader swap were raised on January 3 when White House officials recommended a Presidential veto of Pelosi's first budget proposal.\n\nDemocrats are blocking wall spending, but they have other policy goals in trade, infrastructure, healthcare, and the environment, Vaughan said. For example, Democrats want to add more worker protection to the NAFTA 2 treaty, and they want more construction projects in big cities, she said. Trump should offer concessions in those areas, and so force Democrats to deal or reveal the political cost of their obstructionism, she said.\n\nIf House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi rejects those concessions, she and other Democrats will quickly see how she is martyring her political agenda by opposing a few billion dollars worth of fencing in 2019, Vaughan said.\n\nIf the wall talks are expanded, Pelosi will be under pressure to accept a compromise, Vaughan said, because she has to show she can govern. Moreover, Pelosi's majority is made possible by semi-centrist Democrats who ran to her right in the November elections. They need compromises to keep their seats in 2020, she said.\n\nAlso, outside the Beltway, voters know Trump was elected to build the wall. I think people's perception is that the Democrats are really the problems here and that [perception problem] is going to get worse, Vaughan said.\n\nBut the GOP's business-first wing instead wants Trump to trade away his lower immigration, higher wages policy to get a few billion dollars for the wall, she said.\n\nThat wage-boosting Hire American policy is now raising wages for GOP voters before the 2020 elections — but it is also crimping the profits and stock values demanded by the GOP's donors and business-first legislators.\n\nTech Billionaires urge fast-track green cards for 400,000 contract visa-workers – and many more later. Just guessing here, but maybe most Americans prefer fewer visa workers for biz & higher salaries for their families? https://t.co/yXhMswXOXK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 8, 2018\n\nFor example, GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander, who voted for the Gang of Eight Amnesty in 2013, used a January 3 article in the Washington Post to urge Trump to endorse a huge amnesty that would drive down wages before the election:\n\nGo bigger: Pass the bill that 54 senators voted for last February, which combined a solution for children brought to the United States illegally (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA) and $25 billion in appropriated funding for border security over 10 years. The bill failed only because of last-minute White House opposition. Go really big: Begin the new Congress by creating a legal immigration system that secures our borders and defines legal status for those already here. In 2013, 68 senators — including all 54 Democrats — voted for such a bill, but the House refused to take it up. That bill included more than $40 billion and many other provisions to secure our borders.\n\nIn 2013, Alexander voted for the 2013 Gang of Eight amnesty bill, which would have amnestied an unknown number of migrants, and also allowed prestige companies to import a limitless number of cheap foreign college graduates for middle-class jobs sought by the American graduates.\n\nUtah's Mitt Romney also is arguing that the government should let states import cheap labor.\n\nWe need to make it easier in some respects for people to come here legally and work temporarily and then go home, particularly in the agriculture industry, Romney told CNN's Jake Tapper on January 2. In Utah, we rely on a lot of people coming in to harvest crops and so forth, he said, adding, We ought to be guided by what the states need, as opposed to what the federal government imposes on them.\n\nRomney's policies would allow the states to import huge levels of cheap labor. His plan would cut investors' labor costs, impose new costs on state residents and federal taxpayers, and also deter employers from buying the U.S.-built labor-saving machinery that raises Americans' productivity and wealth.\n\nOther legislators are pushing for an amnesty of at least one million younger 'DACA' illegals. Breitbart News reported January 3:\n\nA handful of Republican and Democrat lawmakers are continuing to tout a plan that gives amnesty to nearly a million illegal aliens in exchange for some amount of funding for President Trump's proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Democrats such as Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and Debbie Dingell (D-MI) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.\n\nVaughan's proposal may never make it onto Trump's desk because Trump's advisers include many deputies and aides who are part of the GOP's business-first wing.\n\nFor example, interim chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on December 28 that legal immigration is so important and wonderful for this country.\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
A significant 86 per cent of Austrians surveyed in a snap poll on Sunday night support their country continuing independent action to deal with the migrant crisis, without the guidance or agreement of the European Union (EU).\n\nAustria was on the main migratory corridor from the Near East and North Africa to Europe, sitting at the top of the so called 'Balkans route' until action by nations like Hungary and Macedonia closed access to the peninsula by illegal incursions.\n\nDespite having spent much of 2015 being highly critical of efforts to close the route, Austria's government under Chancellor Werner Faymann is now taking a much harder line, and this is proving extremely popular with voters, reports Kronen Zeitung.\n\nA snap poll taken after a Sunday night television appearance by the Chancellor, in which he again called on his German counterpart Angela Merkel to change course on her migrant strategy, found broad agreement with the new direction of travel for the country. With the statement Austria should continue to set their own migrant policy as long as there is no solution at EU level, 86 per cent agreed, with 62 per cent agreeing strongly.\n\nAlthough the question left the possibility of Austria falling into line with the EU at a later date should a continent-wide approach to the migrant crisis be agreed on, to the respondents this seemed a remote possibility. Some 83 per cent said they couldn't see any sort of agreement between the EU-28 in the next few weeks.\n\nA similar proportion also believed Austria should be unafraid to make decisions independently of the EU. Asked is it right to enforce the Balkan closure along with other states, 85 per cent agreed, with just six per cent disagreeing strongly.\n\nThe transformation of Austria's Chancellor Faymann from a Merkel-esque advocate of unlimited asylum for all comers into an advocate of border control and fences was as unexpected as it was sudden. Austrian media now characterises him as a Frenemy to the German chancellor, describing his conversion to plan B as an emancipation.\n\nExplaining this transformation, Chancellor Faymann has spoken of plan B as self defence for Austria, and insisted Austria could not become the waiting room of Germany.\n\nHis reticence to play ball with the Euro club of leaders in Brussels while working out ad hoc solutions with neighbours may prove unpopular in Brussels. As Breitbart London reported, Swedish leader Stephen Löfven slammed European countries not accepting migrant quotas as beneath contempt.\n\nCalling for a pan-European solution and discouraging exactly the action Austria, Hungary, and others have taken, Mr. Löfven said:\n\nThe important thing now in such a difficult situation is that we do things together in the EU. If all keep on with their own unplanned solutions we'll make it even worse.
A California high school senior headed for the Army is not allowed to wear an Army sash with his robe and mortarboard at his graduation Friday.\n\nElias Velazquez made a decision to enlist in the U.S. Army after he graduated from Redlands High School, but his school's policy states that students cannot decorate their graduation gowns or caps except for California Scholarship Federation chords and sashes, KTTV reported.\n\nIt means something really honorable to me, it's a whole new life transition to me, Elias said.\n\nElias and his father are hoping the policy can be changed.\n\nIt's kind of defeating the purpose of achieving that greatness, Joe said. We push our kids to strive and try to be better and do the best they can and then we tell them at their grad ceremony, 'We need you all to be the same because we don't want to hurt anyone else's feelings.'\n\nHis father, Joe, posted about the situation on social media to open community dialogue about the situation.\n\nWe're simply trying to open some community dialogue and get people to understand some rules are okay to change, Joe said.\n\nThe Redlands School District said the reason for the rules is to promote fairness and has nothing to do with not supporting the military.\n\nWe are totally supportive of our men and women in the military. This has nothing to do with a lack of our support, a spokesperson for the district said.\n\nAlthough Elias says he is not happy about not being able to wear the sash, he is committed to following every order they give him since he is not one to stray from the rules.\n\nThe school said that students can wear sashes during other graduation events and before and after the ceremony.\n\nA high school senior in Indiana was also told not to wear her Army sash at graduation May 25 because the school district wanted to focus on high school accomplishments at the graduation ceremony.\n\nIn 2016, a Maine high school senior was told by his school's superintendent that he could not display his Army sash at graduation, but could display it at the school's senior awards ceremony.
In order for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks to succeed, a seat at the negotiating table may be needed for the Hamas terrorist group, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has warned.\n\nWelby, on a 10-day tour of the Holy Land, spoke to the Guardian newspaper after visiting Hamas strongholds in the Gaza Strip. The terrorist group has long called for Israel's total destruction and rejects the Jewish state's right to exist as it backs armed struggle against it.\n\nWelby said: In any place where there's serious conflict, there's a point where you need to talk to everyone, but it has got to be the point where you can make some progress.\n\nMet with President Abbas in Ramallah yesterday to discuss the contribution of #Palestinian Christian community to peace and #reconciliation. pic.twitter.com/pfBdsS5jSd — Justin Welby ن (@JustinWelby) May 9, 2017\n\nIn line with British government policy, Welby and his aides did not meet Hamas officials on their brief visit to Gaza but talks should not be ruled out, Welby said.\n\nWelby did tour the West Bank and Eastern Jerusalem, home to some of Judaism's holiest sites including the Temple Mount and Western Wall in Jerusalem; the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron; and Joseph's Tomb in Nablus. Welby said:\n\nThere's a moment, which I'm not saying is now, when it is possible for it to bring rewards. But the moment is not any moment – you can do it at exactly the wrong time and cause a complete meltdown and undermine all the resistance to extremism. And, secondly, the result [can be] the people in the middle become more disempowered, and you end up privileging those who cause the most difficulty, you reward bad behaviour by attention.\n\nThe British government, along with the EU and the U.S., adopted a policy of not talking to Hamas after the faction won Palestinian elections in 2006 and took control of Gaza the following year.\n\nWelby's latest Mideast intervention follows his call earlier this week for bridges to be built between Christians and Jews to help fight the rising tide of global anti-Semitism, as Breitbart Jerusalem reported.\n\nAs for the future of Israel, he noted that, in the past decade or so, there's been a total breakdown of the capacity of human beings to live alongside one another. But in the Middle East, it's happened before and it's been put right before, and there have been new moments of hope. So that's our prayer. And that's what we have to take responsibility for leading.
After a huge electoral victory that saw his party win a two-thirds super-majority, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has announced tougher immigration rules and his vision of a Hungary built on Christian democracy.\n\nThe Hungarian leader announced his new plans in a radio broadcast on Friday, saying: We are building a Christian democracy. An old-fashioned Christian democracy whose roots are in the European tradition, where human dignity is essential and where there is a separation of powers, newspaper Ouest France reports.\n\nWe will defend the Christian culture and we will not give the country to foreigners, Orban added, and spoke about a proposed constitutional amendment from 2016 to limit mass migration, which failed to pass due to the government not having the required two-thirds majority in parliament at the time.\n\nI feel obliged to implement this constitutional amendment now, he said.\n\nThe amendment could increase the rift between Orbán and the European Union, as it also states that the country will reject any EU rules or policies that could radically change the ethnic makeup of the country or infringe Hungary's territorial borders.\n\nHungary's Orbán Calls for Patriotic Alliance to Save Europe, 'We'll Fight Together to Stop the Soros Plan' https://t.co/iiwvw95RAo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 19, 2018\n\nOn the topic of the European Union and its recently announced 1.24 trillion euro budget, Orbán said he would not support the budget, claiming it would help fund mass migration.\n\nAs part of the budget announcement, the EU added a new policy that could see countries not upholding so-called EU values having their funding cut off.\n\nA major part of the campaign of Orbán and his Fidesz party was the influence of left-wing billionaire George Soros and his vast network of pro-mass migration NGOs.\n\nGeorge Soros has an army of shadows working in Hungary. We want to unmask it. We want to show that migration is not a human rights issue but a national security issue, he said.
Restaurant chain Red Lobster is the latest company to cave to pressure from the far-left blacklisting campaign against Tucker Carlson, announcing Tuesday that they would no long advertise on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight.\n\nThe Wrap reports that Red Lobster confirmed their removal of ads from Tucker Carlson's prime time show, saying in a statement, Red Lobster's advertising buying guidelines reflect our core values and commitment to supporting programming that represents the highest standards of good taste, fair practice and objectivity.\n\nWe reserve the right to make changes to our purchases when the dialogue is no longer in line with our criteria.\n\nRed Lobster is the latest company to pull ads from Carlson's show. He faced an ad boycott last month over comments criticizing American immigration policy, and he is once again in the crosshairs of the far-left over comments he made about many women who do not want to marry men who earn less than them.\n\nWhat in the cheddar bay biscuits is this? https://t.co/yZKHbUz6if — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) January 7, 2019\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Fox News spokesperson referred Breitbart News to a previous statement.\n\nThe statement reads:\n\nWe cannot and will not allow voices like Tucker Carlson to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts from the likes of Moveon.org, Media Matters and Sleeping Giants. Attempts were made last month to bully and terrorize Tucker and his family at their home. He is now once again being threatened via Twitter by far left activist groups with deeply political motives. While we do not advocate boycotts, these same groups never target other broadcasters and operate under a grossly hypocritical double standard given their intolerance to all opposing points of view.\n\nCarlson has indeed faced vicious tactics from the left before. In November, his home, where his wife was home alone, was targeted by Antifa, a group notorious for its tactics of violence and intimidation.
One of the country's premier champions of school choice is marketing taxpayer-funded school vouchers to Spanish-speaking parents, informing them their immigration status is irrelevant to obtaining funds for their children to attend private schools.\n\nA report at AZCentral observed that the American Federation for Children (AFC) is promoting school choice in Arizona with an online notice to Spanish-speaking parents. The notice concerns the state's Empowerment Scholarship Account (ESA) program which, according to the report, gives public money that would otherwise go to local public schools to parents to use for private school and other educational services.\n\nESAs, the report continues, have been strongly supported by the Arizona Legislature's Republican majority.\n\nThe news report adds:\n\nMany of those same lawmakers have also opposed illegal immigration and in-state college tuition for undocumented immigrants, including dreamers — the young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in the Plyler decision that free public education cannot by denied to any student from Kindergarten to the last year of high school (12th grade) due to their parents' migration status, the AFC notice to Spanish-speaking parents states. Just like the public education system, the ESA program does not require proof of income, proof of migration status, and children do not need to have certain grades to enter the ESA program, according to the ESA law.\n\nKim Martinez, AFC Arizona communications director, said immigration status isn't a factor when applying for an ESA.\n\nWe care about giving children access to the K-12 education of their family's choice, in full compliance with the law, she said. We don't take positions on tangential immigration issues. Immigration status does not play a factor in ESA eligibility, just like it does not affect whether or not a child can attend an Arizona public school.\n\nOur goal for every election year is simple: defend and expand educational choice legislative majorities across the country. In 2018, our teams did just that! Check out our 2018 Election Impact Report to see how: https://t.co/2gUD6x5fMo #SchoolChoice pic.twitter.com/lRbeSu9miF — Am Fed for Children (@SchoolChoiceNow) January 7, 2019\n\nArizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican, acknowledged that because ESAs are taxpayer funds and federal law prohibits the state from asking about a student's immigration status, the funds can be used for illegal aliens. He said, nevertheless, that he opposes marketing ESAs to people who are in the country illegally.\n\nWe passed ESA to promote good education, not illegal immigration, Kavanagh said. I strongly object to someone to try to divert public funding to people who are here illegally.\n\nDawn Penich-Thacker, spokeswoman for Save Our Schools Arizona, said marketing ESAs to illegal aliens shows the level of hypocrisy that exists with some of these special-interest dark-money groups.\n\nAt the same time, they'll bang the drum of 'rule of law' and 'taxpayer accountability' and yet simultaneously be marketing to a population of families that we might speculate that some of their top donors don't want them marketing to, she added.\n\nSchool choice champion Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was chairwoman of AFC prior to being confirmed to her current post.\n\nIn May 2017, DeVos addressed AFC's National Policy Summit, asserting that every state should provide choices and embrace equal opportunity in education.\n\nIf a state doesn't want to participate, that would be a terrible mistake on their part, she continued. They will be hurting the children and families who can least afford it. If politicians in a state block education choice, it means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids.
Signal, a messaging app, has seen unprecedented and vertical growth in recent days, according to Brian Acton, the billionaire executive chairman of the Signal Foundation.\n\nActon, who cofounded WhatsApp before selling it to Facebook, said recent changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy are driving people to Signal. He told TechCrunch that Signal's user base exploded in recent weeks.\n\nIt's a great opportunity for Signal to shine and to give people a choice and alternative, Acton stated. It was a slow burn for three years and then a huge explosion. Now the rocket is going.\n\nActon spoke with several news media outlets in recent days regarding Signal's growing user base. Reuters reported:\n\nWe've seen unprecedented growth this past week, Acton said in an email to Reuters. It's safe to say that because of this record growth, we're even more interested in finding talented people. … Signal was downloaded by 17.8 million users over the past seven days, a 62-fold rise from the prior week, according to data from Sensor Tower. WhatsApp was downloaded by 10.6 million users during the same period, a 17% decline. … Millions of people value privacy enough to sustain it, and we're trying to demonstrate that there is an alternative to the ad-based business models that exploit user privacy, Acton said, adding donations were pouring in.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Thursday, Encrypted messaging apps Signal and Telegram are seeing huge upticks in downloads from Apple and Google's app stores. Facebook-owned WhatsApp, by contrast, is seeing its growth decline following a fiasco that forced the company to clarify a privacy update it had sent to users.\n\nTechCrunch reported, According to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch, Signal had about 20 million monthly active users globally at the end of December 2020. According to Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded more than 7.5 million times between January 6 and January 10.\n\nActon considered expanding Signal's revenue through a donation-driven model via its user base. If Signal gets to a billion users, that's a billion donors. All we have to do is get you so excited about Signal that you want to give us a dollar or 50 rupees, he said. The idea is that we want to earn that donation. The only way to earn that donation is building an innovative and delightful product. That's a better relationship in my opinion.\n\nAruna Harder, Signal's COO, told ThePrint that the messaging app is trending as no. 1 on Apple (in 70 countries) and Android (in 35 countries).\n\nHarder added, We all know Facebook's revenue model is powered by mining its users' data, so this update to WhatsApp terms of service was only a matter of time. Maybe it is even surprising they waited this long to make this move. … Unlike other tech companies, we understand that user data doesn't belong to us. … We don't want to know anything, not who you talk to, or how many messages you send, not even what your profile picture looks like.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's security forces deployed in large numbers across the capital on Sunday, expecting more protests after its Revolutionary Guard admitted to accidentally shooting down a passenger plane at a time of soaring tensions with the United States.\n\nRiot police in black uniforms and helmets massed in Vali-e Asr Square, Tehran University and other landmarks as calls circulated for protests later in the day. Revolutionary Guard members patrolled the city on motorbikes and plainclothes security men were also out in force. People looked down as they walked briskly past the police, hoping not to draw attention to themselves.\n\nThe plane crash early Wednesday killed all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians. After initially pointing to a technical failure and insisting the armed forces were not to blame, authorities on Saturday finally admitted to accidentally shooting it down in the face of mounting evidence and accusations by Western leaders.\n\nIran downed the Ukrainian flight as it braced for retaliation after firing ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces. The ballistic missile attack, which caused no casualties, was a response to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran's top general, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad.\n\nIranians have expressed anger over the downing of the plane and the misleading explanations from senior officials in the wake of the tragedy. They are also mourning the dead, among whom were a large number of young people with promising futures who were studying abroad.\n\nEven talking about it makes my heart beat faster and makes me sad, said Zahra Razeghi, a Tehran resident. I feel ashamed when I think about their families.\n\nThe denial and covering up the truth over the past three days greatly added to the suffering and pain of the families, and me, she added.\n\nAnother individual, who only identified himself as Saeed, said the largely state-run media had concealed the cause of the crash for political reasons.\n\nLater developments changed the game and they had to tell the truth, he said.\n\nHundreds of students gathered at Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University on Sunday to mourn the victims and protest against authorities for concealing the cause of the crash, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported. They later dispersed peacefully.\n\nA candlelight ceremony late Saturday in Tehran turned into a protest, with hundreds of people chanting against the country's leaders — including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and police dispersing them with tear gas. Protests were also held in the city of Isfahan and elsewhere.\n\nPolice briefly detained the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, who said he went with the intention of attending the vigil and did not know it would turn into a protest.\n\nCan confirm I wasn't taking part in any demonstrations! he tweeted. Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy. Normal to want to pay respects — some of victims were British. I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.\n\nHe said he was arrested 30 minutes after leaving the area.\n\nBritain said its envoy was detained without grounds or explanation and in flagrant violation of international law.\n\nThe Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry said it was awaiting a police report on the arrest.\n\nThe semi-official Tasnim news agency cited an unnamed official as saying the ambassador was suspected of organizing and provoking the protesters, which was in violation of diplomatic protocol and justified his arrest on national security grounds.\n\nIt said he was taken to the Foreign Ministry, which later released him.\n\nAlaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of Iran's parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, also accused the ambassador of organizing protests and called for his expulsion.\n\nIranian media meanwhile focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash, with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign.\n\nThe hardline daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline, A sky full of sadness, while the Hamshahri daily went with Shame, and the IRAN daily said Unforgivable.\n\nMehdi Karroubi, an opposition activist under house arrest, lashed out at Khamenei himself.\n\nYou, as the commander in chief of the armed forces, are directly responsible for this, he said in a statement. If you were aware and you let military and security authorities deceive people, then there is no doubt you lack the attributes of constitutional leadership.\n\nCriticism of the supreme leader is punishable by up to two years in prison.\n\nTensions with the United States eased after the ballistic missile attack, when President Donald Trump declined to respond and welcomed Iran's apparent decision to stand down.\n\nThe emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, traveled to Iran for talks with senior officials. Qatar hosts a large U.S. military base and shares an offshore gas field with Iran. It has often served as a mediator between the two countries, which have no diplomatic relations.\n\nSyria's Prime Minister Imad Khamis was also leading a high-level delegation to Iran, which includes the defense and foreign ministers. Syrian state media described it as an important visit in light of recent events, without elaborating. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country's civil war, and Soleimani had mobilized militias and coordinated military aid.\n\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was also traveling to Iran, with plans to visit Saudi Arabia the following day.
What began as a small protest over the Texas bathroom bill grew to a 75-person Queer Dance Freakout on the street in front of the historic Texas Governor's Mansion. The troupe protested a bill in the Texas Legislature that would require men and women to use bathrooms and dressing rooms designated to the sex on their birth certificate.\n\nThe protest surrounds Senate Bill 6, the Texas Privacy Act, filed by State Senator Lois Kolkhorst (R-Brenham). Breitbart Texas reported on the bill in January when the senator pre-filled the legislation. The law, if passed, would enhance the penalties for a litany of crimes committed in a bathroom against any individual, regardless of their sex or gender identity, Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick wrote.\n\nThe Texas Privacy Act is a thoughtful solution to a sensitive issue. It preserves an expected level of privacy for our public schools and buildings, Kolkhorst said in a written statement. At the same time, it also allows for schools and universities to make personal accommodations for those requesting an alternate setting.

YouTube channels will now be required to reach 10,000 views before the creator's videos will be able to include advertisements and earn money, according to a new blog post from the company.\n\nFor millions of creators, making videos on YouTube isn't just a creative outlet, it's a source of income… Today, more creators are making a living on YouTube than ever before, declared YouTube in the official blog post. However, with this growth we've started seeing cases of abuse where great, original content is re-uploaded by others who try to earn revenue from it.\n\nStarting today, we will no longer serve ads on YPP [YouTube Partner Program] videos until the channel reaches 10k lifetime views, they continued. This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10k views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10k views up until today will not be impacted.\n\nIn a few weeks, we'll also be adding a review process for new creators who apply to be in the YouTube Partner Program. After a creator hits 10k lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies, the company concluded. If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules.\n\nThe move appears to be a part of YouTube's response to mass-advertiser withdrawal from the site and an attempt to bring companies back to the platform.\n\nSeveral large companies pulled their advertising from Google and its sites, including YouTube, last month, citing their adverts appearing on extremist and offensive content.\n\nThe companies included AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, The BBC, The Guardian, Channel 4, Toyota, McDonald's, and even the British Government, prompting Google to pledge a stand against offensive content.\n\nWe take this as seriously as we've ever taken a problem, said Google's Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler. We've been in emergency mode.\n\nIn a blog post announcement, Google pledged to tackle hateful videos on YouTube, as well as provide advertisers with new tools to limit their reach.\n\nHowever, despite their pledge to crack down on extreme content, a large number of YouTube's top content creators and personalities claim to have been unfairly affected by the changes, which have caused many of them to lose substantial amounts of advertisement revenue.\n\nDespite YouTube only announcing the new 10k advertisement rule this week, the company claimed in an email to Ars Technica that this policy has been in place since November.\n\nA YouTube spokesperson told Ars that 'the changes to the YouTube Partner Program announced today were put into motion back in November of last year, with the goal first and foremost to protect creators.' Ars Technica reported, raising questions as to why the company has only just announced the change.\n\nCharlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

On this weekend's broadcast of Fox News Sunday, during the panel discussion about the news that the White House will not release visitor logs and President Donald Trump not release his tax returns, host Chris Wallace declared that Trump thinks transparency is overrated.\n\nThere was another change this week by this president, not a change in his policy, but from the previous presidents, Wallace said. He now says that this White House is no longer going to routinely release visitor logs showing who's coming to the White House, who they're meeting with, as President Obama did. And another interesting development this weekend, there were massive marches across the country, people protesting. These were called tax marches. People demanding that President Trump releases his tax returns as presidents have routinely since Jimmy Carter. And that was the subject of a tweet this morning from President Trump. Let's put it up on the screen. The president apparently not liking those marches. He says, I did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a Republican, easily won the electrical college. Now tax returns are brought up again? Gillian, this president apparently thinks transparency is overrated.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
The city of Louisville, Kentucky, has experienced a spike in heroin overdose cases.\n\nLouisville Metro Emergency Services received 52 overdose calls between midnight Wednesday and 8 a.m. ET Friday, a jump from the 25 calls received in the same time frame last week, CNN reported.\n\nLouisville Metro Emergency Services spokesman Mitchell Burmeister said most of the overdose calls were from heroin, although he also mentioned there were calls about overdoses from alcohol, prescription medications and other controlled substances.\n\nNo overdose deaths were reported, but one heroin user was a passenger who died in a car crash where the driver was also a heroin user.\n\nThere were 695 overdose reports in January 2017, a 33 percent increase from last year, the Courier-Journal reported.\n\nDr. Robert Couch, emergency medical director at Norton Audubon Hospital in Louisville, said that doctors saw several overdoses during the 32-hour spike and administered naloxone, a heroin antidote also known as Narcan.\n\nCouch said that a growing number of overdose patients have to be admitted to the hospital after they've been revived because they experienced complications from the overdose.\n\nThe spike in overdoses all over the nation is blamed on heroin and the pain reliever drug fentanyl. Death rates from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids increased 72.2 percent from 2014-2015, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat generally is going on when you see this is someone has introduced a batch of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply that hasn't been cut sufficiently, said Van Ingram, Executive Director of the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy. I'm afraid it's a reality we're going to see repeated far too often.
State lawmakers are examining model campus free speech legislation that will address what has become a top issue for college administrators in the New Year: how to ensure free speech while keeping students safe and security costs down.\n\nIt's the No. 1 topic of the year, I would say, for folks in my business, Kevin Kruger, president of the Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education, told Politico at the end of December.\n\nViolent protests on college campuses throughout the country, including Evergreen State College, University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Virginia, have led think tanks that seek to protect the First Amendment rights of all students to provide model bills to state lawmakers.\n\nStanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Ethics and Public Policy Center, is the co-author of a model campus free speech bill that has been published by the Goldwater Institute – a libertarian/conservative think tank in Arizona.\n\nKurtz explained the Goldwater bill in an interview with Breitbart News:\n\nWe've put out what I think is the most comprehensive and toughest bill on campus free speech. What this bill does is ban so-called free speech codes, and free speech zones, as it also discourages administrators from disinviting controversial speakers who have already been invited by students and faculty members. That's what most of the other model bills do. But, what the Goldwater model adds to all that is insistence on punishment for students who shout down visiting speakers, or rip down posters for the talk that a speaker is going to give, or in any way interfere with the free speech rights of others. Right now, that's really the heart and soul of the free speech crisis. Even though I think it's absolutely essential that we ban these free speech zones and these restrictive speech codes, if you were to do all of that today, and still let these shout-downs take place, I think we'd still have a campus free speech crisis.\n\nThe Goldwater Institute summarizes its model legislation:\n\nIt creates an official university policy that strongly affirms the importance of free expression, nullifying any existing restrictive speech codes in the process.\n\nIt prevents administrators from disinviting speakers, no matter how controversial, whom members of the campus community wish to hear from.\n\nIt establishes a system of disciplinary sanctions for students and anyone else who interferes with the free-speech rights of others.\n\nIt allows persons whose free-speech rights have been improperly infringed by the university to recover court costs and attorney's fees.\n\nIt reaffirms the principle that universities, at the official institutional level, ought to remain neutral on issues of public controversy to encourage the widest possible range of opinion and dialogue within the university itself.\n\nIt ensures that students will be informed of the official policy on free expression.\n\nIt authorizes a special subcommittee of the university board of trustees to issue a yearly report to the public, the trustees, the governor, and the legislature on the administrative handling of free-speech issues.\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) has also published a model bill that is being considered by state lawmakers. FIRE is largely positive about the Goldwater bill, while it points out some differences:\n\nFor instance, FIRE believes students should have access to the active assistance of counsel in most disciplinary cases, as opposed to only those with a potential penalty of greater than 30 days' suspension or those involving expressive conduct. The bill draft also addresses a few items about which FIRE does not take a position, and which FIRE would therefore not address through its own efforts. But there is little doubt that passage of this model legislation would represent a real improvement in free speech protections in states that do not already include such protections in state law.\n\nKurtz tells Breitbart News that simply characterizing college students who claim they need to be in safe zones, as snowflakes minimizes the real issues at stake:\n\nThe snowflake idea is true, but incomplete. The snowflake idea addresses that these students have helicopter parents who didn't want to see them get hurt in any way, who coddled them, and didn't get them used to the hard knocks of life. I think there's some real truth in that. So – when they hear someone who disagrees with them – they sort of want to shrivel up and die, which makes them want to silence people. But, I think that this psychological explanation underplays the importance of ideology in all this. If you look at what's happened to the university over the last few decades, they've really been taken over by the studies programs – African-American studies, Latino studies, women's studies, environmental studies, gender studies – and sometimes they literally have studies that teach activism. These studies programs are generally built around political assumptions, and their classes are teaching leftist politics.\n\nKurtz further explains that, today, even courses in the conventional departments – such as history, English, biology, etc., are cross-listed with other studies departments and share the common ideology.\n\nThe rise of the studies programs and the political orientation behind them has an awful lot to do with the campus free speech problem we're seeing, he says.\n\nHe notes the gradual acceptance of the teaching of Marxist ideology in American colleges and universities:\n\nIn my day, I must have had three or four courses where we read On Liberty, by John Stuart Mill, which taught the basics of free speech and why we need it. It was very common to read John Stuart Mill and other defenses of free speech in the tradition of classical liberalism – such as what the Founders practiced. This is not taught today. Instead, people teach about so-called white privilege and other ideas that, in an indirect way, are ultimately derived from Marxism or what you might call neo-Marxism, where the basic idea is that individual rights are just an illusion, and you really have just a bunch of powerful classes. Instead of an economic class nowadays they talk about it as an ethnic or a gender class. And those powerful classes dominate and they create ideas like free speech that pretend to be neutral and fair to every individual, but they really aren't. They're just disguising the power of the class. That ideology comes from Marx, but it's been spread out and used in this new frame with ethnicity and gender. So, this is the ideology that dominates the ethos of the studies programs.\n\nKurtz points out that the Goldwater legislation also has an educational component:\n\nOne of the things our campus free speech bill does, in addition to insisting the colleges adopt good statements defending free speech and explaining the meaning of free speech, we insist there be a section of freshman orientation where the students are taught about these statements, and that they're taught about the policy that disciplines people who shut down speakers. So, there is an educational element in our legislation, but ultimately legislation can never be a complete solution. There has to be a change in which we start to really educate students again in the principles of free speech and what classical liberalism of the kind the Founders practiced are all about. If we don't do that, this generation is going to be lost and the country is going to be lost.\n\nKurtz has also been a vocal opponent of the Common Core standards and changes to the College Board's Advanced Placement U.S. History curriculum that reflect the leftist ideology. He explains that the latest controversy is over the College Board's AP European History curriculum:\n\nThat has the same problem as the AP U.S. History curriculum. It focuses on group conflict – exactly the sort of thing that you find in the studies departments. And there's even a neo-Marxist element to the AP U.S. History standards – they're very materialist. The AP European History standards imply that the original liberals, like John Locke and Hobbs, and the Parliaments that brought modern democracy to England, were somehow motivated by class interest, and the implication is there's something inauthentic and not very believable about classical liberalism. So, there's no doubt that the curriculum the College Board has put in place has been adding to and exacerbating the underlying problem that we're experiencing on free speech.\n\nPeople who wish to remain non-partisan emphasize the 'snowflake' thing, and others have taken it up, but the truth is there is a one-sidedness in the ideology of colleges that have become so far-left that they have broken from classical liberalism, Kurtz concludes. If we don't acknowledge that's at the root of the problem, then we'll never solve it.\n\nA Goldwater-based bill has already become law in North Carolina. Additionally, another has cleared the state House in Wisconsin and has already been adopted by the Board of Regents at the University of Wisconsin.
The European Union will not impose border controls to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus, despite hundreds of cases being confirmed in Italy and new cases being confirmed across the continent.\n\nThe European Commission announced on Monday that it is currently not considering tightening border controls within the Schengen interior open-borders zone in response to the outbreak in Italy, which is now battling the largest outbreak of Coronavirus outside of Asia.\n\nStella Kyriakides, the EU's Health and Food Safety Commissioner, told reporters in Brussels that the bloc was outsourcing responsibility for controlling disease in the Union to the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has yet to recommend any border controls in Europe. Consequently, the commission will not impose any restrictions.\n\nWe are facing … an unfolding situation, a complex situation and any decisions made need to be based on risk assessment and scientific advice, and need to be proportionate, she said according to The Guardian.\n\nIt is important that member states fully respect the advice given from WHO and of course from ECDC, but such decisions concerning travel restrictions will always be member states' competence and member states' decisions, Kyriakides added.\n\nToday the governments of Switzerland, Austria, Spain and Croatia have all reported confirmed cases of the deadly coronavirus and an estimated 1,000 tourists are being held under quarantine in a hotel on Tenerife in the Canary Islands after an Italian doctor who was staying in the hotel tested positive for the virus.\n\nItaly Cancels Venice Carnival Over #Coronavirus Outbreak, as World Reaches 'Tipping Point' https://t.co/nzXaBtGJz5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2020\n\nIn Italy, the epicentre of the European outbreak, there are now 322 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with the death toll reaching 11, reports The Guardian. In an attempt to stop the virus from spreading, Italy has imposed travel restrictions for at least 50,000 people, cancelled the Venice Carnival and has closed business and schools.\n\nIn the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Veneto and Piedmont all sporting events have been cancelled in light of the outbreak.\n\nA government source from neighbouring Austria said on Monday that the country will not impose Schengen general border controls, but added that: If we do have a confirmed case, then we will check that again.\n\nUnder the Schengen agreement, singed in 1985, member states of the European Union agreed to enact passport-free travel, allowing people to travel freely throughout the bloc. However, countries are allowed to reimpose border controls in the event of a serious threat to public policy or internal security.\n\nDuring the height of the European Migrant Crisis, eight countries imposed internal border restrictions on travel. The nations of France, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have all notified Brussels that they will continue to enforce border checks to combat the threat of terrorism.\n\nThe Death of Schengen: Denmark Proposes to Make Border Controls Permanent https://t.co/OnOd8CorGs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 22, 2019\n\nFollow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told top Pentagon officials in his first meeting as department chief that he wants them to remember China, China, China.\n\nThe large group discussion meeting on Wednesday included all service secretaries and under secretaries of defense, according to a senior defense official.\n\nActing Secretary Shanahan told the team to focus on the National Defense Strategy and to keep this effort moving forward. While we're focused on ongoing operations, Acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to remember China, China, China, the official said.\n\nThe meetings typically take place on Tuesday or Thursday, but since it was Shanahan's first full workday as acting defense secretary after taking over from former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, he decided to hold it on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe order sheds some insight on Shanahan's priorities, as he takes the reins of the Pentagon from Mattis.\n\nShanahan, the deputy defense secretary, was thrust suddenly into the position, after Mattis announced in mid-December he would resign in February, but was ousted early by President Trump.\n\nShanahan, a business executive who has spent the last 30-plus years at Boeing, represents a break from Mattis in not having any particularly strong ideological views.\n\nMattis had strongly held beliefs about maintaining and respecting allies, which he cited in his resignation letter to Trump.\n\nShanahan, on the other hand, during his 17 months at the Pentagon considered himself the chief operating officer of the building, and focused on running the building versus policy.\n\nBut defense officials say he will represent some continuity from Mattis, since he helped craft the department's National Defense Strategy — which shifts the Pentagon's focus from counter-terrorism to great power competition with China and Russia.\n\nShanahan's focus on China will be in lock-step with President Trump and other members of the Trump administration, who have taken on China as the top economic threat to the country's future.\n\nAs a longtime defense industry executive, Shanahan would be no stranger to issues that are preoccupying the administration, such as intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers from U.S. companies doing business in China, China's rapidly modernizing military, and the U.S.'s eroding military technological edge.\n\nIn his first statement issued as acting defense secretary, Shanahan said:\n\nUnder the direction of President Trump, the Department of Defense remains focused on safeguarding our nation. We have deep respect for Secretary Mattis' lifetime of service, and it has been a privilege to serve as his deputy secretary. As acting secretary of defense, I now look forward to working with President Trump to carry out his vision alongside strong leaders including the service secretaries, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the combatant commanders, and senior personnel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Shanahan sat next to Trump at a Cabinet meeting, in a sign of the president's confidence.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing in June 2017, he pointed at China when asked what his thoughts were on how the U.S. should move forward in the Asia-Pacific theater.\n\nI think the Chinese have been modernizing quite significantly in recent years, and that threatens our ability for freedom of movement. And it is really important that we find ways to maintain the security architecture of the Pacific Rim, he said.\n\nIt is very important that we support our allies and partners there and reassure them of our commitments, he said.
The once prestigious Lancet medical journal has called on the Biden administration to significantly increase U.S. funding of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to reestablish American global health leadership after four years of disruption by Donald Trump.\n\nIn its January 2 op-ed titled A global health action agenda for the Biden administration, whose authors include Donna Shalala, former president of the Clinton Foundation, the Lancet proposes that Mr. Biden will be able to rebuild trust among global partners by ponying up large sums of money to international organizations.\n\nThe incoming administration should mobilise partners to fund the UN COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP), designed to coordinate health and economic action in vulnerable countries, the op-ed states. So far, the UN has received only 40% of the US$9.5 billion GHRP goal for 2020.\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration suspended all funding for the U.N. Population Fund, which has been linked to the support of population control programs such as China's coercive abortion one-child policy.\n\nThe United Nations has joined the World Economic Forum (WEF) to announce a global coronavirus news service, declaring the time has come for new social norms that seek out and correct wrong information. https://t.co/3d8acbyJ8n — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 29, 2020\n\nAs Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) testified in 2015: The UN Population Fund helped fund birth restrictions, fund forced abortions, and a massive and coercive family planning bureaucracy.\n\nThe UNFPA whitewashed China's crimes for decades and continues to do so today, Smith added, noting that on its website UNFPA justifies its history in China, saying it was 'tasked by the Executive Committee' to help China and had to 'engage with China as a sovereign nation.'\n\nThe Trump administration also significantly cut U.S. funding for UNAIDS and the W.H.O. in 2018, by 30 percent and 20 percent respectively.\n\nAnd in May 2020, Mr. Trump threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the W.H.O. altogether — a move that would cost the agency nearly $900 million biennially — over concerns about Chinese influence.\n\nTrump cited the role of the W.H.O in mismanaging and covering up the global spread of the Wuhan coronavirus when he suspended U.S. funding of the U.N. subsidiary.\n\nEmbattled W.H.O. chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was warmly applauded Sunday by China's Communist regime. https://t.co/AZnUh28IYl — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 24, 2020\n\nThey're a puppet of China, they're China-centric to put it nicer, Trump said. They gave us a lot of bad advice.\n\nBiden must also strengthen WHO, not only for the response to COVID-19, but also for the full gamut of health challenges, ranging from maternal, child, and adolescent health to injuries, non-communicable diseases, and universal health coverage, the Lancet declares in its op-ed. Addressing health inequities will be crucial in all these domains. WHO's $5.8 billion biennial budget—about the size of a large US hospital—is incommensurate with its global mandate.\n\nThe Biden administration should push to double mandatory contributions to W.H.O., it states, equating leadership with funding.\n\nWith compound health crises worldwide, UN humanitarian appeals face record shortfalls, the essay declares. The Biden administration could build on the tradition of US humanitarian leadership by funding at least 40% — the USA's share of high-income country gross national income — of UN and WFP appeals.\n\nAmerican global health policies have languished under President Trump, the op-ed asserts.\n\nU.N. chief Antonio Guterres called for the world to urgently redistribute power so as to end gender inequality which he said should shame us all in the 21st century because it is not only unacceptable, it is stupid. https://t.co/sPyAaYudUL — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 28, 2020\n\nCDC's China office, for example, was cut from 47 to 14 staff under the Trump presidency, it notes. Overall, US relationships are frayed, not only with China but also other key allies.\n\nThis is the time to revitalise US global health leadership, after a ruinous retreat from global solidarity under the Trump administration, the article concludes. International cooperation on the compound crises of COVID-19 could become a model for tackling other existential global hazards.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
How climate 'experts' love to mock the ignorance of evil, anti-science Republicans!\n\nE & E News had field day recently, deriding the stupidity apparently on display at a meeting of the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee.\n\nHere is how it began its snarky put-down:\n\nThe Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet. Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming. A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements.\n\nThe leading climate scientist in question was one Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.\n\nSounds impressive. Except, as Paul Homewood notes, the idea that Duffy is a dispassionate observer is risible. Woods Hole Research Center is a green think tank, not a reputable scientific research establishment. And Duffy is more of a policy wonk than a practicing scientist.\n\nNot that this would matter if he knew what he was talking about. If you're going to put Republican congressmen right on their scientific ignorance, you need to do so with actual facts, right?\n\nPaul Homewood has now exposed his three falsest claims for the #fakenews they are:\n\n1) The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago According to Jevrejeva's study in 2014, based on 1277 tidal gauges: The new reconstruction suggests a linear trend of 1.9 ± 0.3 mm·yr− 1 during the 20th century, with 1.8 ± 0.5 mm·yr− 1 since 1970. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818113002750?via%3Dihub And this is their graph of global sea levels: Jevrejevaetal2013GPChange It is plainly evident that sea levels have been steadily rising since the mid 19thC, with a slight slow down between 1970 and 1990. The IPCC acknowledged the same thing in their AR5 Report in 2013.\n\nand\n\n2) We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage Again, this is a fake claim. According to a NASA study in 2015, the land ice is actually growing in Antarctica: A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses And the science is not even that controversial. Put simply, the warming of the climate since the Ice Age has led to increased snowfall over the Antarctic.\n\nand\n\n3) Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet This is the biggest BS of the lot. The cooling of the Earth's climate between 1940 and the 1970s, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, was well known by climate scientists at the time. For instance, HH Lamb wrote this piece for the UNESCO's Courier magazine in 1973:\n\nYou can read more details about just how embarrassingly Duffy got it wrong here at Homewood's place.\n\nIt gives you an idea, doesn't it, as to why there is such a growing divide between the mostly liberals pushing the climate change doom narrative and the mostly conservatives who think it's a hoax?\n\nThat'll be because the conservatives generally get their facts right while the liberals hide behind junk science mumbo jumbo, appeals to authority and sneery, and mocking articles like the one published by E & E.\n\nTruth will win out in the end, of course. But the battle won't be over for a long time yet.
Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, former Obama HUD Secretary and former mayor of San Antonio Julián Castro said he did not believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status.\n\nOn Saturday, Castro announced he is running for president in 2020.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president visited your home state of Texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?\n\nCASTRO: What I believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. That's a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know – and many of them have said – in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric, but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border, and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do? Would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?\n\nCASTRO: I don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. And we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. So no, I don't agree with that. The other thing I'll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually, the exact opposite happened. And so he's failed. He's a failed leader on this issue, and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And it's just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've been calling immigration system broken for some time, and you were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?\n\nCASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law-abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer.
Friday on CNBC's Squawk Box, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said shutting down the government was an immoral, stupid policy.\n\nHoyer said, Our position is we have to stop using the shutdown of the people's government as a strategy to obtain our objectives.\n\nHe continued, The problem with using government as a lever, as a tool and taking hostages—not only the 800,000 federal employees but taking all the millions and millions of people who are served by government every day hostage is—that is very, very debilitating to our country — essentially taking our country hostage. So what we're saying is, Mr. President, we need to negotiate. It could be hard; you can veto some of our bills, but don't shut down government in the process. So this is a bigger issue than just the wall or education or the Affordable Care Act, it's an issue of whether or not we're going to use as a continuing policy shutting down the government of the United States and undermining the confidence of our employees, the confidence of people who deal with the government, and the confidence of the international community looking to see whether the United States of America can act in a rational, responsible way.\n\nWhen asked why Democrats are not negotiating with the president, Hoyer said, What happens next time when the president says, 'do as I say, and if you don't I'll shut down the government.' or the next time after that, or the next time after that? This is a policy that is an immoral, stupid policy, shutting down the government of the United States to achieve an objective.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
The alternative news site Zero Hedge has been permanently blacklisted from Twitter. The account had more than 650,000 followers at the time of its suspension from the platform.\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman told Breitbart News that Zero Hedge's account has been permanently banned for violating its platform manipulation policy. No further details were given.\n\nA spokesman for Zero Hedge strongly rejected Twitter's allegation.\n\nWe have no idea about platform manipulation, nor have we ever engaged in anything of the sort. We appealed a violation against 'abuse and harassment' which we assume is related to the Buzzfeed article.\n\nThe ban occurred shortly after BuzzFeed published a story accusing Zero Hedge of doxing, or revealing the personal identity, of a Chinese scientist accused of playing a role in the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus, a new viral infection that causes pneumonia, has infected more than 10,000 people — most in China — since the start of the year, with 258 confirmed deaths.\n\nDescribing Zero Hedge as both pro-Trump and far-right, BuzzFeed says it claimed without evidence that a scientist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology created the strain of the virus that has led the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency.\n\nZero Hedge did indeed publish an article about a scientist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory in the same Chinese city that saw the start of the outbreak. Zero Hedge noted that the laboratory recently called for applicants to help study bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.\n\nBecause of this, Zero Hedge asserted a link between the virology institute and the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nBoth the name of the scientist and details about his and the Wuhan Institute of Virology's work studying coronaviruses was publicly available on the internet, and circulating widely on social media prior to Zero Hedge's article.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter, or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio thinks stock are declining due to justifiable fears that the Fed will tighten faster than is priced in the credit markets.\n\nDalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Monday, Dalio explained that news last week of faster job growth and higher wage growth fed fears that the Fed would raise rates to keep down inflation.\n\nOver the past week or so, we had reports of strong growth and rising wages (good things!), which sent bonds and stocks down (bad for most investors) due to justifiable fears that the Fed will tighten faster than is priced in the credit markets. The surge in growth and wages came because of both the fiscal stimulation and the rekindling of animal spirits, thrusting the economy into late-cycle capacity constraints, which is leading to the expectations of faster Fed tightening. In other words, fiscal stimulation is hitting the gas, which is driving the economy forward into the capacity constraints, which is triggering interest rate increases that are hitting the brakes, first in the markets and later in the economy. This confluence of circumstances will make it difficult for the Fed to get monetary policy exactly right. This is classic late-cycle behavior (when it's difficult to get monetary policy exactly right, which leads to recessions), though it is more exaggerated because the durations of assets are uniquely long, which means that when interest rates are low, prices of assets are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than when interest rates are high.\n\nDespite this warning that the Fed will have trouble getting policy right, Dalio appeared to downplay the importance of the recent declines.\n\nStill, these big declines are just minor corrections in the scope of things, Dalio wrote. There is a lot of cash on the side to buy on the break, and what comes next will be most important.
London's subway railway is to ban the well-known greeting ladies and gentlemen in platform announcements, Transport for London (TfL) have said.\n\nThe salutation, which prefaces many of the automated and live announcements that inform and guide passengers on the London Underground is to be scrapped in favour of hello everyone, or time specific phrases such as good morning everyone.\n\nStaff have already been told by city travel bosses at Transport for London to use the new phrases, reports the Evening Standard, which is part of a drive to become gender neutral.\n\nMark Evers, a TfL director said of the change: We want everyone to feel welcome on our transport network. We have reviewed the language that we use in announcements and elsewhere and will make sure that it is fully inclusive, reflecting the great diversity of London.\n\nThe change comes after pressure from transgender campaigner and Green Party spokesman Aimee Chandler, who said she was ridiculed by Transport for London staff who said she didn't sound like a miss in 2016. While Chandler said the change was positive, she said it did not go far enough.\n\nSpeaking to the Evening Standard the campaigner said: People are saying it's such a small thing, and 'get a life'. It's these little things which can make people's lives better.\n\nLondon is a city I love travelling through, it's diverse. But hearing these announcements- we are living in the 21st century, not the 19th.\n\nChandler called for the TfL handbook to be rewritten to reflect the changes, as well as the new policy being communicated to staff as an order.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the change: I am keen that TfL addresses these concerns by speaking in a more neutral way when referring to gender.\n\nTfL has made a commitment to transition from gender-specific phrases like 'ladies and gentlemen' which are currently used in announcements, to a gender-neutral alternative such as 'good morning/good afternoon everyone'.\n\nTfL has briefed its staff on this, though from time to time, well-meaning staff may still use the term 'ladies and gentlemen'. If this happens frequently, TfL will issue reminders to staff.\n\nRevised phrasing will be applied to new pre-recorded announcements made across the network.
A National Guard soldier headed home from a deployment to Afghanistan says he was charged a hefty fee to check his military bag.\n\nFirst Lieutenant John Rader said United Airlines made him pay $200 to check a military-issued bag on his flight to Austin, Texas, from El Paso, the final leg of his trip home from his deployment to Afghanistan, because it was overweight, Fox News reported.\n\nI was told point blank that I'd have to pay $200 for the overage or find another bag to siphon stuff off with, Rader told FOX 7. Well, I didn't have another bag so I was caught in a bind.\n\nSome of the things in his bag included Kevlar vests, two helmets, and boots.\n\nRader said he was initially required to serve a nine-month deployment, but he volunteered to extend his deployment to 21 months.\n\nUnited says active-duty military can check up to five bags as long as they are each 70 pounds or less, according to the airline's website.\n\nDelta has a similar policy, while American and Southwest allow active-duty military to check their bags for free provided that they are 100 pounds or less.\n\nRader said he tried to work it out with the ticket agent so he would not have to pay the fee but was told his bag was too heavy for the military benefit.\n\nThere was no empathy to the situation. I'm not looking for sympathy, but some form of empathy in the situation. There was none of that. It was just cold. I had to either pay or leave the bag, Rader said.\n\nHe added that another soldier on his flight also had to pay a fee.\n\nUnited Airlines released a statement apologizing for the incident: We are disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn't meet their expectations, and our customer care team is reaching out to this customer to issue a refund for his oversized bag as a gesture of goodwill.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) suggested during a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday that the latest version of the economic relief package is minimally different from the original measure Democrats rejected and added that he will leave it to others to compare the two and determine whether the last few changes really required or merited three days of delay.\n\nMcConnell said during his floor speech that he originally emphasized four urgent priorities for Senate legislation to help the nation get through the crisis. Those included direct financial assistance to the American people, aid to small businesses to keep paychecks flowing, and measures to both stabilize key industries to prevent mass layoffs and flood more recourses into the frontline healthcare battle itself.\n\nOne week ago, McConnell said, the Senate GOP laid out a proposal that tackled each of these emergency missions and noted that the proposals remain the central building blocks of the legislation they have today.\n\nMcConnell said, noting the creation of the bipartisan working groups that worked literally around the clock to make the bill even stronger:\n\nOur nation needed us to go big and go fast and they did. The created policies our chairman crafted in just a couple of days time remain the central building blocks of the proposal we will pass today. But Republicans knew the nation had no time — no time — for conventional political gamesmanship.\n\nBy Sunday, the majority leader said, they had a bill from both sides.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats had worked together to dramatically strengthen and rework unemployment insurance during this crisis. We worked together to ensure lower-income families could receive the full cash assistance and on and on, he said, again hinting that the bill they will vote on is not much different than the original measure that Democrats rejected days ago.\n\nInstead, Democrats opted to pursuit radical legislation covering a flurry of progressive policy agendas unrelated to the crisis at hand.\n\nMr. President, I'll leave it to others to compare the bipartisan Sunday bill to the final version we will pass today and determine whether the last few changes really required or merited three days of delay — three days of delay in the face of this worsening crisis, he emphasized.\n\nDespite the partisan turmoil over the last few days, McConnell said the Senate will pass the historic relief package today:\n\nStruggling Americans are going to go to their mailboxes and find four-figure checks to help with their bills. Why? Because the Senate stepped up. Many American families who poured everything into a restaurant or a shop or a small manufacturer are going to keep making payroll and keep their businesses alive, because this Senate stepped up. Hundreds of thousands of workers in key sectors, who might well have been laid off through no fault of their own, will instead get to keep their job and continue their career, because this Senate stepped up. And for the health care heroes who leave their own sleeping children and drive to the hospital for an all night shift, who spend hour after hour healing the sick, comforting strangers and literally battling this disease, there will be more masks in their supply closets, more funding for their hospitals, and soon more new treatments to administer to their patients, because this senate stepped up.\n\nThe legislation itself cannot defeat the crisis, McConnell stressed, but it can provide relief to Americans, who will ultimately beat the virus.\n\nNo this fight is not going to be won or lost in Washington, he added. It's the American people who will beat this virus.
A day after concerns about China's economic slowdown rocked the global stock market, American Enterprise Institute scholar Nicholas Eberstadt said that the financial markets—and even the CIA—have for too long been unrealistically optimistic about China's economic potential even when China's demographics suggested otherwise.\n\nOn Tuesday's Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, Eberstadt told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that there is a gradual awakening to the reality that the new contours aren't going to make possible this seven percent year-on-year-on-year-on-year-on growth that our CIA and international financial markets and Chinese planners thought was going to be the basis for the Asian Century.\n\nI don't think it's going to happen because they don't have the human ingredients for it, he said.\n\nRegarding China's one-child policy that former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping instituted over three decades ago, Eberstadt said that while lots of people were talking about the liberalization of China and the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping, the heart of the society—the basic unit of society is the family—and the claim that the government has the right to decide how many babies parents have is much more totalitarian than anything that Lenin even planned.\n\nSo the idea that Deng Xiaoping was going to transform the Chinese family and calibrate the Chinese family to perfect this future economic paradise of course has ended in a disaster, he said. What else could it end in?\n\nChina ended its one-child policy in favor of a two-child policy last year because it feared the country's aging population could lead to a massive economic slowdown.\n\nEberstadt said that there will be a lot of downward pressure on economic growth rates in China, which may still be very fast compared to a lot of the rest of the world.\n\nBut the problem, according to Eberstadt, is our financial system and our businesses have banked on an unrealistically high permanent growth rate in China.\n\nAs for why America's financial industry and intelligence agencies have overestimated China's growth potential, Eberstadt said that it's the easy temptation to think that tomorrow is going to be just like today plus two percent. Growing in a straight line. But straight lines don't happen in history when you actually look at it, he said.\n\nEberstadt added that people in politics usually do not pay attention to demographics and are obsessed with what happens in the next 24 hours. But demographic change creeps up on you on little cat feet and it doesn't become clear that things have changed for half a generation… but at that point the door's closed.\n\nListen to the full interview below:
Homelessness is the number one issue for California voters heading into the 2020 presidential primary in March, according to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), as reported by the Sacramento Bee.\n\nMore than 150,000 California residents are homeless, according to the latest counts.\n\nThe Bee reported Wednesday night:\n\nThe poll finds a plurality of Democrats, Republicans and Independents likely to vote in the state's March 3, 2020 primary election in agreement that homelessness is the most important issue for Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers to work on in 2020. Twenty-one percent of Democrats and Independents called it the top issue, compared to 29 percent of Republicans. Housing affordability and the environment were the next highest priorities for likely Democratic primary voters, while Republicans were more concerned about immigration and taxes.\n\nThe Bee added: Health care has become a lesser focus for Democrats, according to the poll.\n\nThat is a stark contrast to the priorities of voters elsewhere in the country. According to a Gallup poll released earlier this week, Democrats nationwide consider health care the most important issue, followed closely by gun control and climate change. Overall, healthcare, national security, gun policy, education and the economy were cited as extremely important by over 30% of adults in the poll.\n\nBut California faces acute problems with homelessness. As Breitbart News reported last month, the state's 16.4% increase in homelessness is entirely responsible for the nation's overall 2.7% increase, according to federal statistics.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom is in the midst of a week-long focus on the issue, touring homeless facilities and discussing spending proposals in his recent budget.\n\nThe governor is currently fighting President Donald Trump on the issue — as on many others. Newsom has insisted on more federal funding for state housing projects.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti recently adopted a more pragmatic approach, and has approached the federal government to work together in dealing with the city's roughly 60,000 homeless people, including by possibly relocating some of them to unused federal property.\n\nThe California primary will take place on Super Tuesday, March 3, instead of in early June, as in previous years.\n\nJoel B.

The NFL decided to open their marijuana testing window on Thursday, April 20th. In other words, the NFL decided to begin testing their athletes on 4/20.\n\nThe move represents either a complete lack of awareness on the part of the NFL (a definite possibility given their track record) or a really good attempt at humor.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Talk:\n\nFor players not already in the drug-testing program, it means that the once-per-year substance-abuse test can happen at any point between now and early August. Which means that, if/when a player not in the drug-testing program passes the annual substance-abuse test, he can use recreational drugs like marijuana without consequence until next year. As long as, of course, he isn't arrested for marijuana possession in a state where it's illegal or a bag of weed doesn't fall out of his coat pocket while visiting the league office. Given the amount of time necessary for marijuana metabolites to exit the system (it can take as long as 30 days) it may be too late to stop smoking yesterday. For those who stopped in time to produce a clean sample, they'll be hoping to get their number pulled sooner than later, so that they can resume doing what is now legal in nine states for recreational purposes and 29 states for medicinal purposes.\n\nOne wonders how long weed will continue to be outlawed by the NFL. Marijuana is currently legal for recreational use in nine states, plus the District of Columbia. The drug is legal in 29 other states for medicinal purposes. Leaving only 12 states where marijuana is illegal for medicinal or recreational use.\n\nWith so much of the country open to some form of marijuana use, the NFL recently announced they would reexamine their policy. But, as for now, any player wishing to celebrate 4/20 is still subject to league discipline.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn
Remember when Hillary Clinton repeatedly stated that the 55,000 pages she turned over to the State Department in December 2014 included all of her work-related emails?\n\nIn response to a court order in a Judicial Watch case, Clinton declared under penalty of perjury that she had directed that all my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or are potentially federal records be provided to the Department of State, and on information and belief, this has been done.\n\nWe've known for a while that this was not the case.\n\nNow there's more proof. We have released 37 pages of new Clinton emails recently found by the FBI that show the former secretary of state using her unsecure, non-government email to transmit classified information. The new emails also show Clinton used text messages for government business. The documents, which we received after a review by the State Department, include 13 new Clinton emails.\n\nHere's how poorly these emails were handled. The State Department did not provide information about where they were found, why they were not previously produced, or if additional records are anticipated. Last month, a Justice Department attorney could not tell a federal court judge how and where the FBI discovered the new cache of Clinton emails.\n\nThe State Department previously claimed it had produced all responsive Clinton emails, including emails recovered by the FBI that Hillary Clinton tried to destroy or withhold. The State Department initially claimed all responsive emails had been produced in 2018, but then found more emails, which were produced, for the first time, early last year. Then in November 2019, the State Department first disclosed to the court that the FBI had found this latest batch of emails.\n\nThe emails were produced thanks to our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit for all of Clinton's government emails sent or received on her secret server system (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00687)). We sought:\n\nAll emails sent and received by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her official capacity as Secretary of State, as well as all emails by other State Department employees to Secretary Clinton regarding her non-state.gov email address.\n\nHere's what we found.\n\nIn an email Clinton's personal email, dated January 23, 2012, former-British Prime Minister Tony Blair sends details that were redacted as classified.\n\nIn a email containing classified information dated August 30, 2011, Jeffrey Feltman, then-Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs suggested Clinton meet Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in Paris to talk about Syria and other issues.\n\nIn an email exchange on August 31, 2011, Clinton top aide Huma Abedin says she sent Clinton a couple text messages, and offers to send Monica [Hanley] to hamptons to help you get organized.\n\nIn an email sent on April 10, 2012, Clinton forwards to her then-Deputy Chief of Staff Jacob Sullivan a memo on the Egyptian election campaign that includes information on the Muslim Brotherhood that she received from Sidney Blumenthal. In this memo, Blumenthal claims to have Sources with access to the highest levels of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, and Western intelligence and security services.\n\nOn November 7, 2012, Mills forwards a classified email chain with the subject global health doc to Clinton's personal email. The initial email, which included a draft of this document was labeled and highlighted Confidential fyi – not for larger dissemination to ANY others.\n\nIn an email dated August 30, 2011, Clinton forwards to Sullivan, her top foreign policy advisor, an intelligence memo on Libya that was sent to her earlier by Blumenthal with the subject line, H: Very good intel re: inside NTC. Sid NTC is the acronym for the Libyan National Transitional Council. The State Department redacted Hillary Clinton's comments about the Blumenthal Libya memo.\n\nIn a heavily redacted email chain between January 25-26, 2009, Clinton CCs her BlackBerry in a discussion about an envoy to North Korea with her then-Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, and former State Department Special Advisor for Nonproliferation and Arms Control Robert Einhorn. Einhorn sends Clinton, several names for [Clinton's] consideration. Clinton replies from her personal email account.\n\nAfter Einhorn responds, Clinton asks Mills privately to put Einhorn and someone only identified as Rose into transition space. She also asks that then-Senators John Kerry and Richard Lugar be on call lists to schedule the two of them.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, Mills sends an email to Clinton, Clinton's BlackBerry and Abedin containing a message For HRC from [former Ambassador] Frank Wisner about Clinton's request for his thoughts on her upcoming trip to Egypt.\n\nOn August 2, 2009, in an email with the subject line Feingold, Huma Abedin sends to Clinton's personal email a memo from Russ Feingold about issues concerning Somalia, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Nigeria. The memo also includes information on the Islamist militant group, Boko Haram in Nigeria.\n\nIn an email dated January 8, 2012, which included Clinton's schedule, Abedin emails Clinton's main scheduler Lona Valmoro to check to see if Clinton will have enough time to prep for her Elle Magazine interview. She also had an interview with Lisa DePaolo of More magazine. That same day, Clinton took five questions during her phone call with 200 personnel from the US Embassy in Kabul.\n\nIn an email dated October 31, 2012, then-former-State Department Director of Policy Planning, Anne-Marie Slaughter emailed Clinton's personal email, as well as Sullivan, Abedin, Mills, and Clinton innovation advisor Alec J. Ross a document asking for State Department support for a satellite channel that would allow Syrians to talk to Syrians in a citizen-controlled format. Slaughter adds that she's made contact with the Swedes on this issue.\n\nOn November 4, 2012, Valmoro again sends Clinton's sensitive daily schedule to Clinton and Abedin on the unsecure server.\n\nWhat does all this mean? Magically, after years, the FBI finds more Clinton emails that show Clinton used text messages for government work, not to mention the continuing flow of classified information transmitted over her unsecure email system. These documents further underscore the need for a fresh, unbiased and thorough criminal investigation into Clinton's blatant malfeasance – and the related DOJ, FBI, and State Department cover-up.\n\nThe production of documents in this case was to have been concluded with the FBI's recovery of approximately 5,000 of the 33,000 government emails Clinton took and tried to destroy, but, as you see, this case is still in progress.
A group of Brussels-based activists, including staff from the European Parliament are hosting a migrant-based talent show this evening for solidarity and humanity.\n\nFeaturing five Syrian migrants, the event's blurb entices would-be punters with the promise of singing, their talent to the Eastern lute (Oud), the Kanoun [a kind of zither], the violin and the guitar. Entry is €5 on the door — but free for 'refugees', of course — yet any politically uninterested fans of Levantine music won't get away lecture-free.\n\nIn addition to the music promised at 'Syrians Got Talent!' are talks, as the famous refugees will share their experiences with you… this evening is an opportunity to come together and share around a concert, everything that brings us together.\n\nPotentially sensitive to the icy reception migrants may have been receiving from some quarters since the Brussels bombings last week, the programme calls the event a loud protest against the demonization of those Syrian refugees who bring a lot to Europe.\n\nAlthough the invitation encourages would-be concert goers to book in advance due to limited seating, there appears to be some concern over attendance of particular desired groups may be insufficient.\n\nTaking to Facebook last night, French born co-organiser and European Parliament foreign policy adviser Schams El-Ghoneimi begged: Friends, I URGENTLY need journalists to cover this in Brussels, they can call me directly to meet 5 WONDERFUL human beings who also happen to be Syrian refugees – and which will show their talent at this Thursday's SYRIANS GOT TALENT event we're organising near the EU Parliament.\n\nMy 5 syrian refugees friends are not just talented musicians: they each have a story to tell, dreams to share, in English/Dutch/French -if they have had time to learn it since their very recent arrival in Europe- or in Arabic (interpretation available).\n\nIf you know a journalist who thinks THIS should get more media attention, please have them contact me directly for all the details.\n\nThe invitation to the event makes clear the anti-Fascist sentiment of the evening, proclaiming the venue as the former home of artist Marcel Hastir, a member of the Second World War Belgian resistance.

This story by Reuters appeared in the Business Insider.\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) – China is set to report its weakest full-year growth figure in 25 years on Tuesday on the back of slowing output and sagging investments, troubling news that will likely dominate discussion at the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada policy meetings.\n\nEconomists said the expansion of the Chinese economy was held back by sluggish domestic and external demand, weak investments, factory overcapacity and high property inventories, which exacerbated deflationary pressures in the economy.\n\nThe poor figures bolster arguments for more Chinese monetary policy easing on top of the six interest rates cuts seen since November 2014 and suggest that more currency depreciation is coming to prop up corporate profitability, bad news for advanced economies.\n\nAn even weaker yuan will export China's deflationary pressures to advanced economies that are already struggling with anemic price growth, amplified by a fall in oil prices to 12-year lows.
This story originally appeared at Business Insider:\n\nLet's be honest: 2018 doesn't feel good, Eurasia Group's president, Ian Bremmer, and chairman, Cliff Kupchan, wrote in their annual Top Risks report.\n\nYes, markets are soaring, and the economy isn't bad, but citizens are divided, Bremmer and Kupchan said. Governments aren't doing much governing. And the global order is unraveling.\n\nTheir assessment of the biggest risks the world faces in 2018 spans the planet, from individual countries to global trends. Something big could happen, they say, to shake the world unlike anything in a decade.\n\nIf we had to pick one year for a big unexpected crisis — the geopolitical equivalent of the 2008 financial meltdown — it feels like 2018, Bremmer and Kupchan said. Sorry.\n\nHere's what Eurasia Group sees as the risks for 2018.\n\nAt the top of the list is the risk of a powerful and modern China filling a void left by the US in for the position of global leader.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is the strongest Chinese president since Mao Zedong, Bremmer and Kupchan said, adding that more countries are beginning to turn to China because of its non-interference in other countries' affairs.\n\nAt a moment of policy incoherence and dysfunction in Washington, China's government has redefined the country's external environment, set new rules within it, and developed the world's most effective global trade and investment strategy, Eurasia Group said.\n\nRead the full story at Business Insider.
President Donald Trump will deliver his first address from the Oval Office on Tuesday evening at 9 p.m. ET. He will explain why the country needs a physical barrier at the U.S.-Mexico border, and why he is refusing to consider bills to end the partial federal government shutdown unless they provide the funding he is seeking.\n\nBreitbart News readers and listeners have been looking forward to such an address for weeks.\n\nHere are seven things Trump must say.\n\n1. The border issue is about national security, the first priority of government. Americans are used to fights over immigration policy. This is different. The nation faces a crisis at its southern border. The drug cartels are taking advantage of our open border to smuggle drugs, weapons, and people. They are also waging a bloody civil war that bleeds over into our country. Everything else the government does is secondary to protecting the country. There is literally no point to opening the government until politicians are prepared to take care of its first priority.\n\n2. The first victims of the Mexican cartels are the migrants and the countries from which they come. Cartels are brutal. They slaughter innocent civilians. They rape the women and girls they are trafficking to criminals in the U.S. The drugs they sneak into the U.S. kill thousands of Americans each year. And the developing countries that migrants leave behind become poorer. Democrats who, like Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), say [t]here is no national emergency on our southern border, are encouraging the cartels. There is nothing humane about an open border.\n\n3. The border crisis has nothing to do with legal immigration, which we embrace. Corporal Ronil Singh, a Newman, California police officer — and legal immigrant — was murdered the day after Christmas by an alleged illegal alien. Many Americans want less immigration — a debate for another day. Regardless, Americans respect legal immigrants. We should reform our immigration laws, including those that allow foreigners to claim amnesty as soon as they touch American soil. Corporal Singh gave his life to defend the rule of law. That is what is at stake.\n\n4. Illegal immigration hurts all Americans, but especially legal immigrants, minorities, and the poor. With better border enforcement, black and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest ever, and wages are rising for all Americans. Those gains are threatened by illegal aliens who compete with U.S. citizens and legal immigrants for jobs. Illegal immigration also hurts public health care and education, as illegal aliens place additional burdens on services that are already struggling. We can have a generous welfare state, or open borders, but not both.\n\n5. Democrats are hypocrites. Many Democrats — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) — have voted for a barrier at the border in the past. Border walls, and fences, are not immoral, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi keeps saying. Nor are they racist. They work — which is why the European Union builds them, why our ally Israel builds them, and why even developing countries in Africa build them. The main reason Democrats oppose a barrier at the border is because they don't want President Trump to have a political win. Stop making this personal.\n\n6. We have to act now because both parties failed in the past. Many Democrats want open borders because they see illegal aliens as future voters. Many donor-class Republicans have tolerated illegal immigration because of business demand for cheap labor. That is why both parties have overlooked the laws they voted to pass, and ignored the wishes of the American people. President Barack Obama told Congress in 2011: I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. They did nothing. We can no longer wait.\n\n7. Let the engineers design a barrier that works. The wall should not be a Democratic or Republican issue. Nor should it be a budget issue: Democrats are fighting over a mere $5 billion, when their own budget bill spends tens of billions more in excess of White House requests on other items, including foreign aid. The wall — or fence — is little more than an engineering problem. We should let experts make their recommendations about what kind of physical barriers to build at each point along the border. Let the engineers do their job — and let's put America first.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He is a winner of the 2018 Robert Novak Journalism Alumni Fellowship.

We keep digging into the chain of events surrounding the FBI's non-investigation of Hillary Clinton and her email misconduct. The correspondence between Peter Strzok and his lover Lisa Page is proving to be a treasure trove.\n\nWe have now received 191 pages of emails between former FBI official Strzok and former FBI attorney Page that include an August 26, 2016, email in which Strzok says that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in her interview with the FBI about her email controversy, apologized for the work and effort it caused the bureau and saying she chose to use it out of convenience and that it proved to be anything but.\n\nStrzok said Clinton's apology and the convenience discussion were not in the FBI 302 report which summarized the interview.\n\nThe emails also suggest that Strzok had information on an intelligence briefing for then-candidate Trump that may have been a ruse to spy on Trump.\n\nThe emails are the latest production from our January 2018 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the DOJ failed to respond to a December 2017 request for all communications between Strzok and Page (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:18-cv-00154)).\n\nThe FBI is processing the records at a rate of only 500 pages per month and has refused to process text messages. At this rate, the production of these communications won't be completed until late 2021.\n\nThe new records include an August 26, 2016, email from CNN's Even Perez to Michael Kortan, the FBI's assistant director for public affairs, saying: Do you know if Gowdy is right that the FBI didn't ask Clinton about her intent? And is that weird?\n\nKortan forwards the email to Strzok, saying, The question of the day …\n\nStrzok replies to Kortan, I know, I was getting increasingly irritated at Gowdy last night. I don't know the basis for him saying that. We certainly asked her. She said she did it for convenience, because she wanted one system for email. We also asked those close to her – Abedin and Mills specifically – who said the same thing.\n\n[Redacted] but we can find the references in the 302 which discuss it.\n\nThough not in the 302, at the end of the interview she apologized for the work and effort it created for the FBI. She said words to the effect of, I'm sorry this has caused so much work and expenditure of resources by the FBI. I chose to use my own server out of convenience; it proved to be anything but.\n\nStrzok forwarded the exchange to Page, saying, Need to nip this in the bud.\n\nIn an August 25, 2016, email thread with the subject line Found him, which was initiated by an unidentified Chicago FBI field office agent and sent to agents in New York, Cleveland and Washington field offices as well as someone in the counterintelligence division, the Chicago agent writes: Address is [redacted]. Photo attached.\n\nA Washington agent (identity redacted) forwards the email to Strzok and FBI Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Jonathan Moffa, writing: Getting there. Also Pete, let me know if you will when you call CG SAC [redacted] is in a weird spot and even though I've made calls I didn't call SAC Once call is made I'd like to tell [redacted].\n\nStrzok then forwards the email thread to Page, writing: Located our source of predication…\n\nThe records also include an August 18, 2016, email from FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence Bill Priestap to Strzok, Moffa and a FBI official (identity redacted), asking if they happen to know when Clinton will receive the brief? And where will it occur, and which two people has she designated to receive it with her?\n\nStrzok replies, She has not designated her people and no date is set. I believe brief will be HVRA [the FBI's Hudson Valley Resident Agent] or WPRA [FBI's White Plains Resident Agent].\n\nFurther on in the email exchange, the unidentified FBI official from the Washington field office writes, There is no additional or new info as of this morning when I checked with the DNI scheduler. There is a policy that briefs will not be provided a week prior to a debate. If the other candidate does not ID people soon, there was talk that they may not be able to do them. That's all I know at this time.\n\nStrzok forwards the exchange to Lisa Page and says, And now we've got sources in dni <smiley emoji>.\n\nPage replies, Yup, I knew the same. Just hadn't shared yet.\n\nStrzok responds, What?! You holding out? <wink emoji>\n\nPage replies, Time, dude. Time.\n\nStrzok responds, I know, dudette. Hence, the <wink emoji>. Same realization of shit, haven't even told you about Trump brief…\n\nThe DOJ's Inspector General report on Crossfire Hurricane describes the FBI's use of a national security briefing to the Trump campaign in August 2016 to try to further its investigation by planting an agent in the room:\n\n[W]e learned during the course of our review that in August 2016, the supervisor of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, SSA 1, participated on behalf of the FBI in a strategic intelligence briefing given by Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to candidate Trump and his national security advisors, including Michael Flynn, and in a separate strategic intelligence briefing given to candidate Clinton and her national security advisors. The stated purpose of the FBI portion of the briefing was to provide the recipients a baseline on the presence and threat posed by foreign intelligence services to the National Security of the U.S. However, we found that SSA 1 was selected to provide the FBI briefings, in part, because Flynn, who was a subject in the ongoing Crossfire Hurricane investigation, would be attending the Trump campaign briefing.\n\nOn August 19, 2016, the same day as Paul Manafort's resignation from the Trump campaign, Dave Bowdich in FBI Director James Comey's office initiates an email exchange with the subject line OGA [Other Government Agency], in which he tells the top management of the FBI (Randy Coleman, Josh Skule, Michael Steinbach, Amy Hess, Valerie Parlave, James Turgal, James Trainor, Laura Bucheit, Bill Priestap and WL Bean), We are clear to [redacted]. DJ [likely Associate Executive Assistant Director Dave Johnson] will determine the composition of the team with your collective input. This gets our foot in the door, but we can scale as necessary later.\n\nJim Trainor responds, 10-4. Per DJ's voice mail [redacted]. Stand by for the names.\n\nPreistap forwards the exchange to Strzok and Moffa, saying, Pete, Please see the bottom email. We've been asked to send 1 person with the FBI team tomorrow. Our 1 person will then be responsible for providing you/me with a recommendation as to what CD's [Counterintelligence Division's] resource commitment should be moving forward. Please provide the name of the person who can participate tomorrow, beginning in the AM (details to follow).\n\nStrzok replies, OK. Stand by for name\n\nStrzok then forwards the exchange to Page, who replies Bowdich sent separately as well.\n\nStrzok responds, Oh good <smiley emoji>.\n\nOn August 29, 2016, Strzok forwards a Daily Beast article titled FBI vs. State Department Over Hillary Clinton's Secrets to Page, Moffa and a redacted General Counsel office official, with a note saying, Good job, State… \u-19179? – presumably suggesting that the four of them meet to discuss. The article begins, The FBI and the State Department are at odds over whether Hillary Clinton's personal lawyers had the proper government-issued security clearances that they needed to keep copies of her emails in a Washington, DC law office last year.\n\nOn August 30, 2016, former FBI Director James Comey emails then-Assistant Director Andrew McCabe, copying Page, James Baker, Priestap and James Trainor with the subject line WH and said Both meetings went well and I was well prepared.… I will need an update briefing on [redacted] next week. As you might imagine, there was great interest in what each of us is doing on that front and in understanding what more we can do and the obstacles we see. Page forwards the email to Strzok, who replied, Thanks. Bill asked me as I was leaving if I thought it should be in CD [Counterintelligence Division]. Guessing this prompted it. I said yes then described and endorsed Allies reorganization idea.\n\nOn August 31, 2016, a redacted FBI General Counsel official asks Strzok and Page if they should respond to a Washington Times article that asserts that the FBI found hundreds, and likely thousands, of violations of the Federal Records Act by Clinton in her non-government email server use. Strzok's immediate reply is redacted. Strzok ends up asking for the article to be sent to him.\n\nOn September 2, 2016, Chief of Staff James Rybicki sent an email titled All Member Briefing to the same top FBI officials as in the August 19 exchange and discusses a 9/8 Director all-member briefing on FBINet. Action is needed by Tuesday (9/6) by CyD [Cyber Division] and CD. Rybicki follows up on September 2 with an update, saying, NSC determined that this would be a classified briefing and that it would be a briefing for leadership and chairs/rankings of homeland and intelligence committees (12 members).\n\nIn another email exchange on September 2, 2016, FBI agent Stephen Laycock tells Strzok and Moffa that the meeting referenced in the previous exchange on September 2 relates to the project. FBI Congressional Affairs Chief Jason Herring is looped in and reveals that the meeting involves alleged foreign hacking activity.\n\nLaycock writes, Hey guys. Sorry to bother at this hour. Are either of you aware of a cyber brief to the D and HPSCI [House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence] Tuesday that I believe is related to the project? Just got a call from a buddy who is tdy to cyber as SC and was privy to this presentation where he noticed a few CD centric things that CD may have an interest in taking a look at and scrubbing. This may already have been coordinated but just wanted to make sure.\n\nOn September 7, 2016, a redacted FBI official sent an email to Strzok and Moffa with the subject line Another quote from Assange on Hannity, and provides the quote as We have thousands of examples where she herself [likely Clinton] has a 'C' in brackets & signed it off. Strzok forwards the email to Page, saying Interesting.\n\nIn a September 8, 2016, email from New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt to Kortan, Schmidt gives the DOJ an early heads up on something we're planning on reporting today, which was about Clinton's email server technician, Paul Combetta, deleting Hillary's subpoenaed emails, and saying The fact that Combetta was given immunity takes much of the air out of the idea that DOJ needs to investigate the deletions.\n\nSo now we know that the FBI report of Clinton's 'interview' is incomplete and that Peter Strzok may have details on the classified briefing of candidate Trump that were used as pretext for a spy operation. No wonder the FBI had been stonewalling the release of these emails.
BEIRUT (AP) — He has survived eight years of war and billions of dollars in money and weapons aimed at toppling him. Now Syrian President Bashar Assad is poised to be readmitted to the fold of Arab nations, a feat once deemed unthinkable as he forcefully crushed the uprising against his family's rule.\n\nGulf Arab nations, once the main backers of rebels trying to oust Assad, are lining up to reopen their embassies in Syria, worried about leaving the country at the heart of the Arab world to regional rivals Iran and Turkey and missing out on lucrative post-war reconstructive projects. Key border crossings with neighbors, shuttered for years by the war, have reopened, and Arab commercial airlines are reportedly considering resuming flights to Damascus.\n\nAnd as President Donald Trump plans to pull out America's 2,000 soldiers from northeastern Syria, government troops are primed to retake the area they abandoned in 2012 at the height of the war. This would be a significant step toward restoring Assad's control over all of Syria, leaving only the northwest in the hands of rebels, most of them jihadis.\n\nIt can seem like a mind-boggling reversal for a leader whose military once seemed dangerously close to collapse. But Russia's military intervention, which began in 2015, steadily reversed Assad's losses, allowing his troops, aided by Iranian-backed fighters, to recapture cities like Homs and Aleppo, key to his rule.\n\nAssad rules over a country in ruins, with close to half a million people killed and half the population displaced. Major fighting may still lie ahead. But many see the war nearing its end, and the 53-year-old leader is sitting more comfortably than he has in the past eight years.\n\nRehabilitation by Arab states is inevitable, said Faysal Itani, a resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.\n\nA key motive for Sunni Muslim Gulf countries is to blunt the involvement of their Shiite-led foe, Iran, which saw its influence expand rapidly in the chaos of Syria's war.\n\nSaudi Arabia tried briefly to help overthrow him when he seemed most vulnerable using proxy militants, Itani said. With his regime likely to survive, however, Saudi Arabia would prefer to try and exercise influence over Assad to balance against Iran while avoiding escalation with Iran itself.\n\nAfter Assad led a crackdown on protesters in 2011, Syria was cast out as a pariah by much of the Arab and Western world. It lost its seat at the Arab League and was hit by crippling sanctions by the international community, as the U.S. and European diplomats closed their diplomatic missions.\n\nBut Syria's isolation was never complete. China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa maintained diplomatic ties. In the Arab world, Lebanon, Iraq and Algeria never broke ranks with Syria. Propped up by Russia, China and Iran, Assad never really felt the pinch politically.\n\nA Saudi attempt to patch up relations with Assad would be a public acknowledgement of the kingdom's failure to oust him. At the same time, the involvement of Gulf Arab governments and private companies is crucial for any serious reconstruction effort in Syria. Reconstruction costs are estimated between $200 and $350 billion.\n\nLast month, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, himself an international outcast, flew to Damascus on a Russian jet, becoming the first Arab leader to visit Syria since 2011. The visit was largely seen as a precursor for similar steps by other Arab leaders.\n\nOn Dec. 27, the United Arab Emirates reopened its embassy in Damascus with a public ceremony, in the most significant Arab overture yet toward the Assad government, almost certainly coordinated with Saudi Arabia. The Bahrain Embassy followed the next day.\n\nThe debate now appears to be about when, not whether, to re-admit Syria to the Arab League. At a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri said Syria's return to the League is connected to developments on the political track to end the crisis. Some officials in Lebanon insist Syria should be invited to an Arab economic summit the country is hosting next week, although final decision rests with the League.\n\nIt could happen slower or faster, but if Assad is going to stay where he is, then obviously countries in the region are going to try to make the best of that situation, said Aron Lund, a fellow with The Century Foundation. American politicians can sit in splendid isolation on the other side of an ocean and pretend Syria isn't what it is, he said. But King Abdullah of Jordan can't.\n\nThe Arab overtures come amid a shifting landscape in the Western world.\n\nThe planned U.S. pullout from Syria is part of Trump's America First policy. He has repeatedly said he was not interested in removing Assad from power or keeping American troops involved in endless wars in the region, most recently describing Syria as sand and death.\n\nRight-wing parties and populist movements on the rise in Europe are also on friendly terms with Assad, seeing him as a secular bulwark against Islamic extremists.\n\nEven Turkey, whose president in 2012 famously vowed to pray at Omayyad Mosque in Damascus after Assad's ouster, has signaled it would consider working with Assad again if he wins in free and fair elections.\n\nFor Syrians who rose up against Assad's rule, it can seem like the country is right back where it started eight years ago, only with half a million dead and cities in ruins.\n\nAnalysts believe Syria under Assad will likely continue to face conflicts and sputter on in limbo for years to come, with only a partial recovery. But he will likely cling to power and do business with anyone who will do business with him.\n\nI don't imagine Assad's Syria becoming a fine upstanding member of the international community, but nor do I think it will languish in isolation, Itani said.
If France's anti-mass migration Front National (FN) party had been in power, the Islamist terrorist attacks on the streets of Paris last November would have been prevented, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen has asserted.\n\nThe rising star of France's right and niece of FN leader Marine Le Pen also said German migration policy is crazy, drew strong links between immigration and the terror risk, and said her party would strip captured militants like Salah Abdeslam (who is now suing the French state) of their nationality.\n\nSpeaking to French broadcaster BFM TV in an interview on Sunday evening, she said:\n\nIf Front National measures had been in place at the time of the attacks on November 13, we probably wouldn't have had a November 13, a day on which 130 innocent civilians were massacred on the streets of the French capital by Islamic State (IS) linked militants.\n\nThanks to Europe's open door 'refugee' policy and free movement within Europe, the attackers traveled unhindered, back and forth between Syria and France. Three of the terrorists who attacked had taken the migrant route, explained Ms. Le Pen.\n\nThis is not the National Front which is anxious; the reality is anxiety, she said, before insisting her party would never have allowed in such a migrant wave from the Middle East.\n\nMost of [the terrorists] that hit France… would have been behind bars if the NF held power, she added.\n\nReacting to a question about German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ms. Le Pen said simply: The German migration policy is crazy.\n\nImmigration in France has become a breeding ground for radicalisation, this is where we will look for the little soldiers of Jihadism, she said, referring to Salah Abdeslam, the Franco-Belgian terrorist arrested this Friday in Brussels.\n\nHowever, Salah Abdeslam is an immigrant she insisted, adding: We must, of course, revoke the citizenship.\n\nLes propos de Marion Maréchal-Le Pen sur les attentats du 13 novembre, relèvent de la stupidité. — Anne Hidalgo (@Anne_Hidalgo) March 21, 2016\n\nMarion Maréchal-Le Pen's comments on the November 13 [attacks] are stupid, immediately tweeted Paris's Socialist Mayor, Anne Hidalgo.\n\nShe also asked why such an anti-republican politician had been allowed to speak for two hours on television, implying the right wing should be silenced in the media.\n\nSince the attacks, #Paris rises. There is a great desire among Parisians to live together in fellowship, the socialist claimed.
The Times of Israel reports:\n\nA two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is vital to the defeat of the Islamic State, King Abdullah of Jordan argued Friday, saying that the decades-long dispute only served to benefit the jihadist group.\n\n[T]he community of nations cannot talk about universal rights and global justice, but continue to deny statehood to Palestinians, he told the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of foreign and defense policy leaders, referring to IS by an Arabic acronym.\n\nThis failure has created a festering injustice, and continues to be exploited by Daesh (Islamic State) and its kind, he said. Left unresolved, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will become a religious conflict of a global dimension. And it is only a matter of time before we may be faced by yet another war in Gaza or in South Lebanon.\n\nThis is why reaching a two-state solution should remain a priority for us all, he said.
The University of Michigan's chapter of Young Americans for Freedom will host a debate between New York Times bestselling author and conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza and liberal activist Bill Ayers on February 3 at 6 p.m. EST.\n\nD'Souza and Ayers will debate the topic, What's So Exceptional About America?\n\nThe event is sponsored by Young America's Foundation's (YAF) Wendy P. McCaw Freedom Lecture Series, the U-M Central Student Government, and the University of Michigan American Culture Department, among others. Past debates between D'Souza and Ayers have engaged millions of viewers and generated headline-making ideological clashes between the two men.\n\nD'Souza and Ayers debated famously in a YAF-sponsored event at Dartmouth in 2014 and live on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File that year as well. In previous debates, Ayers has declared that he's not proud to be an American and accused the country of doing horrible things. like committing genocide. The pair's tense exchanges in past debates will come to a head as they confront one another over this controversial topic on which their opinions are diametrically opposed.\n\nYoung Americans for Freedom is excited to host this very high profile event at the University, said Grant Strobl, chairman of Young Americans for Freedom at the University of Michigan. On a campus that is often viewed as expressing one ideological viewpoint, we are excited to break the school's culture of political correctness and have a meaningful debate on policy. We expect a packed house and a lively debate.\n\nDean of the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts Dr. Andrew Martin will moderate the debate. The event will held in the University's Michigan League Ballroom in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nFollow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo
President-Elect Joe Biden said he will ensure there is a thorough investigation by the Justice Department into officials of President Donald Trump's administration who crafted and carried out the Zero Tolerance policy at the United States-Mexico border to deter illegal immigration.\n\nDuring a press conference on January 8, Biden committed to having the Justice Department open an investigation into Trump officials who carried out the Zero Tolerance policy through which adult border crossers entered separate custody from the children they arrived at the southern border with.\n\nThe practice, as Breitbart News noted, has been employed since before 2001, though the Trump administration ended the effort in June 2018.\n\nI'll commit that our Justice Department, our investigative arms, will make judgments about who is responsible … and whether or not the conduct is criminal across the board, Biden said. But as I said yesterday, I am not going to tell the Justice Department who they should prosecute and who they should not.\n\nThere will be a thorough, thorough investigation of who is responsible and whether or not their responsibility is criminal, and if that is the [conclusion], the Attorney General will make that judgment, Biden continued.\n\nThe Obama administration, for which Biden served as vice president, often used fencing barriers in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) facilities to house child migrants.\n\nLikewise, Biden hinted at his push to quickly pass an amnesty for the majority of 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. and revoke a number of executive orders issued by Trump to reform the nation's legal immigration system that admits 1.2 million green card holders every year.\n\nI will introduce an immigration bill immediately and have it sent to the appropriate committees to begin movement, Biden said. I will in fact countermand executive orders that the president has in fact initiated that are contrary to what I think is either his authority and/or even if it's his authority, contrary to the interests of the United States on environmental issues and a range of other things.\n\nCritics have said Biden is looking to restart a Hunger Games migration policy at the southern border in which border crossers are encouraged to carry out a dangerous, and sometimes deadly, journey through Central America and Mexico in order to make their way to the U.S. and be freed into the interior of the country while awaiting their asylum and immigration hearings.\n\nBiden and his advisers have said they plan to tear down the legal wall that Trump has erected to close loopholes and eliminate fraud for the purpose of reducing illegal immigration.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

A new report states that 65% of major US banks have failed web security testing designed to determine whether or not they are vulnerable to a cyber attack.\n\nIBS Intelligence states that a new report from the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) claims that up to 65% of US banks are extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks. As part of the firm's Online Trust Audit & Honor Roll for 2017, more than 1000 website were anonymously audited with their security and privacy features ranked from best to worse. Following the audit, many US banks were ranked as the worst for security and privacy.\n\nIn order to receive the Honor Roll Award from the firm, websites must achieve an overall ranking of 80% or more. Three categories are taken into consideration: consumer protection, security, and privacy. Failing any one of these three categories results in an automatic disqualification from receiving the award.\n\n52 percent of the websites audited qualified for the Honor Roll, a 5% improvement on scores from 2016. However, despite the overall improvement, only 27% of the 100 largest banks in the country met the Honor Rolls standards.\n\nAccording to the OTA, the US digital banking sector had shown improvement, but due to increased breaches, low privacy scores and low levels of email authentication, many banks performed poorly. The American Bankers Association (ABA) has taken issues with the OTA's results; Doug Johnson, the senior vice president of payments and cybersecurity policy at the ABA, stated in an interview with NBC that banks absolutely take privacy and security very seriously.\n\nPhil Lieberman, CEO of the US security company Lieberman Software, stated, Most of the serious intrusions are from dumb mistakes made by companies that are easily remediated by a consistent approach to managing access, security and looking for significant anomalies. Countermeasures are simple and effective such as air gaps, rate limiting, IP reputation, and improving identity management. He continued, Other simple ideas like compartmentalisation, security classification of assets and access, and the management of privileged identities and access provide large ROI and reduction of losses.\n\nHe continued, Other simple ideas like compartmentalisation, security classification of assets and access, and the management of privileged identities and access provide large ROI and reduction of losses.
The first woman to wield the gavel of the House of Representatives is on track to secure it for a second time on Thursday, as a rebellion against her from within her own ranks was crushed from election day until now.\n\nAs the onset of the 116th Congress approaches, convening at noon on Thursday, Jan. 3, 78-year-old Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is the only declared Democrat candidate for Speaker of the House. Barring any unforeseen circumstances or last-second shenanigans by Democrat rebels against her, Pelosi will win back the Speaker's gavel on Thursday afternoon–putting her in the driver's seat on negotiations with President Donald Trump on everything from the ongoing government shutdown to major federal policy decisions on just about every issue.\n\nPelosi served as Speaker from January 2007 until the beginning of January 2011, for two Congresses when Democrats held the majority at the end of the George W. Bush administration and beginning of the Barack Obama administration, but she has been stuck in the minority since Republicans took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nThe GOP held control in the House for eight long years, first with former Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) as Pelosi's immediate successor as Speaker and then, after Boehner lost an internal Republican Party rebellion of his own with soon-to-be-former Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), as Speaker.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Pelosi clung to hopes of a return to power from her perch as Minority Leader–the head of the House Democrat Conference–but nearly was denied the opportunity when her massive unpopularity forced Democrat candidates to pledge opposition to her Speakership candidacy in exchange for support from the public. According to NBC News, a whopping 58 Democrats–11 incumbents and 47 new candidates who won their party's nominations for House seats–pledged campaign trail opposition to Pelosi's re-ascent to the Speakership.\n\nThere are technically two votes for the Speakership. The first is in conference, where members of a party select whom their candidate will be. Democrats already selected Pelosi as their conference's candidate with a late November vote of 203-32 with three blank ballots and one absent member. The second, and more consequential, vote is on the floor of the House of Representatives. The first order of business of a new Congress is for the House to elect a Speaker. So, when the 115th Congress disbands and the 116th Congress is sworn in, before the House can do anything else, the chamber must elect a Speaker.\n\nFor a candidate to win the Speakership of the House, that person must receive a majority of those present and voting for a person. Members of Congress can vote for formally introduced candidates–for Democrats that will be Pelosi and for Republicans that will be Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the current Majority Leader who will become the House Minority Leader on Thursday when Democrats take over–or they can vote for someone not listed. The candidate can be a member of the House, but does not have to be–the Constitution is very nonspecific on the requirements for candidates for election to be Speaker of the House–though there has never been a Speaker who is not a member of the House.\n\nFor someone to win the vote, they need to win a majority of those members who voted for a candidate. Voting present technically is a thrown-away vote, as it does not count toward the number of votes cast for candidates, and thereby lowers the total threshold. Assuming all 435 members of the House are present and vote for a candidate, that would mean the winner needs 218 votes. If anyone is absent or votes present and not for a candidate, that lowers the number of votes a winner needs one member for each two members voting present or absent from the vote.\n\nIf no candidate wins a majority on the vote, the voting goes to a second round–and third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, et cetera–until a majority of the House elects a Speaker.\n\nIt is in this vote that Pelosi faced the most potential peril before now. After the midterm elections, when it was clear Democrats were taking the majority in the House next year, 17 Democrats banded together to sign a letter pledging to oppose Pelosi, not just in the intra-conference vote but on the floor of the House as well.\n\nWe promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise, the 17 Democrats wrote in their letter. Therefore, we are committed to voting for new leadership in both our Caucus meeting and on the House floor.\n\nThe incoming House Democrat majority will have 235 members, while Republicans will have 199 members and there will be one vacancy in North Carolina's yet-to-be-resolved ninth congressional district. That means if those 17 had held together and added one more to make their number 18, they would have had the votes to stop Pelosi from ascending to the Speakership at least on the first ballot–forcing a chaotic process and at least a second ballot.\n\nBut in the lead-up to, and aftermath of, the intra-conference nominating vote, Pelosi maneuvered swiftly to win several of those critics back.\n\nThe highest profile signer of the letter was former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), who had even publicly floated potentially running against Pelosi. But, within a week of Fudge's opposition to Pelosi becoming public and an interview she gave considering a Speakership bid herself, Fudge completely reversed course and actually endorsed Pelosi for Speaker.\n\nHow that happened is one for the ages: All of a sudden, when she opposed Pelosi, a letter she wrote seeking a lenient sentence for a Cleveland-area disgraced former judge convicted of beating his wife resurfaced. The timing could not have been better for Pelosi: that same judge had just been arrested on suspicion of brutally stabbing his wife to death after release from prison on the domestic violence charges for which Fudge sought a more lenient sentence for him. The judge has since been formally charged with his wife's murder, and pled not guilty, and Fudge's nascent bid for the speakership ended before it even took off. She dropped out of the running, took a token subcommittee chairmanship, and then endorsed Pelosi for speaker.\n\nNext, Pelosi flipped Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) with a promise to focus on his priorities of healthcare and infrastructure–things Pelosi already planned to do anyway.\n\nThen came the big guns: With a loose promise that the 78-year-old Pelosi would term limit herself, something she intended to do anyway, Pelosi flipped another group of rebels into backing her. Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), a senior leftist Democrat from Colorado who had previously been quoted in Politico publicly organizing against Pelosi, flipped and endorsed her, thereby rescinding his signature on the letter.\n\nSo did another leader of the rebellion: Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) backed off his opposition to Pelosi with that deal:\n\nAfter he signed a letter vowing to vote against her, Democrat Rep. Tim Ryan says he will now support Rep. Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House. https://t.co/1dfiIdJqJd — Kyle Morris (@RealKyleMorris) December 13, 2018\n\nNow, Ryan says the Democrat conference is unified behind her:\n\nWATCH: @RepTimRyan (D-OH), who had previously called for new leadership, said that House Democrats are absolutely united behind Pelosi. https://t.co/K4ekX13crl — NTK Network (@NTKNet) January 2, 2019\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), who called for Pelosi to step aside in a CNN op-ed and was one of the most public organizers of the seemingly failed coup attempt, also flipped and backed her candidacy. Several of the other signers, including Reps. Stephen Lynch (D-MA), Filemon Vela (D-TX), Linda Sanchez (D-CA), and Bill Foster (D-IL), also flipped with the term limits pledge.\n\nSome of the other signers–and others who pledged to oppose Pelosi but did not sign the letter, which was circulated by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY)–are still in opposition to Pelosi. But without the core of their group, which Pelosi won back, the rebels likely do not have the votes to stop her from winning the gavel.\n\nit still remains to be seen what happens on the floor of the House on Thursday afternoon, and anything could go wrong for Pelosi before the vote happens, but for now it looks like she maneuvered her way through this rebellion and completed one of the biggest political comebacks in history against all odds.
Apple CEO Tim Cook announced Wednesday the tech giant will be combatting systemic racism and advancing racial equity nationwide with two new school projects launched under its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI) project.\n\nApple has committed $100 million to its REJI project to help dismantle systemic barriers to opportunity and combat injustices faced by communities of color, the press release stated.\n\nThe company's efforts will include the Propel Center, a learning hub for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and an Apple Developer Academy, which expects to support coding and tech education for students in Detroit.\n\nApple said its projects will help build the next generation of diverse leaders.\n\nCook said in a statement:\n\nWe are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world — and these new projects send a clear signal of Apple's enduring commitment. We're launching REJI's latest initiatives with partners across a broad range of industries and backgrounds — from students to teachers, developers to entrepreneurs, and community organizers to justice advocates — working together to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long.\n\nWe are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at Apple, Cook said.\n\nApple announced the REJI project following the protests, looting, and rioting that occurred in the United States following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others.\n\nEvery individual deserves equal access to opportunity regardless of skin color or zip code, said Lisa Jackson, Apple vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives.\n\nShe added:\n\nFor too long, communities of color have faced gross injustices and institutional barriers to their pursuit of the American dream, and we are proud to lend our voices and resources to build new engines of opportunity that empower, inspire, and create meaningful change.\n\nThe Propel Center was designed by Ed Farm, an education social justice group that works primarily with Birmingham City Schools and adults in the greater Birmingham area. Its key partners are Apple and Alabama Power.\n\nEd Farm says the Propel Center is a physical and virtual campus imagined and designed … to provide Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with shared services to support their work of preparing leaders who improve our word [sic].\n\nThe Propel Center will help cultivate leadership and drive innovation in tech and beyond, acting as a springboard for change in communities across America, Ed Farm founder Anthony Oni said in a statement.\n\nThe mission of the Propel Center is to provide innovative curricula to HBCU's in order to train black students in leadership skills. Included in the curricula will be artificial intelligence (AI), agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment arts, career preparation, and entrepreneurship.\n\nApple says its experts will help develop the curricula and provide mentorship and learning support.\n\nThe Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, a joint effort with Michigan State University, aims to empower young Black entrepreneurs, creators, and coders, helping them cultivate the skills necessary for jobs in the rapidly growing iOS app economy, the press statement says.
Some students at Yale University are campaigning for female inclusion in male-only fraternities.\n\nStudent activists at Yale University who believe that fraternities contribute to discrimination, harassment, and sexual assault are campaigning to institute a major policy change that would allow fraternities to accept females.\n\nThere's a lot of discrimination, harassment, and sexual assault, student activist Will McGrew said in an interview with a local news outlet. Why is that?\n\nI would hope that women being a part for fraternities would create a better, more positive environment for everyone and would probably lessen sexual assault in their houses, Brooklyn native and Yale freshman Jojo Attal said.\n\nOne student, Yale junior Natalie Schultz-Henry, argued that co-ed fraternities would better teach Yale students how to work with gender diverse peers after college.\n\nIt becomes about teaching these young adults how to collaborate with people regardless of their gender in the workplace later on, Schultz-Henry said.\n\nOthers insist that the policy change would significantly lessen the number of sexual assaults on campus. We believe a unique community of support is created through single-sex communities like fraternities. A community these students know it took decades to establish and could take nearly as long to change, Yale freshman Jojo Attal said.\n\nA Yale faculty representative said that the university will continue to support the Greek life system regardless of how the students decide to organize.\n\nWe continue to support all manner of fraternity and sorority life on our campus- whether they are all-male, all-female or co-ed. The criteria for who participates in their processes is up to their national organizations and local chapters, he said.\n\nThere is no indication of an effort to integrate male students into Yale's sororities.
A significant majority of French now support banning the radical Salafist sect of Islam, and the government reinstating the national state of emergency, as the nation reels from another deadly radical Islamic terror attack in March.\n\nThe new poll taken days after four were killed by a self-proclaimed member of the Islamic State killed four in southern France found the French public overwhelmingly backing a significant crackdown on radical Islam and deportations that could impact tens of thousands of people.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, 88 per cent of French said they supported banning the rapidly expanding, radical Salafist sect of Islam, even though over half of respondents said they acknowledged that implementing the ban in France would be difficult, if not impossible.\n\nSlain Hero Officer of Carcassonne Attack Given Posthumous Legion of Honour\n\nhttps://t.co/3n7UgFKkZX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 28, 2018\n\nBreitbart London has previously reported on the nature of Salafism, which contains many radical preachers who see violence as legitimate in pursuance of its aims and which provides the intellectual basis for the Islamic State. A regional director of Germany's constitutional police said of the faith in 2017 that every jihadist terrorist we've seen in Europe in recent years came from the Salafist scene.\n\nIn addition to banning the radical interpretation of Islam, a majority of French surveyed also supported deporting terrorists, too. Le Figaro reports 83 per cent supported deporting foreigners on French soil who have so-called 'S' (security) case files on them held by the security services — the French term demonstrating that an individual is considered a potentially dangerous radical by the French state.\n\nPart and Parcel: France Deploys 100,000 Soldiers and Police Officers for the Holidays https://t.co/fmuHVUUjQm — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 24, 2017\n\nFrance admits to there being approximately 20,000 people on that list, meaning thousands of individuals could be deported from France should the will of the overwhelming majority of French citizens be translated into government policy.\n\nThe terrorist who killed four in and around Carcassonne in March, Radouane Lakdim, was a high priority subject of that list and had been on it since 2014 — but still, French police were unable to prevent the attack. Deportations could relieve some pressure from the security services — a former French intelligence official whistleblower this week revealed the state did not have enough agents or resources to watch all of the suspects.\n\nThe survey also found broad support for the extension of a state of emergency in France at 61 per cent, those agreeing even if to do so meant a curtailment of freedoms for citizens.
Republic of Thirst is a three-part series made possible by a generous fellowship from the Robert Novak Foundation. Part I of examined the debate over how California's scarce water resources should be allocated. Part III will examine whether those resources can be expanded through technological innovations like desalination. Part II examines whether more can be done to store and manage the water that falls naturally on the Golden State.\n\n***\n\nThe water burst out through the spillway in a constant gush, a mad torrent of white, unstoppable and ferocious. It swept down the smooth concrete — then pounded into the new cracks in the failed spillway, sending a spray hundreds of feet into the air and carving a new chasm in the hillside.\n\nAlongside the ruined structure, new channels appeared in the earthen emergency overflow spillway, strewn with rip rack rock that had been dropped by helicopter to keep the hillside from collapsing, to save the cities downstream.\n\nViewed from a small airplane above the Oroville Dam — at 770 feet, the highest in the U.S. — in March 2017, the future of water storage in California looked doubtful. That year, California's deep drought was broken by record rainfall, filling that dam and many others.\n\nAs water continued to pour in, authorities opened the spillway gates as wide as possible. But the concrete cracked, and the main spillway failed — spectacularly. The earthen emergency spillway, used for the first time ever, eroded itself and nearly failed.\n\nInitially, local authorities evacuated nearly 200,000 people downstream of the dam. But a herculean effort by engineers managed to save and stabilize the emergency spillway, averting a massive disaster.\n\nStill, the crisis provoked questions about whether state authorities had mismanaged Oroville Dam or ignored warnings about the structural integrity of the spillway — or even of the dam itself, which, some claimed, had already begin to leak.\n\nTo critics of dams, especially among environmentalists, the events at Oroville Dam were further proof of the dangers of dams and reservoirs — which, they argued, stored water only at great cost to nature and great risk to human life.\n\nTo others, especially advocates of industry and agriculture, the Oroville near-disaster was proof the state government had neglected California's infrastructure needs in favor of redistribution, water conservation mandates, or flashy pet projects.\n\n***\n\nLife as we know it in California today would be unthinkable without the extensive system of dams, reservoirs, pumps and aqueducts that make urban life possible and that have transformed the drought-prone Central Valley into the most productive farming region on earth.\n\nAnd yet it is a system that remains almost frozen in time, constructed largely during the early 20th century, the New Deal era, and the postwar boom that followed — designed for a population of 10 million, in a state now reaching 40 million.\n\nIt is also a system replete with ironies. The state that gave Ronald Reagan to America, and with him a new brand of unapologetic conservatism, is one in which the survival of the population depends on massive investments in infrastructure — albeit paid for, ultimately, by water users themselves.\n\nMoreover, the liberal cities that have incubated America's utopian environmental movement for decades could not exist without ongoing human intervention in the environment that brings water from mountaintop to tap.\n\nFor decades, policymakers have debated whether to build new reservoirs. One project, the Auburn Dam, was authorized by Congress in 1965 for flood control, but later abandoned over structural and environmental concerns. Numerous other proposals have been studied for decades, with little progress at the state or federal level — though local authorities have built their own projects, such as the Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the East San Francisco Bay, one of the few projects environmentalists have not opposed (though many have since opposed its expansion.)\n\nAnother project, the Sites Reservoir, has been debated for decades. Rather than capturing water by blocking a river with a dam, the reservoir would be built in a valley with minimal water and would receive excess water during floods, relieving pressure on other dams and allowing them to store more.\n\nAs Robert Dolezal of the California Water Alliance, a non-profit advocacy group funded by the state's business community, told Breitbart News:\n\nSites Reservoir … reduces the flood potential of the Sacramento River … and it allows the entire Central Valley system, all the other major dams in the north — Trinity, Shasta, Oroville, and Folsom — to rebalance … [A]s much as 3 million more acre-feet of water can be stored in Trinity, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom because they don't have to prevent flooding of Sacramento and other downriver communities, rebalancing the system. A similar proposal to raise the height of the Shasta Dam has a similar purpose, as would Temperance Flat on the San Joquin River near Fresno.\n\nBut critics say these dams would achieve little for storage, while hurting fish populations and destroying Native American heritage sites. They call such projects vampire dams — because they so often rise from the dead after being rejected by state leaders, one wrote recently.\n\nThe divisions over water storage do not match partisan divisions on other issues. In the Central Valley, Democrats tend to be as vociferous in their advocacy for water storage as Republicans are. And in the past, Republicans were as skeptical of such projects as urban Democrats are today.\n\nRegardless of political predilection, during years of drought, one thought pervades public consciousness: how much water is left? Residents anxiously turn to the state's reservoirs as they slowly drain, and dry.\n\nThe consequences of poor planning, and political infighting, have become clear — from a distance, at least for now. Across the ocean, the South African city of Cape Town, Africa's most advanced and cosmopolitan city, provides a new warning. Its population has doubled over the past two decades, but it has not built much new water storage capacity — thanks, in part, to the fact that the national government has authority over water and the local government is controlled by the opposition. As a result, the city nearly ran out of water in 2018, forcing severe restrictions on residents.\n\nThat foreshadows California's grim fate — if it cannot find solutions now.\n\n***\n\nDroughts are nature's fault. Water shortages are our fault.\n\nRep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) greeted me in his office on a frigid Tuesday in December. He is one of the last seven Republicans left in the 53-strong California congressional delegation after Democrats won the midterm elections.\n\nThe hallway was strewn with the furniture of departing GOP colleagues, but for McClintock, it was business as usual. And the business at hand was water storage in California.\n\nA continent away, frantic negotiations were continuing on the eve of the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) decision on the Bay-Delta Plan, the controversial new policy that will mandate that rivers in the San Joaquin watershed must have an average of 40% unimpeded flow during the spring months — a decision that shifts precious water from farmers and cities to the environment in an effort to save threatened fish populations.\n\nMcClintock's office was well-apprised of the state of talks between the various parties, including outgoing Governor Jerry Brown and incoming governor Gavin Newsom. The two liberal Democrats asked the SWRCB to postpone its decision, originally scheduled for November, to Dec. 12 to leave time for voluntary agreements with local water authorities. (The day following my meeting with McClintock, the SWRCB voted to approve the Bay-Delta Plan, despite some agreements being reached.)\n\nThe governors' real priority, some skeptical observers claimed, was to secure enough water for the California Waterfix — the Twin Tunnels project that will divert water from the Sacramento River under the California Delta to be pumped south.\n\nBut that is a fight about allocation. McClintock focused on storage, noting that the cheapest and best way to solve the state's water problems — measured in cost per acre-foot — is to build more reservoirs rather than letting much of the state's rainfall run out to sea. McClintock reminded me that it has been 40 years since California's last dam, the New Melones Dam, was completed in 1978.\n\nThe state's largest water reservoir — by far — is the natural reservoir provided by its Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountain Range snowpack. That dwarfs the man-made facilities and, through gradual snowmelt in spring, continuously refills the man-made reservoirs long after winter rains and snows have stopped for the season.\n\nThough smaller than nature's own reservoir, California's system of man-made reservoirs is vast — and complex. The Public Policy Institute of California notes that state and federal agencies manage 240 large reservoirs that account for 60% of the state's storage capacity, with the rest of the state's reservoirs owned and operated by local water agencies, or by private entities for use on private lands.\n\nThe California Department of Water Resources notes: On average, California receives about 200 million acre-feet of water per year in the form of rain and snow. (It adds that the state rarely experiences an average year.) The state's reservoirs can capture about 42 million acre-feet of that — roughly one-fifth. The rest seeps into underground aquifers, or flows out to the sea.\n\nDolezal notes that California uses an average of about 80 million acre-feet of water per year, and over the past two decades, roughly half of that is preserved for environmental use — dropping to 40% in the most recent drought, with agriculture using just over 40%, in both wet and dry years.\n\nThe reservoir system has a variety of purposes — and storage is just one of them. Many dams and reservoirs were built for flood control.\n\nThe state's capital city of Sacramento, which sits at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers, was inundated during the Great Flood of 1862, which turned enormous regions of the state into inland seas for months, Scientific American recalled. That event, and others like it, fueled enthusiasm for building dams.\n\nCalifornia's dams are also multipurpose facilities, providing hydroelectric power generation; water storage and supply; recreation; and flood management protection.\n\nBut tn times of drought, such as the unusually severe drought that gripped the state from 2011 to 2017, storage is the most salient priority. And McClintock believes there is too little of it.\n\nHe and others argue that California can add to its storage capacity relatively easily — not just by building new dams, but expanding existing ones, such as the Shasta Dam, one of the major reservoirs in the federal Central Valley Project, which supplies water to farmers hundreds of miles south.\n\nShasta Dam was built under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during World War Two, reaching 602 feet, though it was designed to be even bigger. (An even bigger dam was envisioned for the Klamath River, but was canceled in the 1970s; today dams along the Klamath are set to be torn down.)\n\nSimply finishing the Shasta Dam to its design height [of 800 feet] could add nine million acre-feet to the system, McClintock says. Indeed, the Trump administration, is proposing to raise the dam by 18.5 feet, increasing the capacity of the dam by 7 percent (630,000 acre-feet) — if tiny salamander species that environmentalists wish to have declared endangered do not stop plans for expansion.\n\nAnother proposal is to build the Sites Reservoir in the foothills west of the small town of Maxwell, just over an hour north of Sacramento. As noted earlier, the Sites Reservoir would store 500,000 acre-feet of off-stream water, meaning that it would not dam an active river, but rather be a site for water from other sites to be stored as available and used as needed. Proponents argue that it would contribute to environmental quality as well as the state's storage capacity.\n\nCrucially, the Sites Reservoir appears to have some startup funding. As much as half of the money will come from a special water bond passed by voters in Proposition 1 of 2014, which set aside $2.7 billion (of $7.5 billion) for water storage projects. The rest of the project would theoretically be funded by long-term contracts for water not reserved for public use.\n\nJim Watson, general manager of the Sites Project Authority, told Breitbart News that he was confident the project would proceed, given the support of the voters for water storage when they passed Proposition 1. He noted that $816 million had been set aside for Sites — the largest project funded by the proposition bond, compared to several competing projects. He added that local water agencies had also been working with state and federal authorities in preparing studies for the project.\n\nSome of the water that will be produced from the project will be dedicated for environmental projects, he said, nothing that some water would help fish, and some would supply existing refuges that support waterfowl species.\n\nGiven that no formal opposition was raised by environmentalists during the approval process for Sites, he said, he did not anticipate significant opposition from them — though they were skeptical the reservoir would provide the water promised. Watson said the project was consulting with environmental interests to allay those concerns, and to explore their thoughts about how the water should be managed once it had been stored, in the reservoir. He said the management process the project had developed would include local communities and Native American groups. And he added that the Sites Reservoir will have statewide reach by helping recharge depleted aquifers throughout California — an urgent necessity once the state's new groundwater management requirements go into effect in 2020.\n\nThree years ago, the concept of a local agency taking on such a project, that had been on the board since the 1950s, seemed pretty remote, he said. We have now become the state's lead agency for complying with environmental requirements.\n\nWe've come a long way … we're starting to put the pieces together, he added with evident pride.\n\nLikewise, Erin Curtis of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation told Breitbart News, There is a lot of momentum for the project right now.\n\nAnd obviously, she added, for any project in California, especially related to water, there's going to be some discussions with environmental organizations and local landowners, but it did get Proposition 1 funding.\n\nCurtis described the value of the project in terms environmentalists might understand: given that the state's climate is changing, and becoming warmer, that means more of California's annual precipitation is falling as rain, rather than snow.\n\nWithout that frozen, natural reservoir, the system must build new capacity to store water — or else it will be lost, not just to industry and agriculture, but to environmental and recreational users as well.\n\nWe have been getting less and less water in the form of snowpack, which means less storage — we get more rain, so we can't store it. Sites, she said, provides another place to put that water.\n\nCritics, however, say that state authorities allocated just enough money to the project to make it appear as if they are spending money on water storage, while not quite enough to allow the reservoir to be built.\n\nMcClintock is among the skeptics. He told Breitbart News that he has been hearing talk about the Sites Reservoir for decades, and that Californians are constantly told that construction is imminent. But somehow, that reservoir, and others, are never built.\n\nHe blamed the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that make dams more difficult, and more expensive, to build. Until we change the environmental laws, construction is cost prohibitive, he told me.\n\nThat would be perfectly fine with many environmental groups, for whom opposition to dams has become something of an article of faith over the past several decades. Dams were once thought to provide an environmentally-friendly source of renewable energy, through hydroelectric power. But they destroy whatever habitat finds itself submerged by reservoirs; impede fish migration; and — if managed poorly — create new hazards, such as mechanical failure.\n\nMcClintock dismissesdconcerns about Oroville. No dam, no work of man is perfect, he said. We make mistakes, we learn, we go forward.\n\nThat is, dam projects would go forward — if there were the political will to build them.\n\nThe lack of will has less to do with engineering challenges, he maintains, than it does with politics, bureaucracy, and lawsuits by radical environmentalist groups.\n\nEnvironmentalists have made no secret of their opposition to the Sites Reservoir. The Sierra Club has cast the project as a fatal threat to the Sacramento River, declaring:\n\nThe Sites Reservoir would be filled by significant water diversions from the Sacramento River, which could harm the river's dynamic flow-based ecosystems. More than 20,000 acres of federal and state public lands along the river that were acquired to protect and restore the river's riparian and aquatic habitats, could be degraded by the diversions. In addition to reducing flows in the Sacramento River, the reservoir would drown up to 15,000 acres of existing oak woodlands, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural land in the western Sacramento Valley. Impacts associated with the reservoir footprint would harm the federally protected bald eagle, a host of other sensitive wildlife species, several rare plants, and significant historical and cultural resources. The Sites Project Authority, a consortium of water districts and local governments, claim that the reservoir could store up to 1.8 million acre feet of water (making it the seventh largest reservoir in the state) and reliably yield about a half million acre feet of water annually for communities, farms, and the environment. But this yield estimate fails to adequately consider the effects of climate change, chronic drought, and reservoir evaporation on project storage and deliveries. …
State senator David Hinkins (R-Orangeville) is pushing to remove the concealed carry permit requirement in Utah because he believes it unfairly burdens the exercise of Second Amendment rights.\n\nUtah allows open carry of a handgun without a permit, but a person legally—and openly—carrying a handgun requires a concealed permit if his jacket or sweater hangs down over the gun, thereby hiding it from plain sight.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, Hinkins said, If you have it on your body and it's out in the open, you're OK. But the minute you put it in your scabbard to protect it, you're breaking the law. He said the fact that laws are structured this way means citizens who want to carry concealed instead of openly have to pay a fee to the state—a fee that open carriers can forgo.\n\nHinkins's legislation is opposed by the Gun Violence Policy Center of Utah's Gary Sackett, who says, It's common sense that you just don't let people walk around untrained, with weapons that are built only to kill people.\n\nSackett misses the fact that walking around with handguns carried in plain sight without a permit is already legal. Hinkins just wants to level the playing ground for concealed carriers as well.\n\nSackett wants the legislation to go in the opposite way and require a permit for open carry as well.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany's finance minister is denouncing trade protectionism ahead of a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and a summit where global finance officials are expected to tussle over how strongly to support free trade.\n\nWolfgang Schaeuble said in a speech Thursday that protectionism and nationalism are never the right answers. He noted that countries are more connected and dependent on each other than at any other point in history.\n\nWe cannot turn back the clock and reverse globalization… but we can shape it, he told a forum hosted by the Institute of International Finance.\n\nSchaeuble's meeting with Mnuchin comes after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration criticized Germany's trade surplus. Members of the Group of 20, a gathering of the world's most powerful economies, will debate whether to confirm their rejection of trade barriers when they meet Friday and Saturday in southern Germany.\n\nLast year's gathering of the G-20 finance ministers issued a statement opposing all forms of protectionism. This time, early drafts of the ministers' statement have omitted such unequivocal language, which in the final version could be softened to refer to trade that is open and fair, without the absolute opposition to import restrictions to benefit domestic workers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. needs a tougher approach to trade that would put American workers and companies first. He has already pulled the U.S. out of a proposed trade deal with Pacific Rim countries and has started the process to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.\n\nHis trade adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of benefiting from a weak euro that boosts its exports. Germany rejects the charge, saying it sells more abroad because its companies make competitive products and that it can't do much to influence the euro's exchange rate since eurozone monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank.\n\nAhead of his meeting with Schaeuble, Mnuchin visited his British counterpart, Philip Hammond, in London. The two underscored the importance of their countries' close relations and their desire to work closely, including through institutions like the G-20, the Treasury said in a statement.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump claim the president has no legal right to block them, citing the First Amendment.\n\nThe New York Times reports that users that have been blocked by President Trump on Twitter have taken legal issue with their ban, arguing that the Constitution bars the President from blocking people on the social media service.\n\nThey argue the fact that President Trump has used his @realdonaldtrump Twitter account to make statements relating to public policy, his account acts as a public forum which people may not be excluded from by the government simply because they disagree with the opinion expressed.\n\nA letter was sent to President Trump on Tuesday by the Knight First Amendment Institute, who are representing the group of banned individuals. The letter states, This Twitter account operates as a 'designated public forum' for First Amendment purposes, and accordingly the viewpoint-based blocking of our clients is unconstitutional. It continues, We ask that you unblock them and any others who have been blocked for similar reasons.\n\nThe letter is not a formal declaration of legal action but does imply that if the users are not unblocked, legal action may follow. Jameel Jaffer, the Executive Director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said in a statement, Though the architects of the Constitution surely didn't contemplate presidential Twitter accounts, they understood that the president must not be allowed to banish views from public discourse simply because he finds them objectionable.\n\nHaving opened this forum to all comers, the president can't exclude people from it merely because he dislikes what they're saying, Jaffer said.\n\nHolly O'Reilly, one of the main organizers of the anti-Trump protest March For Truth, was blocked by Trump following many critical comments on his statuses. In one tweet, President Trump discussed the British Prime Minister's anger that information relating to the terrorist attacks in Manchester were leaked. YOU ARE THE LEAKER, you bloody idiot. God, you're embarrassing. wrote O'Reilly.\n\nYOU ARE THE LEAKER, you bloody idiot. God, you're embarrassing. So glad we are finally getting the TRUTH. https://t.co/RddfpVuPiU @marchfeed — Holly Figueroa O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 28, 2017\n\nO'Reilly is one of many verified Twitter users that comment on Trump's tweets, often criticizing the president or pushing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. In another of President Trump's tweets criticizing the mainstream media, United Press International writer Ben Hooper continued to push the conspiracy theory that Russia somehow spread fake news in order to benefit Trump.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BenHooperWrites/status/872065508572626945\n\nIf President Trump's blocking of certain individuals leads to a legal challenge, Twitter could find themselves in an awkward position as a social media platform which has actively worked to provide their users with content moderation tools for individuals using the service. Twitter allows users to block others, censor sensitive content, and even mute certain keywords that they would rather not have appear on their timeline.\n\nTwitter has had little issue with censoring conservative voices on its platform, however, as Breitbart Tech has reported:\n\nTwitter's bias against conservatives is well-known. The company frequently bans or locks the accounts of conservative users who have not broken its terms of service, while allowing threats of violence against the President and First Lady to run rampant on the platform.
The Trump White House is weighing its options to fire Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Richard Cordray.\n\nRichard Cordray directs the CFPB. Dodd-Frank legislation tasked the CFPB with regulating mortgages and other consumer loans from predatory practices.\n\nThe Boston Globe reports that the White House will decide the future of the director, seen by critics as partisan, unconstitutional, and abusing his authority to regulate the consumer financial world.\n\nOne lobbyist said, They want to fire him. Their legal counsel are looking at every angle.\n\nFiring Cordray will not be as simple. The CFPB is an independent agency, and his term as director expires in 2018. Trump can only dismiss Cordray for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Sources say that the administration examines Cordray's five-year tenure as director to justify his termination.\n\nA Washington, D.C., circuit court ruled in October that the CFPB is, by design, unconstitutional. Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion, The director of the CFPB possesses more unilateral authority – that is, authority to take action on one's own, subject to no check – than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U.S. government.\n\nHe continued, The CFPB's concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable, unchecked director not only departs from settled historical practice, but also poses a far greater risk of arbitrary decision-making and abuse of power, and a far greater threat to individual liberty, than does a multi-member independent agency.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh's opinion gave a blistering refutation of the CFPB, until this month when a U.S. appeals court agreed to reconsider the D.C. court's opinion to repeal his job protection. The U.S. appeals court will start in May.\n\nRepublicans believe that the CFPB has made it harder for Republicans to get credit. Other conservatives contend that accountable to the president or Congress. Reformers in Congress want Congress, not the Federal Reserve, to fund the CFPB.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse (R-NB) said, The CFPB has done some things that are good, and they've done some things . . . that are really bad policy-making. There are counties in Nebraska where you really can't get a mortgage, and it's because of CFPB and larger Dodd-Frank overregulation. He continued, If people in Nebraska have a problem that's actually created by bad policy-making by the CFPB, who do they complain to? Who really has the power? He doesn't report anywhere.
Stella Parton, the sister of country music icon Dolly Parton, has slammed politicians over the rollout of the vaccine for the coronavirus, pointing out that many Americans have waited for financial stimulus, some starving and dying, while the same politicians receiving the vaccine didn't help fund it in the same way that her sister, Dolly, did.
President Trump has called the family of 33-year-old Newman, California police officer Ronil Singh to offer his condolences after the officer was allegedly murdered on the job by an illegal alien.\n\nThe day after Christmas, Singh pulled Gustavo Perez Arriaga over on suspicion of drunk driving. That's when police say the illegal alien shot Singh. Over his police radio, Singh called out shots fired, and as police arrived at the scene of the traffic stop, they found the officer with a gunshot wound.\n\nSingh was transported to a nearby hospital, where he later died, leaving behind his wife Anamika and their newborn five-month-old son.\n\nPerez Arriaga was arrested in December 2018 for the killing of Singh — a legal immigrant from Fiji — but was officially charged with the murder of a law enforcement officer on Wednesday. The illegal alien, whom authorities said is a known gang member, had been caught by police after a more than 50-hour manhunt. Officials said he was planning to flee the U.S. to Mexico.\n\nIn a statement to the media, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump called Anamika Singh, Ron's wife, Newman, California Police Chief Randy Richardson, and Sheriff Adam Christianson of Stanislaus County, California.\n\nThis afternoon, President Trump spoke with the family and law enforcement colleagues of fallen Newman, California, police officer [Ron] Singh, Sanders said. The President praised Officer Singh's service to his fellow citizens, offered condolences, and commended law enforcement's rapid investigation, response, and apprehension of the suspect.\n\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency confirmed to Breitbart News on Sunday that Perez Arriaga, the main suspect in the killing, was never properly turned over to federal immigration authorities despite his two previous arrests for drunk driving.
Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Taiwan in a speech on Wednesday that independence was a dead end and reiterated his goal remains to reunify the island with mainland China, even if by force.\n\nReunification is a historical trend and it is the right path. Taiwan independence is an adverse current of history and is a dead end, Xi said, according to an English-language translation broadcast on state media reported by CNBC.\n\nXi also warned, in remarks aimed at the United States, that foreign interference on Taiwan is intolerable.\n\nThe issue of Taiwan is part of China's domestic politics. It is a core interest of China, and the … feelings of the Chinese people, and foreign interference is intolerable, he said.\n\nThe speech was delivered to officials, military officers, and guests in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, according to the New York Times.\n\nWe make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures, he also said, according to the Times.\n\nThe speech marked 40 years since a thaw in Sino-Taiwanese relations. After being defeated in a civil war by the communists, nationalists led by General Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan and established a new government in 1949. Taiwan has been self-governing ever since but has never formally declared independence.\n\nBeijing, however, considers Taiwan a breakaway province and not a separate nation and has vowed to someday reunify the island, including by force. Since Taiwan elected a pro-independence president from the Democratic Progressive Party in 2016, China has stepped up its efforts to internationally isolate it.\n\nThe status of Taiwan is a potential flashpoint between Beijing and Washington, with Washington opposing reunification by force and maintaining robust informal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Trump administration has stepped up U.S. support of Taiwan rhetorically and materially from the previous administration.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which reiterates U.S. commitment to a peaceful resolution of the status of Taiwan.\n\nXi in his speech characterized reunification as inevitable and said that China would respect Taiwan's freedoms in a unified one country, two systems framework.\n\nHowever, Taiwan rebuffed Xi's remarks on Wednesday.\n\nForced unification is a folly. #Taiwan is a free & democratic country where #HumanRights are protected. Only its 23 million people can decide their own destiny. The leader of #China must join the rest of the global community & respect this reality, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nForced unification is a folly. #Taiwan is a free & democratic country where #HumanRights are protected.

I call on #China to bravely take steps towards democracy, so they can truly understand the people of #Taiwan, she said, referring to four conditions to more positive relations.\n\nAs president of the Republic of China, I must stress that we've never accepted the 1992 Consensus, & the four musts are crucial for positive cross-strait developments.

It is just a goal, she told the paper.\n\nAs far as his threat of reunification by force, she noted that Xi implied it would be a last resort.\n\nOf course, Xi has to leave that option on the table, but he makes clear it is not his preference, she said.
A poll released Monday by the nation's largest organization of pro-life youth found that 70 percent of millennials support limits on abortion.\n\nMillennials have lived with the harsh realities of abortion all their lives and understand more than their parents' generation that we must address the human rights issue of our day and make changes in defense of mothers and their preborn infants, said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America (SFLA). Millennials may reject labels in general, but when it comes to the specifics of abortion policy, they are anti-abortion.\n\nThe poll, conducted by pollster the polling company, inc./WomanTrend for SFLA's Institute for Pro-Life Advancement, asked 18-34-year-olds during the first week of January about their attitudes toward Roe v. Wade and America's current abortion policies.\n\nThe poll found that, while 56 percent of American millennials – now the largest voting bloc in the country – are political Independents, 65 percent want to vote on abortion policy, compared to only 16 percent who want abortion to remain in the hands of the courts, and 19 percent who are unsure.\n\nAccording to the poll, 20 percent of millennials identify themselves as Republicans and an equal percentage as Democrats.\n\nOf those surveyed, 70 percent support limits on abortion with 42 percent opposing abortion broadly and 28 percent supporting limits through specific policies like parental notification, restrictions on late-term abortions, and opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion.\n\nOnly 7% of Millennials agree with the Democratic Party on abortion. https://t.co/VCCm9HHad6 — Students for Life (@StudentsforLife) January 14, 2019\n\nAdditionally, only seven percent of millennials polled supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by tax dollars – the position embraced by the Democrat Party.\n\nOur poll found that Millennials do not blindly support unlimited abortion paid for with their tax dollars, no matter what the popular culture says, said Hawkins.\n\nAccording to the poll, 41 percent of Millennials supported Roe's reversal, with 33 percent opposed and 27 percent undecided. However, after being informed that Roe allows abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy, 51 percent said they opposed the decision, and 54 percent opposed it when they were informed abortion could be used as a form of contraception or when a mother does not want a baby of a particular sex.\n\nRegarding taxpayer funding for abortion, 45 percent of Millennials polled opposed it, with 33 percent supporting it, and 22 percent undecided.\n\nWhile the poll showed males and females responded similarly to the survey's questions about Roe, after learning more about the impact of Roe, women were more likely to be strongly opposed to it.\n\nWith about a third of abortions now induced by drugs like RU-486, 56 percent of Millennials surveyed opposed selling the abortion drugs online or dropping the requirement for a physical exam due to the potential risks to women.\n\nRegarding Planned Parenthood, 41 percent of Millennials polled had an unfavorable reaction to the abortion vendor after learning about the organization's political spending in the millions to elect pro-abortion candidates, as well as its more than $1 billion in income, about half of which is derived from American taxpayers.\n\nIn addition, 43 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable reaction to Planned Parenthood when they examined the organization's decline in basic healthcare services as seen in its own annual report.\n\nIn contrast, 48 percent of Millennials said they preferred taxpayer funds to go to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) rather than Planned Parenthood, to which 17 percent would send tax monies. FQHCs outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities 20 to 1, and they provide more comprehensive health care without abortions.\n\nTell us, why do YOU march for life?https://t.co/EqqIFkh8hh — Students for Life (@StudentsforLife) January 12, 2019\n\nHawkins observed the poll shows Millennials are not motivated by labels.\n\nOn the issue of abortion, labels like pro-life, pro-choice, access, health, or women's rights often camouflage the true realities of the policies that today crisscross the country, she said. Especially as we talk with Millennials, who are often outside the political structure of Washington D.C., the anti-abortion movement must be clear on what we are advancing and its impact on mothers, the preborn and taxpayers.\n\nAnd for those elected officials who want to engage in life-affirming legislation, Millennial voters are listening when you compassionately address the specifics of Life in law, she added.
A group of six New Orleans Saints players, including running back Mark Ingram, were refused entrance at the door of a posh British nightclub in London because they were too urban. But, the full story doesn't appear to be a race-based issue.\n\nIngram, Sterling More, Vonn Bell, and a few other Saints players decided to take in London's night life on Monday evening and at some point ended up in front of the exclusive Cirque Le Soir club in London's Soho district.\n\nWhen they tried to get in, though, the door keeper denied them entrance even though they had made a reservation ahead of time. Ingram claims that the bouncer told them they were too urban to get inside.\n\nNaturally many assumed that the club was using urban as code for race. Ingram quickly Tweeted out his experience.\n\nIngram also Tweeted a text message conversation he had about the incident with a friend.\n\nOne of the earliest to report on the incident was the UK Guardian, but the paper went with the story before any statement was made by the nightclub.\n\nLater than day, The Sun posted a statement by the establishment which noted that race had nothing to do with the door keepers denying entrance to the six players.\n\nIn fact, it appears that the club doesn't like to admit large, all-male parties and the club also has a dress code that the players clearly did not satisfy if their tweet that night was any indication.\n\nIn its statement the Club emphatically denied that the players were turned away because of race:\n\nAll of the team at Cirque le Soir are really upset by the suggestion that there was anything malicious in our turning away of Mark Ingram and his friends from the club on Monday 27th February. We proudly celebrate diversity, not only as part of our shows, but as part of who we are. We would not dismiss anyone as too urban and we would not turn anyone away on the basis of their ethnicity, sexuality or any other characteristic – other than those expressed in our door policy – as an exclusive members club, we cannot guarantee entry to anyone and full discretion always lies with the door, we particularly discourage casual dress code, intoxicated customers and male heavy entourages. Discretion lies with our door staff and while we sympathise with Mark and his friends we fully support our employees' right to challenge groups that do not adhere to our door policy. Admitting an all-male group goes against our policy and is clearly stated on Facebook and on all reservation confirmation emails.\n\nThe club added that they would love to have Ingram back along with his choice of a female guest.\n\nThis same club has drawn criticism in the past for its exclusive door rules. Back in 2015 controversy erupted when a promoter issued messages to guests telling them not to bring fat people to the club.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
Americans are elated that five U.S. citizens held captive in Iran have been freed–but also worry about the steep cost.\n\nThe deal is, first of all, typically lopsided. In exchange for five Americans–who were likely innocent of much of all charges–Iran will secure the release of seven guilty Iranians, plus charges dropped against 14 others who violated international sanctions and whom the U.S. wanted extradited. Two Americans still remain behind in Iran.\n\nWorse, It is clear that Iran used its American prisoners as a bargaining chip–first to ensure that the U.S. dropped sanctions as the Iran nuclear deal went through; second, to expand its ballistic missile program in violation of the U.N. resolution giving effect to that deal; and third, to humiliate the U.S., most recently in the arrest of ten sailors.\n\nWe now know that the reason the Obama administration dropped plans for new sanctions against Iran in late December–sanctions that had been triggered by Iran's forbidden launch of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles–after the Iranian regime threatened to cancel the prisoner swap.\n\nEssentially, for the price of five Americans, Iran gained the ability to threaten millions of people with missiles that will one day carry the nuclear warheads the Iran deal enables the regime to develop–legally–once it expires.\n\nMost likely, the Obama administration also declined to admit Iran had violated the Geneva Convention rights of captive U.S. Navy sailors last week for the same reason.\n\nThe Obama administration is celebrating the exchange as a confirmation of its foreign policy. The Washington Post, overjoyed at the return of its reporter, Jason Rezaian, agrees, saying that the U.S. and Iran had moved into a new era of international relations. Perhaps–not friendship, but rather a new balance in which Iran holds the upper hand.
The California water supply is suffering serious degradation from the 99 percent of unlicensed marijuana cultivators that remain unlicensed to avoid taxes and environmental regulation.\n\nCalifornia's voter-approved Proposition 64 legalization of recreational marijuana initiative stated the law's purpose and intent was to establish goals to prevent illegal production or distribution of marijuana through licensing to eliminate known environmental degradation of water resources due to uncontrolled wasteful use; pesticides; fertilizers; erosion; irrigation runoff; petroleum and other chemicals; trash and human waste.\n\nCalifornia's temperate climate supports over 50,000 outdoor marijuana farms in almost every area of the state, but it is mostly concentrated in the three Northwestern California counties Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity that are known as the Emerald Triangle.\n\nBut despite four months of legalization, 99 percent outdoor farms remain unlicensed and the number of farms is growing rapidly. Unlicensed and illegal Emerald Triangle marijuana farmers are especially attracted to the area due to its isolated nature, vast amounts of unused forest land and plenty of river and spring water.\n\nThe authoritative peer-reviewed, 'Impacts of Surface Water Diversions for Marijuana Cultivation' published in the POLS ONE journal, estimated that marijuana cultivation in the Emerald Triangle has the potential to cause a 23 percent reduction of stream flow during the driest periods of the year. Such diminished streamflow is likely to lethal to salmon, steelhead trout and cause further decline of sensitive amphibian species.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy senior freshwater ecologist Jennifer Carah told the Water Education Foundation that illegal marijuana cultivation across California imperils fish and human drinking and agricultural water quality and supply: The unpermitted forest clear-cutting and road construction can dramatically increase erosion, which can cause large amounts of sediment to flow down into streams, causing water quality problems.\n\nCarah added that although marijuana cultivation impact on local water sources has been studied on the South Fork of the Eel River in Mendocino and Humboldt counties, to my knowledge, nobody has mapped cannabis cultivation at the state or regional scale yet.\n\nFriends of the Eel River Conservation Director Scott Greacen at a California Water Policy Conference at the University of California Davis in March blamed the worst marijuana cultivation water resource damage on unlicensed so-called trespass grows on U.S. National Forest lands that legalization has failed to stop: They are the most damaging per unit and those are the kind we need to get rid of.\n\nSacramento-based water and environmental regulatory litigator with Kronick Moskovitz Tiedemann & Girard, Hanspeter Walter, told the Water Education Foundation that eventually the environmental damage from illegal marijuana cultivators in the Emerald Triangle will fade as licensed high-productivity farmers in Yolo and Monterrey counties with flat land and better weather will come to dominate the marijuana production.\n\nBreitbart News reported that California's Bureau of Cannabis Control projections that legal marijuana industry would grow at about the same 28 percent compounded rate as the roll-out of Internet broadband access in the 1990s, resulting in state and local tax collections of $1 billion in 2018 spiking to $3 billion by 2021.\n\nBut through February, California marijuana tax collection was 15 percent below forecast, due to a 23 percent price spike for legal marijuana due to a 15 percent state excise and local government taxes on recreational marijuana.
Brain Kolfage, a triple amputee Air Force veteran who raised $20 million to pay for a border wall, announced the launch of a non-profit on Friday, but a GoFundMe spokesperson said it would refund all of the money raised on the website unless donors proactively request to have their money transferred to the new organization.\n\nKolfage said in a Business Wire press release:\n\nWe are grateful for the president's steadfast commitment to border security, the single most important issue plaguing our country. Rather than subsidizing the federal government, which has betrayed the American people by obstructing President Donald Trump's agenda, 'We Build the Wall' is taking the president's signature campaign promise into our own hands. I personally will not take a penny of compensation from these donations incurred in the furtherance of this mission.\n\nIn less than a month, Kolfage raised more than $20 million from more than 300,000 donors, with an ultimate goal of $1 billion. The effort included working with lawmakers and legal experts to find ways to allow Americans to help fund a border wall.\n\nBut the obstacles frustrated Kolfage – including the difficulty of giving money to the United States Treasury for a specific purpose – and ultimately led to a new tact for completing his mission. Kolfage said:\n\nBetter equipped than our own federal government, we have made significant progress in less than a month, having begun extensive due diligence and commenced feasibility studies. We are already taking action on identifying the most densely crossed areas of the border, soliciting affected landowners along the Southern border, and ascertaining the willingness of border landowners to provide no or low-cost easements on their property for wall construction.\n\nThe new 501(c)4 called We Build the Wall, Inc., has formed a board of directors that Folgate will lead and a team of advisers to provide critical guidance on the project's legal, engineering, contracting, environmental, accounting, maintenance, and real estate issues and serve on the advisory board and or the construction, finance and or audit committees, the Business Wire press release said.\n\nBut the financial transition from GoFundMe to the new venture isn't guaranteed. A spokesman for the website said the money raised would not automatically go to the new organization, according to the Hill:\n\nWhen the campaign was created, the campaign organizer specifically stated on the campaign page, 'If we don't reach our goal or come significantly close we will refund every single penny,' GoFundMe spokesperson Bobby Whithorne told The Hill on Friday. He also stated on the campaign page, '100 percent of your donations will go to the Trump Wall. If for ANY reason we don't reach our goal we will refund your donation.' However, that did not happen. This means all donors will receive a refund, Whithorne continued. If a donor does not want a refund, and they want their donation to go to the new organization, they must proactively elect to redirect their donation to that organization. If they do not take that step, they will automatically receive a full refund.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that Whithorne said GoFundMe would contact all donors by email about the status of their donation.\n\nSome of those named to lead the non-profit were included in the Business Wire press release:\n\nKris Kobach — Secretary Kobach served as the Secretary of State of the State of Kansas from 2011-2019. A leader in the national effort to stop voter fraud, he drafted and pushed for the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act of 2011, which made Kansas the first state in the Union to combine photo ID requirements at the polls, equivalent ID requirements for mail-in ballots, and proof of citizenship at the time of registration. John Daniel Moran, Jr. — Mr. Moran is an American businessman, entrepreneur and industrialist best known for his role as President and CEO of Moran Industries, Inc., a warehousing, logistics and transportation company based in Pennsylvania that was founded in 1975. Erik Prince — Mr. Prince is an American businessman and Navy SEAL best known as the founder of the security firm Blackwater. He serves as Chairman of Frontier Resource Group, a private equity fund investing in natural resource opportunities in frontier markets. Dr. Robert S. Spalding III, Brig Gen, USAF (Ret.) — General Spalding is an accomplished innovator in government and a national security policy strategist. He was the chief architect of the framework for national competition in the Trump Administration's widely praised National Security Strategy (NSS), and the Senior Director for Strategy to the President. Angel Dad Steve Ronnebeck — Mr. Ronnebeck lost his 21-year-old son Grant, who was brutally executed by a criminal illegal immigrant over for a pack of cigarettes while working at a convenience store in 2015. Steve has dedicated himself to protecting other families from suffering needless tragedies at the hands of people who have no business being here in the first place through his work with the Ronnebeck Foundation. Angel Mom Mary Ann Mendoza — Ms. Mendoza lost her son Brandon in 2014, after his police car was hit by an intoxicated driver who was in the U.S. illegally. She is one of several parents who have been meeting with President Trump about how to tighten restrictions on immigrants in the country illegally. Sara Carter — Ms. Carter is an award-winning Fox News commentator who specializes in reporting on the border and opioid crisis. Sheriff David Clarke — Sheriff Clarke is an American former law enforcement official who served as Sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Congressman Tom Tancredo — Mr. Tancredo is a former United States Congressman who has been referred to as Congress' most vociferous critic of current immigration policy. He served in the Reagan Administration and ran for President of the United States in the 2008 election.\n\nIt is not clear if Kolfage, board members, or advisers will be compensated for their work.\n\nWhen government fails in its most important duties — protecting its citizens and preserving the country's sovereignty — We the People have the right to do it ourselves, Kobach said.\n\nOur team firmly believes that we can complete our segments of the wall for less than half of the government's estimated costs on a per mile basis, and in a much shorter time frame, Prince said.

Culture secretary Nicky Morgan has warned that the BBC could go the way of Blockbuster — becoming a total irrelevancy and going bust — unless it evolves.\n\nBaroness Morgan made the remarks as her department launches a consultation on decriminalising payment of the licence fee which funds the British Broadcasting Corporation, saying accountability and value for money must be at the heart of how the BBC is funded.\n\nThe TV tax is compulsory for anyone who watches live or records live television or uses BBC iPlayer. Payment is mandatory even if you watch live programming on a computer, phone, or other device and even if you watch live television from other providers but do not watch BBC programming at all.\n\nLast year on the campaign trail, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had questioned whether it was right to continuing forcing consumers to sustain the BBC, saying: How long can you justify a system whereby everybody who has a TV has to pay to fund a particular set of channels?\n\nIn the consultation, Britons will be asked whether criminal sanctions should continue to be imposed for non-payment, or whether another method should be used.\n\nThe culture secretary had written in the Daily Mail: Twenty years ago Blockbuster, the then heavyweight of video rentals, turned down a £38m merger offer from Netflix.\n\nToday Netflix is worth £50bn, 1,300 times its offer to Blockbuster — which has gone from 3,000 stores to a museum in Oregon, for people who want to remember what video cassettes look like.\n\nTony Hall, the head of the BBC, is stepping down from his job: the latest hugely satisfying and thoroughly deserved victim of 'Get woke, go broke'… https://t.co/OtsCt1o2xC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 20, 2020\n\nWe don't want a beacon of British values and world-class entertainment ending up like Blockbuster, Baroness Morgan of Cotes added.\n\nThe broadcaster said that stopping the criminalisation of paying the licence could cost them £200 million a year. However, the government says that doing so would free up Britain's criminal courts and protect vulnerable, poorer members of society. Failure to pay the television licence can result in a £1,000 fine, court attendance, and even imprisonment.\n\nIn 2018, 121,000 people were convicted of television licence evasion and sentenced, with five in England and Wales going to prison.\n\nThat threat of going to prison is also going to be dropped, with Baroness Morgan set to say at the Policy Exchange think tank: Many people consider it wrong that you can be imprisoned for not paying for your TV licence and that its enforcement punishes the vulnerable.\n\nPayment of the BBC's TV tax is policed by enforcement officers, who employ detection vans which can detect the use of TV receiving equipment at specifically targeted addresses within minutes. If you notify TV Licencing that you no longer need a licence, the body may send enforcement officers to your home to confirm whether you still need to pay the tax.\n\nControversy surrounds the BBC's plans to charge the country's 3.7 million over-75s, with exemptions for those on pension credit, the tax to watch television. MPs expressed concern last year that so-called outreach officers visiting the elderly to remind them that they have to pay the £157.50 a year could be frightening. The BBC had agreed to take on the responsibility to pay the fees from the government in 2015, but later claimed that it could not afford to do so.\n\nThe Department for Digital Culture, Media and Sport said that any changes to punishment for not paying the TV tax would not come into effect until April 2022.\n\nBBC a 'Secular Church' That 'Preaches' on Climate Change, Against Brexit: Guest Editor https://t.co/DM3VdFl8ld — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2019\n\nThe licence fee is currently £154.50 a year but is set to go up by £3 in April to £157.50. By comparison, Amazon Prime, which includes a streaming service, costs £79 a year; a single-user Netflix costs £6.99 a month, or £83.88 a year; and NOW TV's basic Entertainment Pass costs £7.99 a month, or £95.88 annually, meaning that a consumer could almost cover the cost of two subscription services for what they are forced to pay per year to support the BBC.\n\nThe current licence is protected by Royal Charter until 2027 and provides the broadcaster with £3.7 billion a year in revenue. Despite the rising cost of the TV tax, the BBC announced last week that it would be axing 450 jobs in its news services in an attempt to save £80 million by 2022.\n\nThis is not the first time that the BBC has been told to evolve or die. Viewing figured revealed last year that fewer than half (49 per cent) of Britons aged 16 to 24 watch BBC programmes even a minimum of once a week. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom warned the BBC in October warned that public support for the licence fee could become eroded in future.\n\nPublic support in the licence fee is already eroded, however, with a YouGov poll from December showing that half of Britons want the TV tax scrapped and the BBC to earn its own money, rather than simply be entitled to it.
(JNS) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to meet at the White House in late March, a few weeks before the Israeli election, Israel Hayom has learned.\n\nNetanyahu plans to visit the United States to attend the annual Policy Conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nThe conference will take place from March 24-26. Israelis will go to the polls on April 9.\n\nNetanyahu associates say the details of summit with Trump have not been finalized, but a source close to the prime minister said that he regularly attends the AIPAC conference, and he is expected to do so this year as well, despite it taking place so close to the election.\n\nA senior official in the Trump administration told Israel Hayom on Tuesday: We do not have anything to announce at this time.\n\nNetanyahu's visit to the United States in March 2015 also took place two weeks before the Israeli election that year.\n\nAt that time, apart from speaking at the AIPAC conference, he spoke before a joint meeting of Congress. His invitation to appear before Congress was not coordinated with then-President Barack Obama, who refused to meet with Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu and Trump may also meet later this month during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
Democrats have grabbed several concessions from President Donald Trump in the border wall talks, but continue to claim that economic migrants from Central America should be welcomed as refugees who deserve humanitarian aid from taxpayers.\n\nThe Trump concessions include a quiet Christmas request for $2.5 billion instead of the current request $5.7 billion for wall construction in 2019, Trump's decision to drop plans for a concrete wall, and Trump's offer to restart former President Barack Obama's Central American Minors program that was intended to shuttle youths and children from Central America to their illegal migrant parents living in the United States.\n\nThe Trump concessions were acknowledged January 7 by Vice President Mike Pence as he briefed reporters on the progress of negotiations. But Pence complained that the Democrats had not offered any concessions of their own:\n\nThe question that I have is: When are the Democrats going to start negotiating? We made the position of the President very clear, not only in terms of what our proposal is; we've integrated some of their proposals … We stand ready to sit down with the Democratic leadership.\n\nDemocrats have offered nothing in exchange, said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at Numbers USA.\n\nThe President went to the negotiating table in good faith. He started with a far smaller [wall funding] number than the original $25 billion and was willing to negotiate further. The [Democratic] response was crickets. At this point, Republicans need to stop negotiating with themselves and wait for the Democrats to come to the table with a offer.\n\nThe Democrats' refusal to negotiate was spotlighted by the failure of January 9 talks between Trump and top Democrats.\n\nJust left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019\n\nIn their response to the President's January 8 address to the nation, Democrats charged that Trump is motivated by malice and claimed the flow of wage-cutting economic migrants deserves a compassionate, welcoming response.\n\nMuch of what we heard from President Trump during this senseless shutdown has been misinformation and even malice, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.\n\nIn his January 8 address to the nation, Trump described his decision to drop his proposed concrete wall as a concession to Democrats. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall, he said.\n\nIn his January 7 briefing, Pence explained the short-lived compromise offer of a $2.5 billion wall request was immediately rejected by Democrats.\n\nI can neither nor deny the numbers that have floated around about what was offered on the first day of the shutdown [before Christmas]. But I can assure you, it came from the President of the United States. And Senator [Chuck] Schumer knows that. They were provided with documentation of that, that day, to Senator [Mike] Leahy's office and to Senator [Richard] Shelby's office … after Christmas that we were informed there would not be a counteroffer.\n\nPence described additional budget proposals as concessions, even though White House officials welcomed the extra spending. He said:\n\nWe incorporated ideas that Democrat leaders and Democrat staff had brought to our attention over the course of meeting of principals and over the course of the staff meeting. And we were able to clear with the President those things that the administration was prepared to support. We added those to our request.\n\nThose changes included extra funding for technology to detect drugs in vehicles as they pass through the border, plus extra medical support for migrants arriving at the U.S. border. He said:\n\nWe have vetted $800 million to address enhanced medical support, transportation, and consumable supplies … we believe that increasing that by $631 million over the '19 level would meet the need of providing the kind of non-intrusive technology to allow us to get at — and not just narcotics, but also, most especially, about human trafficking issues at the border.\n\nThe least recognized concession to the Democrats was the proposed restoration of Obama's CAM program, which was quickly frozen in February 2017 by Trump's deputies. Pence said:\n\nAnother proposal that was brought to us by the Democratic leadership and that, frankly, I've heard about in my meetings with leaders of Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. And that is, they made a request that we consider allowing children to apply for asylum at our embassy in those countries, as opposed to only being able to apply for asylum by making the long and dangerous journey north.\n\nHowever, the restoration of the CAM program would not automatically ensure the delivery of any migrants to their illegal parents in the United States unless the Democrats also demanded a minimal number of transfers each year.\n\nPence coupled the CAM concession with Trump's call for legal reforms which would allow the federal government to return younger migrants who lose their court appeals for asylum. He said:\n\nThe President and the Secretary of State and I met over that issue, and the President has endorsed that reform that obviously would require a statutory change, along with reallocation of State Department resources in the State Department appropriations bill, but it's one that we're prepared to support. And we also believe that we should match that with one other statutory change that the Secretary just alluded to, which is unaccompanied children who apply for asylum, who, after due process, are determined not to be eligible for asylum … We cannot return them, even if their families request them to be — we cannot return them to their families in Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala.\n\nThe reciprocal reform, he said, would cut the economic incentive for the cartels to smuggle children and youths into the United States:\n\nSo we think — what the Secretary described, is that pull-factor. We think that — by allowing children to apply for asylum in those countries [via the CAM program] and by making it clear that those that are not eligible for asylum will be returned to the countries, we think that we will take part of the incentive that human traffickers use to take thousands of dollars cash to take children on a long and dangerous journey, oftentimes facing physical and sexual abuse along the way north, to attempt to come into our country to take advantage of loopholes in our laws.\n\nSince Trump's deputies canceled the CAM program, they have also stepped up identity checks of illegals migrants who pay the cartels to deliver their children to shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats loudly oppose those changes and say migrant youths should be quickly delivered to illegal-migrant sponsors in the United States without any checks on their legal right to live in the United States.\n\nIn his talks with the media, Trump has also hinted at broader concessions, including a huge immigration bill that would provide business with more workers and Democrats with more future voters. In his January 19 exchange with reporters, Trump said:\n\nI would love to do a big immigration bill where we really repair the situation. … Right now we have a problem, we have to take care of this and it's quicker and easier to do this individually. But we would like to see real immigration reform in this country because we need it and it could be a beautiful thing. With all of the companies coming into our country … we have many car companies and other companies that are going in. Best job numbers … We have the best job numbers, we need people, we need great, qualified people. We want them to come in. So I think it's a great time right now, because of this. … Everybody wants to see immigration reform. It's just, it's overdue. It's always been very political. Maybe this [shutdown crisis] will turn out to be a blessing in disguise … We need strong borders and we need immigration reform, beyond that, we need immigration reform.\n\nAny broader immigration reform would be a very risky step by Trump, partly because it would likely put an instant freeze on pay raises before the 2020 elections.\n\nCurrently, companies are raising wages for blue-collar workers because they have begun competing for employees in a tight labor market. That market is created by the combination of a growing economy and Trump's Hire American policy of lower migration.\n\nWages for white-collar workers are growing slower, in part, because companies already have outsourced jobs to roughly 1.5 million non-immigrant visa workers throughout the United States.\n\nDemocrats reject Trump's call for border security – then call for acceptance of more refugees as a humanitarian challenge. IOW, Dems won't recognize that economic migration is a threat to their voters' blue-collar wages & civic equality, See California https://t.co/DLgg0vTMav — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 9, 2019\n\nThe Democrats are not negotiating at all, said Rosemary Jenks of NumbersUSA. They're not at the table, and that is why we are in Day 19 of the shutdown. [For Democrats] this isn't a negotiation — this is 'We're going to slap the face of the entire country and we don't give a damn.' she said.\n\nThe Democrats' no-concessions policy is being aided by the establishment media, Jenks said. Reporters are yelling questions to the president saying 'How long as re you going to let the shutdown go on?' When are they going to ask the Democrats to do that?\n\nBut Democrast will not budge until they feel more pressure from supporters and voters, she said:\n\nUntil either the federal workers' unions — which have a lot of sway — put more pressure on them, until the American people start getting in touch with Democratic politicians, I think the Democrats will refuse to move, despite the fact that what they are doing is against the interests of the American people and of America.\n\nNationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.

West Virginia state legislators introduced a bill that would require the state's schools to offer an elective course on Hebrew Scriptures, the Old Testament, or the New Testament in the Bible.\n\nState Sens. Mike Azinger (R-Wood) and Sue Cline (R-Wyoming) submitted Senate Bill 252 to the West Virginia Senate Thursday for consideration, WOWK reported.\n\nThe text of the bill states that the course would teach students knowledge of biblical content, characters, poetry, and narratives that are prerequisites to understanding contemporary society and culture, including literature, art, music, mores, oratory, and public policy.\n\nIt would also require the schools to follow federal and state laws on religious neutrality, meaning that they must accommodate students' diverse religious views.\n\nThe course also cannot endorse, favor, disfavor, or show hostility toward any particular religion or faith, according to federal law.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, the Bible electives would be made available at all grade levels.\n\nSome schools in the state already offer these electives, although not everybody is happy about them.\n\nA West Virginia mother sued her child's school district in 2017 for its 75-year practice of providing Bible classes to students, alleging that her child was being forced to take the classes.
NEW YORK — Demand Justice, an organization founded by former members of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and associated with a social welfare organization financed by billionaire activist George Soros, is raising money for an eventual court fight against what the group describes as President Trump's proposed racist, unnecessary wall.\n\nDemand Justice claims: This lawless president has created a humanitarian crisis along the southern border of our country by targeting asylum seekers; already, two children have died in U.S. border patrol custody.\n\nThe organization fails to mention that Trump's proposed barrier seeks to stop the humanitarian crisis of illegal aliens, including children, attempting the dangerous trek to cross the porous U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn an email blast, Demand Justice asks supporters for $5 to eventually challenge any proposed barrier in the court system:\n\nIf Trump takes this unprecedented action, it WILL be challenged in the courts. This is why we fight. Give $5 now. We won't allow Trump to hold our country hostage with his fearmongering and scare tactics. The courts may be our last line of defense against Trump's authoritarian impulses and now is the time to show him we won't stand down. Give $5 now to help us fight back.\n\nClinton herself put her name on a separate fundraising email pitch via her associated Onward Together progressive organization seeking funds to fight back against the administration's hateful rhetoric and harmful policies — donate directly to the organizations helping to reunite and provide support to families seeking asylum at the border.\n\nDemand Justice, which formed last year, took center stage when it helped lead opposition to Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Breitbart News reported that less than one hour after Trump announced Kavanagh as his nominee, Demand Justice had already put up the website stopkavanaugh.com, exclaiming: We need to demand that the Senate defeat the Brett Kavanaugh nomination.\n\nThe organization came under news media scrutiny for its refusal to disclose its donor list. The Associated Press reported:\n\nDemand Justice was formed just a few months ago and is structured in such a way that it doesn't have to file annual tax returns. That's because it's fiscally sponsored by a tax-exempt social welfare organization called the Sixteen Thirty Fund. The Sixteen Thirty Fund files federal tax returns but doesn't have to disclose the identities of its donors.\n\nA recent Daily Caller investigation found that Soros's Open Society Policy Center (OSPC) previously donated some $2.2 million to the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the fiscal sponsor for Demand Justice.\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund describes itself as providing a fiscal sponsorship vehicle for donors to direct capital toward social welfare projects that include advocacy, lobbying, and some political and electoral activities.\n\nDemand Justice was founded by Brian Fallon, who served as press secretary for Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The group's digital team is headed by Gabrielle McCaffrey, who was a digital organizer for Clinton's campaign.\n\nWorking at Demand Justice is Paige Herwig, a former Judiciary Committee aide to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Prior to her stint with Feinstein, Herwig served as counselor to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nAccording to emails released by the Justice Department, Herwig was included in a chain of emails crafting the initial media response into Lynch's infamous tarmac meeting at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBI's main subject in a criminal probe, boarded the attorney general's plane and reportedly stayed there for about 20 minutes.\n\nDemand Justice's formation was encouraged by former Obama White House counselor John Podesta, who served as chairman of Clinton's latest presidential campaign. We have ignored this field of battle for too long, Podesta told the New York Times regarding Demand Justice.\n\nEven before Trump announced Kavanaugh as his nominee, Demand Justice committed to spending about $5 million to oppose the eventual nominee. The organization seeks to raise $10 million in its first year.\n\nIn a recent interview with the New York Times, Fallon would not comment on the source of the group's financing, but the newspaper noted that he was a featured speaker at the conference of the Democracy Alliance, a grouping of progressive donors.\n\nDemocracy Alliance's founding donors include Soros and billionaire Tom Steyer. Indeed, Fallon's panel at Democracy Alliance was moderated by Sarah Knight of Soros's Open Society Foundations.\n\nDemocracy Alliance directs donors to leftist groups, including the ACLU, the Women's March, Media Matters for America, and reportedly the radical Indivisible group known for storming Republican townhalls. Democracy Alliance highlighted anti-Trump organizations to donors in a resistance map suggesting which activist groups would be opportune for funding. Already, Indivisible received funds from donors and coalitions associated with Democracy Alliance financiers, the New York Times reported.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

To President Barack Obama, radical Islamic terrorists have more rights than U.S. Navy sailors.\n\nEarlier this week, the administration freed ten Guantánamo Bay terror detainees–the largest release ever–in an attempt to close the prison that it believes violates the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war.\n\nOn Friday, the Obama White House claimed that Iran had not violated the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war when it humiliated U.S. Navy sailors it arrested in the Persian Gulf on Tuesday,because we are not at war with Iran.\n\nSo to Obama, the Geneva Convention applies to stateless terrorists–who are not parties to the convention, and are not lawful combatants–but not to U.S. sailors captured and detained by Iran at gunpoint in a hostile rescue. There are at least five reasons that the Obama administration is wrong to defend Iran, and wrong about the Convention.\n\n1. The Geneva Convention applies even if there is no formal war. Article 2 of the Geneva Convention states that at least some of its provisions apply in peacetime, and that they apply in armed conflicts falling short of war, even if one side of the conflict does not recognize that a state of war exists between the two countries in question.\n\n2. Iran's arrest of the sailors and seizure of the boats was hostile. As former POW Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) noted, Under international law, sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Iran's actions were hostile and fall under the Convention.\n\n3. Britain insisted the Geneva Convention applied in a similar case in 2007. As PBS reported at the time.\n\n4. The Geneva Convention gives captured prisoners the benefit of the doubt. Article 5 of the Convention states that prisoners that fall into the hands of the enemy enjoy its protections until a competent tribunal rules otherwise.\n\n5. Obama claimed the Geneva Convention applies broadly, even to non-parties not officially at war. In a seminal foreign policy speech in 2007, candidate Obama made it clear that he considered terror detainees protected by the Geneva Conventions: As President, I will close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act, and adhere to the Geneva Conventions. Yet terrorists are not parties to the Convention, or officially at war with us.\n\n6. Obama committed to uphold the Geneva Conventions in all circumstances. In his Nobel Peace Prize speech, Obama made a point of his support for the Conventions, adding: we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it's easy, but when it is hard. In this case, we must defend the Conventions even if confronting Iran is hard.\n\n7. Obama is required by his Oath of Office to defend our troops abroad. By that oath, Obama should be arguing that our troops are protected by the Geneva Convention–not looking for loopholes that allow them to be abused. In arguing that Iran did nothing wrong by parading U.S. sailors in front of the cameras, and forcing a female sailor to wear a hijab (head covering), Obama is inviting more abuses of American troops' rights and dignity in the future.\n\nThis article has been updated.
Although he provided few details, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told his parliament on Monday that Japan's forces acted to defend American military aircraft for the first time during a recent mission. His remarks strongly implied the mission had something to do with North Korea.\n\nWith tensions growing over North Korea, the Self-Defense Forces carried out a mission to protect U.S. vessels and aircraft for the first time, Abe said.\n\nAn alliance gets stronger if the partners can help each other. The Japan-U.S. alliance has without a doubt become stronger than ever, he declared.\n\nStars and Stripes described Japanese officials as tight-lipped about the operation Abe referred to, with several high-ranking defense officials refusing requests from reporters for more details. The U.S. military was no more forthcoming.\n\nWithout much to go on, Stars and Stripes theorized Abe might have been alluding to a mission last spring where a Japanese helicopter carrier escorted a U.S. Navy vessel to resupply one of the warships protecting Japan from North Korean missiles. That seems a bit less remarkable than what the prime minister alluded to, or perhaps that mission was more exciting than previously reported.\n\nOne reason Abe addressed the Diet on this subject is that laws allowing Japanese self-defense forces to protect Americans and other allied forces only went into effect last March. Before that, it was only legal for Japan to defend allies ships, planes, or ground forces if Japan itself was also under attack.\n\nThere was considerable unhappiness among the Japanese public that Abe implemented this policy change, and perhaps more importantly, policy changes that allow Japan to deploy its forces overseas, without amending the national constitution. Abe has long expressed a desire to reform the pacifist constitution but felt the urgency of the North Korean threat called for some changes to be implemented more quickly.\n\nJapan may take some comfort from the Pentagon's report this week that American defenses against potential North Korean missile attack have improved. The report's optimism was buoyed by what it described as a nearly flawless test intercept in May of the most realistic ICBM target missile employed to date. However, critics still believe testing has not adequately simulated the difficulty of taking out a live weapon employing defensive countermeasures.
Several Hollywood unions urged members to shut down film production after authorities deemed Southern California to be the most dangerous area in the country due to the coronavirus.\n\nSAG-AFTRA, the Producers Guild, and a group of TV and film advertisers have joined together to urge film production to be immediately shutdown over the coronavirus, Deadline reported. The Joint Policy Committee of the Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies joined the unions in urging a halt to productions.\n\nSouthern California hospitals are facing a crisis the likes of which we have never seen before, SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement. Patients are dying in ambulances waiting for treatment because hospital emergency rooms are overwhelmed. This is not a safe environment for in-person production right now.\n\nDavid White, SAG-AFTRA's national executive director, added:\n\nEven putting aside the risk of acquiring Covid on set – a risk that we have done a great deal to mitigate through our safety protocols – on-set production always poses some risk of injury, whether because of a stunt gone wrong, an equipment failure, or a garden-variety fall. Right now, with few, if any, hospital beds available, it is hard to understand how a worker injured on set is supposed to seek treatment. I would like to thank the JPC and the PGA for their efforts to reinforce safety measures for all, and we acknowledge and appreciate the major studios and other producers who have proactively stepped up and postponed their production during this emergency.\n\nIt is too hard to say right now when the situation may improve, but we are monitoring closely and will make sure that our members have the information they need to make the best decisions they can to protect themselves and our community, White added.\n\nPGA presidents Gail Berman and Lucy Fisher also insisted that health concerns necessitate the shutdown of production, adding, Hopefully, we will be back to work soon. And Stacy Marcus, chief negotiator for the Joint Policy Committee, exclaimed that the risk is simply too great… to performers, crew, and industry personnel to continue production.\n\nThis avalanche of demands came on the heels of determinations by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which sent recommendations to the film industry to shut down production in the face of rising coronavirus numbers.\n\nAlthough music, TV, and film productions are allowed to operate, the health department said late last month, we ask you to strongly consider pausing work for a few weeks during this catastrophic surge in Covid cases. Identify and delay higher risk activities, and focus on lower-risk work for now, if at all possible.\n\nFinally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has similarly declared Southern California to be ground zero for the virus and called the region the most dangerous area in the U.S.A., according to Deadline.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.
Democratic legislators dodged in the House when Republicans spotlighted their unpopular effort to scrub the male and female sexes from the language allowed by congressional committees.\n\nShow me where it says in writing that we're canceling Mother's Day or that you can refer to yourself as a husband or father or mother or grandmother, said a flustered Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), the chairman of the House Committee on Rules. The committee set the ban for all committees on words and terms that acknowledge the male or female sex of people, such as fathers or mothers.\n\nMcGovern continued, Give me a break. Enough is enough. We have to stop this. And we have to focus in on solving the problems that face the American people.\n\nThis [rules] package honors all gender identities by changing pronouns in the House written rules. So they are gender-neutral. Look, we made this change for the sake of inclusion, not exclusion, McGovern insisted.\n\nMcGovern's response came as several GOP legislators highlighted the language barring references to a person's sex.\n\nI'm a proud husband, proud father of a son and a daughter — they don't even want you to be able to say that anymore, said GOP whip, Steve Scalise (R-LA).\n\nThe Democrats rule package takes out words like mother and father and brother and sister in their quest to not offend anyone, said Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ). They're offending, almost all of America, Lesko added.\n\nThe new language is included in the new rules for the congressional committee in 2021 and 2022. The Democrats drafted the rules and pushed them through Congress on Monday, via a 217 to 206 party-line vote.\n\nThe rules comply with the gender identity ideology that denies the male or female sex of each person and insists on the so-called gender-neutral language that hides the male or female sex of people.\n\nThe gender language is usually advocated by those who claim that the law should treat a person's sense of their gender as more important than their biological sex. For example, a man who claims that he is transgender should be allowed to race in women's athletic competitions, say the advocates for transgenderism.\n\nFor example, the rules require the committees to use the plural pronoun themself instead of the singular pronouns, the male himself or the female herself.\n\nThe Democrats' new rules also say:\n\nIn clause 8(c)(3) of rule XXIII, strike ''father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, step-sister, half brother, half sister, grandson, or grand-daughter'' and insert ''parent, child, sibling, parent's sibling, first cousin, sibling's child, spouse, parent-in-law, child-in-law, sibling-in-law, stepparent, step-child, stepsibling, half-sibling, or grandchild.\n\nI've noticed the dangerous trend against free speech in recent years, responded Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who denounced the language rules and also the Democrats' decision in the rules package to prevent extended debates on bills by filing a Motion to Recommit during a floor debate:\n\nIt began in our schools on college campuses where our students are taught the absurd notion that free speech is about privilege and power, and not open debate and rational deliberation. For our constituents, taking away means freedom of speech is silent and good ideas are stifled. … The resolution strips all mentioned the words of father, mother, son, daughter, brother, mother in law, daughter in law. I'm a proud father. I'm an extremely proud son. But we're going strike them from the rules. First we take your speech away. Then we take what you can say.\n\nThe Democrats' increasing determination to hide the biological differences between men and women, or to recognize the complementarity of the two sexes, is driven by the growing clout of the well-funded transgender movement among progressives.\n\nPolls show that Americans do not want to be hostile to people who wish to live as members of the opposite sex. But the polls also show that the policy changes required by the transgender ideology are deeply unpopular and are increasingly opposed by conservatives and feminists. Breitbart News reported in October 2020:\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 3,500 likely voters across geographic regions, ethnicity, sex, and political affiliation, showed how unpopular such policies are in America, despite activist and media attempts to normalize them. Even liberal voters, according to the poll, disapprove of efforts to undermine biological sex with gender ideology. Overall, results found 66.93 percent of those polled say they strongly disagree with gender identity policies, including a majority of liberal voters.\n\nIn 2019, House Democrats passed a bill that would establish the transgender ideology by giving people the legal right to force other people to treat them as members of the opposite sex. The draft bill is called the Equality Act and will get another vote in 2021.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the right-of-center Conservative Party has rolled back plans to promote the transgender ideology. The shift was caused by rising opposition from a wide range of voters and by increasing evidence of medical damage to girls and boys, women and men.
All train, bus and ferry passengers travelling from Denmark to Sweden will from Monday be required to show photo identification before being allowed across the border in a drastic move by the Swedish government to stem an unprecedented migrant influx.\n\nTravellers have been warned to expect long queues and delays once the checks go into effect from midnight (2300 GMT) on the Danish side of the Oresund bridge-and-tunnel link, which has been a major entry point for migrants and refugees hoping to start a new life in Sweden.\n\nThe measures are aimed at keeping out undocumented migrants and come after Sweden — which has taken in more asylum seekers per capita than any other European nation — said it could no longer cope with the unregulated flow of new arrivals.\n\nA temporary fence has already been erected at Copenhagen airport's Kastrup station, where trains will be stopped for the mandatory controls, to prevent people from trying to slip across the tracks.\n\nIt's as if we are building a Berlin Wall here. We are going several steps back in time, said Michael Randropp, a spokesman for the local Kystbanen commuters' association.\n\nThe re-introduction of border controls means that travellers between the two Nordic countries will have to show their passports for the first time in over half a century, and deals yet another blow to Europe's cherished passport-free Schengen system.\n\nSeveral other European Union countries, including Germany, Austria and France, also re-imposed border checks last year as the continent grappled with its biggest refugee crisis since World War II.\n\nMore than one million migrants reached Europe in 2015, most of whom were refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the United Nations refugee agency.\n\nSweden, a country of 9.8 million people known for its generous asylum policies, took in an estimated 160,000 asylum seekers last year alone.\n\n– Delays, fines –\n\nBut the inflow has strained the country's capacity to take care of the newcomers and authorities recently warned they would no longer be able to provide housing for everyone.\n\nAs the public mood shifted, the government began reversing its open-door policy.\n\nSome temporary border controls were already re-introduced on November 12, after which the number of weekly arrivals dropped from a peak of 10,500 to some 3,500 by mid-December, according to Sweden's Migration Agency.\n\nIn a further attempt to regain control over the flood of people arriving via Denmark, the Swedish parliament last month passed a temporary law making transport companies responsible for ensuring that those arriving via the 8-kilometre (5-mile) Oresund crossing carry valid photo ID.\n\nAnyone who fails to provide the necessary documents will be turned back, and travel operators who fail to comply risk a fine.\n\nI believe that these ID checks will be effective. More will have to seek asylum in other countries, Migration Minister Morgan Johansson recently told the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter.\n\nAside from the inconvenience the checks are expected to cause — especially for the roughly 8,600 daily commuters between Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmo — the new measures have annoyed Danish travel operators for financial reasons.\n\nDanish train company DSB has already threatened to levy a supplementary charge on passengers crossing the strait to cover the costs of the checks.\n\nAnd the Danish HH Ferries Group said it had reported Sweden to the EU for unfair competition after being required to pay for identity checks.\n\nThe company argues that the consortium operating the Oresund Bridge, and which is partly owned by the Swedish government, was given special treatment because it was not required to help fund the measures.\n\nThe border controls have also irked the Danish authorities, who are waiting to see if they will end up with a buildup of migrants stuck at their border.\n\nThe migration crisis has been a major point of contention between the two neighbours, with Denmark's right-wing government actively discouraging migrants and refugees from settling in the country.\n\nIt took in only about 18,000 asylum seekers last year.
Telegram surpassed 500 million active users in January, according to a statement from Pavel Durov, the messaging app's founder. Durov noted that 25 million people downloaded the platform in just 72 hours.\n\nThe growth of Telegram's user base comes as digital censorship from the world's largest technology companies intensifies. Various news media outlets have linked the growth of Telegram's user base with recent changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy.\n\nDurov described Telegram as the largest refuge for people seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security. He wrote in a post to his platform:\n\nIn the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA. This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users. With half a billion active users and accelerating growth, Telegram has become the largest refuge for those seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security. We take this responsibility very seriously. We won't let you down. Those of you who have used Telegram for the last several years know we've been consistent both when it comes to defending private data and to improving our apps. For those of you who just joined and are wondering what Telegram stands for, I'd like to quote my post from 2018: You – our users – have been and will always be our only priority. Unlike other popular apps, Telegram doesn't have shareholders or advertisers to report to. We don't do deals with marketers, data miners or government agencies. Since the day we launched in August 2013 we haven't disclosed a single byte of our users' private data to third parties. We operate this way because we don't regard Telegram as an organization or an app. For us, Telegram is an idea; it is the idea that everyone on this planet has a right to be free.\n\nTelegram surpassed 500 million active users. 25 million new users joined in the last 72 hours: 38% came from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA. https://t.co/1LptHZb9PQ — Telegram Messenger (@telegram) January 12, 2021\n\nDurov characterized Telegram's growth as the largest digital migration in human history while highlighting the messaging app's addition of heads of state with their own official channels:\n\nSince my last post, the already massive influx of new users to Telegram has only accelerated. We may be witnessing the largest digital migration in human history. Following this global phenomenon, two presidents started their Telegram channels: The President of Brazil – @jairbolsonarobrasil\n\nThe President of Turkey – @RTErdogan They join a list of other heads of state already present on the platform: The President of Mexico – @PresidenteAMLO\n\nThe President of France – @emmanuelmacron\n\nThe Prime Minster of Singapore – @leehsienloong\n\nThe President of Ukraine – @V_Zelenskiy_official\n\nThe President of Uzbekistan – @shmirziyoyev\n\nThe President of Taiwan – @iingtw\n\nThe Prime Minister of Ethiopia – @AbiyAhmedAliofficial\n\nThe Prime Minister of Israel – @bnetanyahu (Note that such verified accounts typically show a blue check mark in your chat list and search results.) We are honored that political leaders, as well as numerous public organizations, rely on Telegram to combat misinformation and spread awareness about important issues in their societies. Unlike other networks, Telegram doesn't use nontransparent algorithms to decide whether a subscriber will see content they subscribed to or not. As a result, Telegram channels are the only direct way for opinion leaders to reliably connect with their audiences. By removing the manipulative algorithms that have become synonymous with 2010s technology platforms, Telegram channels restore transparency and integrity to public one-to-many communication.\n\nLast week, Durov wrote that Telegram's recent growth is partly driven by a flight of users from WhatsApp to Telegram.\n\nI hear Facebook has an entire department devoted to figuring out why Telegram is so popular. Imagine dozens of employees working on just that full-time.\n\nI am happy to save Facebook tens of millions of dollars and give away our secret for free: respect your users.\n\nMillions of people are outraged by the latest change in WhatsApp Terms, which now says users must feed their private data to Facebook's ad engine. It's no surprise that the flight of users from WhatsApp to Telegram, already ongoing for a few years, has accelerated.\n\nDurov concluded by warning of disinformation spread about Telegram across social media by bots. We have also detected bots which spread inaccurate information about Telegram on social media, he wrote.\n\nDurov added, In 2019 alone, Facebook spent almost 10 billion dollars on marketing (I guess this includes paid bots on Wikipedia and other sites). Unlike Facebook, Telegram doesn't spend any money, let alone billions of dollars, on marketing. We believe that people are smart enough to choose what is best for them. And, judging by the half a billion people using Telegram, this belief is justified.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has upgraded the government advice on coronavirus, telling Britons to avoid public gatherings, work from home if they can, and self-isolate for 14 days if they or someone in their family household has a symptom of coronavirus.\n\nMr Johnson told Britons at a press conference given from Downing Street on Monday that according to modelling by his chief medical and scientific officers, it looks as though we are approaching the fast-growth part of the upward curve of the COVID-19 pandemic and without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days.\n\nAs a result, the government guidance is that if you have one of two symptoms — a new persistent cough or a high temperature — that you should self-isolate for 14 days. All others in your household should also isolate for 14 days.\n\nThat means that if possible you should not go out, even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise and in that case at a safe distance from others, the prime minister said. If that is not possible, Mr Johnson advised that people should do what you can to limit contact when getting them yourself.\n\nThe point about self-quarantine was reiterated by the government's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty, who spoke after the prime minister to say: If one person in the household has symptoms, the whole household stays at home.\n\nCoronavirus Outbreak Could Last a Year, Result in 4 in 5 Infected, 7.9m Hospitalised: Report https://t.co/gCklzvBTbd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 16, 2020\n\nNow is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop unnecessary travel, the prime minister also said. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can and you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres, and other such social venues.\n\nFrom tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do, he added, and further advised Britons against attending large scale public events.\n\nThose with the most serious medical conditions were told to isolate themselves for 12 weeks. External borders remain open, as do the country's schools.\n\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said that the UK was currently three weeks behind Italy in terms of the spread of the China-origin virus.\n\nToday's was the first of Downing Street's daily televised coronavirus press conferences, which will be chaired by either the prime minister or a member of his team. The policy was put into place after criticisms of Number 10's apparent lack of transparency with the public over the government's efforts to protect Britons and halt the spread of the contagious, deadly infection.\n\nThe health secretary confirmed after the press conference that there have been 53 deaths from COVID-19 in the UK.
Last week, the Wall Street Journal broke the amazing story of a Hellfire missile—more precisely, a technically accurate training missile with an inert warhead—that somehow ended up in Cuba, ostensibly due to human error.\n\nTo put it simply, the shipping company accidentally mailed it to Havana instead of sending it to Florida. Hellfire missiles are an important part of the U.S. weapons inventory, so it is troubling to think bad actors could be studying them to improve their own weapons or devise counter-measures against the American arsenal.\n\nWriting at his D.C. Dispatches blog, attorney Jason Poblete has some interesting follow-up questions about this story, chief among them: Was Congress aware of the missing Hellfire? If so, why did they not speak up, at a moment when President Obama was adjusting U.S. policy towards Cuba?\n\nIt is easy to see why the administration would want to keep the missing missile, and the Castro regime's obstinate refusal to return it, out of the public eye while relations with the island gulag were being normalized, but one would think members of Congress opposed to President Obama's policy would have spoken up.\n\nPoblete argues it is improbable that Congress would not have known about the missile and, in fact, claims congressional sources who assured him several key members and their staffers were in the loop. He argues that it was hypocritical for knowledgeable members to sit on the Hellfire story while opposing Obama's Cuba policy on other grounds… or possibly collusion with the administration to keep the story secret until now.\n\nOthers are sounding the alarm not because of what it implies of those who lost the missile, but how those who found it can use it against the United States. As Mary Anastasia O'Grady at the Wall Street Journal points out, Cuba is just about the only friend the pariah regime in North Korea has: In the past 2½ years Cuba has tried to smuggle weapons to Pyongyang, engaged in high-level meetings with North Korean officials, and secured US military technology. Anybody want to connect the dots?\n\nO'Grady dismisses the official excuse about human error shipping the Hellfire to Cuba out of hand, arguing that stealing weapons technology is what spies do for a living, and getting hold of a sophisticated piece of U.S. equipment is a major coup for Havana.\n\nOn the other hand, Graham Templeton at ExtremeTech argues that exposing Hellfire technology to Cuba might not matter all that much because that technology is already available. Not only is there a strong possibility that hackers have looted Hellfire data during numerous raids on U.S. systems, but the weapons have been sold to dubious allies like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, who would have had many opportunities to share Hellfire tech with their even more dubious allies.\n\nAnd then there is the Islamic State, which grabbed a good $700 million worth of fully operational Hellfire missiles when it captured the Iraqi city of Mosul. Remember that ISIS doesn't have much in the way of air power to actually fire said missiles, so we can only assume that the cash-hungry organization at least tried to sell them off, Templeton writes.\n\nCompared with these and other Hellfire-related breaches or risks, it seems hard to justify being all that upset about a dummy missile ending up in Cuba, he continues. It's certainly embarrassing, and doubly so because Cuba is refusing to return the thing, but anyone who might credibly buy it from Cuba, and to whom Cuba might credibly sell it, could easily have been a potential Hellfire customer for a long time now through overtures to even less-ethical actors.\n\nThat only adds to the mystery of why the Hellfire bungle or theft occurred, why it was kept under wraps for so long, and why it is surfacing now. Maybe some of this story manipulation is intended to make the Hellfire in Cuban hands seem like a bigger deal than it really is, to distract bad actors and give them a distorted impression of where the cutting edge in American missile technology lies.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is cautioning Republicans against lecturing their supporters for being angry, even though he defended South Carolina Nikki Haley for speaking her mind during her Republican response to the State of the Union address.\n\nWe will not win the presidency by telling people they're wrong for being angry that middle class wages have declined under this president, he said in an interview with Laura Ingraham. We're not going to win the presidency by telling the people that they're wrong when the foreign policy of this country has made America weaker and a joke.\n\nHe defended Haley's speech, however, praising her for putting a very good face on the Republican party after Obama's State of the Union speech.\n\nI praise her courage for saying what she believes, he said.\n\nChristie said he had been asked to do the response to the State of the Union address in the past, but chose not to.\n\nThe fact is, you get into that, and you're going to wind up angering lots of different people, he said.
On Wednesday's broadcast of MSNBC Live, host Katy Tur argued that President Trump is continuing a rhetorical tactic from the campaign where anybody who watched him could take whatever they wanted to from Trump's statements, including, If you were a Donald Trump supporter because you liked the offensive things he said, you were a white nationalist, maybe, you took his subtle queues and his lack of severe condemnations as a cue that, you know, he is accepting of my point of view, and he's going to champion what I want. And you're seeing that with foreign policy.\n\nTur said Trump's sentences are stronger than they are. … And this is exactly the way he operated in the campaign, and what was so — brilliant is the wrong word, but what was so brilliant about it was that anybody who watched him could take whatever they wanted to take from that. So, if you were a Donald Trump supporter because you believed he's going to bring back jobs, the offensive things he said, you put to the side, you didn't worry about. If you were a Donald Trump supporter because you liked the offensive things he said, you were a white nationalist, maybe, you took his subtle queues and his lack of severe condemnations as a cue that, you know, he is accepting of my point of view, and he's going to champion what I want. And you're seeing that with foreign policy.\n\n(h/t RCP Video)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
In an interview broadcast Sunday night , former Putin adviser Sergey Karaganov said that, to the best of his knowledge, there were no serious connections, fortunately, or unfortunately between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the government of Russia.\n\nKaraganov was the chief foreign policy adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin from 2001 to 2013 and is now dean of World Economy and International Affairs at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow.\n\nDo you think that there are any connections that Trump has with Russia that we should know of? What do you make of those reports? CNN host Fareed Zakaria asked Karaganov.\n\nTo the extent I know, there were no serious connections, fortunately or unfortunately. Now, I would say fortunately because of the heat of the fight within your country. I mean, all connections which you could have had would have been to the detriment of Russia, to the detriment of your president, Karaganov replied.\n\nHe also disputed the notion that Russia affected the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election through cyber-warfare.\n\nPersonally, I would have loved that Russians would have interfered like that, Karaganov added. Our American partners should be educated that they live in the crystal palace and they should stop interfering into internal affairs of other countries, they should stop regime changes, et cetera. I mean if we do that, that would be a great lesson for Americans. I am not sure whether we were able to do that.\n\nAs these comments suggest, Karaganov is an unabashed booster for his home team, declaring elsewhere in the interview that Russia is winning. He said Russia has restored its might and it has restored its possibility to deter, which will lead to a more balanced world.\n\nKaraganov said the liberal international order — or liberal disorder or hegemonic disorder as he also called it — which the United States has sought to impose on the world since Bill Clinton's presidency, collapsed during the Obama years, and Donald Trump's election was a result of that collapse.\n\nI believe that he could lead the United States toward becoming a more powerful nation if and when he's allowed to do that, Karaganov said of Trump. Whether that is good for Russia, I'm not sure, because we will be competitors even if we understand each other and even if we cooperate at margins.\n\nZakaria noted that, in a recent essay about the collapse of the liberal international order, Karganov said that Hillary Clinton was viewed, particularly negatively as a symbol of liberal interventionism, of neo-conservatism, of a kind of expansionist American foreign policy that tried to maintain America's kind of central status in the world.\n\nKaraganov agreed with that characterization of his essay, adding that Russia was even more concerned with the clique of neo-conservatives and liberal interventionists surrounding Clinton, deeming them dangerous because they would have tried to restore the international order that died under Barack Obama.\n\nFor context, Karaganov was one of a number of Russian sources quoted by the New York Times in a February 14 piece that labored mightily to portray the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as a buzzkill for Russian euphoria over Trump's election victory.\n\nTo convey a sense of its tenor, the first line in the article was: The champagne toasts that some Russian officials quaffed just a few short months ago to celebrate the victory of Donald J. Trump have gone a bit flat. The implication is that Flynn was, at the very least, highly sympathetic to the Russians, so they must be crestfallen by his ouster.\n\nHowever, most of the Russians quoted in the article said the Flynn resignation was relatively unimportant, and what concerned them was the possibility that Trump would prove to be as erratic as his predecessor. The Russians mostly use erratic as code for linking issues they believe should be completely unrelated, such as their conduct in Syria linked with U.S. arms control negotiations.\n\nKaraganov's contribution to the article was, as he would later tell Zakaria, the assertion that Russian foreign policy was a success, and it should stay the course rather than making compromises to cultivate a better relationship with Washington.\n\nHe was a bit more optimistic in his take on the first meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Germany last week. I'm sure the outcome of these talks was constructive. And thanks to this, Russian-US relations will gradually start pulling out of the current crisis, he told Russia's TASS news service.
Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner has admitted that the focus of the British political class on ethnic minorities and women's agendas has seen the white working class — and white working-class boys in particular — falling by the wayside.\n\nSpectator editor Fraser Nelson observed that Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) tables have white working-class boys literally at the bottom of the heap during an interview with the Labour MP.\n\nI think it's because as we've tried to deal with some of the issues around race and women's agendas, around tackling some of the discrimination that's there, it has actually had a negative impact on the food chain [for] white working boys, Rayner conceded.\n\nWHITES NEED NOT APPLY – 'Racist' Hiring Policy at ITV's Peston on Sunday Show https://t.co/FI4k6iWHAL — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 9, 2017\n\nHowever, rather than denounce the various 'No Whites' internships and training programmes which have been introduced by public broadcasters, police forces, and so on using the so-called 'positive action' clauses in Britain's equality legislation, Ms. Rayner chose to blame white culture.\n\nThe white working class, she claimed, have not been able to adapt to modern, multicultural Britain.\n\nCulturally, we are not telling them that they need to learn and they need to aspire.\n\nThey are under the impression that they don't need to push themselves in the way that maybe the disadvantaged groups had to before.\n\nI think that is why there is a bit of a lag there. I think we need to do much more about the culture of white working class in this country.\n\nTV doc on murder of white schoolboy by racist Pakistanis airs day after all whites benefit from racism rant on BBC https://t.co/p93ZCNfPz2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 10, 2017\n\nAs well as introducing legislation allowing employers to discriminate against whites and proposing preferential treatment for ethnic minority criminals said to be victims of institutional racism, the British political class and criminal justice establishment have also appeared reluctant to act when white working class people become victims of targeted abuse by other groups.\n\nFor example, the abuse of thousands of predominantly white, working-class girls in towns and cities across the United Kingdom by predominantly Pakistani Muslim abusers was ignored by police, social workers, and other figures of authority — who feared being labelled racist — for years.\n\nUK: Whites Scared, White-Owned Businesses Stoned in a Racially Divided Bradford 'Heading for Disaster' https://t.co/Rd1O6L29HD — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 24, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, the gangs themselves were deemed officially not racist by judges in at least one major court case, despite one abuser having previously told a female ticket inspector: White women are good for only one thing – for people like me to fuck and use as trash.\n\nA recent investigation by the counter-extremism think tank Quilliam found that some 84 per cent of groomers convicted in Britain are 'Asian', with an overwhelming majority of their victims being white.\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery
Turkey and Russia have been unable to rein an al-Qaeda-linked group in Syria that has emerged as the terrorist organization's strongest branch and the most dominant jihadi group in the country, Fox News reported Wednesday.\n\nAlthough they are on opposite sides of the war, pro-Syrian opposition Turkey and dictator Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia reached an agreement late last year to establish a horseshoe-shaped buffer zone in Idlib free of jihadis and their heavy weapons by October, to no avail. The Russia-Turkey pact is part of mutual efforts to end the war in Syria — raging since March 2011.\n\nKnown as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the al-Qaeda-linked group continues to wreak havoc in Idlib, the jihadis organization's primary stronghold in the region.\n\nHTS has proven itself to be the strongest military force in the Idlib pocket in recent weeks. Their rapid advance is a cause for concern because they are de-stabilizing efforts to bring a political settlement to the last rebel enclave. Their extremist ideology also makes it more likely that the Russian and Assadist forces will have an excuse to launch a full-scale offensive, which will have devastating humanitarian consequences, Alan Mendoza, founder and executive director of the U.S. policy think tank the Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News.\n\nIn recent days, the al-Qaeda affiliates conquered the strategic town of Darat Izza, located close to two main highways in Syria used to move fighters and supplies within the country and along the Turkish border.\n\nFox News noted:\n\nAn Al Qaeda-linked jihadist group Hay'at Tahir al-Sham (HTS) is gaining swaths of territory in the northern province of Idlib, usurping control from Turkish-backed groups connected to the National Liberation Front (NLF). The goals of the group, otherwise known as the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, are centered on dominating as much territory as possible ahead of planned talks between Russia and Turkey, to bring a final end to the almost eight-year Syrian civil war. Based on a previous agreement, Turkey was supposed to have reigned in the extremist outfit – now raising concerns it may not have the capacity to do so.\n\nCiting several analysts, Fox News noted that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's near single-minded focus on pushing the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurds out of territory bordering Turkey had rendered Ankara incapable of addressing the al-Qaeda threat in Idlib.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), HTS has between 12,000 and 15,000 fighters and is the most dominant of all rebel groups operating in Syria.\n\nFormerly known as al-Nusra Front and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, HTS claims to have cut its allegiance with al-Qaeda, but several experts have dismissed the claim as deceptive.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State has officially designated HTS a foreign terrorist organization in May 2018.\n\nIf HTS acts as a spoiler to the [Russia-Turkey] agreement on the ground, this will probably lead to one of two scenarios: either Turkey and the NLF launch military action against HTS, or Russia will seize the opportunity with the support of the [Assad] regime and its allies to enter Idlib, Nawar Oliver, an analyst for the Turkey-based Omran Center predicted in October, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nThe ramifications of that move could be vast, he added.

Residents of Calais have said that they are determined to march into Paris to demand that the French President Francois Hollande protect their city from the migrant invasion currently camped out on their doorstep. Announcing their plans, they've told the government to expect fireworks.\n\nCalais has been on the front line of the migrant problem for almost two decades now, with the first Jungle camp being set up in 2002 after an overcrowded red cross centre in the area known as Sangatte was closed by the government.\n\nOver the intervening years camps a cycle has emerged of camps springing up only to be demolished by the authorities. But in the last year, with migration across the continent at an all-time high, the Jungle has grown out of all proportion and is now home to a reported 7,000 migrants – local groups put the figure much higher.\n\nAnd this time, left wing activists have moved in too, organising demonstrations and inciting the migrants to aggressively resist attempts by the French riot police to contain them.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the locals have had enough. In January, the day after more than 2000 activists descended upon their town from across Europe for a day of violent protest, a large group of local people including local business people and city officials wrote to President Hollande asking him to visit the city\n\nThey included in their letter a request for government assistance, including building a secure accommodation facility for the migrants, a commitment to projects in the area designed to boost the economy, and the suspension of business taxes in the area for the next ten years.\n\nEconomically, the situation is very serious, Antoine Ravisse, a member of the Shipping Federation of the Port of Calais told Nord Littoral Calais is heading in the opposite direction to the wider world – businesses are closing, property prices are plummeting. We must stop the bleeding.\n\nJean-Louis Foissey, also a member of the Shipping Federation said: An exceptional situation calls for exceptional measures. The President hasn't instigated a state of emergency – but the emergency exists!\n\nComparing the situation to that of a natural disaster, another group member added: We cannot wait, this is happening now.\n\nThe group gave the President until the 15th February to respond to their letter, saying: Let him come to Calais to take action and get us out of this crisis. If nothing has happened by then we can truly say that Calais has truly been abandoned.\n\nAs that date has now passed with still no sign of Hollande, the group plan to march on Paris to make their voices heard. Commenting on the lack of interest from the government the group said they felt deep distress and a sense of abandonment, and lamented that the President didn't even mention Calais in a recent televised speech.\n\nThey plan to march on the 7th March, and say they are not worried about how many people turn out as they are after action, not publicity. The situation in Calais is known to all, what we want is a strong policy response, they commented.\n\nFrédéric Van Gansbeke, communications manager for the Grand Rally, has said that the plans have not yet been finalised, but promised fireworks. He added in other words, there will be more actions by the collective at various locations in Paris.
Iranian officials released economic data this week indicating oil exports are sharply down and U.S. sanctions have cut the export of products other than oil in half.\n\nRadio Farda reviewed the numbers on Tuesday and found Iran's exports were growing significantly before the second, much tougher round of U.S. sanctions took effect in November:\n\nThe country exported only $1.867 billion non-oil goods during November 21-December 22, less than half of Iran's monthly average during the current fiscal year, which started on March 21, 2018. The plunge in exports was partly due to a complete stoppage in ultra-light oil (gas condensate) sales, which Iran includes in non-oil export basket. The monthly gas condensate export has averaged at about $330 million, or only a seventh of the drop in total non-oil exports during November 21-December 22. In the other world, U.S. oil-related sanctions also seriously impacted Iran's non-oil exports as well. The U.S. also imposed financial sanctions on Iran in August, but the details of customs statistics does not show any meaningful change in the non-oil exports level during the August-November period. During the first nine months of the fiscal year (FY), the country has exported about 5.6 million metric tons of gas condensate at $2.776 billion, which indicates a 50% decline year-on-year. However, the country's total non-oil exports during March 21-December 22 reached $33.36 billions, or 4.5% more than the same period in last FY. Despite this growth, Iran has fulfilled less than 70% of its non-oil export target for the period. Its non-fuel imports also declined 13.3% year-on-year to $32.62 billion.\n\nThe Radio Farda report included a necessary disclaimer that Iran does not officially publish details about its crude oil exports, but since even the countries granted waivers by the United States to purchase Iranian oil have significantly reduced their imports, a decline in export volume can be readily deduced.\n\nIt was widely feared – or, among oil executives and the heads of nations whose economies are driven by oil revenue, devoutly hoped – that knocking Iran out of the market with sanctions would cause oil prices to soar and supplies to become tight. That does not appear to be happening, as another Radio Farda report pointed out.\n\nAnalysts predicted continued oversupply from the astounding surge in U.S. production, reduced demand from the global economic slowdown, anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war, waivers granted to Iran's largest customers, the failure of the OPEC cartel to arrange a production slowdown, and possibly President Donald Trump's lobbying for lower oil prices will keep fuel relatively cheap in 2019.\n\nOverall, this is not a rosy picture for Iran, already suffering from deep economic crisis, compounded by U.S. sanctions, which have impacted the country's banking ties with the world and its non-oil trade, Radio Farda predicted.\n\nThe Iranian regime unsurprisingly chose to focus on the positive, with President Hassan Rouhani declaring on Wednesday morning, The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue to export oil despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn the past 9 months, Iran's trade balance has been positive due to the $750m non-oil exports, indicating that the activities of the economic executives and the private and public sectors have been successful, Rouhani told his cabinet, delicately understating what happened in the last two of those months.\n\nBased on oil minister's reports, Iran's oil sales have been continuing just as it was expected, but there are some minor issues that are solvable and will be solved soon, he claimed. No one looking at the actual data could possibly believe that, but Iranians will be required to believe it so their leaders can claim victory over the American quest to reduce its oil exports to zero.\n\nThe Syrian regime tried to cheer up its Iranian patrons this week by promising they will make a fortune from postwar reconstruction, a project in which Iranian bids will ostensibly be privileged.\n\nOn the other hand, officials in Tehran have probably noticed the United Arab Emirates just reopened its embassy in Damascus and its diplomats are reminding the Syrians about the extensive UAE investments made before the civil war blew up in 2011.\n\nPresident Trump has been talking up the amount of money the UAE's allies in Saudi Arabia are prepared to invest in Syrian reconstruction, to the consternation of Saudis who apparently cannot see the bountiful opportunities for lavish profit promised by Syrian officials. At the very least, sober money men in Tehran will have some doubts about Syrian reconstruction sparking an economic renaissance in Iran.\n\nIran's best hope for weathering sanctions might lie with India, which is generally supportive of U.S. policy but has not disguised its hunger for more Iranian oil. India's finance ministry kicked off the new year by announcing a massive retroactive tax break for crude oil imports from Iran. The move was a major step toward creating a durable financial infrastructure for working around U.S. sanctions to keep Iranian oil flowing into India, and will give Iran a trove of Indian currency to spend on imports and investment.\n\nThe New York Times last week dismissed Tehran's happy talk about the economy and lamented the devastating effect of sanctions on the Iranian middle class, which was already suffering from the absurd mismanagement of Rouhani's regime, especially its habit of manipulating the currency to cover up economic shortfalls.\n\nThe Times quoted analysts who labored mightily to blame the travails of the Iranian middle class on President Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions, but the very same article makes it clear the Iranian government was already fiddling with the economy in a variety of disastrous ways to conceal the effects of corruption, political repression, foolish policies, and the squandering of Iran's windfall from the nuclear deal on foreign adventures.\n\nRouhani is trying to reassert control and tamp down public unrest with a new budget that spends more on domestic priorities, but he could easily have done that during the Obama years when lucrative foreign deals and literal pallets of cash were falling into his lap. If Tehran is truly changing and turning its focus inward, it is only because the crushing effect of sanctions forced a major re-evaluation of policy. There is little evidence that any sort of political liberalization flowed from the nuclear deal boom and a great deal of evidence to the contrary.
Newly-installed Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed Thursday that the Constitution gives her equal power to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe New York Times reported: Asked if she considers herself Mr. Trump's equal, she replied, 'The Constitution does.'\n\nThe context of her remarks was a discussion of the equality of women — but Pelosi's reference to the Constitution made clear that she was also making an argument about actual power as a matter of law.\n\nIn her inaugural speech to the House of Representatives on Thursday, Pelosi sounded a similar theme, calling Congress co-equal to the presidency:\n\nOur nation is at an historic moment. Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn. They called upon the beauty of our Constitution: our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy, remembering that the legislative branch is Article I: the first branch of government, co-equal to the president and judiciary.\n\nBy inference, Pelosi seems to believe, the leader of the legislative branch is equal to the president in power.\n\nBut there are several flaws in Pelosi's analysis.\n\nFirst, Pelosi does not lead the legislative branch. She leads only one chamber of that branch — and the House is generally considered the lower chamber relative to the Senate. Moreover, she only leads at the pleasure of her party, and is only one among equals. The Constitution mentions the Speaker but does not give the office special powers.\n\nBy Pelosi's logic, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) could just as easily claim that he is equal to the president in power — and his claim would arguably hold more weight, given the pre-eminence of the Senate.\n\nSecond, the U.S. Constitution does not actually refer to the three branches as co-equal — a term that appears nowhere in the text. It is commonly held that all three share governing responsibility, but each has some ability to check the others.\n\nPelosi seems to suggest the legislature is the most important because it comes first under Article I, but the president has some leeway to act independently, especially in national security and foreign policy, and the courts can overturn legislation.\n\nThird, Pelosi never argued that Republican speakers John Boehner or Paul Ryan were equal to President Barack Obama. In fact, she made a point Thursday of defending Obama's controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy — even though DACA was implemented in defiance of Congress.\n\nPresident Obama also altered the Affordable Care Act — i.e. Obamacare — several times without any authorization from the legislature.\n\nPelosi defended the president and his usurpation of power — when that president was a Democrat.\n\nJoel B.

President-elect Joe Biden is laying the groundwork for an amnesty for 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the United States, meeting with open borders lobbying groups and sanctuary city politicians to discuss a legislative strategy.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris met with a handful of cabinet nominees, executives with open borders lobbying groups, and sanctuary city politicians about his day one plans to introduce immigration reform legislation and protect DACA recipients, according to a readout of the meeting.\n\nBiden's meeting included Xavier Becerra, his nominee to lead Health and Human Services (HHS), who as California attorney general has implemented one of the strictest sanctuary state policies in the nation — even going as far as to say the state would prosecute employers who cooperate with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\nThe meeting also included Los Angeles, California Mayor Eric Garcetti, who oversees a sanctuary city policy that frees back into the community hundreds of criminal illegal aliens every week from local jails.\n\nAlida Garcia with Mark Zuckerberg's FWD.us attended the meeting. As Breitbart News has chronicled, FWD.us is one of the leading pressure groups to expand the number of foreign visa workers that corporations are allowed to import to take high-paying, white-collar U.S. jobs.\n\nOther executives with the open borders lobbying groups in attendance included:\n\nSindy Benavides, President of LULAC\n\nAlida Garcia, Vice President of Advocacy of FWD.us\n\nDomingo Garcia, Board Chair, LULAC\n\nMaria Teresa Kumar, President & CEO of Voto Latino\n\nHenry R. Munoz III, co-Founder of Latino Victory\n\nJanet Murguia, President of UnidosUS\n\nNathalie Rayes, President & CEO of Latino Victory Fund\n\nTom Saenz, President of MALDEF\n\nHector Sanchez, President of Mi Familia Vota\n\nThe business lobby, which regularly seeks an expansion of legal immigration levels to widen profit margins by cutting U.S. wages, was represented by an executive with the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBiden's advisers have already begun meeting with House Democrats to talk about a legislative pathway for an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. Aside from an amnesty that would burden 18 million jobless Americans with increased foreign competition in the U.S. labor market, Biden is eyeing an end to President Trump's reforms at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe plans include ending the Centers for Disease Control's Title 42 order and Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, which ensures that federal immigration officials can return border crossers to their native countries within hours and forces Mexico to house asylum applicants so they are not released into the interior of the U.S.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Russia's demographic crisis was put in stark terms by Ilan Berman in a Moscow Times editorial on Tuesday, as he quoted a report from Russia's statistics agency that spoke of extinction.\n\nBerman cites Rosstat figures that Russia had 70,000 fewer births in the first four months of 2017 than it did over the same period in 2016, suggesting an overall population decline of 300,000 by 2018. Russia's current population is just over 143 million, but President Vladimir Putin has predicted it could shrink to 107 million by 2050.\n\nOne of Putin's ideas for dealing with the problem was to offer an $11,000 bonus for having at least two children. That is roughly equivalent to the annual income of the average Russian middle-class worker, but Berman reports the impact of the bonus program was negligible.\n\nRussia actually gives parents a medal for having seven or more children, the Order of Parental Glory, but that has not helped much either.\n\nRussia is unusual among demographically-challenged countries in having an official blueprint for dealing with the problem, but it is evidently a rather vague blueprint that has yet to produce much in the way of effective policy. Berman suggests the Kremlin knock off its extensive military spending and foreign adventurism in places like Ukraine and Syria, and spend more on health care and education. The Kremlin is not very likely to heed that advice.\n\nPutin did not offer his rubles-for-rugrats scheme as a crisis measure for dealing with demographic collapse. He flaunted it as a sign of inevitable Russian triumph while taunting European nations for their anemic birth rates. His criticism was not without merit, as Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain, Greece, and Portugal all have lower birth rates than Russia – the latter three nations' birth rates are much lower.\n\nPutin crowed that his policies would take care of people and increase human capital as Russia's most important resource in December 2016. He told his parliament he expected human capital to blossom so much that Europe and the United States would lose their ability to prod Russia with sanctions. However, while Russia's birth rate has ticked up a bit lately, it remains well below the level Putin confidently predicted.\n\nBirth rates are only part of the demographic puzzle. Russia suffers from persistent life expectancy problems, particularly among male heavy drinkers, and occasional mortality spikes nobody can figure out. Healthy birth rates can go a long way toward offsetting high mortality rates in a population and, conversely, long life expectancy does not help to sustain a population if the birth rate falls far enough.\n\nSome analysts believe, contrary to Ilan Berman's gloomy forecast, that Russia's birth rates have rebounded well enough to defuse the demographic crisis. A Reuters piece in March argued that Russia's private health care industry is booming due to rising fertility rates, driven by the desire of new parents to obtain better maternity care than the state provides.\n\nAlternatively, one might speculate that increasingly accessible and affordable private care is making couples more comfortable with accepting the risks and hardships of childbirth. State-run clinics in Russia don't sound like a very welcoming environment for accepting stork deliveries as Reuters describes them.\n\nIf things really are looking up, then Russia is emerging from what Business Insider called a perfect demographic storm that was crippling the nation in 2015. Up to 30 percent of Russian deaths in one study were alcohol-related. Russia has also battled other forms of drug abuse, and a serious HIV/AIDS crisis, contributing to that notoriously high mortality rate for Russian men. It is likely that men embarked upon such tragically short life paths are not settling down to family life and raising children.\n\nThere is no getting around the simple reality that population growth demands a sizable number of couples having three or more children, which generally requires getting started on family life at a relatively young age. Financial incentives to defray the cost of having and raising children may be helpful, but Russia's experience offers the latest evidence that it takes more than money for populations to flourish.
A Catholic apple grower in Michigan has been barred from a city farmers' market over his views on same-sex marriage, after he refused to host a lesbian couple's wedding at his orchard.\n\nStephen Tennes, the owner of Country Mill Farms, has sold his fruit and vegetables at the East Lansing Farmer's Market for the past seven years. After city officials learned of his Christian belief that marriage is the union between one man and one woman, they invoked a non-discrimination policy to exclude him from being able to sell at the farmers' market.\n\nTennes says he was barred from selling his produce after his business, Country Mill Farms, refused to host a lesbian couple's wedding at its orchard in Charlotte, 22 miles outside East Lansing. Explaining his position on Facebook, Tennes cited his Catholic belief that marriage is a sacramental union between one man and one woman.\n\nIn a statement, the city of East Lansing said the farmer's decision not to host a same-sex wedding violated a long-standing ordinance that protects sexual orientation as well as the Supreme Court's ruling that grants the right for same-sex couples to be married.\n\nIn point of fact, the city introduced a modification to the city's farmers market vendor agreement just this year requiring sellers to comply with East Lansing's Human Relations Ordinance. Among other things, the ordinance prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.\n\nThe city's punitive action targets the farmer's use of his own private property, 22 miles outside the city and well outside its jurisdiction. Mr. Tennes has declared that he does not discriminate against LGBT customers at the farmer's market, and gladly sells his produce to all comers.\n\nIt's our faith that informs us how to treat all who come to our farm and the farmers market with dignity and decency … serving customers of many races, religions, cultures and those who identify with the LBGT community, he said.\n\nWhen it came to actually hosting a same-sex marriage that contradicts his biblical understanding of the nature of marriage, Tennes felt obliged to decline.\n\nOur faith and beliefs on marriage and hosting weddings at our home and in our backyard of our farm have nothing to do with the city of East Lansing, Tennes said at a press conference.\n\nAccording to Gay Star News, the biblical view of marriage is homophobic and the City of East Lansing barred Tennes for his homophobic religious views.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 31, Tennes filed a federal lawsuit against the city of East Lansing seeking his reinstatement at the market. According to the lawsuit, Country Mill is the only business to have been prohibited under the market's anti-discrimination policy.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization specializing in religious liberty cases, is representing Tennes. They have asserted that his religious views on marriage have no bearing on his involvement at the market and said the city's actions amounted to a First Amendment violation.\n\nSteve and his farm have been singled out and excluded from full participation in the life of the community for only one reason, said ADF counsel Kate Anderson. Steve expressed a viewpoint the city did not like.\n\nIf the government can shut down a family farmer just because of the religious views he expresses on Facebook … then no American is free, Anderson said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Convicted murderer Gheorghe Mihai attempted to stab a woman to death in the street less than a year after moving to the United Kingdom from Romania.\n\nThe 38-year-old was found guilty of attempted murder at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Monday after flying into a drunken rage and stabbing his sister-in-law Roxana Mihai in the village of Lye, West Midlands, on August 7th last year, the Express & Star reports.\n\nThe car wash attendant chased the 23-year-old woman down the street brandishing a knife after she had interrupted a conversation that he was having with her husband whilst they were waiting at a bus stop.\n\nHe looked like a man possessed, an eyewitness, lorry driver Kieran Langan, told the court.\n\nHe was in a rage. She was backing away. I could tell that she was scared. Then I saw him open his jacket and pull out a large kitchen knife.\n\nI stopped the lorry because I thought I was about to witness a murder in the High Street, Mr. Langan added.\n\nFree Movement of Rapists: Romanian Brothers Rape London Woman After Being Released from French Prison https://t.co/KdD4R34AiW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 7, 2017\n\nThe convicted murderer then ran after the young woman, tripped her up, and stabbed her at least four times in the face, head, arm, and back whilst she lay helpless on the ground.\n\nRomanian Gaman Bobi, who had been talking to the couple at the bus stop, followed them, telling the court: He raised his hand above his head and stabbed her on the face by her right eye. She was on the floor screaming. He raised his hand up again and stabbed her in the back of her head.\n\nMihai only stopped attacking her after her husband caught up with him, leaving their infant child in the care of others at the bus stop, forcing Mihai off his wife and punching him in the face. Mihai then fled and waited to be arrested by the police at a nearby garage whilst his sister-in-law was taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nIn 2006, Mihai had been convicted of murder and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment in his native Romania – a European Union member state whose citizens can exert the privilege of Free Movement across the bloc – for battering a man to death with a piece of wood in 2004.\n\nPolice Attempt to Hide Polish Rapist's Identity to Protect his Human Rights https://t.co/09IwEo2AyG pic.twitter.com/YM2V0iFgyI — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 29, 2016\n\nThough Free Movement can be restricted on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, the directive says previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures and a convicted criminal can only be barred from entry on a case-by-case basis if he presents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.\n\nAnd if the UK Border Force was not aware of the Romanian murderer's conviction, it could not challenge his entry – either his or countless other EU nationals with criminal convictions.\n\nMihai's case is only one in the latest in a number of murderers and sex offenders who were free to enter the UK unchallenged thanks to EU Free Movement.\n\nIn December, Breitbart London reported that two Romanian brothers who served sentences in France for rape in 2016 went on to brutally rape a London woman.\n\nA Romanian car washer with a history of sexual offences was jailed for 16 years in September after entering the UK and attempting to rape a grandmother.\n\nAnd in August 2014, 14-year-old schoolgirl Alice Goss was crushed to death in an apparent attempted rape by convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns. Zalkalns had served seven years in prison for beating his wife to death in his native Latvia.\n\nTwitter Follow @friedmanpress Follow Victoria Friedman on
Norway's Labour party will look at introducing a third gender category if they are voted to power in the general election due to take place later this year.\n\nAnd it's only a matter of time before the other parties get behind the idea now that Labour's draft programme for 2017-2021 says Norway should consider introducing a third gender category, according to a member of the programme committee.\n\nPeople who define themselves as neither male nor female would have the opportunity of being legally recorded as a third gender, Mani Hussaini, who also leads the Labour-affiliated Workers Youth League, told NRK.\n\nFor example in a person's passport it would say they were not male or female but instead belong in a third gender category.\n\nI believe all people should have the opportunity to live out their identity and then have to adapt the laws to reality and not vice versa, he explained.\n\nAsserting that there's a broad mood in favour of the proposal, Hussaini told the public broadcaster he's confident that other parties will back the option for Norwegians to legally 'become' a third gender.\n\nI feel that [people who claim to be neither male nor female are] a movement. When the country's largest party backs [creating a third gender option], I expect we'll see all the other parties following suit.\n\nHealth spokesman for Centre, part of the Labour-led coalition which governed Norway until 2013, said her party isn't ready to support the creation of another gender category.\n\nKjersti Toppe told NRK: It is an issue, but to amend the law to introduce a third gender would affect us all. It's a proposal that Centre are nowhere near ready to consider.\n\nLeft party politician Kjetil Kjenseth said it's only a matter of time before a third gender is written into law, asserting that support is high among younger representatives of several parties.\n\nProposed by the Left party, but supported by just the Greens and the Socialist Left Party, Norway's parliament overwhelmingly voted against the introduction of a third gender category last April.\n\nExplaining his support for the policy, Kjenseth told NRK: [The introduction of a third gender] doesn't mean much for the rest of us, but would greatly benefit those who don't find their gender expressed in the categories of male and female.\n\nThis applies not only to transgender people but also a great number of heterosexuals who have alternating gender expression.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is under fire from her Democratic colleagues in the Senate over her far-left policies and social media antics, with some calling the self-avowed Democratic-socialist the flavor of the month and her positions crazy.\n\nOcasio-Cortez rocketed to national prominence after shocking the political world by ousting 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in New York's 14th congressional district primary in June. The 29-year-old has quickly established a name for herself by pushing radical policies, including Medicare for All, the abolishment of ICE, and perhaps most notably, the Green New Deal — a proposed nationwide shift to non-combustible energy sources financed in (very small) part by a proposed 70% tax on top earners. However, her policy prescriptions and support of grassroots efforts to unseat incumbents within her own party have lawmakers in both chambers of Congress grumbling.\n\nI'm sure Ms. Cortez means well, but there's almost an outstanding rule: Don't attack your own people, said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) told Politico. We just don't need sniping in our Democratic Caucus.\n\nHer views don't represent a lot of my constituents, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said of Ocasio-Cortez to The Hill. Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) agrees with Shaheen, who told The Hill that Ocasio-Cortez becoming the face of the Democratic Party hurts its brand. I think it skews what's really there for the Democratic Party, Jones, the Senate's most vulnerable member, said. He warned that if House Democrats attempt a far-left agenda, its legislative accomplishments will be few and far between. If the House did all the crazy things on the left that the House did on the right for the last two years, that's not going to happen, the Alabama Democrat said.\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-MT), who won reelection narrowly, defeating Republican Matt Rosendale after a hard-fought campaign, believes Ocasio-Cortez's celebrity will taper off. I hope she has a great, successful career, said Tester. I was here when they elected the guy [Sen. Scott Brown] from Massachusetts and he was a flavor of the month.\n\nI was a flavor of the month for a while, Tester added. Flavors of the month come and go. She's a flavor of the month right now. My guess is she'll come, she'll go. It's the way the system works.\n\nThe freshman congressman has also garnered criticism from former Democrat lawmakers — notably ex-Sen. Joe Liberman (I-CT) — who recently said Ocasio-Cortez's call for a 70% marginal tax rate is proof that she does not represent the future of her party.\n\nWith all respect, I certainly hope she's not the future and I don't believe she is, Lieberman, who retired in 2013 after serving nearly 25 years in the Senate, told the Fox Business Network last Thursday.\n\nIf you look at the majority of new Democrats in the house, they tend to be, I say, center-left, if they are not left-left, the Democrat-turned-Independent continued. And that is because they had to be center-left to win some of those competitive swing districts that they took from Republicans. So that's the hope.\n\nOn the subject of Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70% marginal tax rate to fund her Green New Deal, Lieberman said a progressive tax system already exists in the U.S. If you… accumulate income in the country the big bump is still in the middle class, he said. So you've got to be careful about raising taxes too high… a 70 percent tax on high-income people is really done for political reasons.\n\nFlexing her Twitter muscle — where, according to Axios, her account has become one of the platform's most influential — Ocasio-Cortez quote-tweeted Lieberman's remarks with: New party, who dis? The exchange is the latest sign of brewing tensions between the party's progressive and establishment members.
Stanford University announced this semester that male students are banned from the university gym twice a week in order to promote inclusivity.\n\nThe prestigious Stanford University has introduced a new policy that bans male students from the campus gym for two hours on Mondays and Wednesdays. University of Michigan-Flint professor Mark Perry has filed a civil rights complaint against Stanford over the practice.\n\nAccording to the Stanford website, the women's only gym access takes place on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:00 – 3:00 PM. Trans-females are welcome to participate in the women's only hours.\n\nStanford Recreation & Wellness is proud to offer an opportunity for a women's-only training environment. This is a trans-inclusive space. Train on your own, with a friend, or in a group during Women's Only Training in our private personal training studio, AOERC 112, located at the Arrillaga Outdoor Education & Recreation Center. Women's Only Training is FREE to join and no prior experience is necessary.\n\nThe decision was made based on survey feedback from female students who said they didn't feel comfortable in large gym spaces.\n\nJennifer Sexton, the director of fitness and wellness at Stanford, explained that the new program allows female students to feel comfortable while exercising at the Stanford gym. We created it to make a place where women and trans women at any level would feel comfortable working out, Sexton said.\n\nStanford's Fundamental Standard policy ensures that no student will be discriminated against on the basis of their sex. Students are expected to respect and uphold the rights and dignity of others regardless of race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or socio-economic status, the policy reads.\n\nAdam Behrendt, the President of Stanford's Undergraduate Veterans Association, condemned Stanford over their introduction of the new gym policy. He also expressed concern earlier this year after Stanford refused to add military veterans to the text of the Fundamental Standard.\n\nIdentity politics are disgusting in general, but it's especially sad when a University as reputable as Stanford will openly discriminate against men 'to be more inclusive of women' while simultaneously denying veterans even visible affirmation in their guiding document, Behrendt wrote.
White House lawyer Eric Herschmann argued on Monday evening in the Senate that by House Democrats' standards for impeachment, President Barack Obama should have been impeached and removed from office.\n\nHerschmann used Democrats' own definition of abuse of power, laid down by House impeachment manager Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) last week, to show that Obama met all the elements of the standard.\n\nHe began by playing the infamous March 2012 video of Obama caught on a hot mic telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev — a stand-in for Vladimir Putin — that he needed more space until he was re-elected, but would have more flexibility on missile defense afterwards. Medvedev agreed to give the message to Putin.\n\nIn other words, Herschmann explained, Obama asked a foreign leader for a political favor, sacrificing the security of the United States and our European allies for the sake of his own re-election.\n\nHerschmann recalled that when then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney — sitting in the Senate as one of Utah's two delegates — made Russia the focus of his foreign policy in 2012, Obama mocked him.\n\nObama's conduct, Herschmann said, met all of the Democrats' elements of abuse of power: 1. The president exercises his official power … 2. To obtain a corrupt personal benefit … 3. While ignoring or injuring our national interest.\n\nHerschmann noted that Obama had also given up on missile defense in Eastern Europe in 2009, and that the request to Medvedev came in 2012. Following that, he pointed out, Russia invaded Crimea, seizing it from Ukraine, convinced that the Obama administration would never respond.\n\nBy their own standard, Herschmann concluded, Democrats should have impeached Obama, too.\n\nThe case against Obama would have been far stronger than the case against Trump. … Where were the House managers then? he said, accusing them of violating the principle of equal justice with their double standard.\n\nIn contrast, he pointed out, Trump had actually confronted Russia and armed the Ukrainians.\n\nJoel B.

North Korea's latest propaganda video is filled with rocket launchers, jet fighters, military parades, and the money shot of a U.S. aircraft carrier photoshopped to be on fire.\n\nThe UK Telegraph reports the clip was released over the weekend, in coordination with North Korea testing a new high-thrust rocket engine. South Korean analysts believe this test represented a significant step toward accurate multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missiles, although North Korea is still thought to be several years away from delivering nuclear warheads with such weapons.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MTvxFzZ-Y\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, the aircraft carrier seen in the photo is the USS Carl Vinson, which is participating in joint drills with South Korea and Japan. The overheated narrator of the video promises that a knife will be stabbed into the throat of the carrier.\n\nWhen the video switches to an equally cheesy depiction of a B-1B bomber on fire, the narrator shrieks, The bomber will fall from the sky after getting hit by a hail of fire.\n\nReuters reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering sweeping sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system as part of a broad review of measures to counter Pyongyang's nuclear and missile threat.\n\nThe sanctions would be part of a multi-pronged approach of increased economic and diplomatic pressure – especially on Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with North Korea – plus beefed-up defenses by the United States and its South Korean and Japanese allies, according to the administration official familiar with the deliberations, Reuters adds.\n\nAccording to the report, President Trump wants plans on his desk before his scheduled summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April. The State Department has been quietly informing China that expanded sanctions against banks that do business with Pyongyang would hit a large number of Chinese financial institutions. Small Chinese banks have been crucial in helping North Korea conduct illicit commerce to evade sanctions.\n\nA stronger display of military force is said to be part of the policy mix, although probably not direct military action. Interestingly, Reuters suggests expanded cyber warfare and covert action aimed at undermining North Korea's leadership could be an element of the plan.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a North Korean envoy said Pyongyang does not fear broader U.S. sanctions and will pursue acceleration of both its nuclear missile and ICBM programs, including nuclear first strike capability.
Eliott Abrams, who was deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration, has been removed from the list of candidates for Deputy Secretary of State.\n\nAccording to three Republican sources who spoke to CNN, Abrams was personally scratched off the list by President Donald Trump, due to outspoken criticism of Trump during the 2016 campaign. Abrams had been seen as the top contender for the job, supported by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and even senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is President Trump's son-in-law.\n\nThe CNN sources were bitingly critical of Trump for deciding not to nominate Abrams. This is a loss for the State Department and the country and, for that matter, for the President, said one, while another maintained Abrams was bumped off the list because of Donald Trump's thin skin and nothing else.\n\nHowever, even the CNN article concedes there is more than thin skin behind the decision. For one thing, Abrams was not merely critical of Trump in a few random comments last year. He penned a May 2016 op-ed for the Weekly Standard entitled, When You Can't Stand Your Candidate, which declared Trump unfit for office, incorrectly predicted he couldn't possibly win, and compared him to George McGovern. (For those who lack 69-year-old Abrams' perspective on political history, that is not a flattering comparison.)\n\nAbrams called for a floor fight at the Republican convention in 2016, to remind Trump how many in the party oppose and even fear his nomination, warned any Republican with future political aspirations to avoid becoming Trump's running mate, called for a purge of Trumpians from the GOP after Hillary Clinton's inevitable 2016 victory, and suggested running a third-party spoiler candidate to ensure a crushing defeat for Trump.\n\nMoreover, there is a substantial difference in foreign policy vision between Trump and Abrams, whom CNN has no difficulty identifying as a neoconservative and supporter of the Iraq War.\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-KY) of the Foreign Relations Committee strongly opposed Abrams' nomination, as reported by Breitbart News earlier this week, because Abrams's worldview was utterly incompatible with Trump's foreign policy agenda.\n\nIn Senator Paul's case, strongly opposed means he wrote an op-ed for Rare entitled, Do Not Let Eliott Abrams Anywhere Near the State Department, which is roughly as unambiguous as Abrams writing a piece about Trump called When You Can't Stand Your Candidate.\n\nCrack the door to admit Elliott Abrams and the neocons will scurry in by the hundreds, warned Paul. Neoconservative interventionists have had us at perpetual war for 25 years. While President Trump has repeatedly stated his belief that the Iraq War was a mistake, the neocons (all of them Never-Trumpers) continue to maintain that the Iraq and Libyan Wars were brilliant ideas. These are the same people who think we must blow up half the Middle East, then rebuild it and police it for decades.\n\nPaul was particularly critical of Abrams' devotion to nation-building, slamming the practice as both expensive and ineffective. He was concerned that Abrams would be a poor fit not only for Trump but for Secretary of State Tillerson as well, praising Tillerson for foreign policy realism he found utterly lacking in Abrams.\n\nPaul viewed Abrams as an exemplar of the sneering, latte-sipping political class in Washington that Trump was elected to fight, and which shows every intention of fighting dirty in return, as the geysers of leaked information pouring from the new administration attest. (In fact, this very story is the subject of leaks intended to manipulate media coverage, as noted above.)\n\nPaul said Abrams was untrustworthy due to his role in the Iran-Contra scandal: His conviction for deceiving Congress over secret arms deals, better known as the Iran-Contra scandal, show that his neocon agenda trumps his fidelity to the rule of law. The Constitution directs Congress to approve or disapprove of war. It would be a mistake to appoint anyone to the State Department who was previously convicted for defying Congressional authority.\n\nSenator Paul is hardly the only observer to see Abrams' possible appointment this way. The Washington Post found it surprising Abrams was ever under consideration, acknowledging his resumé and reputation as a tough negotiator, but finding little in common with Trump's foreign policy vision beyond being fiercely pro-Israel. Fox News host Tucker Carlson said he was baffled while interviewing Senator Paul about his op-ed. Doug Bandow at Forbes said choosing Abrams would be a particularly stunning reversal of candidate Trump's claim to reject his predecessors' failed policies of perpetual war.\n\nIn short, there is ample reason to believe Trump's decision was about more than thin skin, and his skin didn't have to be very thin to think Abrams wouldn't be a good fit for an administration he previously regarded as an improbable catastrophe. Six weeks of non-stop leaking and bureaucratic sabotage might understandably have reduced the president's tolerance for a Number Two official at the State Department who (according to Senator Paul) once declared Donald Trump unfit to occupy the chair where Washington and Lincoln once sat—but evidently had no such reservations about Hillary Clinton.
The number of cases of the Chinese coronavirus in communist Cuba is continuing to rise as its population faces the pandemic without widespread access to hygienic essentials such as soap and clean water.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, there were at least 40 confirmed cases of the virus across the island, two of whom are in critical condition, bringing it relatively in line with other Latin American countries. However, the dire state of the country's economy and the lack of access to medical and hygienic essentials means it runs the risk of an aggressive outbreak that health authorities will struggle to contain.\n\nA shortage of sanitary products, even in foreign currency stores where there is a far greater selection of products, has led to large queues of people outside the shops that offer them. Last month, Minister of Internal Trade Betsy Díaz Velázquez told the official Granma newspaper that shortages would last until at least April due to economic constraints. The shortages are unrelated to hoarding or coronavirus-related spending. Cubans still use ration cards for many basic goods.\n\nThe first case of the coronavirus in Cuba was reported on March 11, carried by three Italians who had arrived on the island two days earlier. One of those patients, a 61-year-old man who had a history of bronchial asthma, died seven days later after presenting clinical manifestations of complications of the disease.\n\nAccording to the Cuban Health Ministry, in addition to the positive cases, 954 individuals are currently being held under epidemiological surveillance, 727 are Cubans and 528 are foreign citizens. A further 30,773 people are under regular surveillance in their homes.\n\nCuban officials will suspend tourism to the island from Tuesday, while citizens who return from abroad will be required to enter a two-week quarantine. The lockdown is scheduled to last 30 days but could be extended longer, and will undoubtedly inflict major damage on the country's already struggling economy.\n\nThis should enable us to stop (importing) cases and to focus on detecting those there are in the country and stopping transmission, said Cuban second-in-command, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, in a television address on Sunday.\n\nHe also called on citizens to practice social distancing, something he said would naturally go against the nature of the Cuban people.\n\nSomething very difficult due to Cubans' nature, but very necessary, is the elimination of effusive greetings, he said. No kisses or hugs and greetings at a prudent distance until the epidemic passes by.\n\nDespite the brewing crisis in their own country, communist authorities are nevertheless continuing the tradition of sending their slave doctors abroad, with teams already arriving in their crisis-hit ally Venezuela and Italy, the country with the most severe outbreak globally.\n\nSupporters of the Cuban regime have long touted its supposedly high standards of health care, citing the fact that the country has the highest relative number of physicians in the entire world as well as the manipulation of health statistics such as infant mortality. However, the poverty inflicted as a result of decades of communist policy has, in reality, led to a decrepit health system with some of the worst health outcomes worldwide.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
Chairman Janet Yellen says the Federal Reserve is delaying hiking interest rates. That could mean the rapidly inflating real-estate bubble is headed toward another crisis.\n\nThe Fed scaled back its forecast for how interest rates will rise in 2016, citing the potential impacts from a weaker global growth and potential financial market turmoil on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe central bank's Open Market Committee, which sets short-term interest rates, decided to maintain the current benchmark federal funds rate at between 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent, according to its March 16 release following a 2-day meeting in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe dovish economic outlook pushed the U.S. Dow Jones Industrials up 74.23 points to a new 2016 closing high, and sent the VIX cost to hedge market volatility to its lowest level since early December.\n\nThe top stock market gainers were concentrated in the materials sector, which jumped 1.74 percent on expectations that continuing Federal Reserve interest rate suppression would further stimulate a red-hot housing market that is already in bubble territory.\n\nAfter the 2002 to 2007 housing bubble burst, the Federal Reserve responded to what it called the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression by implementing both a zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP) and quantitative easing (QE) to spread cheap money into the financial markets to rescue plunging real estate prices.\n\nAs a result of the Fed's muscular interventions, the average interest rate in the U.S. for a 30-year-mortgage dropped from 6.08 percent in mid-2008 to 3.68 percent on March 16.\n\nDespite U.S. inflation-adjusted incomes still being down slightly since 2008, the Fed's low interest-rate policy basically cut the cost of mortgage payments in half and allowed Americans to qualify to purchase much more expensive homes.\n\nCheap money may not have created much economic growth, but housing prices, as measured by the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, were up 5.4 percent last year and up by 30.1 percent from their early 2012 lows. As of the end of January, average U.S. home prices are only 3.7 percent off their all-time-high in early 2007.\n\nBut the ability of homeowners to qualify for more expensive homes has driven up the ratio of home prices to median household income. At the end of 2014, home prices had reached an all-time record ratio of 5.3 times the average U.S. household income. Although official 2015 data is not yet available, the ratio appears to have reached another all-time high of 5.5 times household income.\n\nIn comparison, the ratio was only about five times household income at the 2007 peak, and just 4 times income at the prior housing price peaks of 1987 and 2001, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nMany people say that a home is an individual's best protection against inflation. But with inflation up only 2.2 percent last year, and 17.8 percent since the 2012 low, home prices are jumping twice as fast as inflation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's ZIRP and QE policies created artificially low interest rates that have been the secret sauce that reflated real estate.\n\nOn Feb. 24, when the price of crude oil was $31.58 a barrel, and the media worried about deflation and negative interest rates, Breitbart News published, Welcome to the Risk of an Inflation Shock. But three weeks later, the price of crude oil is $39.21 a barrel, and the media is reporting that inflation, at 2.3 percent, has picked up in recent months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's announcement that its policy is to continue to suppress interest rates recalls the captain of the Titanic, who sped up in an iceberg field because he thought his boat was indestructible.\n\nBut if inflation starts to burn bright and the Fed is forced to quickly raise interest rates, America faces another housing crisis dead ahead.
Border arrivals in December 2020 jumped by 80 percent above December 2019, partly because the cartels and coyotes are telling their customers that President-elect Joe Biden will end the border curbs, the chief of the Customs and Border Patrol agency said Tuesday.\n\nWe're already seeing the negative impacts of the proposed policy changes, acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said on January 5. The cartels and human smugglers are spreading the perception that our borders will be open. In this case, they're correct. They're right — it's not just the perception.\n\nBiden's campaign promises are not an immigration strategy — [they are] an open border strategy, he said. The immigrants know it, and more importantly, the human smugglers know it … I've been asked, What do you think is going to happen? I say it's already happening.\n\nThe 74,000 migrants who arrived in December you could argue are crisis-level numbers, but the reason why it doesn't feel like a crisis is because we have [President Donald Trump's] authority, statutes, and policies to deal with the numbers, he said.\n\nThe numbers will become a border crisis if Biden follows through on his campaign promise to remove Trump's border reforms, Morgan added. You take that ability away and that 2,500 [arrivals] a day becomes a crisis overnight. That's what concerns us.\n\nThe arriving migrants include more spouses and children of migrants from Central America, he said:\n\nWe're seeing now folks for the Northern Triangle countries now, still mainly single adults, but we're still seeing families and UACs [Unaccompanied Alien Children]. So now we're back about 50/50 now, about 50 percent Mexican nationals and about 50 percent … other than Mexican nationals.\n\nMorgan said his deputies are talking with Biden's deputies.\n\nWe're hoping that the dialogue [with Biden's appointees] is going to continue. We're hoping that that as this administration has done, that they're actually going to listen to the experts that are on the ground, they're going to listen to facts, they're going to listen to reality. And they're going to make the necessary adjustments that we need to protect our country.\n\nBiden's officials seem to be listening. Morgan said:\n\nWhat what I'm hoping, what I heard from folks, from the CBP experts that participated in the briefings, has been very positive. They felt they were being asked good questions, informed questions, the right questions [by Biden's appointees]. And what I've been told is that they felt the preview team was actually listening and hearing what we discussed.\n\nMorgan continued:\n\nThey've already walked back what they promised they were going to do. Mr. Biden himself, in a recent set of questions said he is not going to do what he promised on Day One because he knew that it would create a crisis. That was very good to hear … [but] that doesn't alleviate the concerns that I have. It's simply kicking the crisis can down the road. There's got to be real reform to what their open border strategies are.\n\nJoe Biden's would-be immigration chief says a 'comprehensive' immig. deal would raise wages.\n\nNobody believes that Wall St. cover story – except the people paid to promote it & the estb. journos whose editors don't want them to follow the money.\n\nSee here: https://t.co/t6NqxK7Azv — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 9, 2020\n\nThe United States can control its borders, Morgan said:\n\nWe're not at the mercy of what's happening outside our borders. We can't control worsening economic conditions within an entire Western Hemisphere, which we all know drives illegal migration. But we can and should control how we address its impacts at our borders. And that's exactly what we're doing now. By ending catch and release, and by closing loopholes, we've de-incentivized the pull factors and positioned ourselves to be able to effectively address the constant fluctuation in the numbers, regardless of the external factors out of our control. Tools like the CDC public health order, the migrant protection protocols, and yes, the border wall system. If we remove those tools, the current increase in illegal migration we're already experiencing will become our next full-blown illegal immigration crisis. If the Biden team implements the immigration policy that they have campaigned on, that they promised the American people they would do on Day One, they will create an unmitigated crisis in the first few weeks.\n\nBiden's campaign promises are an open-borders strategy, Morgan said:\n\nHalting construction of the border wall system, stopping deportations for 100 days, expanding DACA, ending MPP [Migrant Protection Protocols] , providing free health care, providing amnesty to millions of individuals here illegally, and the list goes on and on. This isn't an immigration strategy; it is an open-borders strategy. If your strategy consists of releasing you into the interior of the United States once you've illegally entered and have been apprehended, protecting you from local deportation, and providing substantial rewards such as free health care, you have just created a complete system of incentives. Who wouldn't try to enter with Release, Protect, and Reward being the new open border strategy?\n\nBiden's deputies are promising to delay some of their campaign promises, he said. But this isn't good enough, not by a long shot, Morgan said.\n\nThis simply kicks the crisis can down the road, Morgan said. Without significant and permanent walk back of their open-borders strategies, without actively listening and continuing to work based on truth in reality, the only result will be a continuing and steady increase in the numbers.
The Heritage Foundation held an event to discuss Taiwan's role in international organizations on Thursday, with an emphasis on the way China is using its growing economic and diplomatic clout to block Taiwanese membership in vital organizations related to health, safety, and security.\n\nHeritage Foundation Asian Studies Director Walter Lohman began by citing the example of the World Health Assembly, where Taiwan has been denied some role after many years of participation. Taiwan was similarly blocked from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and, perhaps most outrageously, Interpol. In some cases, even limited observer status granted to Taiwan in previous years has been revoked.\n\nTaiwan's Deputy Minister for the Mainland Affairs Council, Dr. Cheng-yi Lin, gave an extensive presentation on Beijing's aggressive and potentially unsafe deployment of new air travel routes over the Straits of Taiwan.\n\nEven Beijing believes that there is a potential risk of an air-traffic close encounter in the air in the Taiwan Strait, Lin pointed out.\n\nHe said mainland China's unilateral opening of air routes so close to Taiwan's airspace was in part motivated by a desire to constrain the airspace of Taiwan, including for Taiwanese military aircraft. Later in the presentation, it was noted that expanding Chinese civilian airspace gives Taiwan less time to identify a potential Chinese military incursion into its territory and prepare a response.\n\nLin said the effort represented an example of China using its sharp power—aggressive diplomatic and economic pressure that lies somewhere between the traditional understanding of hard military might and soft diplomatic influence—to punish the administration of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.\n\nHe added that Taiwan believes Beijing's new air routes violate ICAO regulations. This would be a much easier case for Taiwan to press if it had not been shut out of membership in the U.N.'s civil aviation agency thanks to Chinese interference.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania law professor Jacques deLisle noted that China has been able to shut Taiwan out of numerous international bodies it is eminently qualified to join, based on Taiwan's exemplary conduct, its economic significance, and the internationally-recognized definition of a legitimate nation-state.\n\nHe said one of the reasons China is so eager to checkmate Taiwan's attempts to join international bodies is that membership in such organizations is one of the recognized criteria for independent statehood. The more groups Beijing successfully blackballs Taipei from joining, the easier it is for China to deny Taiwan formal recognition as an independent state.\n\nThis is such an urgent objective for China that it shuts Taiwan out even when Taiwanese membership would clearly benefit the safety and security of Chinese citizens, as with health, environmental, and law enforcement agencies.\n\nDeLisle observed that China moved swiftly and aggressively to isolate Taiwan as Chinese economic power and diplomatic influence grew over the past few years. Taiwanese resistance has fared best at economic organizations since the island nation punches so far above its weight in such matters.\n\nDeLisle bluntly stated that China is able to keep Taiwan out of some important international bodies simply because citizens of the People's Republic of China happen to occupy the chairman's office at the moment. A paramount example of China commandeering important international organizations by filling the top seat is, unfortunately, Interpol.\n\nTed Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, reviewed the case of Interpol in detail. He was outraged by Taiwan's exclusion, pointing out that it defies common sense, might possibly violate Interpol's constitution, and most certainly violates American law.\n\nOn the latter point, Bromund scolded the U.S. State Department for doing a poor job of following up on legislation requiring the U.S. government to push hard for Taiwanese inclusion in Interpol.\n\nThe law is there. The policy is real, he said, lamenting that so little has been done to effectively implement it. He also critiqued the law for being drafted too vaguely and referring to an observer limited membership for Taiwan that might not actually exist under Interpol's constitution.\n\nBromund saw the State Department as a less than optimum choice for implementing congressional instructions since State actually has very little to do with Interpol coordination. He reflected that the United States tends to treat Interpol as what it actually is—essentially a global bulletin board for the police—and uses law enforcement agencies to interact with it, whereas China and some other members view Interpol as a political entity and use political and diplomatic agencies to deal with it.\n\nBromund was unsparing in his criticism of how China has abused its membership, and now the leadership of Interpol, despite providing such a tiny portion of the funding for the international law enforcement agency.\n\nThe 2017 meeting of Interpol's General Assembly happened to be held in Beijing, he pointed out. Enough said.\n\nBut that was not quite enough said, because he went on to note that the current head of Interpol is a former Chinese security official, scoffing at the notion of truly retiring from a high position in the Chinese security apparatus.\n\nThere is no chance that Taiwan is going to gain any status in Interpol as long as it is run by the PRC, Bromund said bluntly, using the mainland Chinese government's name for itself, the People's Republic of China.\n\nBromund found it absurd that Taiwan was blocked from Interpol membership while the Palestinian Authority was accepted. For that matter, he argued that China is not truly fit for Interpol membership because it engages in a number of clearly unacceptable activities, such as using politicized corruption investigations to get rid of officials who fall out of favor and threatening the Chinese families of individuals abroad to secure their compliance.\n\nTaiwan should be a member. China should be expelled under Interpol's own rules, he declared.\n\nThe panel participants worried that China is flexing its muscles in various international organizations at the same moment that American influence is waning, and that Beijing acts aggressively to prosecute agenda items such as isolating Taiwan while Washington is often unclear about what it wants from international bodies. This has allowed China to become the gatekeeper for membership in some important organizations, especially those where each member state is allowed a single vote no matter how large and powerful it is, since China can wrangle supporting votes from a large number of smaller nations in its orbit.\n\nBromund, however, argued that it is more a problem of the United States failing to appreciate how actors like China are willing to politicize and manipulate agencies with noble humanitarian charters.\n\nStep up and recognize that there is a political game going on in these organizations, and that in order to fight the politicization of these organizations, you have to be willing to call it out for what it is, and to appoint individuals to U.S. leadership positions inside the U.S. government who are willing to fight to keep these organizations technical and apolitical, by recognizing that other people want to treat them as political, he advised.\n\nDeLisle had some concrete suggestions for Taiwan to fight back against China's campaign of isolation, such as insisting on the principle of universality, which stated simply means pointing out the absurdity of arbitrarily excluding 22 million people from organizations dedicated to world health or global environmental issues.\n\nHe also recommended highlighting the damage done to Taiwanese citizens when China unfairly excludes their country from important bodies, and for that matter the damage done to Chinese citizens and the international regimes themselves.\n\nDeLisle suggested Taiwan can play the values card by arguing that it plays by the rules of global agencies much better than China does, and if all else fails, Taipei can get some diplomatic mileage out of simply acting like a full member of international regimes, even when Beijing blocks formal membership.\n\nAs Bromund summarized with respect to Interpol, there are many reasonable accommodations that could be made for effective Taiwanese participation in world organizations, even when the rules prevent states from securing full membership with the kind of asterisk on their credentials that Beijing's One China policy represents for Taiwan.\n\nThe problem is not Taiwan, he said. The problem is not Interpol, or Interpol structures, or its requirements for membership, or its forms of cooperation. The problem is quite simple. The problem is the People's Republic of China.
Iraqi militia groups supported by Iran have been seizing Christian property in Baghdad, including homes, businesses, and churches, in a process described as ethnic cleansing by Iraqi Christian community leaders.\n\nThe goal of this campaign is nothing less than the complete expulsion of Christians from Baghdad, according to leaders from the Assyrian, Chaldean, and Syriac communities, as reported by The Foreign Desk.\n\nSimilar purges have been conducted in rural Iraq, where either the Islamic State or Iran-backed Shiite militia units have wiped out some of the world's oldest Christian communities.\n\nThe Foreign Desk recalls that ISIS originally said Christians could remain as subjects in its territory, provided they paid the jizya tax Islamic law requires of non-Muslims, or converted to Islam, but later ISIS abandoned those provisions and began cleansing Christians from the caliphate.\n\nThe purge of Christians has been shockingly effective, one of the most brutal and devastating ethnic cleansing campaigns in history, although not generally reported as such by Western media. Chaldean Patriarch Louis Raphael Sacco notes in the Foreign Desk piece that Christians have been eliminated from the captive city of Mosul for the first time in Iraq's history.\n\nNow the effort to ethnically cleanse Christians from Baghdad is under way, with Sacco describing militia gangsters rampaging through Baghdad, seizing property and forcing Christians to flee the city.\n\nThe former Anglican vicar of Baghdad, Canon Andrew White, who was forced out of his parish in November 2014, also spoke recently about a terrible onslaught of Islamic jihadism that killed or drove off most of his congregation, and warned of ethnic cleansing in Iraq and Syria. White has spent years trying to draw attention to the persecution of Christians, which includes forced conversion to Islam, and beheading for those who resist.\n\nWhen CNN's Wolf Blitzer recently asked the military spokesman for anti-ISIS operations, Col. Steve Warren, about the destruction of Christian communities in Iraq, including an allusion to Baghdad in particular, Warren replied, Wolf, ISIL doesn't care if you're a Christian… We've seen no specific evidence of a specific targeting toward Christians.\n\nThis is patently, painfully untrue, and in any event, it is not ISIS cleansing Christian communities from Baghdad: it is Shiite militias linked to Iran, which the Obama Administration just handed billions of dollars to finance its operations across the Middle East. Those militias are also America's nominal allies against the Islamic State, and will be crucial to the upcoming battle for Mosul, even though militia leaders make little pretense of being happy to fight alongside the American troops they were murdering just a few years ago.\n\nObama foreign policy has left the United States with little choice but to make dirty deals across the Middle East, supporting many supposedly lesser evils to assemble a coalition capable of fighting the greater evil of ISIS on the ground. The Christians of Iraq, Syria, and Iran are collateral damage this Administration and its supporters would prefer not to discuss, not even when ethnic cleansing comes to the upscale suburbs of Baghdad.
Angela Merkel's open invitation for over a million migrants to come to Germany last year was a colossal mistake, a renowned economist has said.\n\nIn an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Oxford academic Sir Paul Collier said that Merkel's actions were morally reprehensible and it was unlikely the huge number of new arrivals would integrate into German society.\n\nSir Paul, who previously worked as director of the Development Research Group at the World Bank, told the paper: Inviting all refugees to Germany was a colossal mistake by Angela Merkel, especially since she had obviously made no preparations for the resulting influx.\n\nHe said condemned the morality behind this invitation as she has virtually asked people to swim to Europe.\n\nThat's like Russian roulette: find a people smuggler and hope that your boat does not sink. What is there to defend?\n\nOne of the strongest tendencies of people fleeing warzones, Sir Paul said, is to stick together in homogeneous communities. This makes assimilating them into wider society much harder than for other types of migrant.\n\nAmid chaos, these people want to preserve their normal lives as much as possible. So they want to stay as close as possible to people from their homelands in order to maintain a last bit of stability.\n\nHe added that recent history also shows how difficult it will be to assimilate the huge number of new arrivals into German society.\n\nGermany has never been particularly good at integrating migrants, he said. Turkish migrants took a very long time to become part of mainstream society.\n\nHe also pointed out that before Angela Merkel wanted to be a saint, she had previously stated that multiculturalism in Germany had failed.\n\nIn 2010, the German Chancellor gave a speech in which she criticised the multikulti concept, telling members of her party: We kidded ourselves a while, we said: 'They won't stay, sometime they will be gone', but this isn't reality. She added that the attempt to build a multicultural society has failed, utterly failed.\n\nI do not see why that should have suddenly changed, Sir Paul said.\n\nHe went on the say that it is not racist to oppose the huge migrant influx, and criticised the media narrative around the subject.\n\nI have the impression that the public discourse in Germany works like this: Holy Merkel against the racists. I think that is defamatory. There are good reasons for scepticism.\n\nHe lamented the failure of mainstream parties to make a policy that appears at least halfway sensible and said this failure had triggered panic in many people.\n\nHe also warned that poorer Germans had tangible existential fears as jobs become harder to find and the rich seem to care less about their concerns.\n\nThere are clear signs that solidarity rapidly decreases in societies with a high proportion of immigrants, he said.\n\nThe miracle of the nation state is that it creates a common identity and makes solidarity possible. Too much immigration endangers this arrangement.
Today at 4 p.m. ET, the Center for Security Policy will conduct two panels on migration jihad and Shariah.\n\nThe first panel is titled Obama's Dangerous National Security Legacy and How it Must Be Reversed.\n\nCSP President and CEO Frank Gaffney leads this panel of national security experts, composed also of Former Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral James Ace Lyons, and 20 year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, and VP for Research and Analysis at CSP Clare Lopez. They will analyze the grievous toll the policies of the Obama administration have taken on our nation's defenses, and how those policies might be mitigated by the next president.\n\nAt 5:30 p.m. ET, the panel The Global Jihad Movement in America and the Counterjihad Campaign will convene.\n\nPanelist will argue free speech is the indispensable tool in confronting jihad and Islamic shariah law. Author and historian Lars Hedegaard of Denmark founded the Danish Free Press Society and International Free Press Society, and has been a fierce critic of the encroachment of shariah law on freedom of expression in the West. He has faced persecution by his own government and survived an assassination attempt in 2013. The UK's Paul Weston leads the Liberty GB party, and is a strong voice against creeping sharia in his homeland. In 2014, he was arrested on suspicion of racial harrassment after quoting verbatim a passage about Islam written by Winston Churchill. CSP Executive Vice President Jim Hanson will outline a new initiative against these and related threats, the Counterjihad Campaign.\n\nFull Schedule:\n\n4:00pm-5:30pm\n\nPanel 1: Obama's Dangerous National Security Legacy and How it Must Be Reversed\n\nAdm.

Mark Penn — Hillary Clinton's chief strategist during her 2008 presidential campaign who has served the Clinton family since the mid-90s — lowers the boom on Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, Christopher Steele, the Clinton Foundation, and the intelligence community's deep state, laying out the absurdity and the danger of the Obama administration's abuse of surveillance and law enforcement against political enemies.\n\nFrom The Hill:\n\nThe deep state is in a deep state of desperation. With little time left before the Justice Department inspector general's report becomes public, and with special counsel Robert Mueller having failed to bring down Donald Trump after a year of trying, they know a reckoning is coming.\n\nAt this point, there is little doubt that the highest echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department broke their own rules to end the Hillary Clinton matter, but we can expect the inspector general to document what was done or, more pointedly, not done. It is hard to see how a year-long investigation of this won't come down hard on former FBI Director James Comey and perhaps even former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who definitely wasn't playing mahjong in a secret no aides allowed meeting with former President Clinton on a Phoenix airport tarmac.\n\nWith this report on the way and congressional investigators beginning to zero in on the lack of hard, verified evidence for starting the Trump probe, current and former intelligence and Justice Department officials are dumping everything they can think of to save their reputations.\n\nBut it is backfiring. They started by telling the story of Alexander Downer, an Australian diplomat, as having remembered a bar conversation with George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. But how did the FBI know they should talk to him? That's left out of their narrative. Downer's signature appears on a $25 million contribution to the Clinton Foundation. You don't need much imagination to figure that he was close with Clinton Foundation operatives who relayed information to the State Department, which then called the FBI to complete the loop. This wasn't intelligence. It was likely opposition research from the start.\n\nIn no way would a fourth-hand report from a Maltese professor justify wholesale targeting of four or five members of the Trump campaign. It took Christopher Steele, with his funding concealed through false campaign filings, to be incredibly successful at creating a vast echo chamber around his unverified, fanciful dossier, bouncing it back and forth between the press and the FBI so it appeared that there were multiple sources all coming to the same conclusion.\n\nRead the rest of the article here.
The Harvard Honors Council has been tasked by administrators with enforcing penalties on members of single-gender social groups who seek leadership position or athletic captaincy.\n\nAccording to The Harvard Crimson, starting with the class of 2021, students seeking leadership roles on athletic teams or in student organizations must sign a pledge that confirms they won't take part in a single-gender social group.\n\nUnder the recommendations, students, starting with the class of 2021, who seek leadership positions, captaincies, or fellowships will have to sign a written statement affirming their commitment to nondiscrimination on the basis of characteristics of 'intrinsic identity,' including gender. Students will also have to affirm they do not currently belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization, did not belong to one in the past year, and will not belong to one the year after their tenure in a leadership position or athletic captaincy ends.\n\nHarvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, the same dean who pushed dropping the term master in favor of faculty dean, instructed the Honor Council to help carry out enforcement of the penalty against students participating in both single-sex social groups and leadership positions on campus. In January, after faculty criticism of the policy, Khurana created a task force to address the criticisms and reconsider the policy.\n\nLast May, Khurana argued that single-gender social groups have led to an environment at Harvard that is based on social power imbalances and oppression.\n\nDiscrimination is pernicious, Khurana wrote. Stereotypes and bias take hold, normalizing bias in a community, which should be unacceptable. In this case, the discriminatory membership policies of these organizations have led to the perpetuation of spaces that are rife with power imbalances. The most entrenched of these spaces send an unambiguous message that they are the exclusive preserves of men.\n\nDouglas Melton, co-chair of the implementation committee, claimed that the policy was proposed to enact social change at Harvard.\n\nGenerally what we're trying to help the College do is effect a cultural change and that won't happen with one policy or in one month or in one year, Melton said. We're not of the view that if [Khurana] followed our recommendations then next term everything would be picture perfect.\n\nAlthough it's unclear what effect this would have on the Harvard community, the social change intended is to transition single-gender social groups to co-ed status. An article in Vox argues that participation in single-sex social groups, particularly for male students, contributes to an increase in sexual violence on campus.\n\nThe report additionally lays out a path to recognition for social groups transitioning from single-gender to co-ed status, creating a temporary provisional social organization designation for clubs who reconstitute themselves with new characteristics and new goals. According to the document, which can be read in its entirety at The Harvard Crimson, must maintain non-discriminatory membership requirements and practice local governance and autonomy.\n\nWe intend that this bridge period enable these groups to make the transition to an open social status, the report states, with the understanding that the positive contributions of those organizations to the campus community would be assessed in three to five years.\n\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

President Donald Trump threatened on Sunday to devastate Turkey economically if Turkish forces attack the Kurds in Syria after the United States withdraws.\n\nThe office of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded on Monday by telling Trump it would be a fatal mistake to treat a Turkish attack on the Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey considers a terrorist organization, as an assault on the Kurdish people.\n\nTrump delivered his warning to Turkey in a pair of tweets discussing his Syria policy on Sunday. Trump encouraged both Turkey and the Syrian Kurdish militia to back away from a confrontation:\n\nStarting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019\n\n….Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria – natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2019\n\nA spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded on Monday by warning Trump, It is a fatal mistake to equate Syrian Kurds with the PKK, which is on the U.S. terrorist list, and its Syria branch PYD/YPG.\n\nTurkey fights against terrorists, not Kurds. We will protect Kurds and other Syrians against all terrorist threats, spokesman Ibrahim Kalin promised.\n\nTerrorists can't be your partners and allies, Kalin told Trump. Turkey expects the U.S. to honor our strategic partnership and doesn't want it to be shadowed by terrorist propaganda.\n\nErdogan's communications director Fahrettin Altun added that Turkey will continue its anti-terror fight decisively.\n\nTerror is terror and it must be eradicated at its source. This is exactly what Turkey is doing in Syria, Altun said.\n\nThe PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, is a violent Kurdish separatist organization in Turkey that the U.S. State Department indeed lists as a foreign terrorist organization. The PYD (Democratic Union Party) is the largest Syrian Kurdish political party, while the YPG (People's Protection Units) is effectively its armed wing. The YPG militia was one of the most effective battlefield allies of the United States in the war against the Islamic State.\n\nTurkey insists the PYD and YPG are actively allied with the PKK and are essentially branches of the same Kurdish separatist organization. Turkey's looming strategic nightmare involves Kurds in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey joining together to declare an independent state that would absorb territory from all three nations. Turkey complains that weapons given by Western allies to the YPG to fight ISIS are finding their way across the border into PKK hands.\n\nThe United States disputes this characterization and wants Turkey to halt its military incursion into Syria against Kurdish forces, an assault Turkey named Operation Olive Branch because it believes peace can only be established by pushing Syrian Kurdish forces away from the Turkish border. President Trump strives to assuage fears that U.S. military withdrawal from Syria will give Turkey a green light to massacre the Kurds.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu complained on Monday that President Trump should not issue public demands while the U.S. is negotiating with Turkey to reach an understanding about Syria.\n\nStrategic partners do not talk via Twitter and social media, Cavusoglu said.\n\nThe foreign minister said Turkey has proposed a buffer zone along the Turkey-Syria border that seems compatible with Trump's demand for a safe zone around the Kurds, presuming the Kurds agree to fall back outside the buffer zone. He criticized the administration of Trump's predecessor, former President Barack Obama, for refusing to consider this proposal due to various excuses and said the Trump administration is only entertaining it now due to Turkey's determination.\n\nThe New York Times noted Trump's tweet was the first time he has publicly threatened Turkey, a fellow member of NATO. The Times worried Trump's aggressive comments could upend Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's attempt to reach a deal with Turkey to protect them.\n\nPompeo did not appear perturbed by Trump's tweets when he spoke with reporters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Monday.\n\nYou'll have to ask the president, he said when asked what Trump meant by economic devastation for Turkey. We have applied economic sanctions in many places, I assume he is speaking about those kinds of things. You'll have to ask him.\n\nPompeo endorsed Trump's demand for a safe zone around the Syrian Kurds. If we can get the space and the security arrangements right it would be a good thing for everyone in the region, he said.\n\nJust as Turkish and U.S. policies are at odds concerning the connection between Syrian Kurds and the Turkish PKK separatists, so the current proposals clash over the difference between Turkey's desire to establish a buffer zone around its border and the U.S. plan for a safe zone around the Kurds.\n\nDespite Turkey's talk of peace and olive branches, it has repeatedly made clear it intends to attack the Kurds if they do not withdraw from the envisioned buffer zone, which is considerably larger than what U.S. planners and the Kurds are comfortable with. Turkey's determination to push east of the Euphrates River is especially worrisome.\n\nWashington and other concerned foreign powers do not place a great deal of faith in Turkey's assurances that it can fight Kurdish terrorist militias without harming civilians or engaging in battle with Kurdish units directly supported by the West during the fight against ISIS.\n\nCavusoglu stated on Sunday that Turkey is offended by Trump administration officials, such as National Security Adviser John Bolton, and foreign governments, such as Israel, telling the Turks they cannot push as far into Syria as they deem necessary for their own security interests.\n\nWe do not seek permission from anyone. We would take necessary steps against terrorists near our borders, and we will decide the timing on our own, Cavusoglu said.
In a debate on Iranian TV, a former US marine called Iran the most peaceful nation on the planet while claiming the U.S. is an imperial monster and bully that blows up women and children on a daily basis, and blindly follows directives from Israel.\n\nKen O'Keefe, who attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship in 2001 , last week debated freelance journalist Philippe Assouline on the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIn the debate, broadcast on Iran's PressTV, O'Keefe espoused the unhinged conspiracy theory the U.S. government is run from enemies within the state, including the Israel lobby. Watch the video below:\n\nO'Keefe says the claim that Iran – which he calls one of the most peaceful nations on the planet – is developing nuclear weapons has no basis in fact and is part of an ongoing charade that is necessary in order to carry out Israeli policy, which is never-ending war, constant tensions, the threat of a third world war.\n\nO'Keefe notes that Iran's leadership has made it very clear that producing weapons of mass destruction is an affront to God.\n\nThis is in contrast to the U.S., which according to O'Keefe is a classic bully on the world stage that has no compunctions about using weapons of mass destruction all over the world.\n\nIf any nation should be disarming it should be the United States, says O'Keefe. [The U.S.] is destroying lives and is blowing apart women and children on a daily basis.\n\nO'Keefe, who becomes visibly angrier over the course of the debate, also claims that the U.S. is following Israeli policy to advance the Jewish state's plan for a Greater Israel.\n\nIsrael's long-term objective, says O'Keefe, is to expand into Syria, into Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and parts of Saudi Arabia.\n\nO'Keefe also accuses the mainstream media of being a bunch of prostitutes.\n\nHis opponent, Assouline, calls O'Keefe's comments amusing and a cartoonish fantasy. He also says that O'Keefe needs a psychologist.\n\nIn response to O'Keefe's defense of Iran, Assouline asserts that in addition to chants of death to America and death to Israel on a daily basis, the Islamic Republic has been showcasing its ballistic missile program. He adds that the country also shoots its own people in the streets for protesting elections.\n\nInfuriated that Assouline interrupted him, O'Keefe tells his opponent, You're an ignorant and unpolite [sic] man, I sit and listen to your nonsense while you speak over me.
Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) is pushing back against the planned bipartisan rollback of jail sentencing that will put violent drug offenders back out on the streets.\n\nOn his Wednesday morning radio show, Bill Bennett highlighted an important speech by Sessions which Bennett said turned the sentencing debate on its head.\n\nBennett played a segment of the Senator's March 7 speech wherein he imparted some extremely important facts that prove lower sentences for federal drug crimes is a major mistake.\n\nExcluding prosecutions in the magistrate courts, Sessions said:\n\nThe six month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We hadn't cut the number of drug prosecutors, we didn't cut the number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we've been doing for 25 years. And it's having an impact and I'm afraid it's going to continue.\n\nMake no mistake, Sessions continued, federal prisons are not filled with low-level, non-violent drug possessors. According to the bureau of justice statistics … 99.7 percent of drug offenders in federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug-trafficking offenses, not drug possession.\n\nBennett said he was flabbergasted by the statistics:\n\nThis [speech] turned this thing on its head, people have this so backwards. You hear this all the time, oh, all the money spent on law enforcement all the prisons are filled with these low-level drug users. Not true! Smoke a joint and the odds you're going to prison are virtually the same as if you don't smoke a joint. It's just a huge myth out that there.\n\nSessions pointed out in his speech that heroin, not low-level drugs like pot, is fueling the rise in inmates and is also fueling the rising violence. Sessions said:\n\nAccording to DEA's 2015 Threat Assessment, Mexican drug cartels control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United States, particularly in heroin markets. … Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin, and the administration has made it clear that officers are not to deviate from the President's lawless immigration policy.\n\nWe need to enforce our laws, the Alabama Senator added, and we have to make the consequences of drug trafficking a deterrent … Law enforcement plays a critical role in it. This means supporting, not blocking the efforts of law enforcement to do their jobs and giving them the tools to arrest drug traffickers and be effective at the border, putting them in jail, not giving them early release so they can commit more crimes.\n\nWe have to stop people from becoming addicts in the first place, and we can't let the fact that we have a heroin abuse epidemic cause us to forget that we have a drug trafficking epidemic too. Law enforcement is prevention, the Senator concluded.\n\nSessions isn't alone in opposing this push to soften sentencing for drug crimes. Recently Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) joined his Senate colleague in condemning the move.\n\nIt would be very dangerous and unwise to proceed with the Senate Judiciary bill, which would lead to the release of thousands of violent felons, Cotton told Politico on January 25. I think it's no surprise that Republicans are divided on this question … [but] I don't think any Republicans want legislation that is going to let out violent felons, which this bill would do.\n\nA group of law enforcement organizations also denounced the policy, saying the move is a strike against public safety.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

Washington (AFP) – Donald Trump replaced his intelligence chief Thursday as reports emerged that the US president was furious with the official over a briefing given to lawmakers about Russian interference in the 2020 election campaign.\n\nTrump erupted in anger at acting director of national intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire when he learned of the February 13 session with the House Intelligence Committee, US media reported.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Trump had objected to a specific element of the talk, in which Maguire aide Shelby Pierson reportedly told lawmakers Russia was once again meddling in the US election on Trump's behalf.\n\nBut the president was annoyed by the presence of Adam Schiff, the Democratic head of the investigation that led to Trump being impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, according to The New York Times.\n\nMaguire had been a favorite to be nominated for the permanent DNI post but Trump soured on the official, The Washington Post said, when he heard about the classified election security briefing.\n\nThe president berated Maguire in an Oval Office showdown last week for the disloyalty of his staff, the Post reported, effectively thwarting his chances of becoming a permanent hire.\n\nThere was a dressing down that was the catalyst for Maguire's sidelining, the Post quoted one unnamed source as saying.\n\nTrump was impeached in December over accusations that he coerced ally Ukraine into helping him cheat in the 2020 election, withholding military aid considered vital to the former Soviet republic in its war with Russia.\n\n– Trump defender –\n\nSince he was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate, an emboldened Trump has been purging the Justice Department, National Security Council and Pentagon of staff he considers disloyal.\n\nCasualties have included NSC staffer Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vindman and EU ambassador Gordon Sondland — both key witnesses in the impeachment inquiry — Vindman's twin brother, an NSC lawyer who wasn't involved, and Pentagon policy chief John Rood.\n\nTrump announced on Wednesday he was replacing Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany with a blunt approach that irritated the close ally.\n\nDemocrats have voiced outrage over the placement of Grenell, who takes charge after a period of tension between intelligence professionals and Trump, who has played down Russian interference in the last election.\n\nGrenell, 53, who has no relevant background or top-level management experience, will supervise 17 agencies including the CIA.\n\nHe is committed to a non-political, non-partisan approach as head of the Intelligence Community, on which our safety and security depend, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement Thursday.\n\nGrenell said on Twitter he would not serve permanently and that Trump would soon select someone else.\n\n– 'Unquestioning obedience' –\n\nTrump has declined to hire a permanent replacement for Dan Coats, who stepped down as DNI in August after standing firm on the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in 2016 to back Trump over Hillary Clinton.\n\nGrenell has previously cast doubt on the extent of Russia's efforts, saying that Moscow's activities were nothing new.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the intelligence committee, accused Trump of prioritizing unquestioning obedience over the safety of the American people.\n\nGrenell has cheered on the rise of right-wing populists in Europe, including hailing Austria's ultra-conservative chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, as a rock star.\n\nHe has been unusually outspoken for an ambassador in criticizing the country where he serves, including warning German companies over Twitter to comply with Trump's orders not to do business in Iran.\n\nNed Price, a former aide to president Barack Obama, said Trump has dropped the charade that he has any use for intelligence.\n\nHe has just named the most political — and abrasive — US ambassador to what it supposed to be the least political — and undoubtedly delicate — role, he wrote on Twitter.
An updated assessment of Russian national security, signed by President Vladimir Putin on New Year's Eve, names the United States as a threat, along with NATO. The report does not, however, list Syria as a threat, even though Russia is currently bombing rebel forces in that country.\n\nReuters reviews how the new appraisal, the first major revision in five years, describes the threat posed by the United States:\n\nIt says Russia has managed to heighten its role in solving global problems and international conflicts. That heightened role has caused a reaction by the West, it says. The strengthening of Russia happens against the background of new threats to the national security, which has complex and interrelated nature, the document says. Conducting an independent policy, both international and domestic has caused counteraction from the USA and its allies, which are striving to retain their dominance in global affairs. That in turn is likely to lead to political, economical, military and informational pressure on Russia, the document says.\n\nReuters writes that the new Russian threat assessment is a sign of how relations with the West have deteriorated in recent years.\n\nThe report also cites NATO expansion as a threat to Russia's security. As described by the Financial Times, complaints against NATO include the intensification of military activities of member countries, further expansion of the alliance, and moving military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders.\n\nNeither America nor NATO was listed as a security threat in the 2009 security assessment signed by Putin's predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev. The Financial Times notes that a Russian military strategy guide published only a year ago also stopped short of describing America or NATO as threats or enemies.\n\nUnsurprisingly, much of the tension in the new security assessment comes from the clash between Russia and Western powers over Ukraine and Crimea. As Russia sees it, the West supported an anti-constitutional coup in Ukraine (a reference to the ouster of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych), which led to a deep split in Ukrainian society and the emergence of an armed conflict, transforming Ukraine into a long-term source of instability in Europe and on Russia's borders.\n\nThe Russians do not think much of the so-called Arab Spring, either, complaining that the practice of overthrowing legitimate political regimes is becoming more widespread, provoking domestic instability and conflicts. They blame the rise of the Islamic State, in part, on Western support for rebel forces in Syria.\n\nSo much for Hillary Clinton's famously bungled reset button stunt, President Obama whispering to Putin that he would have more flexibility to accommodate Russian missile demands after he got re-elected, and the spectacle of the Obama team mocking 2012 rival Mitt Romney for warning that Russia represented a major geopolitical threat to the United States.\n\nOne of President Obama's taunts at Romney during the 2012 campaign said that the 1980s called and wanted their foreign policy back. It looks like the 80s called the Kremlin, too, and Vladimir Putin picked up the phone.
Would you buy a communications system from an oppressive, secretive, totalitarian regime which may be responsible for perhaps the deadliest viral pandemic since the catastrophic Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919?\n\nEven before the coronavirus raised its terrifying head, buying 5G technology from China's Huawei looked like a bad idea for Britain.\n\nNow it's looking like the most stupid idea since the Trojans saw the Wooden Horse their Greek enemies had left outside the gates of Ilium and said: Nice! Let's drag it inside.\n\nTo recap, 5G — which stands for 'fifth generation' — is the next wave of wireless telecoms technology. Insanely, against the advice of allies from the U.S. to Australia, the British government has decided to award the contract for this strategically vital communications system to a country which is not only a major geopolitical rival but which is also infamous for spying on its competitors: China.\n\nAccording to MP and ex-soldier Tom Tugendhat this is unacceptable.\n\nTo see how extraordinary it is we're even considering it, ask the question in reverse: would China let a British company build the critical national infrastructure that controls every other system? — Tom Tugendhat (@TomTugendhat) January 27, 2020\n\nSir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6, has warned that Huawei 'without question' poses a threat to British security.\n\nPresident Trump, too, has urged Britain to be 'very careful' about using Huawei in its 5G network.\n\nEven George Soros recognises that Huawei represents a massive security threat and has praised Trump's decision to stand firm against it as the greatest, and perhaps only, foreign policy accomplishment of the Trump administration.\n\nIf a problem is serious enough for Trump and Soros to agree on it, then you know it's a serious problem.\n\nSo how on earth is Britain still considering allowing this viper into its bosom?\n\nThe stupidity, as Dominic Lawson reports here in the Daily Mail, can be traced back to the era when those two globalist chumps Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne were running the show. Both were determined to prove how modern and forward looking they were by forging a relationship with the world's most dynamic new power China.\n\nIn fact, the nexus between Huawei and the UK began as long ago as 2003, when BT began talks with the Chinese company to provide devices aggregating customer lines and connecting them to the main part of the network. The contract was signed in 2005. Astoundingly, although BT told the Cabinet Office that it was proposing to lock Huawei into UK telecommunications, the civil service 'did not refer the issue to ministers or even inform them until 2006 — a year after the contract between BT and Huawei had been signed', according to the damning words of a 2013 Commons Security and Intelligence Committee report.\n\nIn other words, this was a clandestine agreement cooked up by the administrative state with no public consultation.\n\nBut the Cameron/Osborne era, you might have hoped, was a period of embarrassing, faux-Conservative sclerosis, incompetence and managed decline from which a forward-looking Conservative PM like Boris Johnson would hope to distance himself.\n\nApparently not, for the current rumours are that rather than nix this disastrous deal made by his discredited predecessors, Boris is instead minded to go ahead with it.\n\nThe reasons for cancelling the Huawei deal are manifest; the reasons for sticking with it are murky and obscure – but seem to have something to do with what Trump would call the Deep State and what in Britain we might call the 'liberal elite' or the 'corrupt, self-serving Westminster bubble.'\n\nCertainly, Huawei has worked long and hard to buy the favours of those in power.\n\nAs Lawson reports:\n\nThe Conservative Party has complacently taken many thousands of pounds in donations to its coffers from Huawei. The Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, joined the Huawei 'advisory board'. (She was accompanied in this enterprise by such luminaries as the former senior civil servant Sir Andrew Cahn, the former BP chief executive Lord Browne, and the late former head of the Confederation of British Industry, Dame Helen Alexander.) Huawei's meticulous ingratiation into the heart of the British Establishment went to the very top: it donated half a million pounds to the Prince's Trust. It was only a year ago that Prince Charles's most treasured public enterprise declared it would 'not be accepting new donations from Huawei' because of 'public concerns'.\n\nFurthermore, the Civil Service has clearly already decided at the most senior levels to push through the Huawei deal, come what may.\n\nThe villain of the piece, according to this scoop by Glen Owen in the Mail on Sunday, is Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill.\n\nGovernment sources say Mr Johnson has 'buckled' under pressure from Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill to let Huawei help to build the system. They claim that Sir Mark, the powerful head of the Civil Service, has 'manipulated' Mr Johnson into agreeing the deal by presenting it as a 'fait accompli' – and by 'nobbling' the British security services into dropping their objections. A source said: 'There is a massive row brewing over all this. 'Sedwill is telling people not to 'worry their little heads about it', and manipulating Boris into appeasement by saying that as the deal was already given the green light by Theresa May, to cancel it would require him to actively reverse the decision of a predecessor.' Sir Mark has told the Prime Minister that a ban on Huawei equipment would delay the widespread introduction of 5G for at least two years after the 2025 deadline in the Tory manifesto – and would also delay the availability of super-fast broadband.\n\nLike his equally grim predecessor Jeremy Heywood, Mark Sedwill is the embodiment of the left-leaning, globalist, Remain-championing, entrenched Establishment which sought so hard to derail Brexit.\n\nThe same goes for so many of the influential figures in government and the Civil Service and industry who have been pushing for Huawei (and also for the similarly counterproductive and pointless HS2): this is the Remoaner resistance doing its damnedest to ruin post-Brexit Britain.\n\nThese are the kind of people who, we've been assured by insiders, are going to be swept away by the new broom of Boris's chief advisor Dominic Cumming, in a bid to make Britain more democratically accountable and less in thrall to a shadowy administrative state.\n\nIf so, it would appear that Cummings has been outfoxed. Heaven knows what arch-retainer Sedwill may have promised in order to keep his job but it looks like he was speaking with forked tongue or, perhaps, that he concocted some kind of devil's pact where he agreed to put his weight behind a frictionless Brexit in return for being granted certain favours in return. If that is indeed the case – though it's pure speculation on my part – then the British people have been very ill-served by this stitch-up.\n\nAnd just when the Huawei deal couldn't look any more unattractive, along comes the coronavirus to emphasise the nature of the regime we are dealing with.\n\nThe coronavirus has emerged from Wuhan which, not uncoincidentally, is the home of China's germ warfare programme.\n\nRather than nip the problem in the bud, China has behaved exactly as you would expect a secretive, totalitarian regime to behave: lying about the virility and morbidity of the infection; allowing as many as 5 million people to leave Wuhan before any quarantine was able to take effect; lobbying the World Health Organisation not to declare it a global emergency.\n\nAnd this is a regime that Britain is now trusting with its wireless technology?\n\nThe Huawei deal is starting to look like an unforced error so epically naive, dangerous and wrongheaded that it threatens to eclipse anything Boris Johnson may achieve in the rest of his administration.\n\nIt's also a betrayal of the very thing on which Boris had hoped to stake his legacy: delivering a successful, meaningful Brexit.\n\nOne of the key elements in Boris's vision of a bright, post-Brexit future for Britain outside the European Union is international trade: all those incredible deals Britain is going to negotiate once it is no longer shackled by EU regulations – starting, of course, with the 'very big deal' promised by President Trump with the U.S.\n\nBut Trump has since made it clear that one of the main obstacles to such a deal is if Britain ignores its allies' security concerns and goes ahead with the Huawei deal.\n\nIf you wanted to be cynical, you could argue that the Remain-biased Civil Service — led by arch-Remainer Mark Sedwill — is using the Huawei deal as a cunning way to sabotage Boris's post-Brexit deals in order to make the Brexit vote look like a mistake and to make a return to membership of the EU more likely. You would also, quite likely, be absolutely right in your assessment.\n\nWe have scotched the Remainer snake but we have not killed it. No doubt it will come back to bite us many times hence.
In the midst of Europe's ongoing migrant crisis, Austria's population grew by 115,000 last year to almost 8.7 million, according to official figures.\n\nThis represents a significant higher rate of growth than in 2014, when the population grew by around 77,000, with 75,000 of last year's new arrivals coming from states outside the European Union.\n\n'Statistics Austria' says the number of Syrians entering the country rose by 21,800, with Afghanis increasing by 18,300 and Iraqis by 10,000.\n\nThe news comes as separate figures reveal unemployment has risen to nearly half a million in the country whose total population is less than 9 million.\n\nAustrian paper Der Standard reports that just over 490,000 people were registered unemployed last month, marking a 10 per cent increase on the same time last year, suggesting the massive influx of migrants is failing to boost the country's economy.\n\nOne city that is particularly hard-hit is the capital Vienna, which coincidentally also experienced the highest population growth last year.\n\nThe city took in 43,200 people in 2015, taking its total population to 1.84 million. At the same time, 141,718 of its citizens are registered unemployed, including 58,000 non-Austrians. This represents a 17 per cent increase in the number of unemployed foreigners in the city over the past year.\n\nSocial Affairs Minister Alois Stöger tried to put a brave face on the figures by claiming the rise was smaller than in previous months, but admitted there is no sign yet of the labour market recovering.\n\nIn the mean time, the Austrian government has announced plans to deport some 50,000 failed asylum seekers over the next four years as it attempts to get tough following the failure of its open borders policy.\n\nDeutsche Welle reports the country's government will also seek to cap the number of new asylum seekers at 37,500 this year compared the 90,000 it accepted in 2015.\n\nInterior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said: We are already among the countries with the most expulsions, but we will step up the pace and will increase the upward trend.\n\nGive the huge influx over the past year, however, the figure of 50,000 will likely raise scepticism over whether the Austrian government can effectively deal with the ongoing migrant crisis.\n\nForeign Minister Sebastian Kurz said the new policy was important, but even more important is to end our open door policy and not let so many refugees into the country in future.\n\nIt is also not just unemployment that is causing concern. Yesterday, the trial began of 13 suspected jihadis who were detained last year after a series of raids in cities across Austria.\n\nDer Standard says the trial, in city of Graz, is being held under such tight security that journalists have to apply for accreditation before being given access to the court room.\n\nAmong those accused is a radical Islamist preacher who is charged with various terror offences, including murder.\n\nThe trial comes as Austria deals with an increasing Islamist presence in its countries, with dozens of citizens as well as newly arrived migrants feared to have radical connections.
California Governor Gavin Newsom's first act in office was to propose extending state healthcare benefits to more illegal aliens.\n\nOn Tuesday, shortly after being sworn in, Newsom — who ran on the proposal of providing healthcare to everyone in California, though he struggled to explain how he would pay for it — signed an executive order taking steps in that direction.\n\nIn his first executive order, Newsom directed the state to create a single government purchaser for prescription drugs to increase negotiating leverage with pharmaceutical companies. Alongside the order, Newsom proposed extending Medi-Cal — the state's version of Medicaid — to illegal aliens up to the age of 26, rather than 19.\n\nThe governor's forthcoming budget, his office said, will make California the first state in the nation to cover young undocumented adults through a state Medicaid program.\n\nThat would cover 138,000 young people in the country illegally, according to the Associated Press.\n\nUndocumented young adults should not have to worry about losing their health coverage when they turn 19, the governor's office added, saying that the budget proposals, to be presented later this week, would defend Obamacare from recent federal attacks and bring the state closer toward the goal of health care for all.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Newsom promised sanctuary to all who seek it — a reference to California's status as a sanctuary state for illegal aliens that refuses to help enforce federal immigration law.\n\nThat policy continues to be a lightning rod for national criticism after the murder last month of Corporal Ronil Singh, a legal immigrant and police officer who was allegedly shot and killed by an illegal alien during a traffic stop.\n\nIn addition, Newsom's new budget proposes increasing the size of the subsidies for families who already receive it, and it would make California the first state to make subsidies available to middle income families, his office said.\n\nTo pay for the expansion of those benefits, Newsom is proposing that California restore the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, which was canceled by President Donald Trump at the federal level.\n\nSchumer also sent a letter to President Trump and to congressional leaders asking for legislative changes that he argues would make it easier for states, including California, to develop a single-payer healthcare system.\n\nJoel B.

Establishment advocates are insisting that January 19 is the drop-dead deadline for a DACA or Dreamer amnesty, just two weeks after the advocates insisted that December 22 was the drop-dead deadline.\n\nThe January deadline claim is based on the advocates' claim that agency officials need a few weeks planning time to prepare and launch the amnesty by March 5 when the two-year work-permits invented by President Barack Obama will start expiring at a more rapid pace.\n\nGOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have described March as a deadline, even though hundreds of thousand of work-permits will remain valid after that date. For example, only half of the roughly 650,000 work permits will expire by November 2018, says a business group.\n\nThe last of the DACA work-permits granted by Obama to illegals will expire in in 2019, but the expirations will open up to 300,000 jobs — perhaps at decent wages — before November to some of the nine million working-age American men who have been sidelined by post-1990s wage-freeze.\n\nHere are nine reasons why President Donald Trump should ignore the claimed January deadline — and the alternative March deadline — to ensure that American voters get what they want from the establishment:\n\n1. Delays help Trump pressure Democrats to accept his popular pro-American policies. Many Democrats don't believe Trump will allow the DACA work-permits to continue expiring in March, so feel little pressure to trade their policy priorities for continuing work-permits. So if Trump declines to negotiate a deal until after the expirations accelerate in March, Democrats will recognize that Trump is playing hardball. They [now] think they have the upper hand, they don't really believe he will pull the trigger and let [DACA] expire, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. It is important to not just wait until March but to wait until [more illegals] lose their work permits to ensure the Democrats come back to the table and stop saying 'My way or the high way.' 2. Delays help Democrats make mistakes. In December, Trump called the Democrats' bluff when they suggested they would shut down the government spending unless the GOP gave them an amnesty. That was a bluff in December, and it will be a bluff in January or March or November 2018 because polls show that Americans strongly oppose any government shutdown to help illegals. But Democratic leaders are under pressure from angry illegals — many of whom believed the Democrats' shutdown-or-amnesty threats — and that grassroots pressure may cause the Democrats leaders to make concessions or make further mistakes, such as blocking the next budget deal which is due by January 19. The Washington Post reported January 4: Government funding may depend on a deal with Democrats on dreamers, said Stan Collender, a nonpartisan budget expert and Forbes columnist. 3. Delay helps the economy improve, not merely expand. The government has a duty to help create a labor market where Americans' ability to fairly earn higher wages is balanced with pressure on investors to buy American-made, labor-saving machinery instead of just relying on government-imported cheap labor. But any DACA or a bigger 'Dreamer' amnesty would subsidize investors by giving them more welfare-funded immigrant-customers, so enlarging the consumer economy while damaging the nation's productivity-based economic growth. Any focus on the core economic issue of productivity means that a delay is the high-minded, good-government policy favored by statesmen, in contrast to the crony-capitalist deals favored by billionaires and donation-seeking politicians. 4. Delay is good for the public fisc. The proposed amnesty is far larger and more expensive than its supporters now admit. For example, the bipartisan DREAM Act amnesty would reach 3.25 million initially, while chain-migration would add millions more. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the 10-year cost to be $26 billion, but that estimate ignored DREAM Act loopholes which would sharply boost the numbers and costs. So a delay would allow officials to better grasp the cost and scale of the proposed amnesty. 5. Delay makes for honest government. Obama's DACA policy offered temporary work-permits — not permanent work-permits — pending a solution by Congress. In fact, Obama claimed in June 2012 that this is a temporary stopgap measure. By allowing Obama's temporary work permit to remain temporary, Trump is simply implementing the claimed spirit of Obama's promise — even if Obama intended to make his temporary deal into a permanent fixture. 6. Delay keeps Trump's political opponents fixated on their unpoular pro-illegal-immigrant rhetoric throughout 2018, while an amnesty deal instead would give Democrats a morale-boost before the 2018 election — plus the time to shift towards more popular rhetoric, such as stoking fears about government medical care. By refusing an amnesty, Trump helps makes the 2018 election all about the Democrats' noisy and unpopular demands for limitless amnesty. 7. Delay helps Trump's 2018 election turnout. Under Trump's Buy American, Hire American policies, wages are now rising in some cities, perhaps marking the arrival of a wage-boom in the run-up to the 2018 election. The scheduled expiration of DACA will nudge many illegals out of the labor market before November, likely boosting wages for American voters and encouraging the roughly nine million sidelined working-age American men to take jobs. But Trump's support for an amnesty would show that the establishment's cheap-labor policies are King, so deflating pressure on employers to pay higher wages to workers in the run-up to the 2018 election. 8. Delay gives time to Democrats to gradually accept the nation's desire to shift from a high immigration/low-wage economy to a low-immigration/high-wage economy. This huge economic change will impose a huge psychological shift among Democrats, plus their billionaire and media allies, who have persuaded themselves that voters really want business groups to get an unending stream of cheap-labor in the hope that the cheap-labor will also vote Democratic. Many Democrats have already started their journey with shock on November 8, 2016, but it just takes time for people to work their way through denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, and eventually, acceptance and renewed hope. A DACA delay will help Democrats get through the bargaining stage, prior to guilt in summer, anger in November, then depression in Christmas and acceptance in the Spring of 2019. 9. Delays are not a primary problem because the 3.25 million 'dreamers,' including the 700,000 'DACA' illegals are foreigners and their interests are simply less important than Americans' interests, regardless of any deadline. Few of the illegals will be deported in 2018, partly because enforcement officers are chasing the many criminals protected under Obama's deputies. But if Trump's American First policy is to make any progress, he must first start by helping Americans get higher wages before offering the huge benefit of citizenship to foreigners who have jumped the line at the nation's large and generous immigration offices.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting 1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.\n\nThe cheap-labor policy has also reduced investment and job creation in many interior states because the coastal cities have a surplus of imported labor. For example, almost 27 percent of zip codes in Missouri had fewer jobs or businesses in 2015 than in 2000, according to a new report by the Economic Innovation Group. In Kansas, almost 29 percent of zip codes had fewer jobs and businesses in 2015 compared to 2000, which was a two-decade period of massive cheap-labor immigration.\n\nBecause of the successful cheap-labor strategy, wages for men have remained flat since 1973, and a large percentage of the nation's annual income has shifted to investors and away from employees.
The United States Census Bureau has stopped tallying the number of illegal aliens living in the U.S., an order initially requested by President Trump, according to a report.\n\nAs part of an executive order issued by Trump, the president had ordered the Census Bureau to tally the number of illegal aliens in each state. The total would allow congressional apportionment, where the number of U.S. House seats are allocated, to be based on the citizen and legal immigrant population to prevent states like California, with large illegal populations, from inflating their congressional power.\n\nThe Census Bureau, according to NPR, has stopped all efforts in tallying the total number of illegal aliens living in the U.S., as President-Elect Joe Biden is soon to be inaugurated:\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau has halted all work on President Trump's directive to produce a state-by-state count of unauthorized immigrants that would have been used to alter a key set of census numbers, NPR has learned. [Emphasis added] Senior career officials at the bureau instructed the internal team assigned to carry out Trump's presidential memo to stand down and cease their work immediately on Tuesday night, according to a bureau employee who spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation in the workplace for speaking out. [Emphasis added]\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court threw out a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the state of New York to Trump's order in a 6-3 decision. The unsigned majority opinion said the challenge was premature because the impact of the order is not known.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ACLU praised the Census Bureau's stopping their count of the illegal alien population.\n\nPresident Trump tried and failed throughout his entire presidency to weaponize the census for his attacks on immigrant communities, ACLU attorneys wrote in a statement.\n\nIt appears he has failed yet again. We now call upon President-elect Biden to formally rescind this unconstitutional policy after inauguration, they continued. Doing so would send the message that under our Constitution, everyone in this country counts.\n\nNow that the Census Bureau has stopped counting the illegal alien population, it is unlikely for the order to be carried out. Biden has suggested that he will not pursue the effort, claiming previously that the U.S. Constitution clearly requires illegal aliens to be counted in congressional apportionment.\n\nStates such as Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia are projected to lose congressional seats if the illegal alien population is included in congressional apportioning.\n\nToday, there are an estimated 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. The Census estimates that based on current legal and illegal immigration levels, by 2060 about one-in-six residents will have been born outside the country.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba, compared a violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday by alleged supporters of President Donald Trump to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln and the destruction of the White House by the British in 1814.\n\nFollowing a large protest that Trump addressed on Wednesday – where he told the crowd to get your people to fight and if they don't fight we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight.\n\nWe're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women, Trump promised, but instead departed to the White House on his own while a small group of those in attendance went to the Capitol and burglarized it, leading to at least four deaths. Photos from inside the Capitol during the raid showed rioters breaking through glass windows, looting items from the historic building, and rushing into the legislative chambers. The riot caused lawmakers, who were in the middle of certifying the electoral college votes for President-elect Joe Biden, to go into hiding. They formalized Biden's election in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nTrump responded to the riot with a video in which he told the rioters, we love you, you're very special and that he felt their pain. Go home, he added.\n\nLike other rogue states and human rights abusers around the world, Cuba's state media covered the violence as indicative of the decline of the United States in its entirety. Granma claimed the incident was the gravest in the history of the [Capitol] building, symbol of American power, since the British, on August 24, 1814, burned it down along with the White House and other government institutions.\n\nGlass was literally broken in the 'window of democracy' with which the United States has attempted to lecture the world, the Granma article read.\n\nThe gravity of the situation also perhaps recalls other incidents in the outskirts of the city, like the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, who was shot in the head while attending a play at the Ford Theater, Granma continued.\n\nGranma did not elaborate on the comparison, and the similarities are not immediately clear, as there is no indication that Trump was personally in danger at any point on Wednesday. The assassination of Lincoln in 1865 followed the U.S. Civil War, the most violent period moment in American history not involving foreign powers.\n\nThe newspaper concluded by wryly lamenting that few will allude to an alleged attack against the Cuban embassy in Washington in April.\n\nIn another article, Granma hinted that the one incident on Wednesday could somehow result in America causing international chaos, without elaborating.\n\nHopefully these Trumpist tricks do not have implications beyond the borders of the U.S. and the threats from Trump, [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo, and others in the fundamentalist select group, who insist on possible acts of war, do not become reality, the propaganda outlet declared.\n\nJuventud Rebelde, a Cuban state propaganda outlet geared towards young communists, also published a column speculating that the riots were the beginning of a civil war, an attempted coup, and an attack on democracy, citing unnamed observers.\n\nThe article, titled Chaos in the Empire, favorably relayed condemnation of President Trump by Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) and The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump consultant collective.\n\nThe Trump administration prioritized foreign policy initiatives that made it more difficult for the Cuban communist regime to oppress its people, in contrast with the appeasement strategy of predecessor Barack Obama. Among the policies implemented against the Castro regime were the conclusion of people to people tours to Cuba – an exception to the embargo under Obama – and the outlawing of American cruises to Cuba. While tourism to Cuba is technically not legal under the longstanding embargo, Obama legalized tourism via cruise ships, netting the Castro regime millions of dollars.\n\nTrump's Cuba policy has resulted in a decline in politically motivated arrests in Cuba from the peaks of the Obama era and growing signs of popular dissent, including an unprecedented protest at the Havana Ministry of Culture in November.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has vowed to undo the Trump policies and revert to Obama's thaw towards Cuba.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Wednesday that it would not allow any cotton or tomato products from Xinjiang, China's westernmost province, into the country due to the high likelihood that they were produced by slave labor.\n\nXinjiang is the homeland of the nation's Muslim-majority Uyghur ethnic group, which has faced severe repression by the Chinese Communist Party for decades, culminating in the construction of over 1,000 concentration camps to house members of the group. Survivors of the camps — which at their peak populations were believed to have imprisoned as many as 3 million people — say that Communist Party officials force Uyghurs and other ethnic minority people to endure indoctrination, torture, forced sterilization, forced abortions, rape, and slavery at those camps.\n\nA study released in March 2020 revealed that forced labor was not limited to Xinjiang. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), the Chinese government incentivized companies throughout the nation to use Uyghur slaves, presumably shipped out of the Xinjiang camps, in forced labor for the manufacturing of products sold by dozens of international companies, including brand names like Nike, BMW, and Nintendo. Subsequent reports have revealed that cotton-picking, an extremely arduous undertaking, has become a preferred industry for the Chinese Communist Party to force Uyghurs into.\n\nIn research published last month, Dr. Adrian Zenz revealed Beijing uses sophisticated poverty alleviation mobile applications to target Uyghurs to enslave in cotton fields.\n\nCBP had previously limited imports into the United States of Xinjiang cotton products by specific companies believed to benefit from slave labor, but has now expanded that to all Xinjiang cotton. It has not limited shipments from other parts of China, where evidence suggests Uyghurs have been bussed in to engage in forced labor.\n\nOver 80 percent of the cotton cultivated in China comes from Xinjiang, representing about a fifth of the cotton produced around the world.\n\nDHS [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] will not tolerate forced labor of any kind in U.S. supply chains, acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said in a statement Wednesday. We will continue to protect the American people and investigate credible allegations of forced labor, we will prevent goods made by forced labor from entering our country, and we demand the Chinese close their camps and stop their human rights violations.\n\nThe CBP explained that the new order will direct CBP personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to detain cotton products and tomato products grown or produced by entities operating in Xinjiang. Extensive evidence exists, CBP noted, that tomato products from Xinjiang are also produced using widespread forced labor.\n\nThe agency identified the following forced labor indicators through the course of its investigation: debt bondage, restriction of movement, isolation, intimidation and threats, withholding of wages, and abusive living and working conditions, CBP explained. It listed the affected products as including, but not limited to, apparel, textiles, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, and other goods made with cotton and tomatoes.\n\nTextile manufacturers have complained in the past that limiting imports from China and forcing them to find options that do not use slave labor would hurt their business.\n\nAs a country, we simply do not have the capability or capacity to implement or comply with or enforce a blanket WRO [Withhold Release Order], Stephen Lamar, head of the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA), told Congress in September 2020, objecting to Congress's Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would ban imports from Xinjiang generally with exceptions only for those who can prove their products were not made with forced labor.\n\nWhile most companies accused of using Xinjiang slave labor — even those reportedly lobbying Congress to let them continue the practice, like Nike and Coca-Cola — do not promote the fact that they do business in the region, some openly boast about it. In the credits at the end of the Disney film Mulan, the corporation thanks Xinjiang police authorities, responsible for running the concentration camps, for their help in filming the movie. Companies like Japan's Uniqlo advertise that their clothing is superior because it is made from Xinjiang cotton, famous for its superb quality.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party reacted with ire to the new limitations.\n\nChina is firmly opposed to this, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday, in response to a question from a reporter about the CBP move. 'Forced labor' is the biggest lie of the century made by persons and agencies in some Western countries including the United States, with an aim to restrict and suppress the relevant Chinese authorities and companies and contain China's development.\n\nZhao called concerns about slavery despicable.\n\nSimilarly, Wang Wenbin, a colleague of Zhao's, complained last year that the CBP's prior limitations on imports from Xinjiang were a naked act of bullying against China.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
The Times of Israel reports: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday said that Israel must maintain its military control over the West Bank in the event of a peace agreement with the Palestinians.\n\nThe idea that we can give up territory and achieve peace is not right, Netanyahu told Army Radio in a pre-Shavuot holiday interview. In order to assure our existence we need to have military and security control over all of the territory west of the Jordan [River], he said, reaffirming his commitment to a policy that is rejected by Palestinians, who seek a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory.\n\nIn the radio interview, Netanyahu asserted the root of the conflict lies not with Israeli settlements in the West Bank, but rather in Palestinian intransigence regarding recognition of Jewish rights to any part of the land.\n\nRead more here.
An education consultant said on Sunday that a crisis is brewing in New York public schools where the number of eighth graders failing math exams has tripled since the state started administering Common Core tests.\n\nThe number of students who failed eighth grade math exams went from 14,000 in 2012 to 44,483 most recently.\n\nI think you have a storm warning, David Rubel, a consultant for city parochial schools told the New York Post. That's a huge number of kids not on track to graduate.\n\nThose statistics are cited at the conclusion of an article about how New York high school students are passing tests, not because of increased knowledge but because the bar has been repeatedly set lower to get desired results.\n\nIt's a tough test—but not so tough to pass, the Post reported. New York high-schoolers who took the Regents Common Core Algebra I exam this month had to earn just 27 of 86 points, or 31.4 percent, to pass.\n\nOn the Regents grading scale, that gives them a minimum passing score of 65, the Post reported. The required number of right answers remains at its lowest level since the exam—which kids must pass to graduate—was introduced three years ago, records show.\n\nThis manipulation of passing grades is aimed at raising the overall pass rate, according to the Post.\n\nIn August 2014, 31 points, or 36 percent was a passing mark, with last year's cutoff at 30 points, or 34.9 percent.\n\nAs a result, 72 percent of students statewide passed the exam last year, back to the pre-Common Core level in the 2013-2014 school year, the Post reported. The pass rate had plunged to 63 percent in 2014-2015, when the harder exam was launched.\n\nAaron Pallas, chairman of education policy and social analysis at Columbia's Teachers College, said these standards are a political decision.\n\nOfficials want a challenging test but a scoring system that doesn't knock down the graduation rate—and outrage parents, the Post noted.\n\nCutoff scores have been manipulated to produce politically desirable results in many jurisdictions, Bob Schaeffer, public education director for the national watchdog FairTest, told the Post.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf wants to fund a $32 million budget deficit by grabbing millions in revenue from November's voter-approved soda tax initiative — and critics are accusing her of a bait-and-switch.\n\nAccording to the East Bay Times, three of the nine members of the City Council are blasting Mayor Libby Schaaf's plan to repurpose the soda tax revenue away from health spending to plug the city's two-year budget that she plans to present on May 5.\n\nThe mayor's spokesperson, Erica Derryck, issue a statement on May 1 claiming that Schaaf's plan's use of the revenues is consistent with the goals of the measure.\n\nCity of Oakland voters approved Measure HH on the November ballot by an over 61 percent majority. The initiative assessed a tax of one-cent-per-ounce on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverage products including sodas, sports drinks, sweetened teas, energy drinks and fruit products that were not 100 percent pure juice.\n\nThe City Council's big selling point to voters for the tax increase was the Oakland City Auditor's Impartial Analysis of Measure HH'that promised soda tax revenues would be managed by a nine-member 'Community Advisory Board comprised of medical, dental and School District parents to determine how and to what extent the City Council should establish and fund programs to prevent or reduce the health consequences of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages in Oakland.\n\nThe big reason that the City of Oakland is willing to anger voters is that the union wage and pension costs from the city council's July 2014 passage of a $15 minimum wage are jumping. With the latest spike to $12.86 an hour on January 1, the mayor and her 5 council allies are desperate to find new cash.\n\nThe Oakland City Council's own December 2014 minimum wage staff report highlighted that that there was no legislative solution to address the annual wage-cost impact from thousands of unionized city recreational aides, senior aides and part-time student trainees jumping in cost by 35 percent from $18,155 to $24,500 per year. The city's SEIU contract also requires equivalent higher contributions for sick leave and pension benefits.\n\nThe California Policy Center reported that the Oakland's Human Resources Management Department also expected a $15 minimum wage to have a contractual ripple effect from the compaction of city wage comparisons. SEIU labor contracts mandate that higher-classification public employees must also receive compaction wage and pension increases.\n\nCouncilman Noel Gallo told the San Francisco CBS TV affiliate that there is no problem with how the soda tax will now be spent because It will be used to support children and family activities. Gallo says the soda tax will support libraries, parks, fix potholes, and build affordable housing.\n\nCritics point out that the burden of the soda tax falls disproportionately on the poor.\n\nThe first hearing of the mayor's budget will be on May 5. The final City of Oakland budget must be adopted by June 30.
Tourism revenue is down in the city of Dresden and the local government blames the PEGIDA movement for scaring away potential visitors.\n\nThe total number of overnight stays in the German city of Dresden have decreased in 2015 according to Die Zeit. The Saxony capital has seen a three per cent decline in hotel bookings though they were still able to attract 4.3 million visitors.\n\nThe managing director of Dresden Marketing (DMG) Bettina Bunge lays the blame not at the declining global economy, which has seen severe contractions, but rather at the PEGIDA movement. She said that the group which meets weekly in the main square of Dresden and often attracts hundreds to thousands, had caused a loss of image due to what she called xenophobic sloganeering.\n\nShe went on to say: People have consciously decided not to to visit Dresden and cancelled their personal and business trips from what tourism operators and industry representatives have told us.\n\nTourists from within Germany do seem to have declined slightly according to figures but international visitors haven't been deterred or influenced at all. Stays by international tourists have actually increased by 6.1 per cent in the last year to almost 900,000 people.\n\nMost tourists to the city come from neighbouring countries Switzerland and Austria but also many come from the United States. The only significant decline in international tourism was from Russians who have cancelled many holiday plans all over Europe because of the falling price of the rouble against the euro.\n\nBusiness leaders in Saxony are afraid that the attention PEGIDA has brought, and likely the German media response, is giving many the impression that Dresden is a haven of xenophobic activity. Leaders met with regional vice minister Stefan Brangs to counter the image and make the city have a more welcoming image.\n\nThe president of the business federation of Saxony is sceptical of results and says that the decline in tourism could hurt many businesses in the area. He blames PEGIDA, saying they're probably not interested in how well businesses do.\n\nSaxony has become the epicentre of the latest media controversy in Germany after a video went viral showing bus full of migrants who were stopped by local protesters in the small town of Clausnitz. Media reacted by calling the non-violent protesters xenophobic and went as far as saying their slogans of we are the people were inciting hate against migrants.\n\nMembers of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party admitted involvement in the protest, reports Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung but while leader Frauke Petry regretted the tone of the people involved she supported the right of the people to protest saying:\n\nWe believe that protest is necessary, not against those entering Germany, but against those who are responsible for this migration policy.\n\nThe Clausnitz asylum centre director was also fired after the video, reports Kurier, following allegations that he was also a member of the AfD. It is alleged that his brother was one of the organisers of the protest and that he was removed from his position for his own safety.
On Thursday, the U.S. military published a report on the death of 33 Afghan civilians, and wounding of 27 others, during a joint U.S. and Afghan special forces raid against the Taliban in November.\n\nThe investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict, and in accordance with all applicable regulations and policy, the military said in a statement quoted by Reuters.\n\nIt has been determined that no further action will be taken because U.S. forces acted in self-defense and followed all applicable law and policy, the statement said.\n\nThe operation was intended to drive Taliban forces from the area around Kunduz, which they had overrun in October 2015, and partially occupied the year before that. Specifically, two senior Taliban commanders were targeted in village of Buz-e-Kandahari. (They were indeed killed during the raid, along with an estimated 26 Taliban fighters.)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports U.S. and Afghan forces were led into a trap by the Taliban and ambushed on a dead-end street. The Taliban opened fire from within civilian structures, inflicting several casualties and forcing the American and Afghan troops to call for air support. Two U.S. soldiers were killed and four wounded during the battle, while the Afghans lost three commandos and had 11 wounded.\n\nAccording to the investigation, the responding aircraft appropriately used the minimum amount of force required to neutralize the various threats from the civilian buildings.\n\nThe report said no civilians were identified by U.S. special forces during the firefight, the dead and wounded civilians were effectively serving as human shields for the Taliban, and some of the casualties resulted from a Taliban ammo dump exploding.\n\nThe Associated Press notes that after the battle was over, local residents carried over a dozen corpses of the dead, including children and family members of the Taliban fighters, toward a local governor's office in a show of rage.\n\nRegardless of the circumstances, I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives. On this occasion the Taliban chose to hide amongst civilians and then attacked Afghan and U.S. forces, said General John Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. I wish to assure President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan that we will take all possible measures to protect Afghan civilians. We will continue to assist the Afghan security forces in their efforts to defend their country.\n\nThe Associated Press notes that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani criticized the Taliban for using civilians as shields shortly after the raid in November.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal offers some contextual information that doesn't square easily with departing President Barack Obama's self-congratulatory rhetoric about pulling U.S. troops out of Afghanistan:\n\nCivilian casualties in Afghanistan increased in 2016, with more than 5,000 deaths recorded in the first half of the year, according to the United Nations. Data for the remainder of the year hasn't been released. The U.S. Air Force dramatically increased the number of airstrikes it carried out in Afghanistan in 2016, data released by the military shows, a further sign of growing U.S. involvement in the country's war following the withdrawal of most coalition troops two years ago.\n\nJust about every media report on the outcome of this military investigation mentions the controversial U.S. airstrike in the Kunduz region from October 2015, which killed 42 at a Doctors Without Borders hospital, and led to disciplinary actions against a two-star U.S. general and 15 other military personnel.
The House of Representatives is considering a bill that would prevent the NSA from conducting warrantless searches through U.S. citizens' e-mail accounts.\n\nRepresentatives Tulsi Gabbard (D-HA) and Scott Perry (R-PA) have presented a bill which seeks to permanently codify protections on Americans' privacy. It has been introduced to the House to cement a policy change announced by the NSA in April, ending surveillance of e-mail based on keywords related to foreign targets of spying, unless they were specifically to or from concerned parties. This catch-all form of spying is known as about surveillance, and both Gabbard and Perry want to ensure it doesn't make a comeback.\n\nIn a statement, Gabbard asserted that the NSA has been defying the rights and liberties granted to us under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. She criticized the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — namely Section 702 — for bringing on a massive government-led exploitation of personal privacy. She says that the bill will keep our country from backtracking on this progress by permanently codifying this policy change and banning this privacy-invading collection from taking place again.\n\nPerry said that collection of electronic communications … that merely mention a foreign target of surveillance has been used as an end-around the Fourth Amendment, commending the NSA for finally aligning their collection efforts with the Constitution. It is an important win for the American people that their bill seeks to protect from the decisions of future administrations.\n\nThis bill is the first step in reforming Section 702, a change that Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel at the ACLU, advocated for in the wake of the April decision:\n\nThe announcement today underscores the need for Congress to significantly reform Section 702. While the NSA's policy change will curb some of the most egregious abuses under the statute, it is at best a partial fix. Congress should take steps to ensure such practices are never resurrected, and also end policies that permit broad, warrantless collection of Americans' communications.\n\nBoth Gabbard and Perry are veterans of the Iraq War. They are members of the Fourth Amendment Caucus, and co-chair the Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus. And while they have particular motivation to protect the freedom of Americans, this is a bill that addresses real and ongoing concerns with the state of U.S. citizens' privacy on both sides of the aisle.

Tuesday on CNN's Newsroom, political analyst for the network and veteran reporter Carl Bernstein questioned if President Donald Trump was fit to be the President of the United States.\n\nBernstein said, I think we need to identify the real national emergency in this country and that is the question of whether or not Donald Trump is fit to be the President of the United States.\n\nHe added, And increasingly, we are hearing from Republicans, Democrats, journalists, citizens, on the basis of real hard information why it may be that a consensus is developing that Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States, because of his actions in obstructing justice because of what we just saw in Syria, because of his ignorance on foreign policy, because of his putting his self-interest and that of his family ahead of the national interest, but above all the lying.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
TEL AVIV, Israel – The Syrian army's recent victories over the Islamic State will foster cooperation between Syria and the U.S., despite the latter's reticence, a Damascus official told Breitbart Jerusalem.\n\nForces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad succeeded in pushing IS out of the strategic town of Palmyra on Saturday, which may lead to more victories over IS in Deir al-Zour and Reqqa, the organization's stronghold.\n\nThe Information Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the interview was not officially sanctioned, said that since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the U.S. funded and trained forces opposed to the Assad regime. The primary beneficiary of this protracted war of attrition was IS, he said.\n\nBecause IS is a terrorist group, the Assad regime attributed more importance to Saudi and U.S.-backed opposition groups, which dragged Washington into the Syrian quagmire, from which it only now tries to be extracted, thanks to Russia.\n\nThe official claimed that the events of recent months have shown that the only bulwark against the spread of terror in Syria is the Assad regime, while the Saudi and U.S.-backed rebel organizations have maintained what he described as a love-hate relationship with IS and the al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front.\n\nThey never saw them as enemies or ideological adversaries, he said.\n\nThe dissent between the U.S.-backed groups and IS and Nusra Front … was about the distribution of resources. And the proof is that on the eve of last month's Geneva talks, Saudi Arabia, backed by America, demanded that the areas controlled by Nusra be included in the ceasefire agreement, which Syria and Russia dismissed out of hand. America was subsequently left with no choice but to declare Nusra, Riyadh's ally, a terrorist organization.\n\nThe only difference between the U.S.-backed organizations, which, the official claimed, include the Army of Islam, as well as IS and Nusra Front, is that the former are loyal to their backers. They are Salafi jihadist groups, whose vision for Syria is identical to IS and Nusra. They want to turn secular Syria into a Taliban-style Afghanistan.\n\nThe first indications of a sea change in American policy came against the recent gains made by Russian and Syrian forces in Palmyra, Homs, and other places, during which U.S.-backed opposition groups were forced to abide by the ceasefire, said the official. It is encouraging, but too little and too late. With American backing, the rebels ravaged Syria and exported their ideology to other places, including Turkey and Europe, where we've now seen the results.\n\nThe Americans now understand that they will have to cooperate with Russia and the Syrian regime, which they declined to do before, he added. They now realize that they have to be part of the war against terror, rather than aid and abet it, whether directly or indirectly.\n\nRussia's resolve was clearly what tipped the balance, he said.
Terrorists could potentially use fentanyl – a synthetic opioid mainly produced in China that is the primary source of the fatal overdose epidemic in the United States – as a weapon of mass destruction, Bloomberg News recently reported, citing experts and echoing other articles.\n\nOn December 31, the Omaha World-Herald ran the Bloomberg piece published earlier in the month, which noted:\n\nIt would take only 118 pounds of fentanyl to kill 25 million people. That's how much of the powerful opioid painkiller that Nebraska State Trooper Sam Mortensen found in April when he stopped a truck marked 'U.S. Mail' swerving onto the shoulder along Interstate 80.\n\nIn October, the White House honored Mortensen for making one of the largest fentanyl seizures in American history. Fentanyl has surfaced as the deadliest drug in the United States.\n\nThe drug is a significant threat to national security, Michael Morell, a former acting CIA director under former President Barack Obama, wrote in 2017. It is a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nIn recent years, some U.S. lawmakers have also suggested that bad actors could weaponize fentanyl.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), who along with a group of Republicans have proposed bolstering mandatory minimum sentencing for trafficking fentanyl, said in March 2018 that the synthetic opioid is as much a weapon of mass destruction as it is a drug.\n\nBloomberg reported:\n\nAs a tool of terror, the drug would work best in a closed space, said Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher at Rand Corp. who served as acting undersecretary in the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate in the Obama administration. Open-air release probably wouldn't be as effective, as the drug could become too diluted, he said. If ground-up fentanyl is placed on everyday objects, people could easily put their fingers in their mouths or rub their eyes and have a deadly reaction, Bloom said.\n\nFentanyl-based drugs have been used in conflicts in other countries, so we know it's possible, and we need to be ready to save lives and protect Americans from potential health security threats, Rick Bright, the director of the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) charged with developing medical countermeasures, told Bloomberg.\n\nReferring to Carfentanil, a deadly synthetic opioid drug believed to be a hundred times more toxic than fentanyl, Peter Ostrovsky, then- the assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, said in 2016, Could it be weaponized? Yeah, it could be weaponized.\n\nWe don't have any information that's indicating to us that [carfentanil] will be weaponized. But just let your imagination run wild and you can see that somebody could use it as a weapon, he added, according to Global News.\n\nReportedly, Russia has already weaponized fentanyl, noting the Kremlin used the drug against 50 armed rebels from the country's Muslim-majority Chechnya region who held more than 800 hostages in a crowded theater in Moscow.\n\nAfter a few days, Russian forces used a gas, reported by state news agency Interfax to be fentanyl, to incapacitate the attackers, though more than 100 hostages were also killed, Bloomberg pointed out.\n\nCiting an internal U.S. intelligence report, the Daily Beast reported in 2009 that the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan were using the country's bounty supply of heroin as a tactical weapon against American troops.\n\nRussian soldiers who served in Afghanistan in the 1980s returned to the motherland with an addiction rate than also approached 20 percent. This heroin bomb then does collateral damage back home. The returning soldiers brought home a heroin problem to Russian cities that grew exponentially during the past two decades, the Daily Beast noted.\n\nAuthorities have investigated some U.S. troops for possessing, using, or distributing heroin and other opiates.\n\nU.S. military troops have also fallen victim to fatal opiate overdoses while serving in Afghanistan. However, since the opioid problem reached historic proportions, the Pentagon has refused to release new figures among American forces in Afghanistan, prompting Judicial Watch to sue the government for access to the data beyond 2012.\n\nThe drug overdose epidemic in the United States intensified in recent years after the previous administration pulled tens of thousands of soldiers from Afghanistan when the U.S. declared its combat mission over at the end of 2014.\n\nAccording to the most recent Pentagon data on drug testing in the military, the number of U.S. service members testing positive for opioids, including heroin and prescription painkillers, significantly increased between 2006 and 2011.\n\nBecause of the significant threat from heroin in the Afghanistan theater of operations, all the military laboratories were instructed to perform 100 percent screening for heroin starting in FY 2005, the Pentagon acknowledged.\n\nSome U.S. officials have suggested there is a possible link between the skyrocketing heroin production in Afghanistan and the fatal drug overdose problem in the United States.\n\nA Politico investigation last year revealed that Afghan heroin has contributed to the growing drug overdose epidemic in the United States. However, DEA has reported that heroin primarily originates from Latin America and fentanyl is smuggled into the United States from China. DEA officials have conceded that Afghanistan is the top supplier of heroin in neighboring Canada, which borders many of the U.S. states impacted by the overdose epidemic.\n\nSoon after the 9/11 attacks on the American homeland, the New York Times (NYT) reported in October 2001, The terror network headed by Osama bin Laden has tried to develop a high-strength form of heroin that it planned to export to the United States and Western Europe, according to intelligence reports received by United States officials.\n\nU.S. authorities believe fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin. According to the American government, China, which borders the world's top producer of heroin Afghanistan, is the leading source of fentanyl in the United States.\n\nThe Taliban still generates the majority of its funding from trafficking opium, the main ingredient in heroin.\n\nFentanyl is often mixed with heroin to increase the potency of the drug and its value since the synthetic opioid tends to be cheaper to produce. However, there is no evidence that the Taliban is mixing the drug with fentanyl from across the border in China, U.S. officials told Breitbart News.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's National Security Strategy (NSS) deemed Latin American drug cartels who smuggle heroin and Chinese traffickers of the synthetic opioid fentanyl a top homeland security threat to the United States for killing tens of thousands of Americans each year.\n\nThe Trump administration has also declared a public health emergency over the number of fatal drug overdoses, which killed an unprecedented 72,287 people in the United States in 2017 – proving to be more lethal than terrorist attacks across the world that year, according to a Breitbart News analysis of U.S. government data.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioids alone, including heroin (15,950) and drugs like fentanyl and its offshoot carfentanil (29,418) killed more people (about 49,000) than terrorist attacks across the globe in 2017, which left 26,400 individuals dead.
Mainstream technology news outlet Wired has defended Twitter following Project Veritas' exposé on the company, which revealed how the platform censors users and sells their information.\n\nIn their article, Wired called Project Veritas' investigation, which confirmed years of Breitbart Tech reporting, a whole lot of nothing, and claimed the undercover videos didn't show anything revelatory.\n\nThe Project Veritas videos, filmed without apparent awareness or consent, show a range of selectively edited insights from inside Twitter, claimed Wired. Many of the employees filmed used sensational language, but they also thought they were talking candidly to strangers at a bar. It's not exactly unusual to embellish your job — and to elide its nuances — to a potential new friend or romantic interest. Apparently, Wired has chosen calling Twitter employees lonely nerds as the best defense available for the social media platform.\n\nAnd in any case, none of these gotcha moments amount to anything revelatory, they continued. These videos don't prove that Twitter has a partisan bias against its far-right conservative users. (Indeed, they're some of its most prolific users.) They do show, though, that the right-wing backlash against tech giants has reached a new height. With every new policy intended to curb abuse, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms invite rancor. The new rules have been necessary to fight an increasingly toxic atmosphere online. But Project Veritas sees those steps, and the ban of high-profile far-right users—over clear, apolitical terms of service violations—as an attempt not to improve discourse online, but to quash the free exchange of ideas.\n\nWired then criticized Breitbart News and Sean Hannity for covering the story, and Twitter for going on the defense, despite uncovering a whole lot of nothing. Wired seems more interested in attacking conservative media than it is in investigating the claims of Twitter's own employees that the company ignores user privacy in a desperate attempt to bolster advertising revenue.\n\nSince the release of Project Veritas' undercover videos, Breitbart Tech has called out mainstream technology news outlets twice for ignoring the story.\n\nProject Veritas secretly recorded several former and current Twitter employees while they discussed the company and its tactics.\n\nA direct messaging engineer at the company boasted to undercover reporters that everything you send is stored on my server, including private sex messages, and he also admitted to mass-banning accounts that express interest in God, guns, and America.\n\nOne former engineer claimed there is no way to protect private user information should it fall into the wrong hands, while a senior engineer called the company creepy Big Brother and said it disturbs him.\n\nOthers detailed the platform's shadow banning system, which is used to censor and sanction conservatives, while a senior network engineer claimed the company would be willing to give President Trump's private messages to the Department of Justice.\n\nTwitter responded to the investigation by attack Project Veritas for obtaining the footage, and denied shadow banning accounts, despite employees admitting to using the process.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of Jeane Kirkpatrick's Dictatorships and Double Standards, an essay that changed the world.\n\nCommentary magazine, which published all of its 9,800 words, calls it The Classic Essay That Shaped Reagan's Foreign Policy—and few would argue.\n\nIn 1981, Kirkpatrick was named by President Ronald Reagan to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and the rest is history. The decisions made by Reagan in the early 80s, with Kirkpatrick as a key adviser, led, just a few years later, to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Changed the world, indeed.\n\nAnd yet even with the Soviets gone, today, another empire, China, threatens us. Indeed, the Chinese, at the rate they're going, could prove to be more of a threat to us as than the Soviets at their worst.\n\nIn the meantime, now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on an eight-day trip to the Middle East, visiting our allies in the region, seeking to bolster regional strength against another rival, Iran. Some of those allies—most notably, Saudi Arabia and Egypt—are intensely controversial here at home, and so that's another reason why Kirkpatrick's wisdom is still so relevant, and important.\n\nSo just what was it in Kirkpatrick's article that made it, and her, so influential? And why is it worth remembering four decades later?\n\nIn her piece, Kirkpatrick focused on the foreign-policy failings of President Jimmy Carter, who had so badly mishandled the Cold War against the Soviets. The immediate issue, back then, was that the Carter administration was more critical of non-democratic allies than of actively anti-democratic enemies. Hence the double standard in Kirkpatrick's title; our non-democratic allies were scorned, while our anti-democratic enemies were sometimes even praised. Indeed, the Carterites seemed determined actually to depose pro-American autocratic regimes, thus paving the way for pro-Soviet totalitarian regimes.\n\nAs Kirkpatrick wrote, It is this belief which induces the Carter administration to participate actively in the toppling of non-Communist autocracies while remaining passive in the face of Communist expansion.\n\nKirkpatrick thus put her finger on a central and enduring aspect of liberalism: namely, the instinct to focus intensely on the small flaws of friends, while being blind to the larger flaws of foes. She derided this liberal impulse as a formula for self-abasement and apology. And we might add that this mindset never seems to change—hence, decades later, Barack Obama's notorious apology tours.\n\nAt its root, such thinking seems based on the idea that if a foreign government chooses to ally itself with the U.S., then that government can't be much good. Why not? Because, as liberals like to believe, the U.S. isn't so good, either. And this attitude, Kirkpatrick added, was a form of masochism.\n\nIndeed, when Kirkpatrick's article appeared, the Carter administration was meekly watching as a string of allied governments were being overthrown, including those of Somalia, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and Iran.\n\nIn each instance, we might add, the Soviets were active on the other side—sometimes in a big way, sometimes in a lesser way. And just a few years earlier, Moscow had helped to engineer communist victories in Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola, and Mozambique. This was the reality of the Cold War—the Russians were playing for keeps.\n\nYet in the midst of this cascade of geopolitical dominoes, the Carter administration—its diplomacy led by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, the pluperfect guilt-ridden liberal—was not only unconcerned but, sometimes, actually pleased. That's because the Carter administration, having come in preaching about human rights, was determined to hold friends to a far higher standard than enemies. As Kirkpatrick wrote of the administration, It actively collaborated in the replacement of moderate autocrats friendly to American interests with less friendly autocrats of extremist persuasion.\n\nAs Ronald Reagan often said during the Carter era, The most dangerous thing for a country is to be an ally of the U.S.\n\nKirkpatrick's point was that the U.S. had to be smart about its friends and its enemies. That is, we had to realize that an imperfect friend was a lot better than an implacable enemy. In a word, it's important to realistic, to deal with the world as it is. And it's also important to deal with the fact that not everyone in the world is going to live up to our standards of purity—and yet if they're friendly to us, well, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. As Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of state, Cordell Hull, reportedly once quipped about one pro-America dictator, He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.\n\nIndeed, the Roosevelt administration made some notably hard-nosed choices about working with sons-of-bitches—and worse. For instance, during World War Two, FDR made the wise decision to actively aid the Soviet Union in its fight against Nazi Germany. Roosevelt's logic was as simple as it was impeccable: The Soviets were bad, but the Nazis were much worse. After all, it was Hitler who declared war on the U.S.\n\nFDR's decision was intensely controversial at the time, and yet for the sake of American lives, it was absolutely necessary. The Red Army bore the brunt of the fighting in World War Two, and that was the fighting that spared our GIs. In fact, the Russians inflicted 75 percent of the casualties suffered by the Germans in the entire war.\n\nIn her 1979 essay, Kirkpatrick never claimed that human rights and democracy were unimportant; she simply argued that the American national interest was more important. Indeed, it's worth noting that in recent decades, some authoritarian allies of the U.S.—including South Korea, Taiwan, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—have evolved into functioning democracies, and those countries are stronger as a result. So yes, it's possible for our friends to improve and for the Free World to expand; it's just that the process must be handled with the utmost care.\n\nSo now to the present day. As we have seen, Secretary Pompeo is currently traveling the Middle East, seeking to rally our allies against Iran. As Pompeo declared in Cairo on January 10, in the showcasing policy speech of his Middle East trip, We ask every peace-loving nation of the Middle East to shoulder new responsibilities for defeating Islamist extremism wherever we find it. And in sharp contrast to the liberal apologetics of Obama and others, Pompeo added, The age of self-inflicted American shame is over.\n\nOf course, inevitably, Pompeo will be dealing with leaders, and with regimes, that don't meet the standards of our national ideals.\n\nFor instance, there's Saudi Arabia, which has admitted its culpability in the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist. Khashoggi's death was an outrage, but still, we must ask ourselves: Should the terrible fate of one person, who was not even a U.S. citizen, be used as a reason to overturn a seven-decade-long friendship with the Saudis?\n\nIndeed, we must also ask: If anything were to happen to the current government in Riyadh, who would take power? Al Qaeda? ISIS? Iran? Pompeo's answer is, in effect, that for the foreseeable future, we must stick with the current regime, and one would bet that Kirkpatrick, who died in 2006, would agree.\n\nAnd then there's Egypt. Its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is strongly pro-American; he's even friendly to Israel. And yet he is being roasted by the Main Stream Media for human rights violations. And liberal groups, too, are joining in the chorus.\n\nYet the question, always, is, Compared to what? That is, what's the plausible alternative to el-Sisi and his heavy-handed ways? It's worth recalling that el-Sisi, while no democrat, is a vast improvement over what came before—namely, the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, the Brotherhood was so scary that back in 2013, when el-Sisi seized power, even the Obama administration praised the move.\n\nIt's worth keeping in mind that el-Sisi's government must fight a low-grade war against murderous Islamist radicals; just on December 29, terrorists killed three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian tour guide. In response, the Egyptian military struck back, killing 40 alleged terrorists. The situation in Egypt certainly isn't pretty, but so long as his country is under siege, what else can el-Sisi do?\n\nIn the meantime, the Egyptian strongman is trying to make his country more inclusive to minorities; just on January 6, el-Sisi, himself a Muslim, joined in the inauguration of a new Coptic Christian church in Cairo, signaling to that beleaguered community that he has their back.\n\nSo yes, el-Sisi is a friend to the U.S., and, under the Trump administration, the U.S. is a friend to him. Again, it's a safe bet that Kirkpatrick, were she still with us, would agree that it's better to have him as a friend than someone else as an enemy.\n\nWe could go down the list of all the Arab countries that Pompeo is visiting and conclude that the regimes, noxious as they might be to human-rights purists, are a whole lot better than any possible successor. And all of them are, for sure, an improvement over the regime that the Iranians, if they could, would put in place.\n\nFinally, looming over all pro-American countries—and, in fact, over just about every country in the world—is the threat of China. China, of course, is a human rights-violator second to none: Even if we put its Maoist mass-murderous past aside, today, we see that it is defiantly anti-democratic; it routinely suppresses Christians, as well as Tibetans and other minorities and dissidents, including the Falun Gong. Indeed, it's reliably reported to have preemptively locked up as many as one million Muslims, without even the pretense of a legal trial.\n\nMeanwhile, beyond China's borders, the Belt and Road initiative of the People's Republic, while officially peaceful and cooperative, is, in fact, a key part of that country's bid for global dominion. It was Bloomberg News—not exactly a mouthpiece for hawks—that summed up China's goals in a stark headline late last year: Xi Jinping's Plan to Dominate the World. And oh yes: the Chinese are also busy hacking into America; there's a new report on China's cyber-espionage against the U.S. virtually every day.\n\nSo today, Pompeo and the Trump administration, operating as Kirkpatrick-type realists, believe that the U.S. has an affirmative duty to look out for itself. And that means, as a matter of strategic necessity, allying with other countries that also fear China's rise. We can worry about the nature of those governments later; the first priority is to make sure that we don't lose the greater geopolitical struggle.\n\nThat was Jeane Kirkpatrick's message in 1979, and it's a relevant message, still, in 2019. Of course, we can't hear from her directly anymore, but her wisdom is readily available. And that's good, because we need her clear thinking today as much as ever.
In a recent New York Times op-ed, two Google employees who recently formed the Alphabet Worker's Union outlined their reasons for doing so and their issues with the tech giant.\n\nIn a recent New York Times op-ed titled We Built Google. This Is Not the Company We Want to Work For, Google employees Parul Koul and Chewy Shaw explain why they joined the recently formed Alphabet Workers Union and the issues they've faced with the company in recent years.\n\nBreitbart News recently reported that more than 225 Google engineers and other workers have banded together to form a union, following years of growing activism at the tech giant.\n\nThe union is quite unusual in Silicon Valley which has largely resisted efforts to organize its workforce. For years Google employees have demanded policy overhauls on pay, harassment, and ethics, publishing multiple open letters to upper management over issues such as government contracts and allegations of sexual harassment at the company.\n\nThe new union is called the Alphabet Workers Union and was organized in secret for the better part of a year, electing its leadership last month. The group is linked to the Communication Workers of America, a union representing workers in telecommunications and media in the United States and Canada.\n\nKoul and Shaw were recently elected executive chair and vice chair of the union. Koul and Shaw stated in their op-ed:\n\nFor far too long, thousands of us at Google — and other subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google's parent company — have had our workplace concerns dismissed by executives. Our bosses have collaborated with repressive governments around the world. They have developed artificial intelligence technology for use by the Department of Defense and profited from ads by a hate group. They have failed to make the changes necessary to meaningfully address our retention issues with people of color. Most recently, Timnit Gebru, a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the few Black women in her field, said she was fired over her work to fight bias. Her offense? Conducting research that was critical of large-scale AI models and being critical of existing diversity and inclusion efforts. In response, thousands of our colleagues organized, demanding an explanation. Both of us have heard from colleagues — some new, some with over a decade at the company — who have decided that working at Alphabet is no longer a choice they can make in good conscience. Workers have mobilized against these abuses before. Organized workers at the company forced executives to drop Project Maven, the company's artificial-intelligence program with the Pentagon, and Project Dragonfly, its plan to launch a censored search engine in China. Some of Alphabet's subcontractors won a $15 minimum hourly wage, parental leave, and health insurance after an employee outcry. And the practice of forced arbitration for claims of sexual harassment was ended after the November 2018 walkout — albeit only for full-time employees, not contractors. A few months later, Google announced that it would end forced arbitration for employees for all claims.\n\nThe two added that for those that are skeptical of unions, Alphabet has continually cracked down on employees that speak out about the companies issues including antitrust and monopoly power and union protection would allow employees to speak more openly about these issues.\n\nRead the full op-ed at the New York Times here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave his thoughts on the pending immigration negotiations at Norfolk, Virginia's Slover Library Friday after the administration's framework took shape.\n\nSessions proclaimed that current immigration policies are not serving America's interests in his address after being introduced by First Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy McCormick of the Eastern District of Virginia. For a permanent fix … of our immigration laws, Congress needs to act, he said, moving to address the new framework, which has come under fire from immigration hawks in the congressional GOP.\n\n\n\nDespite concerns about the prospective deal – which includes amnesty and a path to citizenship for potentially millions of illegal aliens, just like previous amnesty pushes – Sessions heartily approved of the rationale behind the Trump administration's agenda behind the concessions they are demanding in exchange for amnesty: a merit based system to replace chain migration and visa lotteries and building a wall on the southern border. There is nothing wrong, nothing immoral to develop a policy of immigration we believe strengthens America and makes us a greater country, he told the audience.\n\nCiting illegal alien crime – especially the transnational gang violence plaguing Virginia – and national security concerns given the majority of terror arrestees being foreign born, Sessions laid out the case for ending chain migration and the diversity visa lottery as follows:\n\nThe American people have known for more than 30 years – the American people are right about this – that our immigration system is broken. It's intentionally designed to be blind to merit. It doesn't favor education or skills. It just favors anybody who has a relative in America — and not necessarily a close relative. That defies common sense. Employers don't roll dice when deciding who to hire. Our incredible military doesn't draw straws when deciding whom to accept. But for some reason, when we're admitting new Americans — the future of this country — our government uses a randomized lottery system and chain migration.\n\nThe attorney general cited the historical experience of fellow English-speaking countries Australia and Canada, both of which have long had well-developed, strict merit-based immigration criteria, in support of the proposition. He characterized these systems as based on their likelihood of assimilating, thriving in the country, and contributing to society as a whole.\n\nThere was no chance the people of Canada would want to go back to their old system, Sessions cited an architect of that country's merit-based immigration policy as having told him.\n\nTurning to enforcement to prevent further illegal immigration, Sessions trumpeted President Trump's signature campaign promise – the wall – which is included in the administration's framework. He said:\n\nThe President is determined to finally build a wall at the Southern border. This will make it harder – much harder – and more expensive for illegal aliens to break our laws and smuggle drugs or even human beings into this country. For many, it will become too costly, or too much trouble, and they will stay home.\n\n… Most importantly, the wall will send a message to the world that in the United States of America, we enforce the laws of this country.\n\nOur goal is not to see how many people we can arrest, Sessions continued. … But to end the illegality and restore in this country a legal system of immigration. We want people to apply and wait their turn. And if they're not selected, they are not entitled to come into the country illegally. It's just that simple.\n\nSessions also took the opportunity to continue his campaign against the policies of sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. These so-called 'sanctuary' policies force police to release criminal aliens back into the community — no matter what their crimes they may have committed in those jurisdictions, he said. And we're not going – and cannot – continue giving federal grants to cities that actively undermine the safety of federal law officers and intentionally frustrate our efforts to reduce crime in America.\n\nThat's why under President Trump's leadership, we've started to channel federal law enforcement funding to cities that do cooperate with immigration enforcement, Sessions added.\n\nThe attorney general touted his department's latest round of pressure application to these jurisdictions: a new set of information requests on their policies – backed up by an explicit threat of subpoena – looking to uncover evidence of violation of federal law.
TEL AVIV – Al-Qaeda's recent gains in Yemen attest to the failure of the Obama administration's Middle East policy, said an Arab intelligence official who spoke to Breitbart Jerusalem.\n\nThe official said he believes the radical Sunni organization's recent capture of the town of Ahwar shows that Washington's airborne surgical offensive against its leaders has failed to undermine the terrorist group's military infrastructure and degrade its will to fight.\n\nWashington decided to pressure Saudi Arabia to negotiate with the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, he said, after they realized that Al-Qaeda is gaining from the ongoing conflict between the Saudi-backed government and the rebels.\n\nOne year after Riyadh launched a military campaign against the Houthis, delegates from both sides met last week to discuss a scale-down of hostilities.\n\nThe official said that American intelligence failed to detect Al-Qaeda's rise as the belligerent parties engaged in a war of attrition.\n\nThe Americans weren't interested in the Yemeni war in the first place, but since they were so adamant to move ahead with the Iranian nuclear deal they lent their support to the Saudis to minimize Tehran's reach in the region, he said. That policy drove two opponents of Al-Qaeda against each other, which was exploited by the group to assassinate government officials and consolidate its foothold around the capital Aden, as well as key regions like Taaz, Hadramout, and others.\n\nHe added:\n\nThe war for Yemen's future is no longer between Saudi and Iranian loyalists, but between Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The United States must push for a Saudi-Houthi pact immediately, so they can collaborate to fend off the jihadists. The recent bombings in Ivory Coast, and IS's storming of areas in Libya, prove that Washington has yet to grasp the threat posed by IS and Al-Qaeda, or at least adopt a consistent strategy to fight them.\n\nOn Sunday, fighting in Yemen between IS and Al-Qaeda killed at least 22.\n\nThe AP reported on the clashes:
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) threatened hospitals in his state Monday with fines of up to $100,000 and cutting them off entirely from receiving any more doses if they do not distribute the allotted supply of coronavirus vaccines within a week of receiving it.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) reportedly announced a different approach Monday that appears to try to motivate hospitals to distribute doses of the vaccine for the Chinese coronavirus faster without the threat of fines, saying those that do not will lose their allotments to other medical centers.\n\nCuomo blamed hospitals for the slow vaccine rollout amid growing concerns that his administration's strict prioritization guidelines for who can get the vaccine could be slowing down the process, Fox News noted.\n\nCuomo, however, dismissed those concerns.\n\nThe hospitals are doing the administration, and that was purposeful, Cuomo told reporters. This is a management issue of the hospitals. They have to move the vaccine, and they have to move the vaccine faster.\n\nIn Albany holding a COVID briefing. Watch live: https://t.co/OG0KlkQrUQ — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) January 4, 2021\n\nAccording to the governor, a letter his administration sent to hospitals said:\n\nIf you don't use the allocation by the end of this week, the allocation you've received by the end of this week, you can be fined and you won't receive further allocations. We'll use other hospitals who can administer it better.\n\nThe apparent dual priority of vaccinating people fast and giving the shot only to people prioritized by the Cuomo administration triggered a question from John Campbell of Gannett who asked:\n\nOn the one hand, you're telling hospitals to use their allotment by the end of the week or face a fine. But on the other hand, you're telling them if they mess up the prioritization they could also face a fine. Are those competing principles there and is that in any way slowing down the vaccination process?\n\nGov. Cuomo retorted by lambasting the hospitals that have not administered their allotment.\n\nThe hospitals have been given the vaccines for expeditious administration, he said, pointing out that some of the state's hospitals have used almost all of the doses they have received.\n\nIf you have been given an allocation and you've only used a third of the allocation, then you shouldn't have the allocation. We have options, he also said.\n\nIf you can't do that within seven days, then just raise your hand and say, 'I can't do this.' Fine, we'll go to a different hospital, Cuomo added. We know what hospitals are better at administering it.\n\nFrom now on, hospitals will face fines of up to $100,000 if they do not use all their doses within a week of receiving them, Cuomo indicated.\n\nStatewide, [NY] hospitals so far have only administered approximately 46% of allotted doses, Daily News reported.\n\nCritics have warned the Cuomo administration's micromanagement of the vaccine process is likely slowing down the distribution process.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) warned New Yorkers on Monday to limit their social gatherings to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, stating that increased infections, resulting in lower hospital capacity, will trigger regions to close down. https://t.co/KLzrTQxlu4 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 4, 2021\n\nIt's chaos out there, Rensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin proclaimed, the New York Post reported. There state has no idea what it's doing.\n\nThe Cuomo handling of the vaccine is blithering incompetence, McLaughlin added.\n\nWhen asked about whether strict enforcement of prioritization was fueling delays, Cuomo did not directly address the question and instead defended his administration's decision on who to prioritize.\n\nOn December 28, Cuomo said recovering drug addicts would get vaccinated within days, reportedly before the elderly.\n\nIn the wake of criticism of the governor's order, Gary Holmes, a Cuomo administration spokesperson, has insisted that New York is still prioritizing nursing home residents to receive the vaccine.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, when New York was the U.S. epicenter, Cuomo issued a directive that some epidemiologists and nursing home advocates assert led to thousands of senior fatalities.\n\nDespite months of low deaths and infections earlier this year, New York continues to lead all other states in the number of coronavirus fatalities (38,549), data maintained by Worldometer showed Monday evening.\n\nThe slow vaccine rollout is not unique to New York.\n\nAs of Monday morning, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed the federal government had distributed over 15.4 doses. Still, only around 4.5 million people have received their first dose. Both of the vaccines approved in the U.S. require two doses.\n\nGov. DeSantis, who has prioritized the elderly ahead of many essential workers for getting the vaccine, announced a policy under which the state would provide doses to hospitals that dispense them out the fastest.\n\nHospitals that do not do a good job of getting the vaccine out will have their allocations transferred to hospitals that are doing a good job at getting the vaccine out, DeSantis declared at a briefing Monday.\n\nWe do not want the vaccine to just be idle at some hospital system, he added.\n\nThe governor did not mention anything about fines.\n\nHe indicated the Sunshine State would deploy an additional 1,000 nurses to inoculate people and keep state-run vaccination sites all week.\n\nThe CDC has provided guidelines for prioritizing people for getting inoculated, but ultimately it is up to the states to decide.
Planned Parenthood is dusting off an already debunked statistic to urge opposition to the Trump administration's proposed campus sex misconduct rule that emphasizes both the seriousness of sexual assault and due process for those accused of misconduct.\n\nStudents are raising their voices in opposition to this rule. They won't stand for this threat to their health, safety, and education, and they won't be fighting alone. Join the fight: https://t.co/VCzaE0fQOZ #HandsOffIX pic.twitter.com/Rq9HcgvVlK — Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) January 6, 2019\n\n1 in 5 women experience sexual assault or attempted assault while in college, Planned Parenthood tweeted Sunday. Students are raising their voices in opposition to this rule. They won't stand for this threat to their health, safety, and education, and they won't be fighting alone.\n\nHowever, the 1 in 5 statistic – spread widely by the Obama administration through its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – is wildly at odds with the official crime statistics, said American Enterprise Institute (AEI) resident scholar and former philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, in a fact-check video:\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the actual rate of sexual assault on college campuses is 6.1 per 1,000 students, or .03 in 5. The rate of rape and sexual assault for non-students is actually 1.2 times higher than for students – 7.6 per 1,000.\n\nWhere did the CDC find more than a million and nearly 14 million victims of sexual violence that professional criminologists somehow overlooked? Sommers asked in the video. It found them by using a poorly constructed telephone survey with a low response rate and a non-representative sample of respondents. No one interviewed was asked if they had been raped or sexually assaulted.\n\nArmed with the false 1 in 5 statistic, however, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement its policy.\n\nThe Obama administration also instructed colleges and universities to use the lesser preponderance of evidence standard to resolve allegations of sexual misconduct, rather than the higher clear and convincing evidence standard.\n\nTo promote its policy, the Obama-era education department engaged the media and allies such as Planned Parenthood with the statistic, and even the former president himself repeated it in his speeches.\n\nThe Obama policy delivered kangaroo courts on college campuses in which mostly male students were accused of sexual misconduct with little information about the allegations against them and no recourse to defend themselves.\n\nIn November, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced the proposed new rule and opened it to public comment.\n\nThroughout this process, my focus was, is, and always will be on ensuring that every student can learn in a safe and nurturing environment, DeVos said.\n\nShe added:\n\nThat starts with having clear policies and fair processes that every student can rely on. Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas. They are the very essence of how Americans understand justice to function.\n\nFor further information on how to urge the Trump administration to keep their #HandsOffIX (Title IX), abortion vendor Planned Parenthood links to a pro-survivor group known as End Rape on Campus.\n\nIf the proposed rule becomes law, survivors will lose access to their education and schools will continue to sweep sexual violence under the rug, End Rape on Campus insists. The new rule will stop survivors from coming forward and make schools more dangerous for all students.\n\nIn her announcement of the new rule, however, DeVos cited cases of students, nearly all male, who were either expelled or punished in some other manner after being accused of misconduct actions which were never proven.\n\nInstead of working with schools, DeVos said, the prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights.\n\nThe public comment period on the proposed rule ends January 28.
John Paul Mac Isaac, the computer technician whose services Hunter Biden procured for laptop repair and data recovery, told Breitbart News on Sunday that his business was destroyed by Twitter's framing of him as a hacker.\n\nMac Issac and his lawyer, Brian Della Rocca, discussed the status of a lawsuit they filed against Twitter seeking $500 million in damages during an interview with Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Sunday.\n\nMac Issac recalled how he came to be in possession of a laptop from Hunter Biden.\n\nOn April 12th, 2019, Hunter came into my shop with three liquid-damaged machines. One was a complete write-off. [For] the other one, I actually loaned him a keyboard because he just had inoperable keys, so he couldn't log in. … The third one was not a complete write-off. It needed some surgery done. and all he wanted was data recovery, so he contracted me to recover the data off of that third machine, which I did and called him the next day when the recovery was complete.\n\nI became concerned over some of the content I was viewing, added Mac Isaac. I became more concerned a couple weeks later when his father announced his candidacy for president, and as the summer progressed and the machine was abandoned, the gravity of the situation grew, because I started recognizing names and events and places that I had seen on the laptop.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nLast October, Twitter shut down links to the New York Post's story about the Biden family's business dealings in Ukraine, in part citing its policy regarding hacked materials. Given the New York Post's sourcing of Mac Isaac's discoveries on Hunter Biden's laptop for its reports, Twitter's censorship amounted to a framing of Mac Isaac as a hacker.\n\nWhat Twitter did went beyond censorship, Della Rocca stated. They decided to label what happened. They decided to say that 'This is dissemination of hacked materials. So we're not going to let you push it through. We're not going to let you spread this information.'\n\nDella Rocca continued, It was not hacked materials. John Paul accessed those materials when he legally owned them, because it was part of abandoned property. So they made a mistake there. The fact that they even decided to label it is a problem. It had direct harm. There's no way that you can say that something is hacked materials and not directly infer that the person who provided that information is a hacker.\n\nTwitter's de facto false characterization of Mac Isaac as a hacker destroyed the computer technician's business and professional reputation, Della Rocca held.\n\n[It] crushed John Paul's business, Della Rocca stated. It hurt his personal life. and I'm not going to get into everything that happened, but John Paul has been through a horrible situation when he was just trying to do the right thing, and Twitter really added to the harm that he has experienced.\n\nDella Rocca added, John Paul had to shut down his business. The day the story broke, the day Twitter refused to allow the story to be disseminated, [Mac Isaac] started getting bad Yelp reviews, calls to the shop, death threats, essentially people trying to destroy his business. That's essentially what happened. He had to close up the business. It's no longer active and he is now 46-years-old trying to figure out what the next thing to do is when you've been a Mac specialist for more than 25 years.\n\nPollak asked if any members of Congress has contacted Mac Isaac for information about Hunter Biden's laptop.\n\nWe haven't heard anything from anyone, replied Della Rocca. I would have thought that there might be a little bit of interest in … the Hunter Biden situation. We haven't heard a thing from anyone in Congress.
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — For Iranians whose icons since the Islamic Revolution have been stern-faced clergy, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani widely represented a figure of national resilience in the face of four decades of U.S. pressure.\n\nFor the U.S. and Israel, he was a shadowy figure in command of Iran's proxy forces, responsible for fighters in Syria backing President Bashar Assad and for the deaths of American troops in Iraq.\n\nSolemani survived the horror of Iran's long war in the 1980s with Iraq to take control of the Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force, responsible for the Islamic Republic's foreign campaigns.\n\nRelatively unknown in Iran until the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Soleimani's popularity and mystique grew out American officials calling for his killing. By the time it came a decade and a half later, Soleimani had become Iran's most recognizable battlefield commander, ignoring calls to enter politics but becoming as powerful, if not more, than its civilian leadership.\n\nThe warfront is mankind's lost paradise, Soleimani recounted in a 2009 interview. One type of paradise that is portrayed for mankind is streams, beautiful nymphs and greeneries. But there is another kind of paradise. … The warfront was the lost paradise of the human beings, indeed.\n\nA U.S. airstrike killed Soleimani, 62, and others as they traveled from Baghdad's international airport early Friday morning. The Pentagon said President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military to take decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing a man once referred to by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a living martyr of the revolution.\n\nSoleimani's luck ran out after being rumored dead several times in his life. Those incidents included a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of Assad. More recently, rumors circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria's Aleppo.\n\nIranian officials quickly vowed to take revenge amid months of tensions between Iran and the U.S. following Trump pulling out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. While Soleimani was the Guard's most prominent general, many others in its ranks have experience in waging the asymmetrical, proxy attacks for which Iran has become known.\n\nTrump through his gamble has dragged the U.S. into the most dangerous situation in the region, Hessameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on the social media app Telegram. Whoever put his foot beyond the red line should be ready to face its consequences.\n\nBorn March 11, 1957, Soleimani was said in his homeland to have grown up near the mountainous and the historic Iranian town of Rabor, famous for its forests, its apricot, walnut and peach harvests and its brave soldiers. The U.S. State Department has said he was born in the Iranian religious capital of Qom.\n\nLittle is known about his childhood, though Iranian accounts suggest Soleimani's father was a peasant who received a piece of land under the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, but later became encumbered by debts.\n\nBy the time he was 13, Soleimani began working in construction, later as an employee of the Kerman Water Organization. Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution swept the shah from power and Soleimani joined the Revolutionary Guard in its wake. He deployed to Iran's northwest with forces that put down Kurdish unrest following the revolution.\n\nSoon after, Iraq invaded Iran and began the two countries long, bloody eight-year war. The fighting killed more than 1 million people and saw Iran send waves of lightly armed troops into minefields and the fire of Iraqi forces, including teenage soldiers. Solemani's unit and others came under attack by Iraqi chemical weapons as well.\n\nAmid the carnage, Soleimani became known for his opposition to meaningless deaths on the battlefield, while still weeping at times with fervor when exhorting his men into combat, embracing each individually.\n\nAfter the Iraq-Iran war, Soleimani largely disappeared from public view for several years, something analysts attribute to his wartime disagreements with Hashemi Rafsanjani, who would serve as Iran's president from 1989 to 1997. But after Rafsanjani, Soleimani became head of the Quds force. He also grew so close to Khamenei that the Supreme Leader officiated the wedding of the general's daughter.\n\nAs chief of the Quds — or Jerusalem — Force, Solemani oversaw the Guard's foreign operations and soon would come to the attention of Americans following the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn secret U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, U.S. officials openly discussed Iraqi efforts to reach out to Soleimani to stop rocket attacks on the highly secured Green Zone in Baghdad in 2009. Another cable in 2007 outlines then-Iraqi President Jalal Talabani offering a U.S. official a message from Soleimani acknowledging having hundreds of agents in the country while pledging, I swear on the grave of (the late Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini I haven't authorized a bullet against the U.S.\n\nU.S. officials at the time dismissed Soleimani's claim as they saw Iran as both an arsonist and a fireman in Iraq, controlling some Shiite militias while simultaneously stirring dissent and launching attacks. U.S. forces would blame the Quds Force for an attack in Karbala that killed five American troops, as well as for training and supplying the bomb makers whose improvised explosive devices made IED — improvised explosive device — a dreaded acronym among soldiers.\n\nIn a 2010 speech, U.S. Gen. David Petreaus recounted a message from Soleimani he said explained the scope of Iranian's powers.\n\nHe said, 'Gen. Petreaus, you should know that I, Qassem Soleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan,' Petraeus said.\n\nThe U.S. and the United Nations put Soleimani on sanctions lists in 2007, though his travels continued. In 2011, U.S. officials also named him as a defendant in an outlandish Quds Force plot to allegedly hire a purported Mexican drug cartel assassin to kill a Saudi diplomat.\n\nBut his greatest notoriety would arise from the Syrian civil war and the rapid expansion of the Islamic State group. Iran, a major backer of Assad, sent Soleimani into Syria several times to lead attacks against IS and others opposing Assad's rule. While a U.S.-led coalition focused on airstrikes, several ground victories for Iraqi forces came with photographs emerging of Soleimani leading, never wearing a flak jacket.\n\nSoleimani has taught us that death is the beginning of life, not the end of life, one Iraqi militia commander said.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
French President Emanuel Macron threatened to ban travel from the United Kingdom if stricter measures were not enacted to contain the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn a phone call with Boris Johnson on Friday, Macron reportedly informed the British prime minister that should the UK continue with its lax policy on coronavirus, France would be forced to shut off travel from the UK.\n\nWe clearly had to threaten him so that he would finally move, a government official told the French newspaper Libération.\n\nConfirming the veracity of the report, a senior French official told Politico: We had prepared the closure of our border and told Prime Minister Johnson we would implement it that day if there was no evolution [of British measures].\n\nFollowing the phone call between the two leaders, Boris Johnson ordered pubs, restaurants, nightclubs, cinemas, and other public venues to close. The British government has claimed that the phone call with Macron did not influence the decision to enact stricter measures to fight the virus.\n\nAs the PM said on Friday these new measures were taken based on scientific advice and following the government's action plan set out two weeks ago, a government official said.\n\nUK Govt Escalated Coronavirus Response on Back of Academic's 250,000 Deaths Warning https://t.co/JbPbuRWw1x — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 17, 2020\n\nLast week, the prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, said that the UK was not adopting strong enough measures to contain the spread of the virus and warned that a travel ban would be enacted if the situation in the UK did not change.\n\nIt goes without saying that if neighbouring states such as the United Kingdom spend too long continuing to avoid these containment measures, then we would have difficulty accepting British nationals who would move freely in their own country and then come to our country, Philippe said.\n\nFrance has enacted some of the strictest lockdown measures in Europe, barring people from leaving their homes for fifteen days.

DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — The Latest on the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland (all times local):\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will raise concerns over Britain's potential use of Huawei technology in next-generation ultrafast mobile networks when he visits London to meet his counterpart this weekend.\n\nThe British government, which is expected to make a final decision next week on the Chinese tech company's future role, has indicated it may not entirely shun the company, in contrast to the U.S., which has voiced cyberespionage fears.\n\nMnuchin said Thursday at the World Economic Forum that he will discuss the issue, alongside other matters such as trade, when he meets Britain's Treasury chief Sajid Javid in London over the weekend.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this month that he doesn't want to prejudice intelligence cooperation with the U.S. but also that the British public deserves the best possible technology. He said critics should suggest alternatives to Huawei, whose few rivals include Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia.\n\n___\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nTurkey's foreign minister has reiterated a proposal to establish a NATO-lead committee to review possible threats to the alliance from Turkey's purchase of a Russian-made missile defense system.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he believes the S-400 missiles don't pose a threat to NATO, of which Turkey is a member.\n\nLet the experts assess this, Cavusoglu said.\n\nThe United States and other NATO members say the Russian system threatens NATO and the U.S.-led F-35 stealth jet program. Washington has removed Turkey from the F-35 program and U.S. lawmakers have called for sanctions over the Turkish government's decision to proceed with the purchase and deployment of the Russian technology.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the panel the alliance has so far not been able to reach an agreement on Turkey's committee proposal.\n\nStoltenberg said: We will try to do whatever we can to find a way to solve this issue because it's one of the issues that has created problems inside the alliance. There's no way to deny that.\n\n___\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nUkraine's prime minister says he is not planning to go anywhere, trying to tamp down rumors that he or his government might soon resign.\n\nPrime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk was initially evasive about whether he would step down during a question and answer session during a breakfast event Thursday about Ukraine on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.\n\nLast week, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy rejected Honcharuk's offer to resign after the prime minister was caught on tape saying Zelenskiy — a former sitcom star with no previous political experience — knows nothing about the economy.\n\nI am not planning to go anywhere. We have wonderful relations inside the team with the president, he told a packed Davos hotel ballroom.\n\nHoncharuk had initially dodged a question about whether he would resign, speaking only more broadly about his government's plans.\n\nI don't want to disseminate the rumors: The government is not leaving, the government is planning to continue working, we're not planning any resignations, he said. There are so many provocations, manipulations around the government.\n\nHoncharuk only admitted he had no plans to leave after being pressed by the panel moderator, Fareed Zakaria of CNN.\n\n___\n\n10:50 a.m.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is in no position to give economic advice until she's gone to college and come out with an economics degree.\n\nAt a press briefing at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss town of Davos, Mnuchin took a swipe at the 17-year-old environmental campaigner for her recommendation that both the public and private sectors should divest from fossil fuels.\n\nWhen asked how that would affect the U.S. economic model, Mnuchin took a swipe at Thunberg.\n\nIs she the chief economist? Who is she? I'm confused, he said. Then following a brief pause, he said it was a joke.\n\nAfter she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us, he concluded.\n\nOver the past year, Thunberg has taken issue with many aspects of U.S. policy, not least President Donald Trump's decision to pull the country out of the Paris accord to limit global warming.\n\nMnuchin insisted that U.S. policy has been misinterpreted, and that Trump absolutely believes in a clean environment.\n\nThe U.S., Mnuchin said, has been a leader in reducing carbon emissions. What the president objects to is the Paris agreement, because he thought it was an unfair agreement for the United States.\n\n___\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nThe U.S. is talking up the prospects of tying up a trade deal with Britain this year and thinks it should be pretty straightforward to accomplish given how similar the two economies are.\n\nAt a press briefing at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to discuss an array of issues with his counterpart Sajid Javid, most notably with regard to a trade deal.\n\nMnuchin said it's an absolute priority for President Donald Trump and that he expects to complete it within this year.
Japan expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump's decision this week to cancel the planned summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, pledging that Tokyo intends to keep up pressure on the rogue regime over its nuclear and missiles programs.\n\nOn Friday, Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono expressed understanding of the U.S. decision to cancel the meeting, saying, It is meaningless to hold a summit if it does not bring about progress, according to Kyodo News.\n\nHe noted that Japan would continue to push for North Korea's denuclearization and solve the abduction [of Japanese citizens] issues, Japan will closely work with the United States.\n\nKyodo News reports:\n\nWhile the cancellation of what would have been the first-ever summit between the two countries is regrettable, [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo] Abe told reporters in St. Petersburg that he respects Trump's decision not to hold the meeting until progress on North Korea's denuclearization and missile issues can be expected.\n\nThe prime minister made those comments while visiting Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nEchoing the Trump administration, a top spokesman for the Japanese government vowed that Tokyo would maintain pressure on North Korea, which has proved to threaten the island nation directly.\n\nJapan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters:\n\nThe important thing is not holding a meeting itself but becoming an opportunity to move toward the solution of the nuclear and missile issues as well as the abduction [of Japanese citizens] issue. Japan, the United States, and South Korea will continue to put pressure on North Korea to change its policy.\n\nSuga noted that Japan would remain vigilant and closely monitor the situation, Kyodo News reported.\n\nDuring a U.S. Senate panel hearing on Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that the Trump administration plans to keep up pressure on North Korea until it takes credible steps towards complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization.\n\nJapan's Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told reporters on Friday, Japan will closely collaborate with the United States and South Korea to push North Korea to take concrete actions toward the complete abandonment of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.\n\nCiting Kim's tremendous anger and open hostility in a letter to the dictator on Thursday, President Trump canceled the June 12 summit, which was expected to focus on the denuclearization of North Korea in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nThe White House and Pompeo have also noted that, while the United States was ready for the meeting, North Korea failed to make adequate preparations for the unprecedented event.\n\nTrump's decision to cancel the meeting came a day after Pompeo told lawmakers the administration was prepared to walk away from anything short of denuclearization.\n\nPompeo's warning came soon after North Korea threatened to cancel the meeting over military drills held by the United States and South Korea.\n\nThe Secretary of State noted Thursday and he and President Trump are optimistic a deal with North Korea remains possible.\n\nThe North Korean regime, in response to the cancellation, said it is still willing to resolve issues with the United States whenever.
Online payment processing service Stripe has reportedly cut all ties with President Trump's campaign and shut down the campaign's payment processing services. This prevents the Trump campaign from accepting donations by credit card.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the payment processing service Stripe will no longer process payments for President Trump's campaign website following last week's events at the Capitol. The financial-tech company handles credit card payments for millions of online business and e-commerce platforms. President Trump's campaign used the service for processing donations to the campaign. Stripe is a private company valued at $36 billion founded by brothers Patrick and John Collison, who remain citizens of Ireland.\n\nStripe alleges that President Trump violated the company's policies against encouraging violence, following his reaction events at Capitol Hill. Stripe asks that users agree that they won't accept payments for high risk activities which include any business or group that engages in, encourages, promotes or celebrates unlawful violence or physical harm to persons or property.\n\nIn 2018 the company shut down the account of social media Gab after the corporate media reported that a gunman who killed 11 people in an attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue had posted anti-Semitic content to the platform.\n\nA number of tech sites and services have banned President Trump in the wake of the Capitol Hill protests. Breitbart News recently reported that the e-commerce platform Shopify banned TrumpStore.com, a website run by the Trump campaign and Trump Organization. The removal appears to be in response to the events in Washington D.C. this week.\n\nShopify said in a statement: Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence. Based on recent events, we have determined that the actions by President Donald J. Trump violate our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibits promotion or support of organizations, platforms or people that threaten or condone violence to further a cause. As a result, we have terminated stores affiliated with President Trump.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated in a recent post that following the events on Capitol Hill yesterday and President Trump's comments on social media about the situation, Facebook would be banning the President's access to the platform indefinitely.\n\nBreitbart News reported today that police are bracing themselves for a possible protest at Twitter HQ following the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account last week. A San Francisco Police Department spokesman stated that the department is aware of a possible demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in favor of President Donald Trump's order barring entry to legal immigrants until they fund their own health insurance and avoid becoming a public charge' for taxpayers.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle put the number of migrants who would not be admissible at an estimated 375,000 every year — or about one million every 2.5 years.\n\nThe Chronicle claimed migrants have a right to enter American's homeland even if they need Americans to pay for their healthcare, and suggested that President-elect Joe Biden would probably reverse Trump's move:\n\nThursday's court ruling involved his October 2019 proclamation denying visas to immigrants who did not have health insurance and could not show that they would obtain it within 30 days of entering the country. Immigrants could receive Medicare and be allowed to remain, but those who planned to obtain coverage under the low-income Medicaid program or the government-subsidized Affordable Care Act would not be eligible. Advocates for immigrants say Trump's proclamation would bar entry to nearly two-thirds of all otherwise legal migrants, those who obtain their entry visas from employers, U.S. relatives or an annual lottery. The ruling by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, if it becomes final, would allow Trump's order to take effect for the first time. But attorney Esther Sung of the Justice Action Center, one of the legal organizations challenging the policy, said that under the court's standard timetable, the ruling will not be binding for 52 days. That would be well past President-elect Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden has promised to undo his predecessor's anti-immigration policies as soon as possible. A federal judge in Portland blocked Trump's proclamation from taking effect in December 2019, saying it exceeded the president's legal authority. Panels of the appeals court twice denied emergency orders that would have let Trump enforce the ban during the court proceedings. But a different panel of the court ruled 2-1 Thursday that the president's broad powers over immigration include the authority to limit entry only to those who can afford health insurance. The majority said the U.S. Supreme Court recognized those powers in 2018 when it upheld Trump's ban on travel to the U.S. from a number of predominantly Muslim nations.\n\nThe ruling makes clear that the Biden administration must move swiftly to rescind all of President Trump's xenophobic presidential proclamations, including this health care ban, Sung said in the Chronicle report. Countless people have been hurt by this ban, and each passing day keeps families needlessly separated.\n\nJudge Daniel Collins said in the majority opinion that the law grants the president sweeping authority to decide whether to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, and for how long and would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\n\nCollins said Trump can put in place restrictions beyond those enacted by Congress as long as the rules do not conflict with federal laws.\n\nAnd the cost of this migrant demographic is staggering.\n\nThe appeals court said the Trump administration had presented evidence that legal immigrants are only one-third as likely as U.S. citizens to have health insurance, and that uninsured residents cost taxpayers and health care providers more than $35 billion a year, the Chronicle reported.\n\nOpen border advocates side with migrants on the issue.\n\nAwful. This decision, overturning the motions panel and letting the healthcare ban go into effect, will have a ripple effect on all the litigation out of the 9th Circuit that has blocked his COVID-19-related bans—which relied on that initial precedent. https://t.co/y8sCgmSSad — Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@ReichlinMelnick) December 31, 2020\n\nIn dissent, Judge A. Wallace Tashima said Trump's order conflicts with immigration policies and laws passed by Congress, including the Affordable Care Act, which made legal immigrants eligible for the same subsidized coverage as U.S. citizens.\n\nTashima said the restriction violates part of the Violence Against Women Act that protects victims of violent sex crimes from being deported.\n\nThe president's proclamation was a major overhaul of this nation's immigration laws without the input of Congress — a sweeping and unprecedented exercise of unilateral executive power, Tashima said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
President Donald Trump has widened his so-called 'travel ban' to pressure foreign governments to tighten up their security checks on airline travelers.\n\nActing secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf said:\n\nThese countries — for the most part — want to be helpful, want to do the right thing, [to] have relationships with the U.S. and are in some cases improving relations, but for a variety of different reasons failed to meet those minimum requirements that we laid out. The only way to mitigate the risk is to impose these travel restrictions.\n\nThe security policy denies most travel and immigration visas to the targeted countries until they can upgrade their often chaotic and ramshackle domestic security and identification policies. U.S. officials want to be able to reliably identify and screen foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States.\n\nWe wanted to make sure that these six countries … mitigate the risk, he told reporters on Friday. We want to send a signal that we're very serious about this but not cripple all of their various visas, so there's a number of visas they're still able to use.\n\nOfficials have added Nigeria, Burma, Kyrgyzstan, Eritrea, Tanzania, and Sudan to the list of non-cooperative travel ban countries.\n\nIn 2018, officials included the first set of chaotic or totalitarian countries — Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Venezuela — after Trump's pro-migration opponents lost a lawsuit at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nPeople in Sudan and Tanzania are also being largely barred from the diversity lottery visa program until their governments tighten identification procedures. Each year, Congress awards 50,000 green cards to countries that have sent lower numbers of migrants to the United States. Trump has repeatedly called for the diversity visa program to be canceled.\n\nPro-migration advocates described the first set of security measures as a Muslim Ban and are now trying to label the updated list as an African Ban.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Joe Neguse, D.-Colo., for example, cited a poem associated with the Statue of Liberty to portray Trump's security upgrade as reckless, cruel and wrong.\n\nGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses As a son of Eritrean refugees, those words mean everything. The President's travel ban on Eritrea & other African countries is reckless, cruel and wrong. Congress must oppose it. And we will. https://t.co/e7Ws3Ga5rX — Joe Neguse (@JoeNeguse) January 31, 2020\n\nAdvocacy groups formed by African immigrants also complained about Trump's security policies:\n\n.@AmahaKassa, @AfricansUS: The WH has gone after African communities by going after the diversity visa, stripping immigrants of TPS, escalating enforcement in our communities. This ban is a continuation of their ongoing xenophobia. — America's Voice (@AmericasVoice) January 31, 2020\n\nOne Islamic-themed advocacy group, Muslim Advocates, said the updated list expands the so-called Muslim Ban:\n\nThe Muslim Ban expansion is about one thing: weaponizing anti-Muslim bigotry for political gain. Like the administration's earlier Muslim bans, this expanded ban overwhelmingly targets Muslims and forces tens of thousands Americans to sacrifice their families, their health and their educational and professional opportunities. In fact, over a million Americans were born in Muslim Ban countries and could be affected. It is clear that the president's goal, as always, is to target Muslims, immigrants, black and African countries and other people or color.\n\nIn September 2001, 19 self-proclaimed orthodox Muslims exploited lax security rules to hijack four American aircraft to target and murder 3,000 Americans in New York, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania.
Former U.N. ambassador John Bolton took stock of President Trump's foreign policy on Thursday's Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.\n\nThe president, during the campaign, always talked about an America First foreign policy. What he said expressly he meant by that was that American national interests have to dominate what a president does – not abstract ideas about the way the world order should look, but concentrating on threats to America and dealing with them, Bolton recalled.\n\nIn the case of Syria, as we've discussed before, I think a lot of people were worried that the retaliation for the chemical weapons attack was just the first step toward a much greater involvement in the Syrian conflict. Those who wanted that said there was a change of policy, and they liked it. Those who opposed it said there was a change in policy and they didn't like it, he said.\n\nBut, in fact, I don't really think there was a change in policy, Bolton continued. I think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons, just as we would respond if it were nuclear weapons or biological weapons. It's a threat to American national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction. So Trump's response – which so far, at least, has been confined to the one strike at the Syrian airbase, although obviously, it took place in Syria – was not a shift in policy on the civil war.\n\nThen when you look at Korea – look, this is one of the consequences of eight years of Obama's failed foreign policy. He pursued what he called 'strategic patience' vis-a-vis the North Korean nuclear program, which was nothing more than a synonym for doing nothing at all. The consequences are right before us: the North Koreans are now very close to being able to drop a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead on a U.S. target, he said.\n\nI think Trump's response was entirely appropriate, he argued. I think where he has not stepped up to the plate yet, at least his administration hasn't, is the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Despite his very strong view during the campaign that the Obama nuclear deal was a debacle, just yesterday Secretary of State Tillerson signed a letter to Speaker Ryan, in compliance with the congressional reporting requirement, saying Iran was in compliance with the deal.\n\nBolton said this assessment of Iranian compliance was just patently false.\n\nNow, they say the NSC is reviewing it. They're looking at further sanctions because of Iran's terrorist activity, but there's plenty of evidence out there already publicly that Iran is violating the deal, he contended. It's not just a problem, as Tillerson said later in the day, that ultimately, the deal just delays Iran's nuclear weapon; it doesn't prevent it. It doesn't delay it, either, if they're violating it, which I think they're doing.\n\nMarlow highlighted Bolton's recent New York Post editorial calling for the Trump administration to name and sanction Iranian terrorists and terror-supporting institutions.\n\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, as its name implies, is the military wing of the Iranian theocracy, to guard the 1979 Islamic revolution there, Bolton explained. It reports directly to the supreme leader. Forget President Rouhani or the election coming up later this spring; the real ruler in Iran has always been the supreme leader, since the '79 revolution.\n\nThe IRGC, as it's called, is really the principal means by which the ayatollahs are trying to get a hegemony in the Middle East, through a variety of mechanisms. The Quds Force, which is really the tip of the spear, they were responsible in an earlier incarnation for the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon going back to 1983. They've been killing Americans for a long time, he said.\n\nThe nuclear weapons program in Iran and the ballistic missile programs are under the control of the IRGC, he said. If we name them as a foreign terrorist organization, all kinds of statutory sanctions kick in. I think it will have a dramatic impact on the Iranian regime. Opponents of naming the IRGC as a terrorist organization include many in the administration who don't want to admit Iran is violating the nuclear weapons deal and who are afraid that if we name the IRGC, that Iran will pull out of the deal.\n\nWhat a shame if that were to happen! Bolton added sarcastically.\n\nThe point is, Iran's behavior has not changed at all, despite what the Obama administration said all through the negotiations: if we can just solve this nuclear program, they'll start behaving like a civilized nation. The ayatollahs have made a joke of that contention for the past now going on two years, since the deal was signed in 2015, he said.\n\nI think there's still hope for the Trump administration on this. Their utterly inexplicable finding that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal – I mean, that's kind of an embarrassment. Fred Fleitz, a former colleague of mine, has an excellent article up on the Fox News opinion website on what's wrong with that finding. I urge people to take a look at that. This has got to be stopped. Otherwise, I think it will risk embarrassing the Trump administration, given the president's very strong stand against this deal in the campaign, Bolton advised.\n\nHe said it was not surprising that the first mandated 90-day status report on the Iran nuclear deal from the Trump State Department would falsely declare compliance because the State Department is almost genetically incapable of saying foreign governments actually violate their treaties.\n\nI had this experience in arms control deals when I was in the Bush 43 State Department, Bolton recalled. I understand what Tillerson's putting up with, but you've got to stand against this because just the inertia of the people who negotiated the deal, the people who supported it, are very reluctant to admit they were wrong and that Iran, in fact, is violating it because it's a way of undercutting all of their efforts.\n\nThat's what political appointees and presidential appointees are designed to do, to pierce through that bureaucratic inertia and get to the truth that the Iranians are violating it on the ballistic missile side, they've violated it on the heavy water side, they've violated it on the enriched uranium limits – and that's just what's been reported publicly, he noted.\n\nWhat do we know, in fact, about Iranian cooperation with North Korea? Bolton asked. How much of the Iranian program is really being conducted in North Korea, where our intelligence is, unfortunately, even worse than it is inside Iran? There are a lot of questions here.\n\nI think it was a mistake to certify compliance, but as I say, it's exactly what the State Department did in the early Bush administration with the agreed framework with North Korea. Despite mounting evidence of North Korean violations, they kept wanting to certify that North Korea was in compliance. Eventually, we broke that. This game isn't over yet, but that first certification was a disappointment, he said.\n\nTurning to North Korea, Bolton said the communist nation's latest threats to unleash a super-mighty preemptive strike on the United States were standard rhetoric.\n\nWithin the next few days, you can expect them to say they'll unleash a 'sea of fire' across the Korean Peninsula, he predicted. They've got a whole handbook of these phrases that they use. This is how they talk before – at least we think before – they have the capability to launch ICBMs that can hit the United States.\n\nOur troops in South Korea are vulnerable. They've got thousands of tons of chemical weapons. South Korean civilians are vulnerable. That's why my view has long been that really the only solution to the nuclear problem in North Korea, and, in fact, the North Korean problem generally, is to reunify the peninsula. As long as this regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually come to fruition, with horrible consequences, he warned.\n\nThis regime is not going to change its behavior, he stressed. It has three times in the past 25 years made unequivocal statements it would give up its nuclear weapons program. It has violated them every time, usually before the ink was dry. That's the pattern Iran is watching. They see this: there are no consequences really for North Korea. Even in the Bush administration, the administration lifted sanctions against North Korea that now we're looking at reimposing. If this is the way North Korea behaves before they can hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, imagine how they're going to behave once they're able to.\n\nBolton looked at the presidential race in France, judging it very close, with several non-conventional candidates, to say the least, possibly making the two-person runoff.\n\nI would guess, in a year or period when political opinion polling has not been exactly accurate, it's going to be very hard to say with any certainty who comes out in the top two spots this coming Sunday. But it's possible Marine Le Pen would be one, as you correctly say, and the other would be a candidate of the extreme left actually backed by the French Communist Party. Melenchon is his name, he told Marlow.\n\nSo you could have a runoff between these two candidates, neither of whom obviously represents one of the major standing French political parties of the center-right or the center-left. I think that is the kind of scenario – a proto-Communist, basically, versus Marine Le Pen – where she could win. In any event, no matter who the last two are, I think that things are so volatile in France and across the European Union that while I still think it's unlikely Le Pen would win in the final round, I don't think you can discount that yet, said Bolton.\n\nJohn Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delivered a message to former Trump administration officials walking away from President Donald Trump, during a meeting with top Republican lawmakers and senior congressional staffers on Friday evening, Breitbart News learned exclusively.\n\nI am proud of what we've accomplished — not just in the national security, foreign policy space, which I've worked with, but the things that we've done with families, the pro-life work that we have done. These are things that will truly be historic. I think history will remember us very well for these things when the books are written, he said in remarks.\n\nPompeo's remarks were made at the end of a private day-long meeting by the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus within the House chaired by Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN). Lawmakers and aides discussed the conservative moment and where it goes next.\n\nPompeo's message was a stark contrast to that from Trump's former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who told Republican National Committee members during a closed door speech on Thursday that Trump will be judged harshly by history.\n\nIt was also a stark contrast to two Trump cabinet secretaries who have resigned in recent days — Betsy DeVos and Elaine Chao — after thousands of the president's supporters protested at the Capitol and some entered and engaged in violence or vandalism.\n\nPompeo said what happened was tragic but that those walking away from the president were not listening to the American people.\n\nWhile I think we all think the violence that took place in the place where you all work in the Capitol was tragic, I've watched people walk away from this president already. And they are not listening to the American people. Not remotely, he said.\n\nPompeo also discussed the administration's foreign policy successes, and contrasted it with eight years under the Obama administration.\n\nWe watched eight years of the foreign policy of the previous administration that was fantasy. Fantasy. They would enter into agreements and arrangements that weren't based on anything with the potential to be lasting, and if America First in foreign policy means anything, it means being realistic. He added:\n\nIt means this deep recognition that our sole responsibility is to protect the American people. When we do that, I am very confident we will increase security for people all around the world, we will raise others up as well. But our mission set, everyday, is to say, 'How do we make sure that everything we do secures freedom for America?' and it's gotten us to walk away from a whole bunch of things. We've walked away from the World Health Organization. We walked away from the UN Human Rights Commission. We walked away from some of the central understandings of the World Trade Organization. Each of these things was detrimental to the American people, their prosperity, their security. We were right to do that. It's a sensibility that I think 75 million people still understand and understood in November of this year. They haven't stopped understanding, I promise you that.\n\nHe said on the threat from China, We not only got it right, and frankly, I think there is some bipartisan basis, I hope, that we can continue to get this right.\n\nPompeo also noted that despite the Trump administration being criticized for hurting alliances around the world, it worked successfully to build an enormous coalition with the Indians, Australians, Japanese, the South Koreans, in some parts of Europe, to counter China. He touted that 120 international telecommunications companies that have forsworn any Chinese technology in their system.\n\nIn the Middle East, Pompeo said the Trump administration worked to realistically meet the challenges there.\n\nHe said while it would have been delightful to solve the problem between Israel and the Palestinians it was not likely to happen and they ought not wait to deal with other countries in the region to get them to accept Israel as a nation they wanted to be a party with, and not throw Molotov cocktails at.\n\nHe added that they also acknowledged facts on the ground in Israel, such as moving to recognize Israeli settlements in Golan Heights and Jerusalem as Israel's capital. President Trump did it, and he did this in the face of enormous stated risk, he said.\n\nIn the Western hemisphere, he said, We did really good work.\n\nI spent more time on Western hemisphere issues than any secretary of state in about 60 years. So whether it was the work we did with our Brazilian friends, the effort we made to oust Maduro — which have not yet been successful, the policy we chose with respect to the regime in Cuba, each of these made America safer, he said.\n\nHe also touted the relationship the U.S. built with Mexico. We ultimately got the Mexicans to do really good work to acknowledge it was reasonable for them to secure their own border in a way that protected the United States from illegal immigration as well.\n\nPompeo's remarks also come as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has been trying to pressure Vice President Mike Pence and cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from the presidency.\n\nAmid reports that some of Trump's cabinet members were discussing doing so, Pompeo tweeted out a photo of himself, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, and White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien in a sign that he was not abandoning the president under Democratic pressure.\n\nHonored to work alongside @DNI_Ratcliffe and @WHNSC Robert O'Brien.

WASHINGTON (AP) — With a single drone strike, President Donald Trump did more than just take out an avowed enemy of the United States. He may have have also upended a central element of his foreign policy.\n\nThe Friday strike that killed the most prominent Iranian general may have ended any chance that he would get the United States out of the endless wars in the Middle East that he has railed against since taking office.\n\nThe killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad has the world bracing for a possible retaliation, with many fearing it could lead to a wider conflict.\n\nIt is probably the most profound escalation that the United States could have taken, said Ned Price, who served on the National Security Council under President Barack Obama.\n\nTrump has been on a confrontational path with Iran since even before he took office, when he pledged to end the Iran nuclear deal signed by Obama. He insisted he doesn't want war and the killing of Soleimani wasn't meant to provoke the Islamic Republic.\n\nWe took action last night to stop a war, Trump sad. We did not take action to start a war.\n\nNonetheless, the targeting of Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, was arguably the most provocative military action in the Middle East since President George W. Bush launched the 2003 Iraq war to topple Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe killing of Soleimani, regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran, came as Trump has sought to apply increased pressure on Iran through economic sanctions to abandon its nuclear weapons program, while Iran has countered with provocative attacks on U.S. military and oil facilities in region.\n\nBy taking out Soleimani, Trump signaled to Iran that his patience has worn thin over the long, simmering conflagration.\n\nThe shadowy general who was in command of Iran's proxy forces was responsible, according to the Pentagon, for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq during the height of the war there. White House officials said Trump decided to take action because Soleimani was plotting unspecified future attacks targeting Americans as tensions between the U.S. and Iran have reached a boil.\n\nTrump said Friday he wasn't interested in further escalating the conflict, but warned the regime that his military advisers have already drawn up plans to retaliate should Iran attack.\n\nIf Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary, and that in particular refers to Iran, Trump said.\n\nTrump's aggressive approach with Iran is remarkable considering his oft-repeated desire to avoid expensive military entanglements. His aversion to long-term military presence has led to him butting heads with his top advisers as he has sought to end the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and Syria.\n\nYet, for much of his nearly three years in office, Trump has buffeted between demonstrating restraint and sending warning flares to Iran that the U.S. is prepared for military confrontation.\n\nIn June, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone, Trump said he gave top Pentagon officials permission to carry out military strikes against Iran before changing his mind 10 minutes before the operation was to be carried out.\n\nTrump said he had a change of heart after being told by a general that the strikes would cause up to 150 Iranian casualties.\n\nIn September, with French President Emmanuel Macron serving as a go-between, Trump reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Iran President Hassan Rouhani to speak with him by phone from the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nThe next month the Pentagon announced it was deploying 3,000 U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia. (The Pentagon on Friday announced following Soleimani's killing that it would boost its presence in the region with an additional 3,500 U.S. troops.)\n\nThe October boost in forces came after a drone attack on a Saudi oilfield. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of being behind unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.\n\nThe tit-for-tat between the U.S. and Iran rose to a whole new level in recent weeks.\n\nLast week, after months of massive street protests in Baghdad by demonstrators urging both Iran and the U.S. to cease interfering in Iraqi affairs, the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group fired a barrage of rockets at a military base in Kirkuk, killing a US contractor and wounding several US and Iraqi troops.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump struck back with airstrikes on Iran-affiliated militia bases in western Iraq and Syria.\n\nThen on Tuesday pro-Iranian militia members marched on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, leading to diplomats holing up in the sprawling compound as protesters burning the embassy's reception.\n\nStill, before attending a New Years Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump told reporters that he didn't see war coming and that he wanted peace with Iran. The president, however, warned that if the U.S. were to go to war with Iran it wouldn't last very long.\n\nLess than 48 hours later, Trump ordered the strike that took out Soleimani.\n\nPresident Trump may be genuine in not wanting war with Iran, Price said. At the same, it is fair to say that he doesn't seem to understand the implication that an action like this could foretell.\n\nJames Carafano, a national security analyst at the conservative Washington think tank Heritage Foundation, argues that that there's no disconnect between Trump's disdain for endless wars and his efforts to increase pressure on Iran.\n\nThis is clearly not an escalation, this is clearly an act of self-defense, Carafano said. The president has also never said we're walking away from the Middle East. What he says he wants is a sustainable security architecture in place which means we're going to protect our interest and we're going to expect others to do more to protect theirs.\n\nIran says it is already plotting revenge.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that harsh retaliation is waiting for the U.S. after the airstrike and called Soleimani the international face of resistance.\n\nAs thousands of worshipers in the Tehran took to streets after Friday prayers to condemn the killing and chant Death to deceitful America, the State Department issued an alert urging American citizens to leave Iraq immediately.\n\nOver the course of presidency, Trump's hawkishness on Iran has lacked coherence and has, in no small part, been informed by his desire to do away with the fragile peace brokered by Obama, said Abbas Kadhim, a Middle East analyst at the Atlantic Council in Washington.\n\nTrump won the White House after pledging as a candidate to undo the Obama-administration brokered agreement to limit its uranium enrichment program in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He and other critics felt the deal gave too many economic benefits without doing enough to prevent Iran from eventually developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nTrump followed through on his campaign vow in May 2018 by officially withdrawing from the treaty and reimposing crippling sanctions on Tehran.\n\nHe exited from the deal because it was an Obama deal, and he did believe in his heart of hearts that he could come up with a better a deal, Kadhim said. He thought Iran would now be facing the greatest dealmaker. But I think he miscalculated the stubbornness of the Iranians.

An increase in the New York City minimum wage is forcing some restauranteurs to either close up shop or raise their prices.\n\nAccording to a report from The Wall Street Journal, New York City restaurants are suffering as a result of a two dollar increase in the minimum wage that took place at the end of 2016.\n\nIt's going up too fast, said Jeremy Merrin, the owner of a chain of Cuban restaurants. Merrin said minimum wage increases forced him to close two of his New York City locations and raise prices at his others. We can't catch our breath, he added.\n\nAngelica Kitchen, long a staple of the East Village, closed their doors after 40 years of operation in response to the increased cost of labor mandated by the new wage policy. I felt like I was being regulated in a way that took certain choices away from me that I felt belonged to me, rightfully, as a business owner, owner Leslie McEachern said. I'm not trying to undercut or underpay anybody, but I also don't know what's coming down the pike.\n\nDespite the negative effects of December's increase, minimum wages in the city are set to increase again by another two dollars at the end of 2017.\n\nNot all restaurant owners are lamenting the new wage policy. Jason Wang, the founder of Xi'an Famous Foods in Manhattan supports the wage increase policy. However, he claims that to offset the increase in the cost of labor, he was forced to raise his prices.\n\nNo one is ever going to celebrate a price increase, Wang said. But I think that with the wage increases, people won't see working in the food industry as a lowest-paying job you take if you can't find work, and start viewing it as a career. It will be good for the industry in the long run.\n\nA study of the effect of minimum wage policies on restaurant employment revealed that minimum wage policies hinder job creation. After Seattle increased the city's minimum wage from $11 to $15, they saw a 900 job drop in overall jobs in the restaurant industry. At the same time, the state of Washington, whose minimum wage remains at $11, saw consistent job creation in the restaurant industry, adding 6,200 jobs over the same time period.\n\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

The hacker group behind the suspected Russian cyberattack of Texas-based IT company SolarWinds is now suspected of also gaining access to Microsoft's internal systems.\n\nNPR reports that the group behind the suspected Russian attack of SolarWinds systems that affected multiple U.S. government agencies and private companies was reportedly also able to hack into Microsoft's internal systems and access some of the company's source code.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Microsoft revealed that while it had previously said that it was among the thousands of companies that detective malware on its systems following an update from SolarWinds, this was the first time that the company announced that hackers had successfully gained access to its systems and viewed source code.\n\nMicrosoft stated that it believed at first that it had blocked the intrusion but some unusual activity on a small number of employee accounts raised alarms at the firm. Upon further investigation, Microsoft found that company source code in a number of source code repositories had been accessed by hackers.\n\nMicrosoft stated: The account did not have permissions to modify any code or engineering systems and our investigation further confirmed no changes were made. These accounts were investigated and remediated.\n\nDmitri Alperovitch, a cybersecurity expert and chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington-based think tank, commented: This attack was not as bad as it could have been for Microsoft. If they had modified the source code, or used it to introduce new backdoors, since Microsoft has billions of users out there in pretty much every organization around the planet, that would've been a very severe, very grave concern, but that doesn't appear to be the case.\n\nRead more at NPR here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Happy New Year! Most of the world is glad to see 2020 in the rear-view mirror. The coronavirus pandemic was the worst of it, along with the global economic crisis\n\n.\n\nBut there was more. In the U.S., the Black Lives Matter movement brought riots to 48 out of 50 major cities. Democrats tried to remove President Donald Trump from office, and Silicon Valley effectively shut down free speech on the Internet.\n\nYet there were some things that went so well that we should bring them into the new year.\n\n1. Operation Warp Speed. When President Trump demanded a coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible, he was told by the experts and the media fact-checkers that it could not be done until the middle of 2021, at the earliest. But Trump insisted, and the scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and logistics experts responded. As a result, millions have already been vaccinated for a disease that was virtually unknown at the start of 2020, and humanity is entering 2021 with hope for a speedy recovery.\n\n2. Abraham Accords. Foreign policy experts laughed at Trump when he said he would bring peace to the Middle East, and outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told the world in 2016 that there would never be separate peace agreements between Israel and the Arab world without the Palestinians. Yet in September, Trump brokered peace and normalization agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Deals with Sudan and Morocco followed, with more deals to come.\n\n3. Work from home. Though many people resented the economic shutdowns, which meant devastation for many businesses, others were able to adapt to working from home. New technologies, such as Zoom, and more flexible work routines allowed employees to become more productive while achieving a better work-life balance. The changes have helped drive a boom in suburban housing, and may help women in particular, who have often been forced to choose between work and family life.\n\n4. Teachers' unions exposed. If it was once possible to see public school teachers' unions as benign, the school shutdowns of 2020 revealed that many of them exist solely to promote the interests of their members, and the political fortunes of the Democratic Party, rather than to improve education for American children. In many cities, schools remained closed despite scientific evidence they could be reopened safely. Their political clout may have suffered permanent damage as a result.\n\n5. Radical left-wing ballot initiatives defeated. Though Democrats managed to defeat President Trump at the polls, voters rejected almost all of the left's most radical ballot initiatives. Tax hikes failed even in deep-blue California and Illinois, and California voters also rejected an effort (Proposition 16) to allow racial discrimination (affirmative action) in state-run institutions. These were major victories, and a sign that even Democratic voters were pushing back against the radical left.\n\n6. Return to space. In May, the U.S. finally returned to manned space flight on board the SpaceX Dragon, marking the first time a private company had ever taken humans into orbit. The feat inspired the world, and gave hope to a nation struggling with the pandemic and ongoing riots. It also heralded the start of a new era in space exploration, giving new momentum to Elon Musk's dream of bringing humans to Mars, and restoring U.S. dominance in space ahead of China and other rivals.\n\n7. Skepticism of experts. Many of the early failures in the fight against the coronavirus happened because the experts were wrong. They told Americans not to wear masks; they botched early coronavirus testing in government labs; and they opposed a travel ban with China. Even the lockdowns preferred by experts are now thought to be counter-productive. As the left pushes the Green New Deal, demanding that we trust the economy to climate scientists, Americans will push back.\n\nJoel B.

President Barack Obama's immigration enforcement director is urging President Donald Trump to release thousands of migrants from detention facilities into the U.S. jobs market amid an economic meltdown.\n\nPreventing the [China] virus from being introduced into these facilities is impossible, according to a March 22 article in the Atlantic by John Sandweg, Obama's former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nICE is fortunate that the threat [to migrants' health] posed by these detention centers can be mitigated rather easily. By releasing from custody the thousands of detainees who pose no threat to public safety and do not constitute an unmanageable flight risk, ICE can reduce the overcrowding of its detention centers, and thus make them safer, while also putting fewer people at risk.\n\nICE has 37,000 people caught in detention, and only a small percentage should be kept in detention, he suggested. In fact, only a small percentage of those in ICE detention have been convicted of a violent crime. Many have never even been charged with a criminal offense. ICE can quickly reduce the detained population without endangering our communities, he wrote.\n\nHis Atlantic op-ed ignores the economic impact of releasing 30,000 migrants into Americans' blue-collar job market, where they can join hundreds of thousands who flooded in during 2019. That huge labor supply reduces blue collar wages and drives up housing costs in blue collar neighborhoods.\n\nHis push to release more blue collar migrants comes as House Democrats try to extend the work-permits used by hundreds of thousands of white collar visa workers.\n\nSandweg framed his catch and release policy as a health and crime issue, saying:\n\nThis doesn't mean that dangerous criminals will be walking the streets. Those who threaten Americans' safety can and must continue to be detained. … When an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs in an ICE facility, the detainees won't be the only ones at risk. An outbreak will expose the hundreds of ICE agents and officers, medical personnel, contract workers, and others who work in these facilities to the virus. Once exposed, many of them will unknowingly take the virus home to their family and community.\n\nMany promigration activists and groups are using the coronavirus disease to push for a mass release, regardless of the impact on Americans.\n\nAlso, the California-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the release of a migrant on March 23 because of the claimed threat posed by the coronavirus. The published order allows judges in the circuit's lower courts to order the release of other migrants.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit – of its own accord! – just ordered the release of a detained immigrant, citing the rapidly escalating public health crisis, which will particularly impact immigration detention. More courts should follow suit. Now. (Thank you for sharing, @aaronlittman!) pic.twitter.com/VoaxktwQgv — Charanya Krishnaswami (@charanya_k) March 23, 2020\n\nBut ICE has already taken many measures to reduce the real risk of the Chinese disease spreading through the confined detention centers.\n\nFor example, it has reduced the danger by scaling back arrest of non-violent migrants into the 30-plus detention centers. It has temporarily halted asylum hearings for the 30,000 migrants waiting in Mexico under theMigrant Protection Protocols rule.\n\nThe agencies are also deporting new border crossers back to Mexico — and flying others back to their distant homelands — without putting them in the ICE detention centers.\n\nAT THIS HOUR: #BorderPatrol and GoM partners work to expel foreigners whom may be carrying a communicable disease. Officials on both sides of the border are processing migrants without delay to expel them to their home countries.\n\nEveryone working to #SlowTheSpread of #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/a4H4SSTevT — Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings (@USBPChiefRGV) March 22, 2020\n\nThe immigration courts are increasing the use of video hearings to minimize the risk of disease transmission between the detained migrants, their lawyers. Court officials also require visitors and lawyers to wear protective gear.\n\nSandweg worked as the ICE chief and top legal advisor to Obama's Department of Homeland Security. In the agency, he helped to implement Obama's 2012 amnesty — dubbed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy — which printed 800,000 work permits for illegals during the extended post-2008 recession.\n\nHe is a law graduate who now works at Nixon Peabody, an elite law and advocacy firm with offices in Washington D.C. and many other cities.\n\nThe huge 2019 inflow was largely allowed by legal rules established by progressives under Obama, and it ended in early 2020 when Trump and his populists blocked the catch and release of economic migrants into the U.S. labor market.\n\nThe migration ended once the would-be migrants realized they could not get U.S. jobs they needed to repay their smuggling debts to the cartel-affiliated coyotes. In January, Trump's deputies released only about 2,000 migrants into the United States, down from 80,000 in May 2019.\n\n10M+ illegals are mixed in with 315M Americans.\n\nAmid the Wuhan virus, some Dems argue for cutback of immig enforcement.\n\nMigrants should be treated alongside Americans to minimize civic risks — but w/o a cutback, says enforcement activist Mark Krikorian.https://t.co/xWUOrcf0oh — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 10, 2020\n\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC, or email the author at NMunro@Breitbart.com.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced the government is working to change the narrative around migration to persuade Scots that the nation needs huge numbers of people from abroad.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of a Scottish government paper which argues for continuing open borders with Europe after Britain's exit from the European Union (EU), the SNP leader claimed a population that is ever-expanding as a result of mass migration is essential to our economic prosperity.\n\nThe stark reality of an ageing society, Sturgeon argued, means she has a duty to make the case for free movement no matter how difficult that is sometimes perceived to be.\n\nThe First Minister's plea for Scotland to remain in the Single Market and to have more liberal immigration controls than its southern neighbour, England, comes only a short time after research showed the majority of Scots would reject bespoke border controls after Brexit.\n\nA detailed study published by the National Centre for Social Research last week found the majority of Scots surveyed are keen to leave the Single Market and have tighter restrictions on migrants post-Brexit, with two-thirds asserting the desire for Scotland to have the same immigration controls as the wider UK.\n\nGrowing our population, and particularly our working age population, is perhaps the greatest national challenge that we face, she announced.\n\nOver the past 15 years, EU migration has helped to turn around the long term decline in Scotland's population and mitigate the impact of an ageing society. Over the next 25 years, our own projected birth rate will not be sufficient to grow our population.\n\nPoliticians call for Wales to be turned into world's first migrant 'sanctuary'. Did Welsh voters consent to this? https://t.co/63jaOA6Vwj — Jack Montgomery ن (@JackBMontgomery) April 10, 2017\n\nBut analysis of previous suggestions that Scotland's population must increase its economy to prosper has shown such claims to be false, with Migration Watch UK last year noting that immigration as a solution to a pensions problem has been dismissed by all serious studies, pointing out among other factors that immigrants too will grow old and draw pensions.\n\nThe migration policy watchdog said: An ageing population is inevitable in Western societies where birth rates are low and health care is extending lives. However, this also means that it is possible to work for longer. Raising the retirement age is one of the most effective means of decreasing the dependency ratio.\n\nWhile Sturgeon warned Scots that their public services are at stake should the population not rise, migration-driven GDP growth has been described as a Ponzi scheme which lines bosses' pockets at the expense of the environment and taxpayers' quality of life.\n\nThe underlying strategy behind the pursuance of such policies is to privatise the profits and socialise the costs incurred from increased population growth, wrote Dr. Joseph Chamie, director of research at the Centre for Migration Studies.\n\nPointing out that while mass immigration results in increasing demand, consumption, borrowing, and profits, the former UN Population Division director said it leaves the general public left to pick up the tab for mounting costs for education, healthcare, housing, and crime.
President Donald Trump downplayed the goal of pro-American immigration reform in his 2020 State of the Union speech, providing only a sketch of a much-touted 2021 reform push.\n\nHe said:\n\nTo build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.\n\nThe issue is vital to his presidency, in part because Americans' wages are reduced by the annual inflow of 1 million legal immigrants alongside the routine inflow of illegals and temporary visa-workers. The huge inflow of legal immigrants also imposes chaotic diversity on the nation's communities, while it shifts wealth to the coastal cities and political power towards the Democrats.\n\nThe short and bland statement gives Trump room to zig-zag between the competing demands of his voters and his donors during the hugely expensive election.\n\nHis voters support the lower-migration policy because it raises wages by reducing the inflow of government-supplied immigrant workers. Rising wages are good for national politics if you're a politician, for sure, Tom Donohue, the long-standing chief of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in early January. He added:\n\nAnd it's good for national politics if you want people to feel more engaged in the healthy part of the economy and go out and vote to keep it that way. If you look the other side of your question: 'Are decreasing wages good for national politics?' Hell, no. … If you have ten people for every job, you're not gonna have a drive [up] in wages. [But] if you have five people for every ten jobs, wages are going to go up.\n\nTrump did not link his immigration policy to the rising level of blue-collar wages:\n\nSince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent — 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.\n\nHis lower migration, higher wages policy is bitterly opposed by investors, nearly every business lobby, most Democrats, and many Republicans. Their opposition killed Trump's 2018 plan to cut legal immigration by roughly 50 percent.\n\nThose investor groups want Trump to endorse migration increases before the 2020 election.\n\nTrump's 2020 speech did not echo business' demand for more workers, even though he said in January that companies need more foreign workers.\n\nWe have to allow smart people to stay in our country — if you graduate number one in your class at Harvard [if] you graduate from the Wharton School of Finance, Trump told Fox News. If we tell smart people to get the hell out, that's not America first.\n\nI have so many companies coming into this country, you're not going to have to worry about it, Trump said in the interview, adding, It is always going to be a shortage [of workers] … We have so many companies coming in from Japan … [and] China now.\n\nThe 2020 speech is also very different from his 2019 State of the Union speech, when he said he wanted to welcome legal immigrants in the largest numbers ever.\n\nHe said, Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.
Harvard University's Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority chapter has dissolved to form a new gender-neutral social club called the Fleur-de-Lis.\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma, the third sorority to arrive at Harvard, has officially disassociated from the sorority's national organization to establish a gender-neutral social club called the Fleur-de-Lis. The new organization's president, Tiana M. Menon, announced the decision in an email statement.\n\nMembers of Harvard University's chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma are happy to announce the formation of The Fleur-de-Lis, a new, independently-affiliated, gender-neutral organization, Menon wrote.\n\nThe May 2016 policy presented the opportunity for our group to critically think and converse about our place on Harvard's campus and collectively determine our path forward, Menon added. The formation of The Fleur is the culmination of numerous discussions spanning the last two or so years within Harvard's Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma and with the administration. [Administrators] have helped shape the path we as a group have chosen to pursue.\n\nHarvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, who was instrumental in the passage of the new Harvard policy that restricts members of single-sex student organizations from obtaining leadership positions elsewhere on campus, praised Fleur-de-Lis' announcement.\n\nThis kind of positive change is made possible by our students' leadership in creating environments and cultures rooted in respect and inclusion, Khurana wrote. As members of this community, we all have an opportunity to strengthen our culture both for current students and future generations, and I applaud the Fleur-de-Lis on their efforts.\n\nOn Fleur-de-Lis' new website, the organization claims that they will not deny membership to any student interested in joining on the basis of gender. Being a gender-neutral club means that we will never deny membership to our organization to anyone on the basis of gender, the organization's website reads. Our mission is to create a safe, empowering space for female-identifying individuals on campus.
The Major League Baseball Hall of Fame will no longer allow Chief Wahoo, the longtime logo of the Cleveland Indians, to be displayed on Hall of Fame plaques.\n\nThe Hall of Fame announced their position in a statement released on Wednesday:\n\nThe issue came about last month as soon-to-be-inducted Hall of Famer and former Indian Jim Thome, announced that he did not want the Wahoo logo on his cap or plaque, when he gets enshrined.\n\nI know my decision would be to wear the 'C' because I think it's the right thing to do, Thome said. I think I need to have a conversation with the Hall of Fame because of all the history and everything involved. I just think that's the right thing to do.\n\nHowever, the matter of which logo a player wears for Hall of Fame enshrinement, is not solely up to the player. The Hall of Fame has final say in order to ensure that the player wears a logo which represents a significant portion of his career. As opposed to a player getting enshrined with a logo for a team he only played with briefly.\n\nIn this case, the Hall of Fame went a step beyond what Thome was asking for, and instead created a new policy for all future Indians Hall of Famers.\n\nIn January, MLB announced that the Indians would remove Chief Wahoo from all jerseys and caps. Commissioner Manfred said at the time, the club ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use in Major League Baseball.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn
Several asylum seekers in Sweden have killed themselves in recent weeks, and the government has held a crisis meeting to find the cause and deal with the issue.\n\nFive asylum seekers have taken their lives in Sweden, three of them in the last two weeks alone. The migrants have two things in common, all were young Afghan asylum seekers, and they were all scheduled to be deported. The problem is especially prevalent among young asylum seekers who even encourage others to kill themselves online Deutschlandfunk reports.\n\nPsychologist Julia Tiberg works with young migrants at Vi står inte ut, an organisation dedicated to helping young asylum seekers in Sweden. Tilberg said, We observe young asylum seekers in closed internet forums encouraging each other to commit suicide, adding, suicide is also considered moral by the group and is for the sake of others, to affect the current policy.\n\nOmbudsman Fredrik Malmberg has backed up the claims saying, I have been informed by the social authority that there are seemingly organised suicidal thoughts among asylum seekers without families, which is extremely worrying because several of them have actually committed suicide.\n\nIn the past year around 3,000 underage Afghan migrants have arrived in Sweden and 600 of them have been rejected for asylum status. Of those rejected, many have been allowed to stay in Sweden because they claim not to have any family back in their native country.\n\nMusse Hossein is an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who tries to help his fellow countrymen. He said of the underage migrants he has met, they feel lonely, have mental problems, and when their asylum petition is rejected, the situation is, of course, serious.\n\nOver the past year, Sweden has also had problems with abuse in underage migrant homes. In February of last year, a 15-year-old Afghan migrant boy who had recently arrived in Sweden was tricked into going to a field near his asylum home by several other underage asylum seekers who proceeded to beat him and rape him.\n\nA few months later in April, another underage migrant was sexually abused. In that case, the victim was a 15-year-old girl, and her attacker was another Afghan migrant who claimed to be underage, though authorities discovered that he was lying about his age and had only been in Sweden for two days before the attack.\n\nAnother boy was sexually abused by Afghan migrants in December in the Swedish city of Uppsala. The boy, who is said to have been under 15, was lured by five underage Afghans to a wooded area where the boys sexually abused him, beat him and filmed the ordeal on their mobile phones.
President-elect Joe Biden's advisers are reportedly meeting with House Democrats to discuss a swift immigration agenda for the incoming administration, which is almost certain to include some form of amnesty for illegal aliens living in the United States.\n\nSources familiar with the meetings told Politico that Biden's policy advisers met with Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA), as well as Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) and Linda Sanchez (D-CA) to discuss an immigration agenda:\n\nThe president-elect says he plans to introduce an immigration bill immediately. It's not clear if that will be a larger reform package or a more narrow bill targeted at Dreamers — undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age, according to our transition reporting team. [Emphasis added] Biden's immigration policy advisers also met with Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.) about a week ago to discuss legislation, a source with knowledge tells Laura Barron-Lopez. [Emphasis added]\n\nLast month, Castro and Sanchez joined a number of other House Democrats to introduce legislation that would permanently add millions of foreign workers to the U.S. labor market every year. Those foreign workers, here on temporary visas, would otherwise be asked to return to their native countries.\n\nBiden and his advisers have repeatedly hinted at action to dismantle reforms implemented by President Trump to reduce visa abuse, illegal immigration, and asylum fraud.\n\nFor instance, Biden's advisers have said they will work to end U.S. asylum agreements with Central America so as to reopen the Catch and Release policy whereby border crossers are often caught by U.S. Border Patrol and released into the interior of the country.\n\nLikewise, Biden is considering ending Trump's Remain in Mexico policy that has drastically reduced asylum fraud, and he has suggested providing amnesty to over 11 million illegal aliens in his first 100 days in office.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, border apprehensions at the southern border have jumped to the highest level for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2021 since the year 2000.\n\nBetween October and December 2020, nearly 208,000 border crossers were apprehended at the border, the highest number since the Clinton administration.

Supermarkets are opening early in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia so that senior citizens or those with disabilities can avoid coronavirus panic shopping.\n\nSince the arrival of the China-origin COVID-19 to Europe, British shoppers, fearing shortages, closures, and quarantines, have been stockpiling on essentials across the country. Supermarkets are working with suppliers and delivery services to increase production and delivery to respond to the demand, but shelves normally holding pasta, rice, UHT milk, or toilet paper are often empty by the middle of the day.\n\nIn a bid to ensure that the more vulnerable people in our society are not left wanting and can shop in safety, British budget supermarket chain Iceland has announced some of its stores will open an hour early exclusively for senior citizens and those with disabilities. While not company policy, managers at a local level have decided to respond to their communities' needs and open their stores early where needed.\n\nWe just want to make sure the experience is as stress-free as possible, Danny Burke, the manager for Iceland in West Belfast, Northern Ireland, told the BBC, with other Iceland stores are opening early in the south-east and north of England.\n\nA huge thank you to @AldiUK for their generous donation. This money will help us continue to provide vital information, advice and services to vulnerable older people at this difficult time. 💜 https://t.co/J3kE6QIDPS — Age UK (@age_uk) March 17, 2020\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Lidl and Tesco store managers are also looking out for their community by offering priority shopping for seniors, over 65s, and carers. All 163 Lidls across Ireland will offer priority shopping for these groups from 9 am to 11 am every day, which will include prioritised queuing and additional assistance for our older customers. All of Tesco's 151 stores will be open an hour early for seniors on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.\n\nAustralian supermarket chain Woolworths has introduced a special elderly hour for its senior customers whilst another chain, Coles, is set to introduce a similar scheme. Many older Aussies had told the BBC that they found it difficult to get supplies, with Australians similarly stockpiling. Today, there was plenty of food on the shelves, one shopper told the broadcaster, whilst another noted how well organised and friendly all the staff had been.\n\nHowever, mobility for seniors has recently become more difficult after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that in order to protect seniors, who are more at risk from coronavirus, they should self-isolate for 12 weeks as a precautionary measure. Health minister Matt Hancock had said on Sunday that seniors may be asked to self-isolate for up to four months even if they have no symptoms.\n\nNow more than ever, every little helps pic.twitter.com/SrFsY2ZuIp — Tesco Ireland (@TescoIrl) March 16, 2020\n\nHow to ensure seniors can still buy groceries may be solved thanks to new technology. Media revealed that government ministers are in talks with food app delivery services Deliveroo, JustEat, and Uber Eats on plans to deliver care packages to seniors and particularly how to provide the service for older people who may struggle using apps.\n\nA Deliveroo spokesman told Sky News on Monday: Our riders are part of their local communities up and down the country and we know they will want to help support people, particularly the most vulnerable.\n\nKeeping isolated seniors fed is not enough, however, with older Britons at risk of loneliness and experiencing mental health issues due to months of isolation. Volunteers have been self-organising and developing support networks across the country.\n\nTherapists in Oxford have set up telephone and Skype services for seniors in need of emotional support and advice. A Shropshire medical centre is organising volunteers for grocery pick-ups, while a charity in Cornwall is coordinating helpers for those elderly who have no family. Wales's Local Government Association is looking to recruit an army of volunteers to ensure that Welsh seniors are not forgotten and that there are people on hand to offer emotional and practical support.\n\nWe're at 400 #MutualAidCV groups!!

The heading of the postcard reads, Hello! If you are self-isolating, I can help and includes sections prompting the volunteer to share their name, number, and offers of help, such as picking up groceries, posting mail, or even just offering a friendly phone call.\n\nThe post card's creator Becky Wass wrote on Facebook: I've been feeling pretty helpless watching the news. Maybe you have too? I wanted to do something about it, so I've made a postcard that I'll be posting to my older neighbours as this progresses (after washing my hands!).\n\nIf just one person feels less lonely or isolated when faced with this pandemic, then I'll feel better about it (I hope!)\n\nCoronavirus is scary. Let's make kindness go viral.
The Times of Israel reports: Hamas co-founder Mahmoud al-Zahar clarified Wednesday that his terror group's new political program, which some interpreted as accepting the idea of a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines, would not preclude Hamas from seeking to liberate all of historic Palestine, including Israel.\n\nIf we liberate Palestine though the resistance until the 1967 borders, we will go directly to liberate the rest of Palestine and the territories of 1948, and there will be no negotiations, Zahar said at a conference in Gaza addressing international reactions to the new policy document, according to the Hamas-linked al-Resalah news site.\n\nZahar was likely responding to hardline critics of Hamas's new program, such as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group. As partners with our Hamas brothers in the struggle for liberation, we feel concern over the document, Islamic Jihad's deputy leader, Ziad al-Nakhala, said Saturday.\n\nRead more here.
A transgender billionaire is threatening to stop donations to the GOP unless GOP leaders reject voters' support for the continued federal recognition of the two equal, different, and complementary sexes.\n\nI have supported many Republicans in elections, Jennifer Pritzker, a billionaire member of the wealthy Pritzker family who is living as a woman, wrote in the Washington Post. Pritzker added:\n\nI have hoped the Republican Party would reform from within and end its assault on the LGBTQ community. Yet, the party continues to champion policies that marginalize me out of existence, define me as an eccentric character and persecute me for using the public restrooms that correspond to my gender identity. As a result, the GOP's positions have forced me to refocus my attention away from their agendas I support. Instead, I find myself focusing on issues to protect myself and others like me. Every dollar spent defending transgender rights is one dollar less I can contribute toward other party initiatives.\n\nPritzer is a leading donor to the various advocacy groups which are pushing the transgender ideology into U.S. law and civic life. The ideology insists that everyone should have an FBI-enforced federal right to switch their legal sex — regardless of science or their biology — to match their claimed gender identity whenever they enter sports competitions, lesbian nightclubs, K-12 bathrooms, hospitals, gym showers, the military, or single-sex civic groups.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump is blocking the ideology and is now working to ensure the Supreme Court recognizes the bright line between male and female biology.\n\nPritzker wrote:\n\nThe Republican Party more closely aligns with my beliefs in a less interventionist government. Democratic Party policies can be too costly and restrictive on citizens. Lowering regulations helps protect people's individual rights with private property, business and investments. Increasing taxes and creating or adding to government agencies are not a guaranteed solution to any problem.\n\n…\n\nI ask Republicans to prioritize policies that improve our country for all Americans. When the GOP asks me to deliver six- or seven-figure contributions for the 2020 elections, my first response will be: Why should I contribute to my own destruction?\n\nPritzker donates heavily to business-first establishment Republicans, party committies, and state parties. The strategy is likely intended to encourage party committees to suppress GOP voters' rising concerns about the broad campaign to impose the transgender ideology on communities and families.\n\nPritzker's demand for top-level GOP rejection of GOP voters echoes similar threats from other business-first GOP donors. In June 2018, for example, Breitbart reported on donors' demands for more imported workers and consumers:\n\nA large group of NeverTrump investors and cheap labor CEO donors are promising to go on strike until House Speaker Paul Ryan schedules passage of a cheap labor amnesty for June 25. The bipartisan group, which is titled the American Business Immigration Council, is led by Mike Fernandez, a healthcare executive in Florida. He wants Ryan to keep the House in session on June 25 so the alliance of 193 Democrats and 25-plus cheap labor Republicans can pass a discharge petition amnesty through the House — despite many polls showing any amnesty is very unpopular among GOP voters.\n\nThe Pritzker family strongly supports Democratic politicians and advocacy groups. That policy is rational because the family's real-estate holdings rise as the federal government imports more immigrants who will need to rent or buy the families' apartments and real-estate.\n\nGOP legislators recognize that the transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Trump to win the presidency.\n\nMultiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology's claim that a person's legal sex is determined by their feeling of gender identity, not by their biology.\n\nFar less than one percent of Americans try to live as members of the other sex. For example, only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\n\nBut the gender ideology is gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies, and despite growing damage to young people, including the many people who reverse their transgender views and try to live as members of their own sex.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans' attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of gender identity has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules which help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents' rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women's expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men's sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children's sexual privacy.
The lawyers representing the mother of a child fathered by Hunter Biden recently filed a motion seeking to have the former vice president's son held in contempt of court for repeatedly refusing to obey a paternity and child support suit-linked order to provide financial documents, including his 2017 and 2018 personal tax returns.\n\nCiting the contempt motion filed in an Arkansas court by 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' lawyers on Friday, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette revealed that besides his tax returns, Hunter Biden has also failed to disclose:\n\nAll financial institutions used by him or a business he owns or controls; a list of all companies he currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated; a list of all sources of income for the past five years; a list of all employers for the past five years; tax documents for companies he owns and a copy of deeds to properties that he owns or in which he has an ownership interest.\n\n[T]he defendant continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support, the motion declared, adding, This Court should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law.\n\nRoberts is a former stripper and the mother of 50-year-old Hunter's child.\n\nHunter's conduct is willful and contemptuous, Roberts' lawyers also argued, urging the court to order him to appear in person at a March 13 pretrial hearing to explain why the tribunal should not hold him in contempt, Fox News reported on Sunday.\n\nThe Arkansas court expects Hunter to appear for a deposition on Wednesday in Little Rock despite his attorney arguing that his client would be unavailable until April 1.\n\nHunter must appear for a deposition before the March 13 hearing, the judge insisted.\n\nAfter months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents could shed light on his father's massive conflicts of interest as vice president, Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee (RNC), told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nCiting the results of a DNA test, the Arkansas judge hearing the paternity and child support case ruled in January that Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is the biological and legal father of Roberts' child.\n\nAccording to documents filed in connection to Roberts' suit, Hunter is the subject of multiple criminal investigations, including a money-laundering probe linked to Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.\n\nHunter served on Burisma's board of directors for a lucrative $83,000 a month while his father was in charge of U.S. policy towards Ukraine as vice president, prompting corruption allegations that have triggered investigations by Senate Republicans.\n\nThe former VP's son worked for Burisma between 2014 and 2019 despite the conflict of interest and corruption concerns raised by individuals from inside and outside the Obama administration.\n\nHunter has repeatedly defied multiple court orders, refusing to comply with deadlines to provide the financial information.\n\nRoberts' lawyers have reportedly filed three motions to hold Hunter in contempt of the Arkansas court — on March 6, December 23, and January 20.\n\nThe Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported on Saturday:\n\nIn Friday's Renewed Motion for Contempt and for Order to Show Cause, Roberts' attorney, Clint Lancaster, said [Hunter] has continued to flaunt the orders of this Court by failing to answer discovery, comply with court orders, and provide his financial information. Circuit Judge Don McSpadden, who was initially assigned the case, made clear more than three months ago that Hunter could not withhold certain records.\n\nCircuit Judge Holly Meyer replaced McSpadden in January.\n\nHe needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire, Meyer declared during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, the Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Hunter is spending time pursuing a career in art in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in the Hollywood Hills. He is reportedly driving a Porsche.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. challenged Hunter over the weekend to a debate, adding that he would release his tax returns if the former vice president's son makes his public as well.
Delta Air Lines is banning gun check-ins for passengers headed to the Washington, DC, area ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nNBC News reports that Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Squawk Box, We're all on high alert based on the events over the last couple of weeks in Washington.\n\nBastian indicated the airline will implement a policy this weekend that will prohibit D.C.-bound travelers from checking firearms on flights. The new policy does not impact law enforcement officials who are authorized to carry firearms.\n\nUSA Today notes that Bastian was asked if he is worried about the behavior of Delta passengers. He responded by noting that nearly all Delta passengers are really great and doing a good job.\n\nHe added, I don't want to overreact. I think this is a moment hopefully in time with the outcry around the election results.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

YouTube, the Google-owned video platform, said it would escalate efforts to crack down on election misinformation amid an unprecedented campaign of censorship against President Trump from other Silicon Valley companies.\n\nAll YouTube channels that Google deems to violate its policy, including President Trump's will receive a strike that temporarily prevents them from uploading new videos.\n\nIn a series of tweets, the official YouTube Twitter account said it was escalating its policy due to the disturbing events that transpired yesterday.\n\nVia Twitter:\n\nDue to the disturbing events that transpired yesterday, and given that the election results have now been certified, starting today *any* channels posting new videos with false claims in violation of our policies will now receive a strike. Over the last month, we've removed thousands of videos which spread misinformation claiming widespread voter fraud changed the result of the 2020 election, including several videos President Trump posted to his channel. Like other major policy updates, in our Help Center, we noted that there would be a short grace period after the Dec update & new content that broke our rules would be removed without penalty. The grace period was scheduled to end on Inauguration Day. Channels that receive a strike are temporarily suspended from posting or live streaming. Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube. We apply our policies and penalties consistently, regardless of who uploads it.\n\nThe Google-owned platform also removed a short clip of President Trump calling on supporters to peacefully disperse, the same video that was taken down by Twitter and Facebook.\n\nWe removed a video posted this afternoon to Donald Trump's channel that violated our policies regarding content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S., Farshad Shadloo, YouTube spokesperson, told Business Insider.\n\nWe do allow copies of this video if uploaded with additional context and sufficient educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA) value.\n\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price and Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office and Management and Budget, disagree with the Congressional Budget Office's assessment on the cost and other impacts of the GOP's American Health Care Act, which concludes that as many as 24 million would be uninsured by 2026 under the new law.\n\nWe disagree strenuously with the report that was put out, Price told reporters at the White House after the CBO score was released.\n\nPrice said that the CBO report looked at a portion of our plan, but not the entire plan, according to a pooled press report from the White House.\n\nThe GOP plan has three parts and the CBO based its reports on the first phase.\n\nPrice explained that HHS can employ the regulatory apparatus to make certain that patients are helped and that costs are decreased.\n\nPrice also said CBO ignored other legislative action.\n\nWe believe that our plan will cover more individuals at a lower cost and give them the choices that they want for the coverage that they want for themselves and their family, not that the government forces them to buy, Price said.\n\nMulvaney said he had not read the entire CBO report but did find a bright spot.\n\nThe numbers that I've seen in the first glance is that CBO says that premiums will go down by at least 10 percent, Mulvaney said.\n\nA reporter noted that CBO got to that figure by estimating that fewer older Americans would get coverage, but Price said CBO did not take into account the entire for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, we're working on the regulations right now, Price said.\n\nAsked about the report's finding that 14 million more people would be left without insurance next year, Price said it's virtually impossible to have that number occur.\n\nSo CBO is wrong, they are not credible? a reporter asked.\n\nPrice said:\n\nWell, you just look at the numbers. There are 8-9 million people who are on the exchange currently. I'm not sure how they are going to get 14 million people uninsured, if that's what they say, with only eight million people on the exchange. They are individuals, I guess that they assume that are on Medicaid who aren't paying anything in the Medicaid system who are not going to take the Medicaid policy just because the mandate ended or something happened. It's just not believable is what we would suggest. We'll look at the numbers and see.\n\nWithout that mandate to buy coverage, wouldn't you concede there will be millions of uninsured? a reporter asked.\n\nNo, I wouldn't concede that at all, Price said. The fact of the matter is they are going to be able to a coverage policy that they want for themselves and for their family.\n\nThey are going to have the kind of choices that they want … so we think that CBO simply has it wrong, Price said.\n\nMulvaney criticized CBO's report for assuming Medicaid changes will happen on day one.\n\nIt's just absurd, Mulvaney said.
Militants allied with the Islamic State (ISIS) reportedly looted a fortune in cash, gold, and jewelry from the Philippine city of Marawi during their five-month occupation last year, and have used their booty to recruit hundreds of new terrorist operatives.\n\nAlthough its ambitions to use Marawi as the capital of a new caliphate were thwarted, ISIS has grown strong enough to battle Philippine troops again over the weekend.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the key figure in the Islamic State's Philippine comeback is an insurgent named Humam Abdul Najib, a.k.a. Abu Dar. Najib was able to slip out of Marawi after it was recaptured by Philippine forces in October with treasure stolen from banks, businesses, and residences in the city. Money was also raised by taking hostages for ransom. Some of the hostages report seeing militants use explosive devices to crack open bank vaults.\n\nMarawi City police supplied an additional detail to the ISIS looting spree: the occupation began shortly before the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, so the largely Muslim residents of the city had more money on hand than they usually would because gifts of money are a local Ramadan tradition. The thieves were overheard proclaiming their loot was a gift from Allah.\n\nNajib used these funds to recruit both impoverished Filipino youths and hardened mercenary troops. His recruiting drive was successful enough to replace many of the hundreds of militants lost in the battle for Marawi.\n\nDefinitely they haven't abandoned their intent to create a caliphate in Southeast Asia, warned Col. Romeo Brawner of Joint Task Force Marawi. That's the overall objective, but in the meantime, while they are still trying to recover and build up again—fighters and weapons—our estimate is they are going to launch terrorist attacks.\n\nThe first of these attacks appears to have occurred on Saturday, as government forces clashed with small squads of the ISIS-allied Maute terrorist group. The Philippine military expressed concern that ISIS terrorists have become adept at surviving in the wilds of the restless island of Mindanao and have forged connections with the impoverished local population.\n\nHopes that ISIS in the Philippines would collapse with the death of local strongman Isnilon Hapilon were quickly dashed. As far back as November, the many other militia groups in Mindanao, including some Muslim fighters, were bracing themselves for battle with the Islamic State and warning that ISIS recruiters were active in their communities.\n\nSome said the Islamic State's defeat in Marawi was less important than the impressive length of time they were able to hold off Philippine government forces, which inspired more feuding Islamist bands to rally under the ISIS banner. Presumably, the militants were even more impressed by vans and trucks overstuffed with money and jewelry rolling out of Marawi during the occupation.\n\nMindanao remains under martial law, as it has been since the siege of Marawi began last May. President Rodrigo Duterte's office put out a call for foreign assistance on Monday, even as opposition politicians criticized the intensive American assistance provided during the Marawi crisis.\n\nWe ask help from anyone, from all countries of the world, because the threat of terrorism is not just in the Philippines, it's a worldwide concern. So if countries want to give whatever assistance they could and they want to, it's welcome, a spokesman for President Duterte said, while insisting the request was not inconsistent with Duterte's aspiration to develop a more independent foreign policy.
U.S. Ambassador to London Woody Johnson has hailed Britain's departure from the European Union, reaffirming President Trump's enthusiasm for a free, world-facing United Kingdom and a future trade deal.\n\nThe written message came in the final hours of Britain's membership of the EU, when Ambassador Robert 'Woody' Johnson noted the historic occasion and expressed his good wishes to the United Kingdom in the next chapter of her national history.\n\nHailing the transatlantic special relationship, the Ambassador said the United Kingdom and the United States would go forward to face global challenges together.\n\nMaking clear the United States' support for Britain, Ambassador Johnson wrote: America shares your optimism and excitement about the many opportunities the future will bring — one of those opportunities very evidently being the hotly-anticipated future free trade agreement between the two nations.\n\nI would like to wish the UK every success as you chart a new path outside of the EU. We share your optimism and excitement about the many opportunities the future will bring. pic.twitter.com/6H216ZalHL — Ambassador Johnson (@USAmbUK) January 31, 2020\n\nA British-American trade deal has been a core part of the Brexit story since before even the 2016 referendum, with the fact that European Union laws and conventions ban its member-states from striking their own trade deals being a sticking point for many Eurosceptics during Britain's membership of the bloc.\n\nThis dynamic took on a dramatic turn in the runup to the 2016 Brexit referendum, when then-U.S. President Barack Obama told the British people that Britain would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal should it ever dare leave the European Union at the request of then-Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nThe intervention in the Brexit debate by President Obama was poorly received by many British voters, and was subsequently credited with helping the public swing behind Brexit.\n\nThe fact the intervention was manufactured by David Cameron was subsequently revealed and compounded the controversy surrounding it.\n\nConfirmed: Cameron Told Obama to Say Brexit Britain Would Be 'Back of the Queue' https://t.co/k6QIKSdS6J — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 2, 2018\n\nAttitudes to a trade deal developed markedly under U.S. President Donald Trump, however, who flipped the phrase on its head, telling Britain when it was ready to leave the European Union it would be at the front of the line for a deal — something he has frequently repeated since.\n\nAmbassador Johnson emphasised this in his Brexit Day note of congratulations, writing: President Donald J. Trump has long supported the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union. Now that the UK is back in control of its own trade policy, we look forward to achieving a broad Free Trade Agreement that will increase prosperity and create jobs in both our countries.\n\nPresident Trump's Ambassador has long been a cheerleader for a free trade agreement between the two countries, and has made clear his determination to see one signed.\n\nSpeaking in January, Ambassador Johnson said the Trump Presidency and the British government would work day and night to facilitate a deal.

New York Times best-selling author and populist conservative columnist Ann Coulter says President Trump's border wall prototypes sitting in the San Diego, California, desert are a ridiculous waste of time.\n\nDuring an interview on KABC Los Angeles, Coulter mocked Trump's border wall prototypes after the president visited the structures last week, as Breitbart News reported. According to Coulter:\n\nThey're very good at stopping any illegal alien prototypes. … I don't know why we need prototypes, except that it's all just a fakeout and the whole thing about building a wall is just 'I'm going to get four years saying I'm going to build the wall and inspecting prototypes, but I'll never actually build the wall.' … No, it's a ridiculous waste of time. [Emphasis added]\n\nCoulter said the U.S. should model its illegal immigration policies on Israel's successful effort that has ended all illegal immigration into the country, as noted by Breitbart Israel Bureau Chief Aaron Klein. Coulter said:\n\nI'll take whatever Israel has because it's working 100 percent. … They have a huge problem with illegal aliens and they're fantastic. I mean, I have a whole chapter in 'Adios, America' about 'Why can't we have Israel's plan on immigration?' … They take illegal aliens and just fly them to other countries and drop them off in the desert.\n\nKlein noted at the beginning of 2018 how Trump's effort to stop illegal immigration pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border should be modeled off Israel in five simple points:\n\nBuild a wall at the border\n\nForcibly deport illegal aliens\n\nGive illegal aliens incentives to self-deport\n\nEnd all government funding for illegal aliens\n\nFine employers who hire illegal aliens\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, despite more than a year now into Trump's presidency, a border wall remains unconstructed along the southern border with no clear vision in sight of when the project will break ground.\n\nThe border wall prototypes in San Diego have been collecting dust in the desert for over half a year now, though some experts say none of the prototypes will ever be chosen and that the border wall will be mash-up of multiple elements from each prototype.\n\nIn the meantime, wage growth for American workers is at risk as illegal immigration is set to majorly increase this year.\n\nWage Growth for American Workers Threatened by Lack of Wall, Expected Rise in Illegal Immigrationhttps://t.co/4c0aYxs73j — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 16, 2018\n\nPrinceton Policy Adviser President Steven Kopits says illegal immigration in 2018 is likely to increase by 70 percent—or about 590,000 border-crossings for 2018.\n\nSuch an increase, Kopits told the Washington Examiner, would put 2018 as the second highest year since 2010 for illegal immigration on the southern border.\n\nIn Kopits' most recent report on illegal immigration, he notes that California's farm wages for Americans have increased because of slower illegal immigration throughout 2017 and increased enforcement, with the caveat, However, the more enforcement succeeds, the higher wages will go, and the greater the incentive to evade the ban. In California, for example, tougher border enforcement has raised farm wages to $16 / hour, up perhaps $5 / hour over earlier times.\n\nThose wages gains, though, risk being depleted this year. Also running the risk of being depleted is history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black Americans.\n\nA whistleblower in the California construction business most recently revealed how mass immigration and illegal aliens contributed in driving down Americans' wages in the industry, Breitbart News reported:\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER: If I hired a framer to do a small addition [in 1988], his wage would have been $45 an hour. That was the minimum for a framing contractor, a good carpenter. [Emphasis added] … Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can't go lower than the minimum wage. [Emphasis added]\n\nEvery year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants, consisting of mostly low-skilled foreign nationals who are only entering the country because they have foreign relatives already living in the U.S. In 2016, the illegal and legal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.
The anti-Trump Lincoln Project is building a database of Trump officials and staffers with the intention of holding those people professionally accountable for supporting the president, according to Stuart Stevens, a Republican operative who works with the Lincoln Project.\n\nStuart Stevens revealed in a tweet Saturday that the group is building what appears to be a blacklist.\n\nAt @ProjectLincoln we are constructing a database of Trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration & track where they are now, he wrote. No personal info, only professional. But they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved.\n\nAt @ProjectLincoln we are constructing a database of Trump officials & staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration & track where they are now.

But they will be held accountable & not allowed to pretend they were not involved https://t.co/DkpxpaWaWB — stuart stevens (@stuartpstevens) January 9, 2021\n\nHe didn't say when the database would go live or how the group will make it accessible to the public.\n\nThe Lincoln Project actively campaigned against President Trump during the presidential election and supported Democrat candidates during the Georgia runoff elections this month. The group, whose founders include Steve Schmidt and George Conway, became the darling of the left-wing elite, which embraced the group and showered it with donations.\n\nThe revelation of the database has already sparked criticism from some prominent conservative media figures. Fox News's Brit Hume replied, This will not end well.\n\nThis will not end well. https://t.co/2AqroKqhDE — Brit Hume (@brithume) January 9, 2021\n\nCommentator Tammy Bruce compared the effort to the Star of David patches that Nazis forced Jews to wear during the Holocaust.\n\nI hear it would be even easier if you made them wear a patch of some sort so they can be recognized even when in public. So much easier to keep them in control & perpetually punished for the Wrong Think. #fascist https://t.co/mnCpSLfreS — Tammy Bruce (@HeyTammyBruce) January 9, 2021\n\nThe database seems to bear a spiritual resemblance to the short-lived Trump Accountability Project, an effort promoted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) that was intended to publicly ostracize Trump administration officials and staffers. The project was abandoned after it received backlash from public figures across the political spectrum.\n\nIn November, Lincoln Project leaders attempted to publicly shame two attorneys working with President Trump on claims of voter fraud by posting their photos on Twitter. Those tweets later vanished after it was determined they violated Twitter policy.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the group also pledged to spend $500,000 on ads to shame Jones Day and Porter Wright Morris & Arthur for their role as counsel to President Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

A Silicon Valley elementary school recently told third-graders to rank themselves according to their power and privilege, whistleblower documents revealed.\n\nA third-grade teacher at the R.I. Meyerholz Elementary School in well-to-do Cupertino, California, conducted a lesson on social identities during a math class, Christopher Rufo reported at Manhattan Institute's City Journal.\n\nAccording to the report, based on the whistleblower documents and parents' comments, the teacher asked the young children to create an identity map, composed of characteristics such as race, class, gender, religion, and family structure.\n\nNext, the teacher taught the children they live in a dominant culture of white, middle class, cisgender, educated, able-bodied, Christian, English speaker[s], with others of privilege who created their culture in order to hold power and stay in power.\n\nThe young children then read from the New York Times bestseller, This Book Is Antiracist, only to learn their privilege allows them power over others.\n\nRufo reported:\n\nAs an example, the reading states that a white, cisgender man, who is able-bodied, heterosexual, considered handsome and speaks English has more privilege than a Black transgender woman. In some cases, because of the principle of intersectionality, there are parts of us that hold some power and other parts that are oppressed, even within a single individual.\n\nThe third-graders then deconstructed their own identities and were asked to circle the identities that hold power and privilege on their maps and rank them using the hierarchy they were taught.\n\nAdditionally, Rufo noted the children received another related essay assignment of at least one full page of writing describing their powerful and privileged identities.\n\nAs an example, the presentation included a short paragraph about transgenderism and nonbinary sexuality, he wrote.\n\nParents were reportedly outraged when they discovered the lesson and assignment.\n\nWe were shocked, one Asian-American parent told Rufo. They were basically teaching racism to my eight-year-old.\n\nThis parent organized others to protest the school's intersectionality curriculum. Eventually, the parents met with Jenn Lashier, the school principal, and demanded the instruction end. According to the report, Lashier ultimately agreed to suspend the curriculum.\n\nRufo explained the paradoxical situation:\n\nThe irony is that, despite being 94 percent nonwhite, Meyerholz Elementary is one of the most privileged schools in America. The median household income in Cupertino is $172,000, and nearly 80 percent of residents have a bachelor's degree or higher. At the school, where the majority of families are Asian-American, the students have exceptionally high rates of academic achievement and the school consistently ranks in the top 1 percent of all elementary schools statewide. In short, nobody at Meyerholz is oppressed, and the school's high-achieving parents know that teaching intersectionality instead of math is a waste of time—and potentially dangerous.\n\nReading from This Book Is Antiracist, the teacher taught the children the theory of intersectionality and claimed that those with privilege have power over others and that folx who do not benefit from their social identities … have little to no privilege and power. pic.twitter.com/GX77Og36Ai — Christopher F. Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) January 13, 2021\n\nRufo reported one parent noted that Critical Race Theory is a reminder of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in that its goal is to portray society as divided between those who are oppressors and those who are the oppressed. The parent explained:\n\n[S]ince these identities are inborn characteristics people cannot change, the only way to change it is via violent revolution. Growing up in China, I had learned it many times. The outcome is the family will be ripped apart; husband hates wife, children hate parents. I think it is already happening here.\n\nRufo reported that what has happened in this one elementary school is but an example of what has grown into a larger development of mobilization by West-Coast Asian-Americans against affirmative action.\n\nIn October 2019, he reported on Asian-Americans in Washington, organizing to resist the radical leftwing agenda that demands diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nThe families rebelled against the Democrats' affirmative action laws that actually penalize academically successful Asian-American students by limiting their admissions to the University of Washington system.\n\nRufo reported other Asian-Americans in California have been successful in 2020 as well.\n\nIn both cases, they defended the principles of meritocracy, individual rights, and equality under the law—and roundly defeated a super-coalition of the states' progressive politicians, activists, universities, media, and corporations, Rufo noted, observing the leftwing mantra of systemic racism and white supremacy has made Asian-Americans an inconvenient minority.\n\nAs Breitbart News also reported in November, the North Thurston Public School district in Washington released a statement in its equity report in which officials were forced to apologize for ejecting Asian-American students from their students of color category because they were performing satisfactorily. The report had grouped white and Asian-American students together.\n\nAsians are too inconvenient to their narrative. — ALeaf (@yangleicq) November 15, 2020\n\nWhile the school district attempted to justify its actions with its intention to make equity-based decisions, after an apparently significant response from the community's Asian-American families, officials apologized for the negative impact we have caused and removed the equity report from the district's website.\n\nIn November, a federal appeals court upheld Harvard University's affirmative action policy that had been challenged by a group that alleged the Ivy League school discriminates against Asian-Americans.\n\nIlya Shapiro, director of constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, commented to USA Today he was not surprised by the ruling.\n\nThe case was always designed to go to the Supreme Court and now it will, he said. It's high time that the justices end the 40-year error of interpreting the Constitution to allow universities that accept public funding to use racial preferences in admissions decisions.
Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the best friend small business will ever have in the White House.\n\nWe're in the promise-keeping business, Pence told the crowd.\n\nIn the first 100 days, Pence said that Trump picked a world-class cabinet filled with business leaders who know what it takes to succeed in a competitive marketplace.\n\nPresident Trump has already signed more bills cutting job-killing regulations than any president in American history already, Pence said, highlighting the more than a dozen pieces legislation taking advantage of the Congressional Review Act to reign in regulations issued by the administrative state.\n\nHe also pointed to President Trump's executive order demanding agencies seek to remove two regulations for each new one they seek. He also touted the long-delayed approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and the role it will play in delivering cheap energy to American business. No matter where you look, President Trump has taken decisive action to get government out of the way so you can do more, create more, innovate more, and grow more jobs, Pence said.\n\nPence was bullish on progress so far, pointing to 500,000 new jobs created so far in calendar-year 2017, which he characterized as driven by small business.\n\nFolks he's just getting started, Pence said of his boss President Trump, turning to the administration's agenda going forward.\n\nWe're gonna pass the largest tax cut in American history. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, Pence boasted, We're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the kind of world class health care they deserve.\n\nThe latter promise has, so far, proven more difficult to bring to fruition than the administration had hoped. Repeated false starts and delays have plagued Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's attempts to get the necessary consensus from his caucus.\n\nPence reiterated his commitment to crossing health care off the administration's checklist. I'm headed to Capitol Hill right after I leave you, he promised, continuing:\n\nIt was about a month ago Congress wasn't quite ready to take that first step to repeal and replace that disastrous policy. But the president remains confident that, with your strong support, and maybe you could talk to a member of Congress before you leave town, that we'll get a fresh start on health care in America … I want to promise you. Working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, President Trump is going to make sure that these majorities and this nation's capitol keep our promise to the American people. We're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to give the American people the ability to purchase health insurance that they want and not what the government dictates and mandates.\n\nAlso notable was Pence's lavish praise for now-official White House adviser Ivanka Trump. He called the First Daughter a Great Leader and a Champion for Small Business, comparing her upbringing in the Trump Organization to his own experience working as an attendant in his father's Indiana gas station.\n\nMore broadly, the vice president praised the vital role small business owners play in the American economy. Every single one of you is a profile in courage. Every single one of you took a risk when you set up shop, he said. When small business is strong, America is strong.
The GOP's failure in the two Georgia Senate races dramatically raises the likelihood that Joe Biden's pro-migration, anti-enforcement nominee will be confirmed as head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), say activists.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden announced in late November he would nominate Cuban-born immigrant Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nHis previous activities as [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services agency] USCIS director should preclude him from getting the job, but with the results in the Georgia race yesterday, it does not appear that that will be an impediment, said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at NumbersUSA. Mayorkas' activities, she said, included delivering valuable green cards to political allies and opposing enforcement of the nation's immigration laws.\n\nThe Democrats' gain of two seats in Georgia leaves the Senate divided 50-50, allowing future Vice President Kamala Harris to break vote ties in favor of Democrats. The Democrats won the two seats after the GOP candidates' turnout fell slightly once President Donald Trump was not on the ballot.\n\nIn December, Mayorkas claimed legalized immigration raises Americans' wages, despite the recognized evidence that migration shifts wages from American workers to migrants, employers, and investors.\n\nJoe Biden's would-be immigration chief says a 'comprehensive' immig. deal would raise wages.\n\nNobody believes that Wall St. cover story – except the people paid to promote it & the estb. journos whose editors don't want them to follow the money.\n\nSee here: https://t.co/t6NqxK7Azv — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 9, 2020\n\nMayorkas has a long record of not enforcing the nation's immigration laws, despite the damage it does to Americans and recent immigrants. President Barack Obama appointed him USCIS director in 2009 and promoted him in 2013 to deputy secretary at DHS, despite no support from GOP Senators.\n\nHe is completely anti-enforcement, not just in terms of blocking fraud investigations, but [is] utterly opposed to enforcement, Jenks said. He believes that the job of USCIS is to hand out green cards, period.\n\nDuring Mayorkas' tenure, he oversaw the inflow of more than 2.5 million Mexican and Central American migrants into U.S. jobs, apartments, and schools. Most Mexican migrants have been sent home, but the vast majority of Central American migrants remained in the United States — and so encouraged a huge migration in 2019.\n\nThat extra wave of migrants further cuts Americans' wages and drives up their rents while forcing more chaotic diversity into American society — but it also boosts Wall Street investors by cutting labor costs and by spiking sales to welfare-aided consumers.\n\nFor example, DHS data posted December 31 shows that 80,711 Central American family migrants arrived at the border in 2016. By March 2020, just 3,578 (3.3 percent) had been sent home, 3,520 (4.1 percent) were allowed to stay, and 45,768 were still being processed.\n\nOverall, there was no confirmed departure for 95.6 percent of the 2016 Central American family arrivals of women with their children, said the DHS report. Many went north to meet husbands who earlier sneaked illegally into the United States.\n\nThe December report also admitted that the DHS has no confirmed departure for 95.5 percent of 6,796 similar arrivals in 2013, for 95.6 percent of the 61,202 arrivals in 2014, and 94.8 percent of the 34,320 arrivals in 2015.\n\nThe Central American deportation numbers show little improvement until 2020, partly because the D.C. establishment strenuously opposed Trump's campaign promise of border security — until Trump threatened trade sanctions with Mexico in 2019. The DHS data shows no confirmed departure for 97.2 percent of the 440,616 Central American family migrants in 2019 — and just 61 percent among the sharply lower 22,056 arrivals in the first three months of fiscal 2020, during October to December 2019.\n\nThe post-2013 arrival of 1.9 million Central American migrants was prompted, in part, by claims from coyotes and cartels that Obama's deputies were allowing migrants into the United States. Obama's deputies, including DHS chief Jeh Johnson, publicly denied the claims even as they allowed the migrants free passage. There is no free pass, Johnson said in June 2014. There are no permisos for children, for your children, who come to the United States.\n\nJust 554,366 of the 1.9 million Central Americans have been deported, even though only 147,333 have been allowed to stay, said the DHS report, which does not offer numbers for people who successfully sneaked across the border.
Facebook has announced that it will remove all content that mentions Stop the Steal, a phrase in reference to the 2020 U.S. presidential election that is popular among supporters of President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Monday, the social media company said it is removing Stop the Steal content from Facebook and Instagram, claiming that such language might incite violence on Inauguration Day, considering the riots that transpired last week on Capitol Hill.\n\nWe are now removing content containing the phrase 'stop the steal' under our Coordinating Harm policy from Facebook and Instagram, said Facebook in a blog post.\n\nWe began preparing for Inauguration Day last year. But our planning took on new urgency after last week's violence in Washington, D.C., and we are treating the next two weeks as a major civic event, the company added.\n\nIn November, Facebook shut down a group called Stop the Steal, which had garnered over 364,000 members.\n\nWe removed the original Stop the Steal group in November and have continued to remove Pages, groups and events that violate any of our policies, including calls for violence, said Facebook.\n\nThe company went on to claim that it is allowing robust conversations related to the election outcome and that will continue.\n\nBut with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday's violence in DC, we're taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration, continued Facebook.\n\nIt may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts, the company added.\n\nOn January 7, Facebook and Instagram locked President Trump out of his accounts indefinitely. Twitter, on the other hand, permanently banned the president from its platform.\n\nOn Monday, an Idaho internet provider announced it is blocking Facebook and Twitter for its customers, stating that it does not condone big tech companies censoring users or trying to exterminate the competition, such as Parler.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, on Parler at @alana, and on Instagram.
CNN's The Lead host Jake Tapper on Tuesday said President Donald Trump's State of the Union address had several lovely moments and noted that he had never seen anything like it.\n\nA partial transcript is as follows:\n\nWOLF BLITZER: It was awkward at the very beginning, Jake. It looked like Nancy Pelosi was ready to shake [President Trump's] hand. He did not respond. In the very end, it looked like she was sort of ripping up the advanced copy of the speech he had presented.\n\nJAKE TAPPER: Yeah, she went to shake his hand. Whether he snubbed her or didn't see, he didn't recuperate. Normally, the speaker of the House will say, To the member of Congress, to the joint session, it is my high honor and distinct pleasure to introduce the president of the United States. Speaker Pelosi just said, Members of Congress, I introduce the President of the United States. She did not include the high honor and distinct pleasure, which was also rather notable.\n\nIt really was striking for a number of reasons, Wolf. One of these, while we are used to since the days of Ronald Reagan, a president going to the people in the first lady's box to illustrate some sort of policy point or some sort of American note, whether it's honor troops or talking about education, we've never seen … a scholarship given, which is what the president did with the young girl from Philadelphia. We've seen the type of thing where a war hero like Tuskegee Airman Gen. McGee. That was a lovely moment. To have a 100-year-old Tuskegee Airman there with his grandson, who wants to be in the Space Force. President Trump telling a little girl that she's going to get a scholarship, President Trump announcing that there is a solider coming home and reuniting with his wife and children, we've never seen anything like that before.
Steven Brill, the founder of Court TV and the American Lawyer, discussed his new book Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America's Fifty-Year Fall and Those Fighting to Reverse It with SiriusXM hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Tonight.\n\nWe basically got too much of a good thing, said Brill, describing the premise of his new book and his cover essay for TIME magazine's May 28 issue. What I mean by that is the kinds of core American values that we cherish were kind of hijacked and have been used and turned against us.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nFor example, meritocracy, he continued. Everybody loves meritocracy, right? I'm a beneficiary of meritocracy. I got a scholarship to Yale at a time that was a really new thing, that Ivy League schools gave people like me scholarships. But what that created was a generation of much smarter knowledge workers at the same time that the knowledge economy was replacing the factory economy.\n\nThe knowledge workers went to work for large law firms or investment banks, and they used the First Amendment — another great American value — to allow money to dominate the political system, he said.\n\nOne of the offshoots of that is when it came to globalization, which is another sign of progress in the world — or it would seem to be — they basically didn't pay any attention to all the people who were the victims of globalization. Every other country across the world has job retraining programs so the middle class isn't left out in the cold when we make a trade deal, whether it's with China or anybody else, said Brill.\n\nWe paid lip service to that through something called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which for 40 years running, through the Kennedy administration and the Nixon administration, Carter, all the way on down, has been a total fiasco. No one paid attention because the people who were supposed to be the beneficiaries of that program were largely in the middle of the country. Over the last 40 years, there have been exactly two articles written in any significant newspaper about how that program was not working, he said.\n\nBrill believes this explains the elite surprise that a supposedly long-settled issue like the North American Free Trade Agreement could return to the forefront.\n\nI happen to think that things like NAFTA are good if, and only if, you take care of the victims of NAFTA, he said.\n\nNAFTA and all kinds of international trade have a lot of benefits in the United States, he noted. We pay a lot less for televisions. We pay a lot less for clothing. But if we're all enjoying that while this big swath of the country are victims of it, that's not the way our country is supposed to work. We're all supposed to be in this together.\n\nBrill described a protected class that is insulated from the decrepit state of the social safety net because it does not rely on government for essential benefits and has minimal contact with enforcement agencies like the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThey don't depend on the public education system. They don't depend on mass transit. They don't care if civil servants are unresponsive and aren't doing their jobs because they don't depend on the government, he said, citing the example of elite New Yorkers who suddenly became deeply concerned about the poor state of jury facilities after generous exemptions from jury duty were eliminated in the 1990s.\n\nThe Vietnam War really changed when we got rid of deferments for college students because suddenly middle-class and upper-class kids were subject to a draft, he added. The people who run things don't care about the teachers' unions who are protected because they're either politicians in cities where the Democrats dominate and the teachers' unions dominate the primaries on those cities or because they're sending their kids to private schools anyway.\n\nBrill said the economic reconfiguration and displacements of the past few decades have broadened the gap between the protected class and the rest of the country.\n\nThe things that the economy values become things that these knowledge workers do, he said. The lawyers figure out strategies for corporate takeover fights instead of strategies for corporations to employ more workers and make new things. They figure out strategies for stock buybacks. They figure out derivatives, which as you know ended up completely crashing the economy. The people behind it were not held accountable. The people who lost their homes were the ones who suffered and who lost their jobs.\n\nEverything started to change when we became less of a community; and when we put a value on things like legal engineering and financial engineering; and when we did things in the name of democracy such as reforming the primary selection system so that everyone now has a direct primary, so therefore they tend to run to favor the people who are giving them money and to favor the political base. That just pushes people apart, he said.\n\nEven progress in media technology totally changed things, he continued. In the 1940s and 50s and 60s, the invention of radio and television actually brought the country together. The whole country listened to FDR's fireside chats or listened to Edward R. Murrow reporting about World War 2. We watched the moon landing together. We watched the Kennedy assassination and the funeral together. We did everything together and we saw the same events.\n\nNow there were problems with that because half a dozen media companies basically had a monopoly on all the news, he conceded. That was a problem, but look at the problem we have today, where all the advances in technology have tended to split us apart.\n\nBrill lamented the loss of government focus on developing common infrastructure, which enjoyed its heyday in the 60s and 70s.\n\nWe were investing in the future, and then Congress became so polarized that it became impossible for Democrats to want to give a Republican president any kind of victory or progress, and it became impossible for Republicans to want to give the Democrats anything — not even building a bridge or repairing roads, which should be as American as apple pie, he said.\n\nThe interstate highway system is a good example of something good getting done in Washington, Brill proposed. You get a train in the United States versus a train in Europe, and there's a reason for the difference. The difference is that we haven't raised the gasoline tax since President Reagan raised it. The gasoline tax has actually gone down because it's 18 cents a gallon, and it was 18 cents a gallon when cars were getting six or seven miles to the gallon. It's now 18 cents a gallon when cars are getting three or four times that much.\n\nPollak objected that the experience of California's high gas taxes has demonstrated it is a regressive tax that hits working people the hardest.\n\nIt is, Brill agreed. There ought to be tax relief for people in income categories or in job categories that have a special need for gasoline.\n\nHe also agreed with Mansour's point that much of the vast sum appropriated by the government for infrastructure, notably including President Barack Obama's massive 2009 stimulus bill, simply disappears into the bureaucracy with little tangible benefit for the American people.\n\nLet me give you another example: the Veterans Administration, Brill responded. Remember the scandals in 2013 and 14 about the waiting lists? The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has been writing reports — if you can believe it — since the 1980s saying that the Veterans Administration was in shambles, the waiting lists were a huge problem, the computer technology didn't work, and people were covering up how long it was taking for people to get their treatment at VA hospitals. That's since the 1980s.\n\nThe woman who was found in Phoenix to have doctored the lists, they tried to fire her, and under civil service rules she was able to appeal, he recalled. She hired a lawyer, there are all kinds of law firms that specialize in protecting civil servants. The appeals judge in what's called the Merit System Protections Board, if you can believe it, ruled that even though she was in charge of the hospital, she wasn't really directly responsible for this, so she couldn't be fired. In fact, she got a merit bonus that year.\n\nMansour applauded the theory Brill advanced in Tailspin that Hillary Clinton became the avatar of our malfunctioning meritocracy, so voters turned from her to Donald Trump in revolt.\n\nShe's the epitome of meritocracy. I mean, first-generation wealth, Wellesley, Yale Law School, always prepared, always does her homework, articulate, perfectly spoken — but also perceived as cold and calculating, Brill said.\n\nTrump was the opposite. He shoots from the hip. He takes pride in not being prepared. He's just the total opposite person from Hillary Clinton. 46 percent of the public liked that and voted for him, he said.\n\nPollak suggested that Trump's election can also be seen as a revolt against the lavish idealism of the 60s and the enormous government, attended by an equally large managerial class, that resulted from it.\n\nBrill said he disagreed with that premise because you can look across government, whether it's local, state, or federal, and find programs that do work.\n\nYou can look at what happens in other countries where programs and policies like, for example, different policies on health care — which you and I probably disagree about — do work, he told Pollak.\n\nI don't think it's uniformly the fault of government. It's uniformly the fault of the people who are running government, who are not accountable because of gerrymandering and political money and everything else, he said.\n\nIt's not the liberals who started these programs, and in fact, a lot of these programs have been cut back, he asserted. For example, housing assistance to the poor and lower middle class, that's about a fourth of our housing assistance budget in the federal government. The other three-fourths is involved with giving interest deductions to the upper middle class and the rich on their mortgages. That's the biggest housing subsidy we do. That's just not fair.\n\nBrill described mortgage derivatives as originally a well-intentioned way for banks to package the mortgages that these homeowners now owed to them, sell them off to other investors, and then take the money and give out more mortgages.\n\nThat created a housing boom for the middle class because mortgage interest rates went down and more money was available. That was an unalloyed good thing until it got taken way, way too far and became these crazy financial instruments that farmed out the risks to people all over the world who had no idea what these securities were, or what the risks were. That's how we got the crash, he said.\n\nWhat started out as a good thing became much too much of a good thing, he said. There are a lot of parallels like that. There are a lot of boomerangs. The Citizens United case, whatever you think of it, it was started, the legal road to Citizens United, was started by guess who? Ralph Nader.\n\nIt seemed like a good idea at the time, Brill remarked. What Ralph Nader and his lawyers did was, there were some discount pharmacies in Virginia who wanted to advertise their discount prices. To us consumers, that's a good thing. We'd see that you could buy the drugs at a discount price somewhere.\n\nWell, the large pharmacies in Virginia banded together and lobbied and got the state to pass a law saying you can't advertise the price of drugs, he related. Ralph Nader brought a case saying, well, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. In this case, the listeners were consumers of drugs who would benefit from that speech, so why are you stopping it just because the speaker is a corporation, i.e. a drug store?\n\nThe Supreme Court said, yeah, you're right, the First Amendment is for listeners as well as speakers. That then got extended to every form of speech and every restriction on speech. Why would you want to limit political contributions if that just creates more speech about political debates and political candidates? he said.\n\nI actually think they're right about that, but I think we need some kind of constitutional amendment that stops the corruption of money in politics, Brill added. We have congresspeople of both parties spending five hours a day, every weekday, dialing for dollars. That cannot be what the Founders had in mind.\n\nBrill applauded the work of groups such as the Bipartisan Policy Center, which he described as rabid avid Republicans and rabid avid Democrats who meet and actually try to solve problems.\n\nThey created some proposed fixes to NAFTA, for example, he said. Their premise is that people of good faith on both sides actually can get back to the business of coming up with solutions in this country instead of saying, 'Well, if it's a Republican idea, we hate it because we're Democrats, and if it's a Democrat idea, we hate it because we're Republicans.'\n\nThe best example of that, and I'm sure you may disagree with me with this one, is the reason the Republicans could not come up with an alternative to Obamacare is that Obamacare, as I write in the book, was for years the Republican idea for how to reform health care, he said.\n\nTed Kennedy was talking about single payer in the 1970s, and Nixon proposed a plan that was almost exactly like Obamacare: you subsidize people to get insurance, you require them to get insurance, the whole nine yards — except it was more liberal than Obamacare. That was the Nixon answer to Ted Kennedy, he recalled.\n\nNo Democrat wants to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Trump signs anything, and no Republican wanted to go to a signing ceremony in the White House where President Obama signed anything, Brill said, returning to his main thesis.\n\nThat is a total reverse of most of the history of this country, he said.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern.
California Democrats are reportedly pushing to give full healthcare benefits to illegal immigrant adults, which would mean that the Golden State not only may have to raise taxes but will also be a magnet for even more illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to a Monday Politico report, state Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) is leading the charge by reportedly arguing that California needs to be a laboratory for social change by taking the lead on progressive causes.\n\nWe are trying to address the fact that, whether you like it or not, our undocumented community needs the care, and we are paying for it anyway, he reportedly said.\n\nPolitico points out that California Democrats are trying to extend the state's Medi-Cal program this legislative session to nearly 1.2 million illegal immigrant adults who would qualify for it, and companion bills in the state Assembly and Senate have already passed their respective health committees with party-line votes.\n\nThe cost to expand Medicaid coverage to adult illegal immigrants in California is reportedly projected to cost $3 billion annually.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown, who extended Medi-Cal coverage to illegal immigrant children in 2015, has not commented on the pending measures but is required by law to sign or veto bills passed this session by Sept. 30, just five weeks before the midterm elections.\n\nPolitical and health analysts are reportedly astounded that Democrats are trying to extend healthcare benefits to illegal immigrants before this year's important midterm elections, reportedly saying that the measure would give Republicans in California relevance they would never have before in an election cycle in which House races in California could decide which party controls Congress.\n\nPaul Ginsburg, director of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, told Politico that the proposal would be fiscally very dangerous and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford physician and health economist, suggested to the outlet that such a plan would have to be paid for with tax increases.\n\nBhattacharya also pointed out the obvious—giving full healthcare coverage to illegal immigrant adults will make California, which is already an official sanctuary state, even a greater magnet for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe illegal immigrant who murdered Kate Steinle, for instance, told authorities that he came to San Francisco after being previously deported five times because he knew San Francisco was proudly a sanctuary city.\n\nIf you make a program like this available, undocumented workers in other states might be attracted to California because of this, Bhattacharya, the Stanford physician, reportedly said.
Fewer than one in five Italians (19 percent) would like the government to reopen the country's closed ports to migrants, according to a poll released Friday.\n\nOnly 12 percent of those surveyed say that it is the responsibility of individual states in whose territorial waters the migrant ships have arrived to resolve the situation. The survey commissioned by the Italian daily Corriere della Sera revealed that 60 percent said that in these cases it is the responsibility of the European Union (EU), while 13 percent said the duty lies with the NGO vessels that took the migrants aboard in the first place.\n\nThe issue of migration has returned to the political foreground in Italy with the ongoing saga of the two vessels operated by the NGOs Sea Watch and Sea Eye. The story has highlighted tensions in relations with the EU and other international organizations such as the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).\n\nA significant majority of Italians (64 percent) are favourable to the Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini's decision to close the country's ports. Of these, 80 percent want the government to stand by its absolute ban on new migrant landings even in the case of the vessels Sea Watch and Sea Eye, while the other 20 percent think an exception should be made for these 49 migrants.\n\nThe closure of ports is the prevailing option among all social segments regardless of gender, age, educational qualifications, employment status, or religious faith, including Catholics who regularly attend mass, the poll found.\n\nIn its analysis of the survey, Corriere della Sera said Italians continue to fear the uncontrolled mass immigration experienced in recent years and also resent what seemed to many a betrayal by the EU in failing to come to their assistance.\n\nSurvey: 78 Percent of Europeans Want Tighter Control of Borders https://t.co/1Ynx8em6Te — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2018\n\nA poll conducted last February covering all 28 EU nations revealed an overwhelming concern over illegal immigration with more than three-quarters of EU citizens saying that Europe's external borders should be better protected.\n\nThe survey conducted by the Századvég Foundation's Project 28 sampled one thousand adult citizens from each of the 28 EU countries, and found a remarkable consistency of thought regarding the dangers of unchecked immigration.\n\nWhat is most striking about the survey, wrote the Spectator's Douglas Murray, is that there is such extraordinary unanimity around the question of immigration.\n\nImmigration policy is emerging as the central issue of interest in the upcoming campaign ahead of the May 26th European Parliament elections.\n\n'European Spring': Italy's Salvini Building Alliance with Poland to 'Save Europe' https://t.co/xzGorcTRIb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 10, 2019\n\nFollow Thomas D.

The New York Times has never been a big fan of Israel, or non-assimilated and non-leftist Jews for that matter. But it's hard to escape the impression that the Times has decided to intensify its hostile stance towards Israel, Israeli Jews, and American Jews who support Israel.\n\nThese efforts take two forms.\n\nFirst, the Times whitewashes Israel's enemies.\n\nLast month, the paper published a paean to Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese terror army, which controls Lebanon and remains the most powerful and dangerous terror organization in the world.\n\nIn an article ostensibly about Christmas celebrations in Beirut, the paper singled out Hezbollah for praise for its permissive stance on observing the Christian holy day.\n\nNoting wistfully that because of financial constraints, the terror group ditched its past practice of dispatching a Santa to give out gifts in Christian neighborhoods, the Times lauded Hezbollah, which seeks the annihilation of world Jewry and has seeded terror cells across the globe, because it sent representatives to a Christmas concert sponsored by Iran.\n\nThe presence of Lebanese terror operatives at the festival, sponsored by their Iranian state sponsor, the Times cooed, demonstrate Hezbollah's inclusivity as a major political and military force in Lebanese society and … highlight its political alliances with Christian parties.\n\nOwing to Hezbollah's effective control over the Lebanese state and military, Lebanon's Christian President Michel Aoun and his fellow Christian politicians serve as Hezbollah's underlings.\n\nThe Times' willingness to disseminate pro-Hezbollah propaganda may have represented a new low in its advocacy for terror groups. But arguably, the Times' decision to champion the most powerful non-state actor in the world — with one of the world's largest missile arsenals, all pointing at Israel — is not the worst aspect of its coverage.\n\nWhat may be worse is the Times' campaign to effectively disenfranchise American Jews. The paper undertakes this campaign by using its pages to legitimize antisemitism emanating from the left, delegitimize friends of Jews on the political right, and shame American Jews who stubbornly refuse to abandon Israel, or turn their back on Israel's friends. These American Jews also impertinently notice the galloping Jew hatred on the political left.\n\nThis move by the Times is more dangerous because it is more difficult to criticize. It is easy to spot apologetics for terrorism. It is harder, and more controversial, to call the Times out for manipulating American Jews in the service of left-wing antisemites.\n\nThe Times' influence operation against American Jews and American Jewish supporters of Israel is being carried out – conveniently enough — by its Jewish columnists. These writers run the gamut from far-leftists to neo-liberal former conservatives in the Never Trump camp.\n\nFar-left Times columnist Michele Goldberg has a prolific record of anti-Israel writing. So it wasn't much of a surprise when, on December 8, she published an article arguing that it isn't antisemitic to reject the Jewish people's right to self-determination and political freedom in their homeland.\n\nGoldberg insisted that the Jewish people's right to self-determination is contingent on Israel's satisfaction of the Palestinians' demands and its appeasement of the left's ever-expanding list of grievances. Israel is guilty of a raft of sins, she alleged — from failing to give the Palestinians a state (despite the fact that the Palestinians have rejected every offer of statehood Israel has put forward); to standing with right-wing European governments – which stand with Israel; to supporting President Donald Trump – who supports Israel; to cultivating good relations with Saudi Arabia – which is supposed to be the point of peace processes Goldberg and her comrades supposedly want to advance.\n\nGiven Israel's deplorable, unforgivable behavior, Goldberg argues that rejecting its right to exist and implementing discriminatory boycotts against Israeli Jewish products is reasonable and justified, not discriminatory and bigoted.\n\nNewly sworn in members of Congress Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) are not antisemites for supporting Israel's annihilation and for denouncing its supporters as disloyal Americans, Goldberg wrote.\n\nThe next blow came from columnist Bret Stephens. Stephens has a record of pro-Israel positions stemming back from his tenure as Jerusalem Post editor from 2002-2004. Now a vocal member of the Never Trump clique, Stephens, who has abandoned several of his formerly held positions to advocate against the president, published an intellectually dubious article on December 26 titled Donald Trump is bad for Israel.\n\nIn it, Stephens insisted that all of Trump's pro-Israel policies are basically meaningless. Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem; scrapping the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran; reinstating crippling economic sanctions on the Iranian regime; defunding the Palestinian Authority and UN agencies devoted to the perpetuation of Palestinian suffering and hatred for Israel — these are all meaningless gestures, by Stephens's telling.\n\nAnd whatever marginally positive effect these policies may have had on Israel's international position pales in comparison to the damage Trump has allegedlycaused Israel through his failure to support what Stephens refers to as the liberal international order against totalitarian states, and his preference for a purely transactional foreign policy based on the needs of the moment or the whims of the president.\n\nStephens's apparent purpose in publishing his column was to shame Jews who support Trump because of his friendship and support for Israel.\n\nStephens's colleague, Bari Weiss, makes a similar argument. Together with Stephens, Weiss has watered down her support for Israel since she moved with Stephens to the Times from the Wall Street Journal in 2017.\n\nIn a stunning appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher in November, Weiss insisted that Jews who support Trump because they like his policies on Israel and the Middle East are betraying the values that have sustained the Jewish people.\n\nTo date, the height of the Times' onslaught against Jews – Israeli and American – who think that actual pro-Israel policies are more meaningful than abstract concepts, and believe that it is antisemitic to argue that Jews are uniquely unworthy of self-determination — came last week. On January 4, the Times' deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman published an essay titled, American Jews and Israeli Jews are headed for a messy breakup.\n\nAlthough presented as a news analysis, Weisman's article was really a threat against Israeli Jews and the American Jews who support them, and a diatribe against Judaism as it has been practiced for thousands of years.\n\nWeisman first received national attention in September 2015 when he published a news analysis of lawmakers who opposed Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. Weisman inserted a table in the analysis that highlighted the names of Jewish lawmakers who opposed the deal in yellow. He specifically categorized them as Jews. Also highlighted in yellow was the percentage of Jews residing in states and Congressional districts of lawmakers who opposed the nuclear deal.\n\nFollowing the 2016 presidential election, Weisman wrote a book which purported to be about anti-Semitism titled, (((Semitism))): Being Jewish in America in the Age of Trump.\n\nWeisman did three things in his book. He used the presence of antisemitism on the right as a means to castigate the entire Republican party and conservative movement as antisemitic. He ignored and dismissed antisemitism on the Left. And finally, Weisman attacked Judaism, Jews who observe Judaism, and Jews who support Israel.\n\nWeisman accused pro-Israel American Jews of disloyalty to America, arguing, The American Jewish obsession with Israel has taken our eyes off not only the politics of our own country, the growing gulf between rich and poor, and the rising tide of nationalism but also our own grounding in faith.\n\nWeisman's January 4 article in the Times was an amplification of the arguments he made in his book. Again he ignored left wing anti-Semitism. He regurgitated Goldberg's allegations of Israeli moral infirmity. He defended Tlaib and Omar and their hatred for Israel. And thne, Weisman insisted that American Jewry should forget its ties to Jewish tradition and to the Jewish people and instead embrace an identity based entirely on leftist ideology and propaganda.\n\nIn his words, American Jewry has been going its own way for 150 years, a drift that has created something of a new religion, or at least a new branch of one of the world's most ancient faiths.\n\nIt is hard to know how influential the Times' ever-escalating campaign against Jews will be on the American Jewish community. Survey results and other data indicate that the vast majority of American Jews are not buying the claim that Israel is morally infirm, incapable of discerning its national interest, and deserving of hatred and destruction.\n\nMost American Jews don't think that American Jews should tell Israel how to handle the security and other challenges it faces. And even as anti-Israel groups in the American Jewish community receive adulation and attention disproportionate to their small numbers, they do not seem to have built major inroads into the Jewish community. This explains why their efforts are directed towards weakening existing Jewish institutions rather than building their own. Their constituencies are too small to support them.\n\nBut whether the New York Times succeeds or fails in its campaign to mainstream leftist antisemitism, shame pro-Israel American Jews, and detach the Jewish community in the U.S. from Israel and the rest of the Jewish world, it is worth taking note of, and condemning, what the newspaper is attempting to do.\n\nCaroline Glick is a world-renowned journalist and commentator on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, and the author of The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East.

On Monday's broadcast of MSNBC's All In, House Intelligence Committee member Mike Quigley (D-IL) declared that he believes President Trump has been compromised.\n\nQuigley said, The fact that Deutsche Bank was the only bank that would do business with the president before he was elected, was also the bank that laundered money for the Russians, the fact that the president slow-rolled out sanctions against the Russians, the fact that he would rather trust a foreign adversary, President Putin, over his entire intelligence community, he fired Sessions and Comey, there are no coincidences. I believe the president of the United States has been compromised. Whether he made all of these extraordinary policy decisions based on bad policy choices, or they were — he was compromised, must be the subject of the investigation.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Despite the efforts of European nations to tighten their borders, one million Syrian migrants are set to arrive in the continent over the coming year, a Middle East analyst has said.\n\nThe figure would be double that of last year, when around 500,000 people crossed from the war-torn nation into Europe, making up one of the largest constituencies of the migrant crisis.\n\nSpeaking to German magazine Der Spiegel, Fabrice Blanche, research director at the University of Lyon and visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that ongoing battles for Aleppo are affecting some two million people, while people are also fleeing relatively peaceful cities due to the deteriorating economic situation.\n\nAdd to that the number of people who are travelling to Europe to join family members who are already in the continent, and we can expect to see one million new arrivals from Syria if the current trend contines, Mr Blanche said.\n\nLast month Gerd Müller, Germany's Development Minister, warned that only a tenth of potential migrants from Syria and Iraq had reached Europe so far, and even more were to come from North Africa, with the figure reaching up to 10 million.\n\nThe biggest movements are ahead: Africa's population will double in the coming decades, he said in an interview. In the Sahara up to one million people have died trying to escape.\n\nThe huge influx would almost certainly lead to the end of the Schengen visa-free travel zone, and the European Commission is losing its credibility over the crisis, he added.\n\nThe protection of external borders is not working. Schengen has collapsed. A fair distribution of refugees has not taken place.\n\nHis comments echoed those of Social Democrat MP Heinz Buschkowsky who said in November that Germany faces an avalanche of migrants, and should expect up to 10 million by 2020 if current trends continue.\n\nThis influx, he said, would change the country forever.\n\nThe situation is irreversible. The people who are here now, this society is challenged to integrate them and to offer them a perspective on life.
The president of the European Commission has recommended member states enact entry restrictions to the European Union for 30 days due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen made the proposal on Monday, saying: As I have just informed our G7 partners, I propose to the heads of state and government to introduce a temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the European Union. These travel restrictions should be in place for an initial period of 30 days, which can be prolonged as necessary.\n\nThe four non-EU members of the Schengen visa-free zone — Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein — were also asked to enact travel restrictions.\n\nMrs von der Leyen outlined exemptions, including long-term residents of the EU and family members of EU nationals, people transporting goods, frontier workers who travel from other non-EU countries to work, and diplomats. Essential medical and scientific researchers working on fighting the virus are also encouraged to continue to come to the European Union.\n\nHowever, these are, at best, recommendations as ultimately it is the 27-member states who can decide who can enter their countries. Further, several countries have already enacted strict border controls, the latest being central European state Hungary and the home nation of von der Leyen, Germany.\n\nThe European powerhouse announced that as of Monday evening, it will close borders with five of its neighbouring countries — Austria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland — to help halt the spread of the disease across national borders.\n\n'Open Borders' Germany Closes Borders With Five Countries As Coronavirus Cases Jump 1,000 in 24 Hours https://t.co/rDt1GYCvOs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 16, 2020\n\nCommission President von der Leyen, however, did not call for the halt to the internal movement of people within the bloc. On Sunday, she had said that protecting people's health should not result in blocking goods and the movement of essential staff across the bloc, and that Free Movement must be maintained to keep our internal market going.\n\nStill reluctant to recommend countries self-isolate to lessen the spread of the virus, the European Commission, however, told the EU27 on Monday that Member States may reintroduce internal border controls for reasons of public policy, which, in extremely critical situations, may include public health.\n\nThe announcement came after an emergency meeting of the G7 via videoconference to discuss the global responses to COVID-19 which was announced on Friday. The emergency meeting — comprised of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan with the EU as an 'eighth' member — came after U.S. President Donald Trump had banned entry to foreign travellers from the Schengen Zone.\n\nPresident Trump had said: The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots… As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\n\nThe President had initially exempted the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland from the ban, as neither are in Schengen, but both have since been added to the ban.\n\nDespite criticisms over the handling of coronavirus, the UK has not as yet enacted similar entry bans to those of either the U.S. or even EU. Boris Johnson's transport minister appeared to criticise other countries' decision to lock down their borders, with Grant Shapps telling Sky News on Monday: We are just being entirely science-led, we're not doing the things that are happening elsewhere just because it seems like a popularist [sic] thing to do.
Immigration and the care of migrants should be put on the front burner and not considered a second-tier issue, Pope Francis has insisted in a new teaching letter released Monday morning in the Vatican.\n\nIn his 44-page apostolic exhortation bearing the Latin title Gaudete et Exsultate (Rejoice and Be Glad), the pope said that Christians have no right to treat the plight of migrants as a minor moral issue because Jesus commanded his followers to welcome the stranger.\n\nWe often hear it said that, with respect to relativism and the flaws of our present world, the situation of migrants, for example, is a lesser issue, Francis wrote. Some Catholics consider it a secondary issue compared to the 'grave' bioethical questions.\n\nThat a politician looking for votes might say such a thing is understandable, but not a Christian, for whom the only proper attitude is to stand in the shoes of those brothers and sisters of ours who risk their lives to offer a future to their children, he continued.\n\nCan we not realize that this is exactly what Jesus demands of us, when he tells us that in welcoming the stranger we welcome him? he asked.\n\nThe pontiff defended his continual insistence on the issue of migration by saying it was not just his pet cause but a central teaching of the bible.\n\nThis is not a notion invented by some Pope, or a momentary fad. In today's world too, we are called to follow the path of spiritual wisdom proposed by the prophet Isaiah to show what is pleasing to God, he said.\n\nQuoting from the Old Testament books of Exodus and Leviticus, Francis said that oppressing strangers is contrary to God's will.\n\nIn his letter, the pope does not descend to the level of practical public policy concerning immigration, and elsewhere in the text criticizes groups of Christians who give excessive importance to certain rules, customs or ways of acting, as if only one viewpoint were acceptable. In this regard he allows for a plurality of possible solutions under the virtue of prudence.\n\nWelcoming the stranger is not a problem for politicians to sort out but the task of every Christian in day to day life, he suggests.\n\nIn his insightful exploration of the topic of immigration in the Old Testament, the great medieval scholar Saint Thomas Aquinas noted that every nation has the right to determine who can be allowed to migrate to it and to establish immigration policies accordingly.\n\nAquinas analyzed how the ancient Israelites actually applied in practice God's commandment to welcome the stranger, noting that the Jewish people of Old Testament times did not admit visitors from all nations equally, since those peoples closer to them were more quickly integrated into the population than those who were not as close.\n\nPeople emigrating from certain nations were not admitted into Israel at all due to their hostility toward the Jewish people and culture.\n\nCitizens of nations with whom their relations had been hostile, such as the Ammonites and Moabites, were never to be admitted to citizenship, he observed.\n\nThe Amalekites, who were yet more hostile to them, and had no fellowship of kindred with them, were to be held as foes in perpetuity, Aquinas added.\n\nIn his nuanced commentary, Aquinas also distinguished among three types of strangers in the Israel of the Old Testament.\n\nFirst were the foreigners who passed through their land as travelers, much like modern day visitors with a travel visa.\n\nSecond were those who came to dwell in their land as newcomers, seemingly corresponding to resident aliens, living in the land but without the full benefits of citizenship.\n\nA third case involved those foreigners who wished to be admitted entirely to their fellowship and mode of worship. Even here, dealing with those who wished to integrate fully into the life and worship of Israel required a certain order, Aquinas observed. For they were not at once admitted to citizenship: just as it was law with some nations that no one was deemed a citizen except after two or three generations.\n\nThe reason for this was that if foreigners were allowed to meddle with the affairs of a nation as soon as they settled down in its midst, Aquinas argued, many dangers might occur, since the foreigners not yet having the common good firmly at heart might attempt something hurtful to the people.\n\nIn other words, Aquinas taught that total integration of immigrants into the life, language, customs and culture (including worship, in this case) was necessary for full citizenship.\n\nIn his analysis of the issue of immigration in the Old Testament, Aquinas avoided the common error of focusing solely on the rights of immigrants without taking into account the common good and safety of the host nation, in this case Israel itself and its citizens.\n\nOne thing that was absolutely clear for Aquinas was that the host nation itself had the right and the duty to legislate immigration in such a way that it was of benefit not only to the strangers seeking admittance, but to the receiving nation as well.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

U.S. small-business optimism unexpectedly slumped in December to a seven-month low as owners grew increasingly concerned about the new economic policy of the incoming Biden administration and the spread of coronavirus infections triggered renewed restrictions.\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business said Tuesday that its index of sentiment declined by 5.5 points to 95.9.\n\nThe result was a sharp decline from last month's 101.4 and weaker than the median forecast of 102 in Econoday's survey of economists.\n\nThis month's drop in small business optimism is historically very large and most of the decline was due to the outlook of sales and business conditions in 2021, said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg.\n\nNine of the 10 index components declined and only one—the gauge of current inventory—improved. Owners expecting better business conditions over the next six months dropped sharply, falling 24 points to a net negative 16 percent.\n\nThe share of owners thinking it's a good time to expand fell four points to eight percent. Sales expectations over the next three months dropped 14 points to a net negative 4 percent. Plans to grow payrolls fell four points to 22 percent.\n\nSmall businesses are concerned about potential new economic policy in the new administration and the increased spread of COVID-19 that is causing renewed government-mandated business closures across the nation, Dunkelberg said.
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is warning that former Vice President Joe Biden could face impeachment over his son's dealings in Ukraine if elected in 2020.\n\nErnst, a first term lawmaker who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Bloomberg News on Sunday that the door for impeachment has been opened. In particular, the Iowa lawmaker cited Biden's role in overseeing Obama administration policy toward Ukraine, while his son, Hunter, was simultaneously serving on the board of directors of one of the country's largest natural gas conglomerates. Ernst said:\n\nJoe Biden should be very careful what he's asking for because, you know, we can have a situation where, if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people – right the day after he would be elected – would be saying, 'Well, we're going to impeach him,' Ernst said.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hunter Biden's wheeling and dealing in Ukraine is at the center of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Congressional Democrats claim that the president committed a crime when he suggested Ukraine look into how Hunter Biden secured his position with Burisma. Trump's allies have countered that Hunter Biden's role with the company was rife with potential conflicts of interests for his father.\n\nThe younger Biden joined Burisma's board of directors in May 2014, around the same time his father was tapped as the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine in response to Russia's invasion of Crimea. Despite having no background in either eastern Europe or the energy industry, Hunter was paid as much $83,000-per-month for his services.\n\nAs Peter Schweizer detailed in Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden's background in banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of Burisma's board.\n\nAdding to concerns was that he joined the company at a time when it was actively courting western leaders to prevent scrutiny of its business practices. The same month of the appointment, Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma's founder, had his assets frozen in the United Kingdom on suspicion of money laundering.\n\nA Ukrainian official with ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October 2019 the only reason Hunter Biden was tapped to join with Burisma was to protect the company from foreign scrutiny.\n\nIt is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky's legal troubles that Joe Biden's influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016.\n\nJoe Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than $1 billion in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor's ability to tackle corruption.\n\nUnofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin's successor, who is now himself being investigated for public corruption, dropped the investigation into Burisma.\n\nAfter the investigation into Burisma was closed, Hunter Biden remained on Burisma's board until his term expired in April 2019. During his tenure, Burisma wired millions of dollars to a Morgan Stanley bank account controlled by the younger Biden and his business associates. Between November 2014 and November 2015 alone, Burisma transferred more than $3.5 million to the account.\n\nGiven the history, Ernst believes there is enough evidence to warrant impeachment proceedings were the former vice president to be elected.\n\nThe Iowa Republican told lawmakers the reasoning had to deal with Joe Biden being assigned to take on Ukrainian corruption yet turning a blind eye to Burisma because his son was on the board making over a million dollars a year.
A 2018 strategy document from the National Security Council (NSC), declassified many years ahead of schedule Tuesday, outlined the Trump administration's strategy for the Indo-Pacific region, including the U.S. strategic framework for containing Chinese ambitions in the region.\n\nAustralia's ABC News theorized that the document, which was not due for declassification until 2043, was made public with such extraordinary speed in an effort to keep American strategy consistent through the next administration:\n\nThis is a highly significant document. It's extraordinary that it's been released decades early, Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at ANU, said. I think it's a signal about the kind of continuity that the permanent government of America, or if you like the officials, want to see in America's relations with the Indo-Pacific, including in managing China's power. Washington sources familiar with the development of the strategy say Australia had a significant influence on the document, as did Japan.\n\nOne of ABC's sources said the document was released in order to reassure U.S. allies that we are not fading away, but doubling down in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) less charitably speculated the document was published by the permanent strategic policy bureaucracy in Washington to reassure the public that beneath President Donald Trump's unpredictability, conceit and unilateralism, the policy professionals were striving to advance a more serious and coherent agenda.\n\nThe lead author of the 2018 document was then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster. The decision to declassify the document early came from current National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, who said he was releasing the United States Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific to communicate to the American people and to our allies and partners, the enduring commitment of the United States to keeping the Indo-Pacific region free and open long into the future.\n\nO'Brien said President Donald Trump's 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) recognized the most consequential challenge to the interests of the United States, and those of our allies and partners, is the growing rivalry between free and repressive visions of the future.\n\nThe Framework recognizes that a free and open Indo-Pacific depends on robust American leadership. The United States has a long history of fighting back against repressive regimes on behalf of those who value freedom and openness. As the world's largest economy, with the strongest military and a vibrant democracy, it is incumbent on the United States to lead from the front, he declared.\n\nO'Brien stressed the importance of coordinating strategy with America's partners in the region and said the U.S. strategic framework was developed in harmony with the regional strategies of Australia, Japan, India, South Korea, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). He quoted President Trump describing the Indo-Pacific in 2017 as a beautiful constellation of nations, each with its own bright star, satellites to none — and each one, a people, a culture, a way of life, and a home.\n\nSome parts of the Framework are redacted, but the available text makes it clear that containing China without aggressively confronting it, and perhaps sparking a wider regional conflict, was a major strategic goal. Protecting Taiwan, preserving free and open access to the Indo-Pacific region, and containing the nuclear threat posed by China's clients in North Korea were outlined as major goals, even as the strategic document recognized that the balance of powers in the Indo-Pacific is inexorably shifting.\n\nStrategic competition between the United States and China will persist, owing to the divergent nature and goals of international rules and norms to gain an advantage. China will circumvent international rules and norms to gain an advantage, the 2017 strategy framework warned.\n\nChinese economic, diplomatic, and military influence will continue to increase in the near-term and challenge the U.S. ability to achieve its national interests in the Indo-Pacific region, it continued.\n\nThe Framework's most unsettling passages concerned the ideological and political threats posed by China's growing influence over the digital realm, reaching far beyond the Indo-Pacific region:\n\nChina seeks to dominate cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and bio-genetics, and harness them in the service of authoritarianism. Chinese dominance in these technologies would pose profound challenges to free societies. China's proliferation of its digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations will damage U.S. efforts to promote our values and national interests in the Indo-Pacific region and, increasingly, in the Western hemisphere and at home.\n\nThe Framework suggested developing India as a counter to Chinese political, economic, military, and cyberspace influence, and making all necessary investments to hold ASEAN together as an alliance against Chinese aggression. The importance of protecting U.S. and allied technology from Chinese intellectual property theft was heavily stressed.\n\nAustralia, Japan, and South Korea were described as the backbone of effective opposition to Chinese ambitions in the Pacific, provided their capabilities and will could be strengthened sufficiently, while closer U.S. relations with other regional powers like the Philippines and Thailand were recommended to strengthen their role in upholding a rules-based international order.\n\nThe overall goal seems to have been convincing second- and third-tier Indo-Pacific governments that China seeks to dominate them and giving them good reasons to push back while undermining China's efforts to present itself as an irresistible hegemonic power with a superior economic and political system. One of the major strategic objectives outlined in the Framework was promoting U.S. values throughout the region to maintain influence and counterbalance Chinese models of government. Another was investing in capabilities that promote uncensored communication between Chinese people.\n\nThe authors and contributing agencies behind the Framework emphasized that China must not be allowed to believe it has gained air and sea military dominance over first-island-chain nations, prominently including Taiwan but not limited to that particular island. The implicit concern is that China would become more likely to invade Taiwan if it believed it held such a dominant position that it could score a swift victory, and then it might keep going, securing all of its military objectives across the Indo-Pacific.\n\nContrary to speculation that the national security bureaucracy declassified this document decades ahead of schedule because it wanted to assert its primacy over Trump's chaotic foreign policy, the framework is broadly consistent with Trump's policy goals regarding China and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe document is strongly supportive of Trump's maximum pressure campaign against North Korea's nuclear ambitions, for example, and it encouraged expanding U.S. intelligence and law enforcement activities that counter Chinese influence operations, a goal the Trump administration unquestionably emphasized.\n\nThe scorecard for implementing the 2017 strategic framework over the following three years is far from perfect, especially after the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, which China ruthlessly exploited to overturn many of the policy goals outlined in the NSC document. As 2020 drew to a close, China was aggressively using the pandemic and its disruptions to argue for the superiority of its authoritarian system and command economy, the exact opposite of how the framework authors hoped the world's new struggle against authoritarianism would be faring at the end of Trump's term.\n\nThe framework's hopes for bringing Japan and South Korea closer together to counter China have sadly not been realized; as of Wednesday, Japan was thinking about ejecting the South Korean ambassador over the latest developments in the long-running dispute over Japanese compensation for World War Two atrocities. ASEAN signed a gigantic trade pact with China in November, a development China hailed as the end of U.S. hegemony in the West Pacific.
French President Emmanuel Macron used his New Year's televised address to lash out at the populist Yellow Vest protestors who have taken to the streets through November and December to oppose his globalist policies, accusing them of anti-Semitism and other defects.\n\nSpeaking after a year which has seen his approval ratings plunge to new and historic lows and even the President placing a helicopter on standby to escape angry protesters, Emmanuel Macron defied expectations on New Year's Eve to deliver a speech that was combative and unapologetic. The address came as a significant change of tone from just when weeks before when he attempted to defang the Yellow Vest protests by promising policy changes.\n\nInstead of speaking of a united France as he did last year, Macron attacked his detractors, who have taken to the streets in weekly protests over two months to demand his resignation. While the protests have at times turned violent, the rebels have enjoyed the broad support of the French public — unlike their increasingly unpopular President.\n\nMajority of French Reject Macron's Offers, Want More Yellow Vest Protests https://t.co/EAnuvQjjeP — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 12, 2018\n\nAttacking the character of Yellow Vest protestors — who he did not call by name — and calling them un-French liars, Macron said in the televised address from his Paris palace that they are: the megaphones of a hate-filled crowd attacking elected representatives, the forces of law and order, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals.\n\nThat is simply the negation of France. I have recently seen things that are unthinkable and heard the unacceptable… Republican order will be ensured with no leniency.\n\nDespite his having rowed back on the policy of pricing vehicle ownership out of the means of ordinary French citizens by levying high taxes on fuel, Macron vowed to continue with his policy programme in the speech. Making clear his unpopular — but some claim necessary — reforms would continue despite opposition, Macron told the nation: We can't work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending… We can and must do better.\n\nMacron Had Helicopter on Standby to Escape Presidential Palace During Protests https://t.co/qOu4EQKnzv — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 14, 2018\n\nGlobalist Macron also used his speech to talk up the European Union, whose flag he stood before, talking of a renewed European project just months before the next EU Parliament elections are due to take place in 2019.\n\nMacron has become personally invested in the vote, even though he is not standing to be a Member of the European Parliament, as he has portrayed himself as a leader of a globalist alliance standing against populist and nationalist parties expecting to see major gains in the vote.\n\nIf Macron's preferred candidates suffer in the vote, as they have been already across Europe in 2018, it could be another serious blow to his credibility.\n\nYellow Vests turned out in Paris again on New Year's Eve, just days after their previous protest on Saturday, but in much smaller numbers than previous 'acts', or marches.
Peter Wehner, a member of the small Never Trump faction, declared Friday in The Atlantic that The Trump Presidency is Over because of coronavirus.\n\nWehner, who called for a shadow government to replace Trump in 2017, wrote:\n\nWhen, in January 2016, I wrote that despite being a lifelong Republican who worked in the previous three GOP administrations, I would never vote for Donald Trump, even though his administration would align much more with my policy views than a Hillary Clinton presidency would, a lot of my Republican friends were befuddled. How could I not vote for a person who checked far more of my policy boxes than his opponent? What I explained then, and what I have said many times since, is that Trump is fundamentally unfit—intellectually, morally, temperamentally, and psychologically—for office. For me, that is the paramount consideration in electing a president, in part because at some point it's reasonable to expect that a president will face an unexpected crisis—and at that point, the president's judgment and discernment, his character and leadership ability, will really matter.\n\nThe president had failed, he said, because of the delay in coronavirus testing, though he admitted that Trump's travel ban on China had been prudent. He also said Trump had provided false information.\n\nTaken together, this is a massive failure in leadership that stems from a massive defect in character, Wehner concluded.\n\nRead his full article here.\n\nJoel B.

Henry Olsen, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and author of The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism, said Mitt Romney appeared to prioritize investors' profits over American jobs, which contributed to the former Massachusetts governor's failure to win the presidency in 2012. He offered his remarks in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nRomney described President Donald Trump as a man whose character falls short in Tuesday-published Washington Post opinion editorial: Trump's character falls short. … With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.\n\nOlsen wrote a response to Romney — published in the Washington Post on Wednesday — entitled, Mitt Romney's op-ed crystallizes all the reasons the old GOP establishment has been pushed aside.\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\n\nOlsen said, Mitt Romney had a great chance to be President of the United States, and he blew it. He blew it because he didn't talk about the things that were making people insecure. He wasn't talking about an economy in a way that made them think that he cared about them. He didn't talk about immigration in a way that made them think that he was serious about it. He didn't talk about trade in a way that made them think that he cared more about American jobs than investors' profits.\n\nOlsen added, Romney was shocked. His pollsters told him he was going to win. They were all prepared to win, but the evidence was there all along that the people who gave Trump the presidency rejected Mitt Romney because he did not share their values.\n\nOlsen continued, The biggest problem I see in Washington is that most Republican elected officials and most Republican elites still wish that this was the party where the argument was between Romney and Cruz, and it's not.\n\nOlsen went on, It's not [between Romney and Cruz], because Donald Trump picked up the hundred-dollar bill that had been lying in front of them for about a decade, and cashed it. And that's the hundred-dollar bill of dissatisfied blue collar workers who want a government that's limited in its scope but active in the protection of Americans because they are Americans. They think they can put the genie back in the bottle by getting rid of the president. Well, good luck. The fact is, this is what people wanted for years. They've had a taste of the apple. They like it, and they're going to expect the next Republican leader to follow suit, or they're going to abandon the party.\n\nOlsen assessed left-wing proposals from self-described democratic socialists — including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — as unappealing to working class and blue collar Americans.\n\nThe AOC approach is a non-starter with most of the working class, said Olsen. They don't want a big government, heavy, high-tax, high-benefit state. What they want is what they had. They want their jobs back, and they want to stop being subjected to what they consider to be unfair competition. There's nothing that AOC or her allies would do about that sort of competition [for jobs], particularly from people who come here — whether legally or illegally — and who compete with these people for the jobs.\n\nTrump's appeal to working class voters was key to winning the presidency, appraised Olsen.\n\nIn 2016, I think the way to understand what happened was, there were really three party primaries, judged Olsen. There was a Democratic primary between Clinton and Sanders. There was a Republican primary between 17 people, and there was a working class primary between Sanders and Trump, and the working class voters who heard both of those people — and in most states could've gone either way because they don't have party registration — overwhelmingly chose Trump, and a lot of the people who chose Sanders did so knowing that they would vote for Trump if their guy lost. There is no appeal to the AOC-type of policy among the actual working class voters.\n\nThere's nothing about the left of the Democratic Party that interests the TIGRs [Trump Is Great Republicans], concluded Olsen.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.
The pro-mass immigration Koch brothers' network of billionaire, donor class organizations will push an expansive amnesty for illegal aliens this year while vowing not to financially support President Trump's 2020 re-election bid.\n\nIn a leaked email obtained by Time Magazine, the Koch brothers' network of organizations — which includes Americans for Prosperity, the LIBRE Initiative, and Freedom Partners — have their sights set on an amnesty for the at least 3.5 million illegal aliens who are enrolled and eligible for President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nThe Koch brothers' organizations claim Americans have a commitment to providing amnesty to DACA illegal aliens, though doing so would strain the country's social safety net intended for U.S. citizens.\n\nThese are people who have already demonstrated their commitment and contribution to this country – and in 2019 our country can do the same for them, the Koch network email stated.\n\nThe Kochs' push for DACA amnesty this year comes as the billionaires and donor class checked two items off their wish list in the last two years of Trump's presidency: Tax cuts and criminal justice reform.\n\nMeanwhile, plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, reduce legal immigration levels, and implement mandatory E-Verify to reduce illegal competition against American workers have stalled.\n\nThough the Trump administration has provided the Koch network and its billionaire donors with those two major legislative wins, the libertarian organizations are already vowing not to support the president, financially, in his 2020 re-election bid against a slew of Democrat candidates.\n\nWe are making significant investments to unite the country and address critical issues that will help people improve their lives, Koch spokesman James Davis told TIME. This starts with a major new initiative to fight poverty in America, and following on the success of the First Step Act in December continuing to build broad-based policy coalitions on issues from education reform to immigration. These will include a significant investment to support policy champions in Senate, House and state races. This is where we can make the biggest difference for millions of Americans. [Emphasis added]\n\nMost recently, the Koch network lobbied the Trump administration not to enforce an existing law whereby foreign nationals seeking to permanently resettle in the U.S. would need to prove that they will not become drains on the American taxpayer.\n\nBillionaire Koch Brothers: 'Serious Mistake' to End Welfare-Dependent Immigration to U.S.https://t.co/2ewhRKABxk — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) December 15, 2018\n\nThe immigration controls would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.
Brexit leader Nigel Farage was forced to hit back at a senior Sky News political editor who suggested the fishing industry was economically insignificant and should be sacrificed to the European Union at the cost of thousands of jobs.\n\nSpeaking from a fishing boat in front of the Houses of Parliament this morning, Sky News' Beth Rigby contrasted the City of London to working-class fishing communities, suggesting only one could be saved in the government's Brexit negotiations.\n\nFishing, in those communities, might be very important, but the truth is that the financial services industry is 11 per cent of the economy, she said to the former UKIP leader.\n\nFarage Leads 'Furious' Thames Fish-Flinging Protest at Parliament Against Brexit Deal https://t.co/td7LZbRF0z — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 21, 2018\n\nIn contrast, fishing is 0.05 per cent of the economy, she added, asking: Can you perceive it from the Chancellor's perspective?\n\nOh, to hell with them then! blasted Farage, mocking the notion that coastal, working-class communities are expendable in order to protect urban, high tech industries and the multi-national financial sector.\n\nThe argument that the fisheries are not financially significant enough to save during the negotiation has been widely used by some arguing 'softer' Brexit.\n\nThe British fishing industry contributes less than 0.05 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and fisherman have expressed concern that the sector could be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, reported the Financial Times on the 17th of this month, ahead of the announcement the EU would continue to control fishing policy for years after Brexit.\n\nFarage rejected Ms. Rigby's question as a false dichotomy, saying: No. If you have someone in your front room taking your possessions, you get rid of them, and get back control of your own life.\n\nFishing is the acid test of Brexit, he continued. This is the clearest way that we can measure, actually, what is being done, and when it comes to financial services [EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier] has already made it plain he's not going to give us a good deal.\n\nAccording to Fishing for Leave, around 60 per cent of the UK fleet has been scrapped thanks to the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which the UK is now likely to remain tied to for two years after Brexit.\n\nThe UK's fishermen are likely to be even worse off in those years than under current arrangements, as they will remain bound by the rules but with no say in setting them.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to make a number of changes in the composition of her cabinet Monday, with movements anticipated to predominantly focus on junior positions.\n\nWhile Westminster pundits have reported the senior ministers including Home Secretary, Chancellor, and Foreign Secretary minister will remain in post, up to a dozen other cabinet posts are expected to change, with the possibility of new ministerial positions created to support the Brexit process.\n\nUpdate 20:00: Justine Greening quits cabinet\n\nJustine Greening, the former Education Secretary quit the cabinet Monday evening after reportedly having turned down a sideways move to the Department of Work and Pensions. The MP, who was hailed as being a trailblazer in the education department as the only lesbian in cabinet and the first state-educated education secretary championed social justice and social mobility causes during her 18 months in post.\n\nThe Times Education Supplement reports the Prime Minister found Greening patronising and had been seen to be actively campaigning to keep her job in recent weeks.\n\nGreening has been replaced as Secretary of State for Education by Damian Hinds, who was Work and Pensions minister.\n\nI wonder if @JustineGreening 's resignation is linked to the fact most parents don't want their children indoctrinated by the latest #64genders nonsense she's been focussing on rather than the nuts & bolts of education.#Greening#Reshuffle#CulturalMarxism — Ben Harris-Quinney (@B_HQ) January 8, 2018\n\nThe original story continues below\n\nThe first official change of Monday was the announcement that close Theresa May ally James Brokenshire was taking the opportunity of the cabinet reshuffle to stand down from his position of Northern Ireland secretary, citing ill health. He is expected to be undergoing major surgery in the coming weeks for a lung condition, reports the BBC.\n\nThis news was followed by the departure from cabinet Sir Patrick McLoughlin, and his replacement with Brandon Lewis, who has become the new Chairman of the Conservative Party and sits in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio. 2015 intake MP James Cleverly has joined him as deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party.\n\nLewis had until today been the Minister of State for Immigration and was the first minister to have been summoned to No.10 to meet with the Prime Minister this morning. Veteran Sir Patrick McLoughlin leaves cabinet after eight years, serving under May and Cameron, and has previously served in John Major and Margaret Thatcher's cabinets.\n\nThe reshuffle took on a bizarre twist Monday morning as the official Conservative party Twitter account tweeted an image congratulating Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling on becoming the chairman of the Conservative party. The Tweet was deleted moments later.\n\nGrayling is a close ally of the Prime Minister, having been the campaign manager for May during her successful campaign to become the leader of the Conservative party.\n\nHonoured and delighted to be appointed by the PM as Vice Chair @Conservatives for Communities. pic.twitter.com/dRsACTBM9x — Rehman Chishti (@Rehman_Chishti) January 8, 2018\n\nAsides cabinet movements, there have been a number of appointments within the Conservative Party itself Monday, with a grand total of eight new Vice Chairs at CCHQ being drawn from the parliamentary party, with positions including a Vice Chair for Local Government going to Marcus Jones, and a Vice Chariman for Policy going to Chris Skidmore.\n\nThe reshuffle comes after the disappointing result for Mrs May in the June 2017 general election, in which she and her party defied expectations to consolidate their position in parliament to actually lose seats.\n\nThis Story is developing
Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced a paid suspension for Colorado Rockies shortstop Jose Reyes.\n\nCops in Hawaii arrested Reyes for an alleged assault on his wife on Halloween. A new domestic-violence policy empowers the commissioner to make the unprecedented move to suspend, albeit with pay, without a legal finding of guilt.\n\nUpon resolution of Reyes' criminal proceedings and the completion of the Commissioner's Office's investigation into the incident, Commissioner Manfred will make a decision whether to impose discipline on Reyes, a statement by the league read. The Commissioner's Office will have no further comment on this matter until a final disposition is announced.\n\nThe players' association countered with a statement threatening action.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the proceedings in Hawaii, as well as the Commissioner's actions under the Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy, the MLBPA's statement read. If further discipline is issued, or if Mr. Reyes' paid suspension is not resolved in a timely fashion, the Players Association will work with Mr. Reyes to ensure that all of his rights under the Policy are protected. Pursuant to the confidentiality provisions of the Policy, the Players Association will have no further comment at this time.
White House officials rolled out a list of 15 visa-lottery jihadis and chain-migration terrorists to pressure Democrats towards a compromise on the president's framework amnesty-and-immigration plan.\n\nThe February 2 list of jihadis includes a senior leader in the Islamic counter-attack against personal freedom, Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook. He is an alleged United States Hamas leader [who] received his green card through a predecessor program to the visa lottery, said the statement. Marzook was deported in 1997 for terrorist activities.\n\nThe statement backs up Trump's speech in the State of the Union speech, where he urged elimination of the visa lottery and chain migration programs, saying:\n\nIt is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work who will contribute to our society and who will love and respect our country.\n\nThe jihadis include seven mujahids who arrived via the visa lottery and six jihadis who arrived via chain migration. They include:
Washington (AFP) – Two people have tested positive for the new coronavirus after taking part in a pro-Israel lobby group's conference in Washington which Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and dozens of lawmakers also attended.\n\nThe influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee said in an email to attendees, speakers and congressional offices that the infected pair had traveled from New York to go to the March 1-3 event.\n\nWe have confirmed that at least two Policy Conference attendees from New York have tested positive for the Coronavirus, AIPAC said in the message, posted to its Twitter account.\n\nOfficials said on Friday that 22 new cases had been confirmed in New York state, mostly in a Westchester County cluster north of New York City, bringing the total to 44.\n\nWe have continued to remain in constant communication with the Westchester County Health Department and the DC Health Department which is coordinating with the New York Health Department, and national health authorities, AIPAC added.\n\nAIPAC circulated a statement later Friday it attributed to Washington health authorities saying no immediate risk to attendees had been identified. DC Public Health was unavailable for comment.\n\nThe event attracted several high-profile attendees including Pence, Pompeo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Democratic former White House hopeful Mike Bloomberg.\n\nPence is leading the US response to the novel coronavirus.\n\nLawmakers from all political stripes make an annual pilgrimage of sorts to AIPAC to pledge their support for the state of Israel on a grand stage.\n\nAbout 18,000 people had been expected to travel from across the US to attend the conference, which typically attracts around two-thirds of the members of Congress.\n\nAttendees swamped Capitol Hill in their hundreds during the event.\n\nIf you test positive for Coronavirus, we urge you to inform your local health authorities so they can properly coordinate the response to this situation with the appropriate health authorities, AIPAC said.\n\nThe virus has now killed more than 3,450 people and infected more than 100,000 across 92 nations since the outbreak first emerged in China in December. Over 3,000 of those deaths have been in China.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is skillfully and successfully implementing President Donald Trump's immigration policies, says the pro-migration, elite-left Vox website.\n\nThe site's immigration writer, Dara Lind, described Sessions as the seasoned vet in a clubhouse full of rookies, who:\n\nunderstands the immigration system exceedingly well and is devoted to wreaking as much change in it as possible. Every Trump administration initiative on immigration, to the extent that it's had teeth at all, has been given those teeth by Sessions and the DOJ.\n\nAmid Washington uproar, Sessions is forcefully reforming the Department of Justice's myriad agencies, rules, and staff rosters to reverse decades of pro-migration preferences, Vox recognizes:\n\nSessions has generally kept his attention on doing his job — even at the cost of his relationship with the president. He's pulled every available lever to redirect the considerable resources of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to fight the crimes he considers most serious: violent crimes, drug crime, and, most notably, violations of immigration law. …\n\nBut Sessions isn't using his leadership of the DOJ simply to make the immigration court system more efficient. He's using the full extent of his power as attorney general to reduce the likelihood that a case gets resolved (quickly or otherwise) in an immigrant's favor — removing tools and resources that make courts more efficient but improve immigrants' odds of winning their cases, while pressuring immigration judges to plow through cases at an unheard-of rate. He's removing the safety valves from the pipeline while increasing the pressure.\n\nVox is a progressive site, which generally adopts pro-migration policies that subordinate the interests of white-collar and blue-collar Americans to the interests of migrants, investors and cheap-labor CEOs. Like many other sites, Vox's articles reflect the progressive view that Americans have a moral duty to help foreigners migrate to the United States, and it is eager to overlook the resulting civic and economic damage done to ordinary Americans — and also to ignore the huge economic gains that cheap-labor migration delivers to investors and upper-income postgraduate progressives.\n\nAccording to Vox, Session believes immigration rules should help Americans, not primarily migrants, cheap-labor CEOs and Wall Street investors:\n\nwhile his peers in the Republican Party tried to strike a balance between good legal immigrants and bad illegal ones, he has always taken a skeptical attitude toward immigrants and immigration, period, believing that the burden of proof ought to be on an immigrant to prove that she deserves to come to or stay in the US, and preferring, always, to keep worthy people out rather than let anyone unworthy in. … As Sessions has put it, more people want to move to the United States than the country could ever possibly accept; the dividing line between whom the country should accept and whom it shouldn't, he believes, should be determined by the American people based on who they feel serves the national interest — defined as assimilating into American culture and helping the fortunes of American workers.\n\nVox notes that Sessions avoids sentimental arguments about individual migrants' tragic circumstances and often admirable character. Those personalized, sentimental arguments are exploited by the establishment media and activists who can always find striving illegals or pitiable women, and sad children to serve as a sympathetic face for progressives' nation-changing ambitions and CEO's cheap-labor goals. Instead, Sessions uses the law — not emotion — to deliver gains for Americans:\n\nSessions has generally preferred a logical, categorical approach: The problem with unauthorized immigration is that it is illegal, and that illegality itself causes real pain to American citizens. Because Sessions doesn't rely on bad unauthorized immigrants to make his point, he doesn't open the door for sympathy toward good ones.\n\nRead it all here.\n\nBreitbart News has already covered many aspects of Sessions' step-by-step gradual reform of the Justice Department and the immigration policies.\n\nEach year, four million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for good jobs in the free market while the federal government accepts another 1 million new immigrants.\n\nWashington's policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
Blaine amendments, borne out of 19th-century anti-Catholic bigotry, have been the constant bane of the modern education-choice movement. The amendments, currently found in the constitutions of 37 states, prohibit public funds from supporting sectarian schools.\n\nBlaine amendments have been at the center of legal disputes in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and elsewhere, in which leftist groups and teachers-union hacks have challenged school choice programs that allow parents to educate their children at religious schools using public funds. Thus far, supporters of school choice have experienced several setbacks, but all that could soon change.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case that could erase Blaine amendments from the school choice debate once and for all. Teachers unions, who have used Blaine amendments as their bread-and-butter argument in dozens of cases, have a legitimate fear this ruling will spell doom for their failed system.\n\nAfter lawmakers enacted [education savings accounts], teachers unions and other special interests challenged their legality in court, The Heritage Foundation's Lindsey Burke wrote in October 2016. Arizona unions based their suit on the state's Blaine amendment, which prohibits public funds from flowing to religious institutions. In 2014, Arizona courts ruled in Niehaus v. Huppenthal ESAs do not violate the state constitution.\n\nIn Nevada, too, the state's Supreme Court ruled against the local chapter of the ACLU, which was challenging the Nevada's new ESA program on the grounds it violated the state constitution's Blaine amendment. And though, as Burke writes, both research and legal precedent … make [ESAs] well-positioned to withstand legal challenges based on Blaine amendments, the amendments continue to serve as an impediment to families accessing school choice programs in an efficient way. In Nevada, for instance, thousands of families are stuck on a waiting list as the legislature figures out a way to fund the ESA program after the state's Supreme Court declared the program (but not its funding mechanism) constitutional.\n\nThe very existence of Blaine amendments also seems to serve as a deterrent to attempts to establish more education choice programs, and there appears to be a positive correlation between claims of Blaine amendment violations being shot down and more states moving to propose their own forms of popular school choice programs.\n\nState legislators across the country are pondering education savings account measures in the wake of a split decision by the Nevada Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of that state's program, while killing the funding source, Watchdog.org reported in October 2016. Lawmakers in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin are considering their own ESA programs.\n\n'Nevada's nearly universal ESA has set the new standard for educational choice,' Leslie Hiner, vice president of programs at EdChoice, told Watchdog.org.\n\nThe fact that teachers unions may soon be unable to blame Blaine spells further endangerment for their beloved (and often failing or mediocre) public schools.\n\nIf SCOTUS removes Blaine amendments from the arsenal of anti-school choice advocates, what will the unions and their cohorts have left? Claims that school choice drains public school funding have been disproven many times over, and parents who want to send their child to a better school—one that is not decided for them based on their ZIP code—can hardly be expected to care about financing the failed school they've chosen to abandon.\n\nA U.S. Supreme Court ruling finally to dismiss Blaine amendments would be a win for the whole country. We could at last do away with this bigoted measure, which has marred the constitutions of many states for decades while opening the door for the type of educational alternatives children and their families have been yearning for.\n\nSuch a ruling wouldn't be all bad for public schools, either. More school choice would mean greater competition and motivation for government schools to strive to their greatest potential. All public schools have to worry about is whether the private sector can do things better, and again, their fears are legitimate.\n\nTeresa Mull (tmull@heartland.org) is a research fellow in education policy at The Heartland Institute.
Washington (AFP) – The historic impeachment trial of Donald Trump opened Thursday in the US Senate, as lawmakers took a solemn oath to be impartial in deciding whether to force the 45th US president from office.\n\nIn a hushed chamber, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, clad in a traditional black robe, raised his right hand as he was sworn in to preside over the trial. He then administered the oath to senators in turn, to convene the third court of impeachment in American history.\n\nRoberts asked if they swore to deliver impartial justice according to the US Constitution, and 99 lawmakers — one was absent — responded in unison: I do.\n\nEarlier in the day in a deeply symbolic moment, the two articles of impeachment — charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — were read out on the Senate floor.\n\nThe Senate Sergeant of Arms Michael Stenger issued a warning as proceedings got underway.\n\nHear ye, hear ye, hear ye, Stenger said, commanding senators to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment.\n\nAdam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who will serve as lead prosecutor for the trial, read the charges accusing Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nTrump has ridiculed the impeachment process for months, and he responded to the opening of the trial by once more branding it a hoax.\n\nI think it should go very quickly, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nIt's totally partisan, Trump said. I've got to go through a hoax, a phony hoax put out by the Democrats so they can try and win an election.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House, in an overwhelmingly partisan vote, impeached Trump on December 18 over his dealings with Ukraine and subsequent efforts to obstruct the investigation into the affair.\n\nImpeachment rules require a two-thirds Senate majority to convict and remove a president, and Trump's acquittal is widely expected in the Republican-dominated Senate.\n\nJustice Roberts, 64, was appointed to the nation's top court by president George W. Bush, and will preside over the duration of the trial, which is expected to last two weeks.\n\nAfter the senators' swearing in, the Senate adjourned until 1:00 pm (1800 GMT) on Tuesday, when the prosecution begins laying out its case against the president.\n\nOne senator — Republican James Inhofe — was absent due to a family medical emergency but said he would be sworn in with no delay on Tuesday, when Trump's impeachment trial begins in earnest.\n\n– 'Senate's time is at hand' –\n\nTrump is accused of abuse of power for withholding military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting for the country's president in exchange for an investigation into his potential presidential election rival Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe nonpartisan Government Accountability Office concluded in a report released Thursday that the White House violated federal law by putting a hold on the congressionally-approved funds for Ukraine.\n\nFaithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, according to the GAO, a congressional watchdog.\n\nThe second article of impeachment relates to Trump's refusal to provide witnesses and documents to House impeachment investigators in defiance of congressional subpoenas.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been extremely critical of Trump's impeachment by the House and Democrats have accused him of planning to oversee a sham trial in the Senate.\n\nMcConnell has said he would coordinate the defense of Trump in the Senate with the White House.\n\nIt was a transparently partisan performance from beginning to end, McConnell said of the House impeachment. But it's not what this process will be going forward.\n\nThe House's hour is over, the Republican senator from Kentucky said. The Senate's time is at hand.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump had given the House no option.\n\nIt is a sad day for America, Pelosi told reporters. We were given no choice.\n\nTrump's actions undermined national security, were a violation of his oath of office and jeopardized the integrity of our elections, she said.\n\nFor weeks Pelosi held back on delivering the articles to the Senate as she pressured McConnell to agree to subpoena the witnesses and documents that the White House blocked from the probe.\n\nMcConnell has refused to commit, saying the issue will only be decided after the trial's opening arguments and questioning.\n\nA Trump administration official told reporters they expect the trial to last no longer than two weeks, suggesting McConnell could use his 53-47 Republican majority to stifle calls for witnesses and quickly take the charges to a vote.\n\nAside from Schiff the prosecution team will include Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler; House Democratic Caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries; Zoe Lofgren, a veteran of two previous impeachment investigations; and three others.
Chanel Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld is threatening to renounce his German citizenship if Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy of open borders continues.\n\nLagerfeld — who recently designed First Lady Melania Trump's custom Chanel gown for the American-French state dinner — told the French newspaper Le Point that he would consider dropping his German citizenship if Merkel keeps allowing foreign nationals to enter the country in mass numbers.\n\nLagerfeld said:\n\nDid she really need to say it was necessary to welcome one million migrants at a time when France, which casts itself as the land of human rights, pledged to take in 30,000? Lagerfeld said. … If this keeps up, I'll abandon German citizenship, he continued.\n\nThe fashion icon called Merkel a pastor's daughter who cannot accept the evil that Germany carried out after 1933 and thus has attempted to make up for it by imposing a foreign population that now exceeds 11 percent in the European superpower.\n\nLagerfeld — whose comments fly in the face of many of his Hollywood counterparts, many of whom publicly promote open borders in America — previously blasted Merkel's open borders policy saying, One cannot – even if there are decades between them – kill millions of Jews and then bring millions of their worst enemies in their place.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Recently liberated Ramadi citizens are telling media the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) tortured them and used them as human shields when Iraqi forces moved into the city.\n\nThey took us to many places, exclaimed one woman. They later told us to go to the front, but inspected us before leaving.\n\nThe Islamic State forced out Iraqi forces in Ramadi in mid-May 2015. The militants stole weapons and captured the military headquarters. They then murdered anyone loyal to the government.\n\nAll the families in Ramadi were like captives, she said. ISIS tortured men in a way that they cried like women.\n\nNot all Ramadi citizens escaped the Islamic State upon the liberation of Ramadi. My mother is captured by ISIS, cries one woman on camera. Please tell me where my mother is.\n\nAs she wept, the woman begged the Rudaw crew to take her to her mother.\n\nI just want my mother, she continued, after she regained her composure. Dozens of people are still seized. We even didn't have water to drink.\n\nAs Iraqi forces moved in during December, the Islamic State grew paranoid and used the civilians as human shields. One man said the militants forced people to remain in their houses and could only leave with permission.\n\nWe feel like we're living inside a sealed casket, described Abu Ahmed.\n\nBy retaking Ramadi, Iraq's security forces have won a morale-boosting victory https://t.co/0Bs2vZ9siF pic.twitter.com/vSoHvoyTmH — The Economist (@TheEconomist) January 8, 2016\n\nThe widespread destruction in Ramadi, Iraq, illustrates the costs of dislodging ISIS https://t.co/19xikwUY0u pic.twitter.com/YoZfM0kPRp — New York Times World (@nytimesworld) January 8, 2016\n\nThey come to the house and take the children and accuse them of being spies, stated another source. If the mom cries and gets upset at them, they accuse of her [sic] being a spy too and take her to the jail and later kill her.\n\nThe forces liberated Ramadi from the Islamic State in late December.\n\nThe clearance of the government center is a significant accomplishment and is the result of many months of hard work by the Iraqi Army, the Counter Terrorism Service, the Iraqi Air Force, local and federal police and tribal fighters, declared Col. Steve Warren, the spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State.\n\nHowever, the forces insisted the area is not 100% safe. They withdrew 635 residents to nearby Habbaniyah, but there are many areas that still contain terrorists. The officials arrested 12 alleged militants who attempted to escape by blending in with the civilians.\n\nBut the militants who did escape received a literal fiery welcome when they arrived in Mosul.\n\nThey were grouped together and made to stand in a circle and set on fire to die, a former resident told Fox News.\n\nTerrorism expert Michael Pregent said it is normal for the Islamic State to execute fighters who lose valuable territories. They did the same thing when militants lost Tikrit.\n\nThey continue to lose territory, we've seen a growing number of defections and a rise in the number of alleged internal spies – many of whom they have killed mercilessly without demonstrating significant evidence of internal espionage, said Clint Watts, Fox fellow of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, adding:
Major school exams across the UK have been moved to accommodate Islam and students who fast during the month of Ramadan, following new measures set in place by education authorities.\n\nThe GCSE and A-level schedule has been rearranged so that some exams in key subjects are clustered before the start of Islam's month of fasting.\n\nThis year Ramadan is expected to fall in early June and the examination boards say they have met with Muslim groups and complied with their wishes to avoid scheduling exams in the most popular subjects during the period.\n\nWhere possible, large-entry GCSE and GCE [A-level] subjects are timetabled prior to the commencement of Ramadan and consideration is given to whether they are timetabled in the morning or afternoon, said the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), which represents examination boards in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nSeveral core maths exams appear to have been shifted to earlier dates than last year, meaning candidates will have fewer days to revise. The new measures are likely to be in place for at least five years, until Ramadan no longer clashes with the exam season.\n\nThe month, which runs from June 6 to July 5 this summer, moves backward through the calendar by around 11 days a year.\n\nAnne Longfield, the government's children's commissioner for England, said she applauded the move when she appeared before parliament's education committee at a hearing on Wednesday. She added that it is important we understand the individual children in this.\n\nPlenty of other groups asked just why it was that the entire British education system should be changed to accommodate just one faith with followers that make up just 4.8 per cent of the population.\n\nThey should let things be, Colin Hart, of the pressure group Christian Concern, told the Daily Mail. How can you start changing the rules for everybody just to accommodate those particular pupils who are Muslims, who are in a minority?\n\nWe don't live in Saudi Arabia where they need to fit the exams around sharia principles. It's wrong imposing this festival on everybody else.\n\nKeith Porteous Wood, of the National Secular Society, said: If there are a significant number of Muslim students that are affected and calling for a change, they should be accommodated, but only if this can be achieved with no or minimal disruption.\n\nSir Iqbal Sacranie, founding secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, defended the decision as fair and just. But this is not a special privilege and it is within the JCQ policy, which is welcomed and appreciated.\n\nPeople often accuse Muslims of demanding special rights and provisions, he added. We don't want them.\n\nThis is of particular relevance when it comes to accommodating faith communities for their religious festivals, particularly Muslim and Jewish communities, who follow the lunar calendar.\n\nReligious communities need to be able to celebrate their festivities without being burdened by examinations on these special days.\n\nDr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said that her union had been campaigning on the issue of exams during Ramadan for more than a year.\n\nAs educators we want all children to be able to achieve their best in exams that are so crucial to their future, she said. We shall continue to raise awareness of best practice and how education staff can support students during Ramadan.
President Donald Trump discussed his new plans on trade with conservative media at the White House, assuring them his goal of making American trade fair again.\n\nHe announced his intent to institute a 20 percent tax on Canadian soft lumber imports as a big step forward on his agenda.\n\nI've been looking to do this for years, I cannot understand how this country has allowed itself to be literally taken advantage of by so many other countries and we never go back, he said.\n\nTrump confirmed reports that he would tackle unfairly subsidized aluminum imports in the upcoming weeks, and preview additional actions after that.\n\nHe specifically addressed free trade critics of his economic agenda.\n\nI'm the biggest free trader of them all, you can't be a free trader when nobody else is, and nobody ever says that, he said.\n\nThe president signed an executive order last week to move forward on an investigation into international steel imports to see whether they threaten national security.\n\nNot specifically China, he said, although he acknowledged that China was doing a lot of the dumping.\n\nTrump appeared confident that countries exporting to the United States would quickly learn his motives for trade policy.\n\nThe process is, when you charge them enough, they're not going to send it anymore, it's a very simple process, he said.\n\nHe pointing to countries who had their own protective import taxes of 70, 80, 90, even 100 percent.\n\nI call it a reciprocal tax, Trump said. If a country is charging us a 100 percent tax, and we're charging them nothing for the same product … why didn't these politicians just say reciprocal tax? We're going to be very heavy on the reciprocal tax.\n\nTrump admitted that his tone with China has moderated somewhat, but pointed to his negotiations with them to contain the North Korea threat as the reason.\n\nChina has a tremendous power over North Korea, in my opinion they can help us … lets see what they do, that will have a lot to do with my thinking.\n\nTrump pointed to Canada obstructing American milk and milk product from being imported into the country.\n\nWe can't sell milk, he said, pointing to the milk product classifications that were recently put into place by the Canadian dairy industry, sparking protests from American dairy farmers.\n\nTrump signaled that his actions on trade would help restore the states of important industries in the United States, specifically citing his thoughts on dairy and lumber.\n\nYou know what it's going to really mean? It means we're going to start doing lumber in our country, it's going to mean that farmers are now going to start selling milk in our country, instead of buying Canadian milk. Trump said.
Beijing (AFP) – China's economy grew last year at its slowest pace in three decades, hit by weak domestic demand and trade tensions, but while officials warned of further headwinds, separate figures Friday suggest the downward trend is bottoming out.\n\nThe 6.1 percent rate is a sharp drop from the 6.6 percent the year before and marks the third straight drop, though it met the government's target and analysts said leaders were unlikely to open up the stimulus taps just yet.\n\nThe reading was also in line with AFP analyst forecasts.\n\nAnd while the world's number two economy had been gradually losing steam over the first three quarters, growth held steady at 6.0 percent in October-December — the same as the previous quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nNing Jizhe, commissioner of the NBS, said momentum remained generally stable through the year and said the same could be expected in 2020.\n\nHowever, we should also be aware that the global economic and trade growth is slowing down, he said at a news conference, adding that there were more sources of instability and risk, with the economy facing mounting downward pressure.\n\nThe figures were released days after Vice Premier Liu He and Donald Trump signed a much-vaunted phase one pact that marks a truce in their nearly two-year-old trade war.\n\nThe agreement will see the US slash import duties on Chinese goods worth billions of dollars, though levies remain in place on two-thirds of more than $500 billion of products.\n\n– 'New normal' –\n\nThe World Bank said in a report this month that weakening exports from China had compounded the impact of a slowdown in domestic demand. Policy uncertainty and higher tariffs on exports to the US also cast a pall on manufacturing activity and investor sentiment, it added.\n\nOther data released Friday showed while industrial production and retail sales slowed over the year, both indicators outperformed in December, with the NBS pointing to a particularly strong showing in consumer spending.\n\nThe latest … data provides a very positive start to the Chinese New Year for China's economy, Rajiv Biswas, of IHS Markit, said. The outlook for 2020 is for continued robust growth, boosted by the phase one trade deal with the US and the continued positive impact of government monetary and fiscal policy stimulus measures.\n\nBut analysts note that China's slowdown is structural, as it becomes a more developed economy and faces demographic challenges such as a shrinking number of people of working age.\n\nThe NBS said China's birthrate fell to 10.48 per 1,000 people last year — the lowest since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.\n\nFaced with an ageing population, Beijing relaxed its one-child policy in 2016 to allow people to have two children, but it has not led to more births.\n\nStill, Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, told AFP that Beijing considers the slowdown part of a new normal and that major easing is unlikely, given the improving global outlook and the US trade deal.\n\nHe noted policymakers likely want to keep their powder dry, aiming for a stabilisation rather than reigniting growth, adding: What they don't want to see is a too-rapid slowdown.\n\n– Stabilisation in 2020 –\n\nAnalysts and officials are expecting the economy to level out this year.\n\nKuijs noted the trade deal bodes well for exports, as well as sentiment on business investment and consumption. It also reduces the risk of escalation and severe decoupling in other dimensions such as restrictions on companies and finance.\n\nBut UOB economists Ho Woei Chen and Peter Chia said in a recent note that the deal is unlikely to catalyse a strong rebound in growth for China as the bulk of US tariffs remain in place.\n\nTommy Xie, head of Greater China Research at OCBC Bank, said more supportive state policies such as tax incentives have helped stabilise national growth.\n\nBut he noted a tailing off in the growth of infrastructure investment, which could prove problematic. With property investment slowing, the strength of China's growth this year will depend on whether infrastructure investment is able to offset this decline, he said.\n\nLast month, the NBS said China would revise its historical regional GDP data under a unified accounting mechanism to be introduced early 2020.\n\nThis is expected to close a discrepancy between national and regional figures and enhance the credibility of government statistics, according to state media.\n\nEconomists have long suspected that Chinese economic data is massaged upward, often noting that full-year gross domestic product hits Beijing's targets with suspicious regularity.
ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — In an exclusive interview hours before President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Breitbart News that the Democrat senator who currently occupies his old seat in the U.S. Senate has revealed himself as part of the radical left with the Trump impeachment push he's helping lead.\n\nJones on Wednesday, hours before the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote to acquit President Trump on both Articles of Impeachment adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives after a weeks-long Senate trial, revealed that he intends to vote to convict President Trump on both counts. Jones's votes will fail, as the U.S. Senate has well more than enough votes to acquit President Trump, but the fact that he has decided to align himself with the leftists who have taken over the Democrat Party has people like Sessions alarmed on behalf of the state of Alabama.\n\nBREAKING: Senator @DougJones just released his statement on Senator on his Impeachment Decision. Jones *will vote to convict the President on both articles of impeachment: — Kellie Meyer (@KellieMeyerNews) February 5, 2020\n\nSessions, who is leading the GOP primary for the chance to take on Jones in November for his old seat, told Breitbart News in this exclusive interview that Jones has let the people of Alabama down by refusing to see their will done in Washington.\n\nDoug Jones has made clear whose side he's on, Sessions said. He has supported Speaker Pelosi's gambit to withhold the Articles of Impeachment for purely political timing reasons, not for substantive reasons. He's supported that. He's supported only the witnesses Chuck Schumer has called for. He's supported Sen. Schumer's call for only Democratic witnesses. He's supported Speaker Pelosi's idea that she can hold back the articles for political reasons and political timing. He's also called the case presented by the House impeachment managers 'compelling.' Fourthly, I would say, with regard to Alabama, he's not once defended President Trump from all the unfair attacks he's been subjected to throughout this process, even though President Trump carried Alabama by a super large margin. He's ignored the wishes and beliefs of the people of Alabama.\n\nMore importantly, Sessions said, the mask has slipped off Jones, revealing he is just as radical as the rest of them—and his claims to be a moderate are failing and untrue.\n\nI think he's clearly revealed himself to be a part of the Schumer team, the liberal team, that would create a majority in the Senate, that would make every committee chairman a Democrat—some of them radical Democrats—and all of which is contrary to the values of Alabama, Sessions said.\n\nRegarding the impeachment more broadly, Sessions said the partisan push by the U.S. House—it's the first time in the history of the United States that an impeachment has been purely partisan in nature with bipartisan opposition—was a colossal failure. In the House, all Republicans were joined by three Democrats in opposing one Article of Impeachment and by two Democrats in opposing the other. A fourth Democrat voted present on both Articles, refusing to vote for either one. One of the two Democrats who voted against both Articles left the Democrat Party over it, joining the GOP. The Senate process has been similarly marred by Democrat partisanship. What's more, Sessions says, the actual allegations don't pass muster.\n\nThis was a colossal failure of the Democratic House, first and foremost, Sessions said. This was nowhere close to an impeachment. I've been saying that for weeks. It's not an offense. It's nowhere close to being an impeachable offense. They should not have done this. They have abused the great impeachment article in the Constitution more than it's ever been abused in its history and they deserve to be criticized for it. It's become more and more clear, I think, to the American people as time went on that this is not—the evidence did not justify removal from office. It's nowhere close to what's required. I'm glad the Republicans said listen and went through a process, but they're correct to bring this to a close. It's just not there. I thought Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz made the case in a compelling fashion.\n\nPart of the reason why Democrats like Jones are going through with this, Sessions said, is because of how effective President Trump has been on his agenda. Sessions, whose interview came before Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night, said the president's speech would be a positive message for America.\n\nHe's going to welcome into his coalition Democrats and independents who believe that we've not defended our jobs and our manufacturing sufficiently on international trade, who think that it's long past time to end the massive illegality at our border and defend America's interests at the border and other issues that he's been thinking about that appeal not just to Republicans but to all Americans, Sessions said.\n\nBy all accounts, that's exactly what Trump did—hyper-focusing on trying to win back the black community for Republicans, something that has even Democrats like Van Jones worried—and Sessions said this success Trump has had in building a broad coalition is why Democrats are trying to take him out.\n\nI think the Democrats are terrified. I think it goes beyond just hostility to President Trump, Sessions said. I think they believe he's assembling a majority coalition in America that could govern this country for a decade or more. The loser will be the radical, socialist, secular left who are going to be left out in the cold. They are a minority in America. President Trump has shown he knows how to appeal across party lines and draw in the extra voters that you need to win elections. So they went after him personally because they feared him, and they feared they were losing the support of the American people. It's not just that they didn't like him personally but he and his agenda—that I've believed in for a long time—his agenda assembles a working majority of Americans. They support that. He will now have this impeachment behind and he'll be even more effective driving his policies, and the American people will continue to respond and the economy is growing at a very, very positive rate. I think we have a window of opportunity in the next year or two to make some changes that will be historic for America, to build on the good judges and to build on the tax reductions and regulation reductions and to defend people of faith and reduce our involvement in endless war and to protect our borders and protect American jobs and manufacturing. That can be a matter of great historic importance. I'm just really excited about it.\n\nBut, Sessions warned, while President Trump clearly gets this broader coalition message, several Republicans do not—and that is why he is running for his old seat in the U.S. Senate, to help steer the GOP correctly in the era of Trump and beyond.\n\nI would say this. Many of our Republicans don't fully grasp that, Sessions said. They don't fully understand the opportunity we have right now. This is a major historical redirection of American policy from the left to mainstream American values—that's the choice we'll face in this next election.
Social media platform Parler is now offline after Amazon Web Services suspended the site, claiming it lacks content moderation.\n\nThe Hill reports that social media website Parler has been taken offline after its hosting account was suspended by Amazon Web Services which claimed that the site failed to adequately moderate content on its platform.\n\nIn an email to Parler, Amazon stated: Recently, we've seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It's clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.\n\nThe email added: It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency.\n\nParler CEO John Matze said in a recent statement that the site could be offline for up to a week as it searches for a new web hosting provider. Speaking to Fox News early on Sunday, Matze stated:\n\nIt would put anybody out of business. I mean, this — they could destroy anybody. If they did this to any app, any company, it would completely destroy them. And we're going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we're having a lot of trouble, because every vendor we talk to says they won't work with us, because, if Apple doesn't approve and Google doesn't approve, they won't.\n\nParler has also been removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Parler's Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff told Fox & Friends Weekend:\n\nWe're not necessarily being singled out by those tech companies, but certainly by the people who have been putting pressure on them and, in fact, we think we're being set up in a lot of ways because in looking at some of the content, these are accounts that have been created two days ago and they have few pieces of content and some of them are parodies of what you would think a right-wing inciter of violence would be.\n\nPeikoff went on to explain what she referred to as a crucial question about the continued operation of Parler, stating: Do we want all of the content that is posted online, every single piece to be scanned for 'objectionable content,' as they call it, 24/7 and also removed without due process if it's flagged by an algorithm because that seems to be the standard that Parler is being told that we must adhere to.\n\nBreitbart Tech has reported extensively on the de-platforming of conservative social media and President Trump, read more here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

An illegal alien named Juan Manuel Razo Ramirez was indicted in Ohio on 16 counts for a string of crimes he is accused of in Lake County–including murder.\n\nThe suspect, also know as Juan Razo, was arrested last July and accused of the murder of Margaret Peggy Kostelnik. But that isn't all he was accused of. In fact, Ramirez is accused of going on a crime spree that included the sexual assaulting of his own 14-year-old niece as well as the shooting and wounding of a woman walking on the street.\n\nUpon apprehending the man, police discovered that Ramirez was in the country illegally.\n\nNow the illegal immigrant has been officially indicted on 16 counts.\n\nAside from an indictment for the murder of the 60-year-old Kostelnik, Ramirez was indicted on several other counts including raping the dead victim, the attempted rape of a minor, the attempted murder of Mary Kable as well as the attempted murder of three Ohio peace officers.\n\nAs the case developed last year it was discovered that Ramirez had been arrested by local police only a few weeks before his crime spree but due to changes in immigration policy instituted by the Obama administration, police had to release him instead of remanding him to federal authorities for deportation.\n\n\n\nAccording to ABC 5, despite his admission that he was an illegal immigrant, federal authorities refused to take custody of Ramirez from Lake County police after the suspect was arrested during a traffic stop.\n\nBecause of the new federal policy, Lake County police released Ramirez only three weeks before he murdered Margaret Kostelnik.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com
Support for President Donald Trump among American farmers is on the rise, according to a new poll released this week.\n\nAccording to the latest Farm Journal Pulse Poll, which featured responses from 1,286 farmers, President Trump received an approval rating of 83 percent, a point higher than the previous poll. Only 18 percent disapprove of President Trump. Since Farm Journal's tracking of Trump's support from farmers in recent months, the latest poll marks his highest approval.\n\nOf note is the strongly approve category went up three percentage points from an already lofty (December) number and his highest overall approval ratings ever, said Pro Farmer policy analyst Jim Wiesemeyer.\n\nThat says the president's approval is rock-solid, Wiesemeyer added. With the recent upbeat news on USMCA and the Phase 1 accord with China, the ratings will likely remain firm ahead.\n\nFarmers who stated they strongly approve of President Trump rose to 64 percent in January, up from 61 percent at the end of 2019. A mere 19 percent said they somewhat approve of President Trump's performance, while only three percent said they somewhat disapprove.\n\nTrump needs the rural vote to keep the same states he won in 2016 in his win column come November, Wiesemeyer said. In fact, contacts say he is focusing on winning Minnesota this time as a backstop should he lose a state he won in 2016. That means agriculture will continue to be a key topic in the president's re-election campaign.\n\nIn accordance with the latest poll results, President Trump also spoke at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Austin, Texas, where he praised the many accomplishments of American farmers.\n\nFollow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.
Legendary NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw says former First Lady Nancy Reagan, who died Sunday at the age of 94, will be remembered as a very skilled and powerful First Lady who didn't let the seams show.\n\nShe had a very subtle touch behind the scenes, Brokaw told host Stephen K. Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News, on Monday morning's edition of Breitbart News Daily, heard daily on Sirius-XM's Patriot Channel 125.\n\nI am quite close to a number of people who worked in that White House and they always said 'We knew where the power was, not just with the President, but with Nancy as well.' And she didn't abuse the power. She was very skilled in how she used it, Brokaw added.\n\nBrokaw also told Bannon that Nancy Reagan's influence on her husband may have contributed to his administration's foreign policy successes:\n\nIt was important for the staff to know not just where she stood on issues, but on personnel as well. I do think that, as a modern First Lady, she had a huge impact on the politics of the White House. I know for a fact that she dialed Ronnie, as she called him, dialed him down on his rhetoric about the Soviet Union because she could see the possibilities of getting something done with Mikhail Gorbachev at that time. And also understood the historic importance of that, if he were the President who could start to unwind the nuclear confrontation.\n\nBannon asked Brokaw to expand on how Nancy Reagan was really a partner to him [President Reagan], not in so much policy, but really as the person that he kind of leaned on in very difficult situations.\n\nWell it was, in the truest sense of the word, a deeply emotional relationship, but also very pragmatic. I was just saying on the air a few moments ago that I thought their thespian training, their Hollywood background, helped them in politics, because they were conscious of the fact the country wanted something grand in the Presidency, Brokaw said. He also noted that:\n\nThey were always prepared to help deliver that, not just on a substantive point of view, but also in a kind of metaphorical way. So when they went out in public, they had a patina, more than a patina, of glamour about them, and she kept that up after we lost the President. At the [Reagan] Library, for example, she would be always introduced as the former First Lady of the United States. They had ruffles and flourishes played. The whole setting at the library, I think, is a real tribute to their personal tastes, but also to the place of the Presidency in our lives, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or a Tea Party member or whatever. You go in there and you have a sense of the majesty of the office, if you will, and I mean that in a pragmatic sense, not in the royal sense.\n\nThey were very, very much aware of the importance of symbolism. I think it was helped shaped a little bit by their years, not just in Hollywood, but eight years as Governor of California, Brokaw added.\n\nBannon also posited that without Nancy Reagan as First Lady, there for the comfort, aid and really protection of him, it might have been a very different Presidency, would it not?\n\nBrokaw agreed:\n\nI think that's true. She was, she didn't let this on to him, but she was terrified whenever he went out, because she saw just how vulnerable he was, even with all that protection. He was such an important part of her life from a personal point of view. She was very anxious about it. But they got through it. She didn't show that anxiety to the public, and she was greatly relieved when he was able to leave office on his own two feet, as it were. And then, of course, when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and wrote that very, very touching letter to the American people, hand written, and then she went on to live with him in that condition. He had to have her at his side, at night, for example, or he would get agitated, and she was there, and never complained. I had quite a strong personal relationship with her by then, and I would not bring that up, and she would not… there was never a hint of a complaint from her about the life she had been reduced to. A lot of her friends were gone by then, so she didn't have a very active social life. She had a harder time getting around. She had friends in New York. She would come here from time to time, but then she lost most of them. She was a very brave woman through it all.\n\nBannon also asked if this old-fashioned marriage [between Nancy and Ronald Reagan], even though he was divorced, is it something that the first couple can have, does the new First Lady have to be too policy oriented or do you think they could actually have this throw-back marriage?\n\nI do think that marriage was a reflection of their times, Brokaw responded, adding:\n\nAnd when he got divorced [from first wife Jane Wyman], it was very hard for him to accept. He kept thinking for awhile that they would get back together again. But Ms. Wyman, whom I didn't know, but I've heard from others who talked to her, just, he was consumed with politics 24-7. He was the head of the Screen Actors Guild for example. He was very liberal, he was very involved in politics, and then he made the transition to becoming the kind of typical conservative of his time. Divorce in those days was almost a lower s scandale. People didn't get divorced. They covered it up. I think he was very conscious of that. He came out of a strong Protestant background in the Midwest. He was part of that culture. His mother was a huge influence on him.\n\nBrokaw agreed with Bannon's assertion that Reagan was kind of the All-American boy.\n\nHe was, and he carried that out, Brokaw noted:\n\nWhat people forget is that he did grow up under very difficult circumstances. He went to Eureka College [in Illinois], played football, and almost instantly became a big radio star in the Midwest. He worked for WHO, the big radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, and he recreated the Chicago Cubs baseball games. He got a great interest in horseback riding. So he was a glamorous figure by those standards. And then he went to the West Coast to cover the Cubs in spring training, and somebody said to him, 'You ought to take a crack at Hollywood.' And he became a contract player for Universal Pictures. This was all before he was 30. So he had a rocket ride to some considerable success at that time. That would have been in those moments that would have been the American dream fulfilled.\n\nYou can hear the full interview here:
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah group vowed Sunday to end the U.S. military's presence in the Middle East, saying U.S. bases, warships and soldiers were all fair targets following the recent U.S. killing of an Iranian general.\n\nHassan Nasrallah said the U.S. military will pay the price for the U.S. drone strike that killed Gen Qassem Soleimani in Iraq Friday. His comments further heightened tensions in a region already on high alert and bracing for Iranian retaliation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to bomb 52 sites in Iran if it retaliates by attacking Americans. Iran vowed to take an even-greater step away from its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers as a response to Soleimani's slaying.\n\nThe suicide attackers who forced the Americans to leave from our region in the past are still here and their numbers have increased, Nasrallah said.\n\nIt was not clear which suicide bombings Nasrallah was referring to. A 1983 attack on a U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon killed 241 U.S. servicemen. President Ronald Reagan eventually withdrew all American forces from the country. Suicide bombings in Iraq in the 2000s also put pressure on the Americans to withdraw.\n\nNasrallah spoke from an undisclosed location, and his speech was played on large screens for thousands of Shiite followers in southern Beirut, interrupted occasionally by chants of Death to America. The comments were Nasrallah's first since Soleimani's killing.\n\nNasrallah spoke shortly before the Iraqi parliament voted in favor of a bill to expel the U.S. military from Iraq by canceling the military agreement between the two countries. More than 5,000 U.S. soldiers are in Iraq, based on an invitation by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help fight the Islamic State group.\n\nEarlier Sunday, tens of thousands of mourners accompanied a casket carrying the remains of the slain Soleimani through two major Iranian cities as part of a grand funeral procession across the Islamic Republic for the commander killed by an American drone.\n\nNasrallah said Soleimani was not only Iran's concern but the entire so-called axis of resistance, a term used to refer to anti-Israel militant groups in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the Palestinian territories. He said it was up to those groups to decide if and how they would retaliate.\n\nHe praised Soleimani and said the shoe of Qassem Soleimani is worth the head of Trump and all American leaders.\n\nSoleimani's killing escalated the crisis between Tehran and Washington after months of trading attacks and threats that have put the wider Middle East on edge. The conflict is rooted in Trump pulling out of Iran's atomic accord and imposing crippling sanctions.\n\nIran has promised harsh revenge for the U.S. attack, which shocked Iranians across all political lines. Many saw Soleimani as a pillar of the Islamic Republic at a moment when it is beset by U.S. sanctions and recent anti-government protests.\n\nRetaliation for Soleimani could potentially come through the proxy forces which he oversaw as the head of an elite unit within the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Soleimani's longtime deputy Esmail Ghaani already has taken over as the Quds Force's commander.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia separately warned Americans of the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks.\n\nLate Saturday, a series of rockets launched in Baghdad fell inside or near the Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy.\n\nTrump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.\n\nTrump did not identify the targets but added that they would be HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.\n\nThe 1954 Hague Convention, of which the U.S. is a party, bars any military from direct hostilities against cultural property. However, such sites can be targeted if they have been re-purposed and turned into a legitimate military objective, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nIran, home to 24 UNESCO World Heritage sites, has in the past reportedly guarded the sprawling tomb complex of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, with surface-to-air missiles.\n\nAfter thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general's body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz. An honor guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.\n\nThe caskets then moved slowly through streets choked with mourners wearing black, beating their chests and carrying posters with Soleimani's portrait. Demonstrators also carried red Shiite flags, which traditionally both symbolize the spilled blood of someone unjustly killed and call for their deaths to be avenged.\n\nOfficials brought Soleimani's body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard's newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.\n\nAuthorities then took Soleimani's body to Mashhad later Sunday. His remains will go to Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, followed by his hometown of Kerman for burial Tuesday.\n\nThis marks the first time Iran honored a single man with a multi-city ceremony. Not even Khomeini received such a processional with his death in 1989. Soleimani on Monday will lie in state at Tehran's famed Musalla mosque as the revolutionary leader did before him.\n\nSoleimani was the architect of Iran's regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back decades.\n\nThough it's unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq.\n\nIranian officials planned to meet Sunday night to discuss taking a fifth step away from its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, one that could be even greater than planned, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told journalists.\n\nIn the world of politics, all developments are interconnected, Mousavi said.\n\nIran previously has broken limits of its enrichment, its stockpiles and its centrifuges, as well as restarted enrichment at an underground facility.\n\nAfter the airstrike early Friday, the U.S.-led coalition has scaled back operations and boosted security and defensive measures at bases hosting coalition forces in Iraq, a coalition official said on condition of anonymity according to regulations.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait, the latest in a series of deployments in recent months as the standoff with Iran has worsened. Protesters held demonstrations in dozens of U.S. cities Saturday over Trump's decisions to kill Soleimani and deploy more troops to the Mideast.\n\nIn a thinly veiled threat, one of the Iran-backed militias, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, called on Iraqi security forces to stay at least a kilometer (0.6 miles) away from U.S. bases starting Sunday night. However, U.S. troops are invariably based in Iraqi military posts alongside local forces.\n\nThe Iranian parliament on Sunday opened with lawmakers in unison chanting: Death to America! Parliament speaker Ali Larijani compared Soleimani's killing to the 1953 CIA-backed coup that cemented the shah's power and to the U.S. Navy's shootdown of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 that killed 290 people. He also described American officials as following the law of the jungle.\n\nMr. Trump! This is the voice of Iranian nation. Listen! Larijani said as lawmakers chanted.\n\nA spokesman for Iran's armed forces, Gen. Abolfazl Shekarchi, likewise threatened the U.S. by saying Iran and the resistance front will decide the time, place and way revenge will be carried out.\n\nIraq's parliament is meeting for an emergency session Sunday. Its government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops who are based in the country to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.\n\nThe U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and temporarily closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters had recently staged two days of violent protests in which they breached the compound. Britain and France have warned their citizens to avoid or strictly limit travel in Iraq, as London said it would begin escorting ships through the Strait of Hormuz. Oman, long an interlocutor between Iran and the West, urged Tehran and Washington on Sunday to pursue dialogue.\n\nNo one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Karam reported from Beirut.

The Justice Department says it is taking measures to ensure that jurisdictions receiving federal grant money are in compliance with federal law, and that includes sanctuary cities.\n\nIn a letter to Rep. John Culberson (R-TX), Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik detailed the policies in place to ensure jurisdictions comply with federal immigration law.\n\nNamely, the Justice Department is requiring applicants for law enforcement grants to assure and certify that they are in compliance with federal law, including immigration law.\n\nWhere the Department of Justice (the Department) receives a credible allegation that an entity receiving funds under a Department grant or reimbursement program has, after assuring or certifying compliance with applicable federal laws, violated specific federal law, the Department can potentially seek criminal or civil enforcement options against the entity, the letter, dated Tuesday, reads.\n\nCenter for Immigration Studies expert Jessica Vaughan explained to Breitbart News that this policy means any jurisdiction that has a policy restricting cooperation with federal immigration officials, in violation of the law, will find their funding under scrutiny.\n\n[Attorney General Loretta] Lynch said that if her department gets a 'credible allegation' that jurisdictions have these policies and have received funds, they will contact the sanctuaries and tell them they must change their policies or lose their funding, Vaughan wrote in an email.\n\nThe Justice Department's posture toward sanctuary cities comes after Culberson pressured the department to bring sanctuary cities into compliance with existing law. Culberson is the chairman of the House Appropriation's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.\n\nThe new policies the Department of Justice announced today will keep our streets safer by ensuring that criminal aliens do not roam freely in our communities, and prevent federal tax dollars from being sent to jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration laws, Culberson said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the more then 300 sanctuary cities that may find their funding in the balance, the Justice Department also announced a new process for criminal aliens being released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. Under the new procedure, immigration enforcement gets first dibs on taking criminal aliens into custody for immigration violations — rather than localities, which may has an outstanding warrant.\n\nICE's decision to exercise this right of first refusal is informed, in part, by the state or municipality's willingness to cooperate with federal authorities on ICE detainers, Kadzik wrote.\n\nLynch has also agreed provide the Appropriations Committee with quarterly reports on the new policies.\n\nI am encouraged by Attorney General Lynch's announcement today, and I commend Chairman Culberson for working with the Department of Justice to get their commitment to stop any grant funding to jurisdictions that are in violation of applicable federal laws. This is a significant matter for a lot of us and I look forward to verifying DOJ's progress each quarter, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) added in a statement.\n\nLynch elaborated on the new policies during a subcommittee hearing Wednesday when questioned by Culberson and Rogers:
Former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton discussed the threat of expansionist China on Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon, who has personal experience with the region.\n\nBolton agreed with Bannon that the American people have not been well-prepared by their political leaders to understand the enormous strategic significance of the South China Sea, or the true scope of China's ambitions. He laid the task of providing that perspective, and rallying public support for whatever American counter-moves are necessary, at the feet of the next President.\n\nPeople need to hear their leaders, or their would-be leaders, explain why these issues are important to them, he said.\n\nFor a lot of people, maybe who didn't grow up in the Vietnam era, the South China Sea sounds like it's a long way away. Here's a key fact: every barrel of oil that goes to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan – key allies and trading partners of the United States – goes through the South China Sea. if the Chinese take what are now international waters, and make them into a Chinese lake, they've got their hands around the throats of those economies. They've got forward position among the nations of Southeast Asia, and they're right on the edge of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThere's a lot at stake here, he concluded. A real leader could explain that, could explain to the American people how it could affect their daily lives – and why we have to take actions such as a substantial naval rebuilding program, so that our Navy doesn't sink to levels we haven't seen since World War I, and so that we can protect our freedoms here, and our way of life.\n\nBolton conceded these complex issues are not well-suited to 45-second answers in these serial press conferences we call 'debates,' so presidential candidates would have to use other venues to bring the voters up to speed.\n\nIt can be difficult for candidates to invest precious campaign energy on deep issues of foreign policy, even at a time of heightened public concern over national security, but Boton made an excellent point about how those seemingly far-off events in the South China Sea could be presented as immediate threats to the American way of life. There will indeed be swift and dire consequences for American citizens if China dominates the entire Pacific Rim by controlling the freedom of navigation, as Bolton described.\n\nHe stressed that the next President must understand, and express to the American people, that there is a clear relationship between foreign policy and domestic policy.\n\nYou can't treat them separately. You can't have a strong American economy and preserve our way of life here at home without a strong American presence internationally… and you can't have a strong presence internationally without a strong economy.\n\nBolton advised that the first job of the President who cleans up after Barack Obama would be to re-establish that America is going to protect itself and its friends around the world, much as Ronald Reagan did after Jimmy Carter.\n\nWe're trying to avoid conflict in the world. We're trying to protect our interest without hostilities. But you have to do that from a position of strength, Bolton explained. You've got to start with political leadership, then you've got to follow it up with some very extensive programs to re-furbish the military. That's going to cost money. Nobody better blink at that.\n\nYou can listen to the full interview with John Bolton below:\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is becoming 'more and more obsessed' with COP26 (the United Nations climate conference which Britain is hosting later this year).\n\n'The green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense,' he claims. 'If you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.'\n\nThe green agenda is not just a load of green nonsense… if you do it right, it's the opportunity to create hundreds of thousands of jobs Looking ahead to COP26, Boris Johnson says he is becoming more and more obsessed with what we can dohttps://t.co/eGiunu4sRs pic.twitter.com/83cBYLzVMA — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) January 13, 2021\n\nPossibly this is good news for Johnson, who, as a reward for this nonsense, may now get more nookie from his eco-activist girlfriend Carrie Symonds (aka Princess Nut Nut). But it will be an absolute disaster for the country at large, as a number of recent reports and articles make clear.\n\nA recent analysis by a senior economist at Deutsche Bank, for example, says that the way the European Union is selling its 'Green Deal' is 'dishonest' and poses massive risks for prosperity, the economic system and democracy itself.\n\nIn the report, titled Climate Neutrality: Are We Ready for an Honest Discussion?, Eric Heymann warns that the EU's green ambitions of 'Net Zero' Carbon emissions cannot be achieved without a fall in standards of living, a reduction in international competitiveness, and a loss in personal freedom.\n\nAt the moment, he notes, we all get to take key consumption decisions — whether we travel at all, how much we travel and which means of transport we use, whether we live in a large house or a small apartment and how we heat our homes, how many electronic devices we have and how intensely we use them or how much meat and exotic fruit we eat — on the basis of 'income, not on climate considerations.'\n\nIf we are to achieve climate neutrality, we will need to change our behaviour in all these areas of life because it is impossible to do any of the above things in a carbon neutral way. The only way this is likely to happen, he warns, is through government compulsion.\n\nHeymann warns:\n\nI know that 'eco-dictatorship' is a nasty word. But we may have to ask ourselves the question whether and to what extent we may be willing to accept some kind of eco-dictatorship (in the form of regulatory law) in order to move towards climate neutrality.\n\nThis, Heymann goes on to say, will lead to massive political resistance because prosperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.\n\nLet's repeat that phrase for the dimmer kids at the back of the class, Johnson.\n\nProsperity and employment are likely to suffer considerably.\n\nThis makes a nonsense of Johnson's airy claim that his green revolution will create hundreds and thousands of new jobs. Of course it won't. There is plenty of evidence to support Heymann's claim. None to support Johnson's.\n\nI pointed this out in June last year in a piece titled Britain Unleashes a Green New Deal to Kill What's Left of the Economy.\n\nFor example, a study by economics professor Dr Gabriel Calzada Alvarez of Madrid's University of Rey Juan Carlos found that for every 'green job' created by the Spanish government, another 2.2 jobs were destroyed in the real economy. Another study, this time in the UK, found that for every green job created by government 'investment' in the renewables industry, 3.7 jobs were destroyed in the real economy.\n\nMore recently, a report by the think tank Onward has warned that ten million jobs in 'Red Wall' seats (i.e. traditional Labour constituencies in the Midlands and North which lent their votes to the Conservatives in the 2019 election so that Johnson could deliver Brexit) face being wiped out in Johnson's attempt to reach his 'net-zero by 2050' emissions target.\n\nThis might suit Johnson and his green crony capitalist chums in the Westminster bubble, but as Paul Homewood notes, metropolitan greenies will largely insulated from the disastrous effects of their eco-fascist policies in the country at large.\n\nThe climate change agenda is being driven by the metropolitan liberal consensus in London, where few jobs will be at risk. Outside of London there is little support for Net Zero, but people there have little say in policy decisions. Polling may suggest otherwise, but the public have been deliberately kept in the dark about the real costs and implications involved.\n\nBoris Johnson's green revolution is a slow motion train crash in the making. Even those invested in 'climate change' as a genuine threat are starting to wake up to the problem.\n\nHere, for example, is market strategist and investor Bill 'I absolutely believe climate change is the biggest challenge humanity faces' Blain writing at CapX.\n\nThe brutal reality is offshore wind is far less efficient than promised and requires much more expensive maintenance. They break down, sink into their foundations and don't generate anything like the power expected. For all the due diligence, they simply won't ever make any money unless the price at which they sell energy is dramatically increased – at which point they make zero sense.\n\n[It goes, almost without saying, that 'offshore wind' will be playing a major part in Boris Johnson's green revolution – the one that will supposedly create those 'hundreds of thousands of jobs']\n\nBlain sees the makings of a 'financial crash' driven by the renewables sector, for wind turbines are not the panacea they may look to gullible investors.\n\nThis will feel very familiar to many investors who have seen all the blithe assumption about operating and maintenance costs on all kinds of technological green marvels fail to meet expectations. Biowaste generators, biomass, thermal pellets – you name it, and the rosy assumptions failed to materialise because the difficulties in making them work and keeping them working were glossed over by the promoters. Most of the smart money already knew that about renewables and is deeply sceptical. The not-so-smart money still laps the deals up. Sadly, renewables is likely to become another charming but flawed investment thesis. I am no stranger to investment madness – three times I've invested in airships and lost my dosh every time.\n\nBoris Johnson's obsession with green issues is steering the UK economy to disaster. He needs to go now.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is back as the most powerful woman in the House of Representatives, but as a more diverse and far left 116th Congress takes shape,it is clear minorities will want to use their newfound status to get appointed to important committees and be at the table on a wide range of policy issues.\n\nRoll Call explained the dynamics behind the new Democratic-controlled House:\n\nThe ideological caucuses are looking to be a larger source of power in the majority since the groups' central purpose is to develop and debate policy. In the minority, much of the power has been delegated to the Congressional Tri-Caucus — composed of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.\n\nHer hometown San Francisco Chronicle describes the growth of the Tri-Caucus and Pelosi's need to keep them in the fold:\n\nThe growth in the groups' membership — in the last Congress, the Tri-Caucus had roughly 90 core House members — reflects the diverse lineup of Democrats who won election in the November midterms. It also signals that their influence will be wide-ranging. Among the Tri-Caucus members will be eight committee chairs, leading panels ranging from environmental issues to homeland security to small business. They will have representatives in the No. 3, 4 and 5 spots in Democratic leadership. Lobbying firms in Washington are hiring staff with connections to the Tri-Caucus, a signal of their importance. More than 100 of 235 Democratic members in the new House, many from California, belong to one of the three affinity groups known collectively as the Tri-Caucus. It will arguably be the most powerful voting bloc for the Democratic majority.\n\nWe're going to be active on just about every policy area that this House of Representatives will concern itself with, Rep. Joaquín Castro, (D-TX), now chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in the Chronicle article.\n\nPelosi has already committed to convene weekly meetings between leadership and the chairs of the Tri-Caucus groups. During her successful campaign to reclaim the speaker's gavel, Pelosi sat down with each of the groups — and made promises to them, the Chronicle reported.\n\nThose promises include calling for a vote on the Dream Act to give amnesty to young people brought to the United States illegally by there parents, amending the Voting Rights Act, and other immigration issues.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
Education about 'men's violence against women' is to become a compulsory component of a range of university courses as part of Sweden's national strategy for gender equality.\n\nAs part of the state-directed changes to higher education, students from a range of disciplines will be meeting with abused women and children during the course of their studies, the government announced on Friday.\n\nKnowledge of violence in certain occupations may be crucial to saving lives, said equalities minister Åsa Regnér in a statement which outlines the goal of the curriculum changes as teaching students how to detect and prevent violence.\n\nStudents will have mandatory training on the topic of male violence in intimate relationships, where they will meet both aggressors and victims of violence.\n\nThis is a basic measure that should have been in place for decades. Anyone who has studied these issues understands that, by bringing in these changes, the government is making history, said the minister.\n\nSwedes studying in the areas of law, medicine, dentistry, psychology, physiotherapy, nursing, and social work will have to complete courses and training in men's violence against women under the policy.\n\nWhile the government's strategy is explicitly gender-based, stating that it sets out to combat violence against women, studies carried out both in the wider West and in Sweden show that women are more likely to initiate domestic violence.\n\nIn 2013, a study by the University of Gothenburg found that a larger proportion of men than women had been exposed to domestic violence in their relationships.\n\nSweden prides itself on having the world's first feminist government, its website explaining: This means that gender equality is central to the Government's priorities – in decision-making and resource allocation.\n\nEarlier this month, Environment Minister Karolina Skog said reducing the number of cars on the road is a feminist issue as well as a matter of meeting carbon emissions targets, arguing that male drivers occupy space in Swedish cities at the expense of women.
A Texas middle school teacher is fighting to keep her job after word spread that she was an adult film actress in at least 16 productions more than a decade ago.\n\nResa Woodward, 38, taught sixth grade science at Young Women's Science Technology Engineering and Math Academy at Balch Springs Middle School in Dallas and was placed on administrative leave in November when the news of her past broke, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nWoodward said she was forced into pornography more than 16 years ago and has since earned a master's degree and become a teacher.\n\nShe worked as an adult film actress under the name Robyn Foster and appeared in 16 films between 2001 and 2004.\n\nSome films that were compilations of her past performances were released as recently as 2013.\n\nWoodward claims that her involvement in pornography was not of her own choosing and that an older man she was living with at the time forced her into it during a time of financial hardship for her.\n\nShe was able to escape from that situation and decided to pursue a career in education, a profession she worked in for 15 years until the Dallas Independent School District received an anonymous tip regarding her past on March 10.\n\nAn investigation into the incident determined that Woodward's past participation in pornography does not in itself constitute a policy violation, according to records obtained by the Dallas Morning News.\n\nWoodward said the district allowed her to continue teaching as long as her past remained private.\n\nMonths later, Woodward, an active member of the Libertarian Party of Texas, shared her experience: she called the police on a drunk driver on Facebook when a Libertarian man in another state who disagreed with her views on police made her past public on social media.\n\nWhen Woodward alerted the district, she said she was placed on administrative leave and that the district was pursuing termination because it became public.\n\nWoodward, who says she has received merit pay increases at the school for the last two years, is worried about what message her termination would send to her students.\n\nI taught in an all-girls STEAM academy that was all about empowerment for women, Woodward said Tuesday. The sad thing is that if these girls find out that I'm being punished for something that I did nearly 20 years ago and had no control of and fought to get out of, well, what does that say about empowerment?\n\nWoodward is still on administrative leave and filed an appeal with the Texas Education Agency, but officials say they would not pursue the request because it was filed incorrectly.
President Donald Trump has more public support for his argument that the nation is facing a border crisis than Democrats have for their claim that the nation is merely facing a problem on the border, according to a Morning Consult poll released Tuesday evening.\n\nForty-two percent of voters say the U.S. is facing a crisis, while only 37 percent say the U.S. is facing a problem, according to the poll of 1,989 registered voters, which was conducted with Politico.\n\nAmid the flows of migrants and drugs from Central America, 12 percent say the U.S. isn't facing a problem or crisis, according to the poll, which was conducted January 4 to 6.\n\nTrump's crisis argument is backed by 72 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of independents, and 19 percent of Democrats.\n\nThe Democrats' problem rhetoric is backed by 19 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of independents, and 52 percent of Democrats.\n\nTwenty-one percent of Democrats — but just four percent of Republicans and ten percent of independents — say the cross-border flow of cheap labor and drug-smuggling is neither a problem nor a crisis.\n\nThe poll is bad news for Democrats, who are increasingly claiming there is no border crisis that President Trump can cite to declare a national emergency and then build a border wall with unspent funds.\n\nJust to be clear: there is no basis to declare a national emergency. https://t.co/ZrfjzqdZR6 — Eric Holder (@EricHolder) January 8, 2019\n\nHowever, a series of lawyers admitted to establishment media outlets that existing laws provide Trump with the legal authority to build a wall after declaring a national emergency.\n\nLeft-lawyers admit past Congresses gave Trump emergency powers which he can use to build a wall with federal funds. Ooops. Next: Dems will argue that migrant/drug crisis is not a real crisis b/c Dems & biz are OK with it. https://t.co/sNoDj7Qc1w — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 8, 2019\n\nThe poll also showed 44 percent support for a border wall and 47 percent opposition to a border wall. Eighty-three percent of Republicans and 13 percent of Democrats support the wall, while 83 percent of Democrats and 14 percent of Republicans oppose the wall.\n\nHowever, the poll also shows lopsided opposition to government shutdowns. Sixty-five percent of voters say Presidents should take all necessary steps to avoid a government shutdown. They should achieve their policy goals another way, while 22 percent said, Presidents should allow a temporary government shutdown if it helps them achieve their policy goals.\n\nTwenty-nine percent said Trump has done enough to foster agreement, while 52 percent said he has not done enough to avert a shutdown.
A collection of leaked documents appears to show Facebook redefining rules around hate speech and re-educating content moderators following the Charlottesville protest in 2017.\n\nAccording to leaked internal documents obtained by Motherboard, the 2017 Charlottesville protests were a moment of intense introspective for Facebook, which scrambled to redefine what they consider hate speech and to educate content moderators about American white nationalists. One training document obtained shortly after the protests reads: Recent incidents in the United States (i.e. Charlottesville) have shown that there is potentially confusion about our hate org policies and the specific hate orgs in specific markets.\n\nA log of updates to hate speech policy documents show some of the new phrases and sentiments that were defined as hate speech following the Charlottesville protest. In November 2017, trainers added the comparison of Mexican people to worms as an example of hate speech, in December they added the comparison of Muslims and pigs, and in February, trainers added that referring to transgender people as it rather than their preferred pronouns was hate speech.\n\nFive months after the Charlottesville protests, Facebook added slides explaining the social media firms position on white nationalism, supremacy, and separatism. Interestingly, the slides stated that the company does not allow praise, support, or representation of white supremacy as an ideology but does allow positions on white nationalism and separatism to be praised or discussed.\n\nFacebook notes that nationalism as an ideology is not specifically racist, stating that it is an extreme right movement and ideology, but it doesn't seem to be always associated with racism (at least not explicitly). Facebook then notes that In fact, some white nationalists carefully avoid the term supremacy because it has negative connotations.\n\nHowever, Facebook notes that the difference between nationalism and supremacy expressed by some users can be hard to distinguish. Overlaps with white nationalism/separatism, even orgs and individuals define themselves inconsistently, says one slide in a section titled challenges for white supremacy. Another slide asks: Can you say you're a racist on Facebook? Facebook's official response to this is No. By definition, as a racist, you hate on at least one of our characteristics that are protected.\n\nHigh profile users, individuals, and organizations are classified as hate groups based on strong, medium, and weak signals, according to another slide. A strong signal would be a user that is a founder of a prominent h8 org as Facebook refers to them, a medium signal would include using a logo or symbol from a banned hate group or repeatedly using dehumanizing language towards certain groups.\n\nFacebook told Motherboard in a statement that they evaluate whether an individual or group should be designated as a hate figure or organization based on a number of different signals, such as whether they carried out or have called for violence against people based on race, religion or other protected categories.\n\nFacebook says that they do not classify every organization listed as a hate group by the Anti Defamation League as a hate group on their platform, but states that: Online extremism can only be tackled with strong partnerships which is why we continue to work closely with academics and organisations, including the Anti-Defamation League, to further develop and refine this process.\n\nFacebook commented on their attempts to crack down on certain groups on the platform saying: Our policies against organized hate groups and individuals are longstanding and explicit — we don't allow these groups to maintain a presence on Facebook because we don't want to be a platform for hate. Using a combination of technology and people we work aggressively to root out extremist content and hate organizations from our platform.
TEL AVIV – The meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marked a symbolic reset of relations after eight years of tension between the two countries, a top American foreign policy expert said on Friday.\n\nSenior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations Elliott Abrams said on a conference call organized by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA),\n\nWe have come through a period of eight years of tension at various levels, but particularly the top level. It's clear that [former president Barack] Obama and Netanyahu didn't get along, didn't like each other. And that attitude was then communicated to the White House staff. You had a lot of backbiting, criticism of Netanyahu — all of that is over. We've returned now to the idea that there should be no daylight in public between the two governments. There will be plenty of disagreements, but those will be discussed in closed rooms and the relations at the top are obviously genuinely good. There is no artifice here about getting along.\n\nThat's a critically important thing, Abrams noted. The whole US government takes its cue from the relationship at the top.\n\nAbrams, who also served as deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush, added, Other governments also pay attention. I've always believed that most governments, particularly in Europe, base their relationship [with Israel] on ours. They don't want to be quite as close to Israel. So if we're distant, they're more distant. If we're close, then they get closer.\n\nAbrams lauded Trump's ambivalence regarding the two-state solution as being the key to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe goal should never be a two-state solution, the goal is peace. And there are many ways of moving in that direction and there are several potential endpoints. And I think that it's useful to the Israelis and for us to remind everybody that the goal is peace. We should not let the means become more important than the end, and we should think about that goal, rather than saying there is no other possible arrangement ever than the two-state solution.\n\nAbrams said that Trump's request to Netanyahu to hold back on settlements for a little bit was not necessarily an instruction to stop building entirely.\n\nI think that [Trump was] moving back to the George W. Bush approach. And what was the Bush approach? Basically it was, don't change the footprint [and] don't expand the settlements geographically. Population growth, that's different. Build up and in. In built-up areas, if you want to build a new house, a new apartment, that doesn't affect the Palestinians or the chances of peace really. So the Google Earth map, if you put it that way, of the settlements doesn't change.\n\nWe had a deal with [late Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon that was basically no new settlements, no physical — territorial — expansion of settlements and no financial inducements to move to a settlement. I think this administration is moving back to that view, he added.
The Wall Street Journal revealed that CAIR lobbied social media giant Twitter to blacklist outspoken conservative activist Laura Loomer from the platform over her remarks about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).\n\nIn a recent article titled Facebook, Twitter Solicit Outside Groups, Often on the Right, to Referee Political Speech, the Wall Street Journal notes that social media firms such as Facebook and Twitter consult with outside groups in order to develop their policies surrounding political speech on their platforms. Although it appears the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have begun reaching out to some conservative groups for at least some semblance of ideological balance, the articles most illuminating revelation is about Twitter's blacklisting of Laura Loomer.\n\nThe Journal Reports:\n\nConservative Jewish activist Laura Loomer says she didn't know until recently that outside groups and individuals had privately lobbied Twitter executives to remove her from the site in late November. In an email to Ms. Loomer, Twitter said she had violated its hateful conduct policy for a tweet calling Ilhan Omar, the Muslim congresswoman from Minnesota, anti-Jewish and supportive of Shariah law. In an interview, Ms. Loomer says she was referring to a 2012 tweet from Ms. Omar in which the congresswoman wrote, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Among the groups that had complained to Twitter was the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy organization. The council doesn't often step in to advocate against other users, says Executive Director Zahra Billoo, but did so in the case of Ms. Loomer based on her previous comments about Muslims. In 2017, Ms. Loomer tweeted after a terror attack in New York City, Leave it to Muslims to ruin everything. People can't even enjoy #Halloween without those savages f**king everything up for everyone. Other organizations, including the civil-rights organization Muslim Advocates, voiced similar complaints.\n\nThe article states that when Loomer was suspended, she was not informed of the influence of these outside groups in her removal from the platform. A Twitter spokesperson stated that Loomer's removal from the platform was the result of multiple, repeated violations of the same rules, it was not about any one tweet, and that multiple organizations had reported Loomer throughout the years.\n\nFollowing her suspension from the platform, Loomer staged a protest outside Twitter's offices in New York. Wearing a yellow star of David on her jacket, Loomer shouted: I threw away the key, and I'm here for the millions of conservatives who have been censored by Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe tweet that resulted in Loomer's suspension from the platform read:\n\nIsn't it ironic how the twitter moment used to celebrate 'women, LGBTQ, and minorities' is a picture of Ilhan Omar? Ilhan is pro Sharia Ilhan is pro- FGM Under Sharia, homosexuals are oppressed & killed. Women are abused & forced to wear the hijab. Ilhan is anti Jewish.\n\nLoomer at one point rhetorically asked: Why is it that I get banned as a Jewish conservative but Louis Farrakhan is still on Twitter? Loomer was referring to Farrakhan's comments about Jewish people in a video he posted to Twitter where he refers to them as termites stating: To the members of the Jewish community that don't like me, thank you very much for putting my name all over the planet … I'm not mad at you, 'cause you're so stupid.\n\nHe continued to say: So when they talk about Farrakhan, call me a hater, you know they do, call me an antisemite — stop it! I'm anti-termite! I don't know nothing about hating somebody because of their religious preference. Farrakhan was not banned from Twitter for this video.\n\nLoomer was not charged for her protest outside Twitter's offices and police left the scene shortly after arriving. Loomer remains blacklisted from Twitter.\n\nRead the full article in the Wall Street Journal here.
Immigration policymakers need to recognize many Americans do not have jobs and decent wages, Texas GOP Rep. Michael Burgess told an audience at a CPAC panel February 22.\n\nWe need to have American jobs for American workers at American wages, Burgess said, prompting applause from the friendly crowd. I don't know why that is so difficult to understand.\n\nFederal unemployment data hides a large number of Americans who have fallen out of the economy and are not even looking for jobs, he said. There are 5.5 million folks … who are out of the workforce and are not even counted anymore in that group of people who should be seeking jobs, he said.\n\nBurgess' comments are a sharp contrast from statements by business-first Republicans who argue that immigration policy should be built around the investors' preference for plentiful, cheap labor, or the desire of myriad foreigners to get American jobs.\n\nFor example, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters on January 21 he wants to import more low-wage workers:\n\nWe need more legal immigration. … I don't want green cards just for computer engineers. If you are out there working in the fields, if you are a construction worker, I want some of those people to have a way to stay here, because if you are running a business and you have a guest worker who is really good, and would add value to our country, I want them to have a chance to get a green card. I just don't want to be a country in the future of just computer engineers or high-tech people.\n\nMaine's GOP Sen. Susan Collins said February 15 that:\n\nrather than going after a chemistry professor who has been in this country for many years and has contributed greatly to his community and sending him back to his native land at time when he was on his way to pick up his child from school, that the first priority—not the only priority— [of immigration enforcement] should be to go after people who have committed felonies, serious misdemeanors, multiple less serious misdemeanors, are a threat to public health or safety. Wouldn't most Americans agree that that is where our resources should be targeted?\n\nBurgess also warned that politicians need to recognize that the public does not trust their promises to deliver future security in exchange for an amnesty today.\n\nPeople need to see some tangible response that border security is being taken seriously, he said. Burgess continued:\n\nPeople are suspicious. Ronald Reagan is held up as a hero in Texas — except for the Simpson–Mazzoli [1986 amnesty] bill … where President Reagan was promised 'Give us the amnesty today and you'll get your border security tomorrow. There is a fear that Congress will promise [security] and not deliver — people need to see something tangible. That is what the wall is to them.\n\nI think that is why when the President campaigned about building a wall, it resonated with people, he said.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.\n\nBut the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
Government agents smuggled doses of an unapproved Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate into the Philippines and gave them to President Rodrigo Duterte's military security detail as early as September, the Philippine defense minister said Wednesday.\n\nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said members of the Philippines' Presidential Security Group (PSG) obtained early samples of the vaccine candidate in development by the Chinese company Sinopharm at least three months ago without government authorization. He said the president's security guards received the inoculations in September and October without his knowledge.\n\nWhen asked by reporters Wednesday if the vaccines were smuggled into the Philippines, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana replied: Yes smuggled, because they were not authorized, only the government can authorize.\n\nThey need to explain because they violated FDA [Food and Drug Administration] rules, Lorenzana said of the PSG. It is justified … it will protect them so they will not be infected and at the same time they can protect the president.\n\nThe Philippines' FDA has yet to approve any coronavirus vaccines for the country's citizens and has not yet set a timeline for when Filipinos will receive the injection.\n\nThe president first revealed that his security detail had received coronavirus inoculations before anyone else in the country on December 28.\n\nI'll say it, many here were already injected with Sinopharm. … I have to be frank, I have to tell the truth. Many were vaccinated and up to now, I haven't heard anything for the select few, not all soldiers, because it's not policy yet, Duterte said in a televised address.\n\nPSG head Brigadier General Jesus Durante told Philippine news channel ANC on December 29 that a handful of the unit's members had given themselves a coronavirus vaccine in good faith as early as September. He added that Duterte was only informed of their inoculation afterward, stressing the PSG could not afford to wait for the president's approval. Durante did not reveal how the unit obtained the coronavirus vaccine, or which candidate they received.\n\nWith the current pandemic, PSG needs to ensure that they are not themselves [a] threat to the President's health and safety. As such the PSG administered Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccine to its personnel performing close-in security operations to the President, Durante said in a statement. PSG's decision to take the risk is a courageous step that greatly supports its mandate. We did it not for personal agenda but on a greater pursuit that is even way beyond our mission of protecting our President.\n\nWe are in a state of war, a war against Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus]. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people, Durante added.
A report by Real Clear Investigations (RCI) suggests Sheriff Scott Israel did not fire Deputy Scot Peterson–aka, the Coward of Broward–following the Parkland school shooting because Peterson covered up a sexual assault incident involving the sheriff's son.\n\nAccording to RCI, in 2014 Israel's then-17-year-old son, Brett, was accused of participating in a sexual assault of a 14-year-old boy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nPeterson wrote up a report on the incident in which he said the victim alleged that Israel, then the school's starting quarterback, held him down while another senior kicked him, grabbed his genitals and rammed a baseball bat between his buttocks, simulating rape.\n\nIndividuals with knowledge of the accusations say Peterson could have pursued felony charges against Israel instead reduced the matter to simple battery. This allowed Israel to benefit from an Obama-era disciplinary reduction policy and receive a three-day suspension over the incident.\n\nRCI reports that Peterson's handling of this situation is being put forward as a possible reason why Israel did not fire the deputy after he refused to go inside and confront the Parkland school shooter. Instead, Israel allowed Peterson to resign and he now draws a pension of over $100,000 a year.\n\nPeterson arrived on scene at Building 12 on the Parkland campus some 90 seconds into the attack. He stood outside the building as the gunman continued shooting and moving floor-to-floor to find more innocents to kill. Months after the incident Peterson told CBS News that would enter that building in a heartbeat if he could do it all over again.\n\nSeventeen innocents were killed in the attack and the gunman, facing no armed response, had time to pause and reload five times.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment.

A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled it unconstitutional for public figures, including President Trump, to block people on Twitter.\n\nThe case was brought by aggrieved members of Verified Liberal Twitter, a bottom-feeding group of Twitter users that cultivates likes, retweets, and followers on the platform by piggybacking on the President's tweets.\n\nGiven Trump's enormous Twitter following, the top reply to his tweets often receives a great deal of attention. As Twitter favors verified users on the platform, while often shadowbanning conservative accounts, liberal and left-leaning responses to the President often appear at the top of his replies.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has even expressed openness to using Google's hopelessly flawed, politically biased AI hate speech filter on reply threads beneath Trump tweets, which would privilege the replies of left-leaning users to the president even further.\n\nWith or without the filter, left-leaning users frequently attract thousands of retweets with their replies to the president:\n\nTo be fair you didn't win the WH: Russia won it for you. pic.twitter.com/iPUXKopd9B — RPBP (@rpbp) June 6, 2017\n\nThus the incentive for Verified Liberal Twitter.\n\nThere's just one snag. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which brought the case on behalf of the blocked Verified Liberals, argued that the President had violated the rights of the blocked users by limiting their participation in a public forum.\n\nIf Twitter is a public forum where users have First Amendment rights, that could make Twitter bans unconstitutional as well. It might also have knock-on implications for other social media platforms, like Facebook. That would present a huge problem for Jack Dorsey and other Masters of the Universe, who continue to purge conservative users from their platforms.\n\nThe wording of the judge's ruling is unambiguous on this point, stating the viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is prescribed by the First Amendment.\n\nFurthermore, the second part of the judge's ruling, that public figures have no right to block users on social media in response to their political views, also has implications that range far beyond Trump.\n\nFor example:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/999340428959801346\n\nEven if it's argued that the ruling is narrow and only meant to apply to public figures (maybe even arguing that it applies only to the U.S. president), that still has implications for Twitter's enforcement policy. A Twitter-wide ban cuts users off from the feeds of public figures with even more finality than a block. So too does a shadowban.\n\nTo put it another way: if Americans have a constitutional right to access the Twitter feeds of public officials, that means that no one — neither the President nor the CEO of Twitter — is allowed to prevent them doing so.\n\nSo, no more bans for American Twitter users then.\n\nThe ruling may well be judicial trolling from an anti-Trump judge, and there's a question mark on whether it would stand on appeal — including eventually a Supreme Court appeal. But the fact remains that a federal judge has said that the First Amendment applies on social media.\n\nThanks, Verified Liberals!\n\nTwitter declined to comment on this story.\n\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Rocker Neil Young celebrated his U.S. citizenship in his newsletter this week, which featured a photo of him saluting next to an American flag with a sign in the background reading, Democrats Register To Vote Here.\n\nThe Canadian-born rocker announced his U.S. citizenship in his newsletter with a picture and announcement reading, I'm Happy To Report I'm In!! TMZ confirmed that rocker officially became a U.S. citizen at the Convention Center in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday.\n\nYoung was, at least partially, inspired to pursue U.S. citizenship due to his disdain for President Trump.\n\nI want to be a dual citizen and vote, Young wrote in his newsletter in November. While he originally passed the test, he faced delays over his honest answers on his marijuana usage.\n\nThe problem is defined in an April 19, 2019 addition under Attorney General Sessions. USCIS issued a Policy Alert which includes: 'An applicant who is involved in certain marijuana related activist s may lack GMC (Good Moral Character) if found to have violated federal law, even if such activity is unlawful under applicable state or foreign laws,' he wrote.\n\nI sincerely hope I have exhibited good moral character and will be able to vote my conscience on Donald J. Trump and his fellow American candidates, (as yet un-named), he added at the time.\n\nYoung has been a longtime critic of Trump, even lamenting his past use of his music.\n\nDonald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' In The Free World' in his presidential candidacy announcement, Young's team stated after Trump used the 1989 anthem to announce his candidacy. Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President of the United States of America.\n\nTrump's campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski, claimed the campaign paid for the rights to the song.\n\nNonetheless, the singer-songwriter also took issue with Trump continuing to use his music at his famous MAGA rallies.\n\nDT does not have my permission to use the song 'Rockin' In The Free World' at his appearances, Young wrote in a post in November 2018. Legally, he has the right to, however it goes against my wishes.\n\nI asked him then, in a widely shared, public letter to cease and desist, he continued. However, he chose not to listen to my request, just as he chooses not to listen to the many American voices who ask him to stop his constant lies, to stop his petty, nasty name calling and bullying, to stop pushing his dangerous, vilifying and hateful rhetoric.\n\nHe added that Trump does not represent the character and people in the USA that I have come to know and love.\n\nYoung was a staunch supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2016 and freely allowed him to use his music.\n\nThe Harvest Moon rocker recently called Trump, as well as other past presidents, losers for failing to take action to combat climate change.
The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the fourth time since 2008. The central bank says it is targeting a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent for overnight borrowing between banks.\n\nJob gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined, the Fed said in its analysis of current economic conditions. It noted that inflation has recently declined.\n\nThe Fed's expectations for future rates suggest that there will be one more hike this year, in line with what the market had been expecting. Neel Kashkari, the head of the Minneapolis Fed, dissented from the Fed's decision. He would have refrained from raising rates.\n\nThe Fed also announced detailed plans for how it will unwind the large balance sheet it built up by buying bonds during the financial crisis and in the years that followed. Questions over how and when the Fed would shrink its balance sheet have been foremost in the minds of investors and monetary policy mavens for some time. The Fed said it would reduce its holdings later this year by not reinvesting some of the funds received when bonds it holds mature. Currently, the Fed reinvests all of the proceeds from maturing bonds.\n\nIt was the Fed's third consecutive rate increase, signaling a definitive end to the Fed's nine-year old economic stimulus scheme. The move indicates the Fed's confidence in the stability of the economy, although it does not necessarily indicate that the Fed is attempting to slow economic growth. Monetary policy makers believe that low rates support economic growth by lowering the cost of borrowing for businesses, homebuyers and consumers; raising rates is believed to reduce central bank support for the economy.\n\nThe Fed's move came after several disappointing data points appeared to indicate that the economy may be softening and hoped for tax cuts may be delayed longer than expected. Job creation in May came in lower than expected, at just 138.000 jobs. Retail sales in May fell 1.6 percent from the prior month, the biggest decline in 16 months. Economists had expected sales to increase in May, following a 0.4 percent increase in April.\n\nPrior to the Fed announcement on Wednesday, consumer price data revealed that inflation unexpectedly fell in May. Core CPI, an economic indicator closely watched by the Fed because it excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 1.7 percent year-on-year. That was lower than expected and short of the Fed's announced long-term target.\n\nThe dollar was weaker prior to the Fed's announcement but following the release of the soft economic data. Yields on long-term Treasuries, which are thought to reflect investor's expectations of the path of future short-term rates, fell. Falling long-term yields indicate that investors are lowering their expectations for future short-term rates. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was down 10 basis points to 2.11 percent earlier Wednesday.
Tuesday on MSNBC, host Katy Tur said President Donald Trump only knows how to pick fights to keep himself in the headlines.\n\nTur said, Donald Trump supporters are not a monolith. That's a mistake that everybody makes. No more so than Donald Trump himself who believes his voters need him to fulfill these promises. It's not a promise if Mexico's not paying for it. Donald Trump supporters even said to me when I said, what if he can't build a wall? 'That's fine. I just want him to go in there and get things done.' He's not getting anything done.\n\nShe continued, Rush Limbaugh was not at campaign trail talking to people at Donald Trump rallies. His campaign aides should know this as well because a lot of them were there also. Yes, there was the response. 'Build the wall and Mexico will pay for it. ' But a lot of them were there for the show and entertainment value of those rallies, rather than the point by point that Donald Trump was making for his policy. They understood that he was a showman. They didn't think he was going to go to Washington and continue to be a showman in that vein. They were hoping he would be somebody who would get things done.\n\nShe added, It seems all he wants to do, all he understands how to do is fight, fight, fight. When there's no fight, pick a fight. 'I'm going to do everything I can to keep myself in every single one of the headlines and the only way I know how to do that is by blowing things up over and over again.'\n\nShe concluded, There were all sorts of folks that put him over the edge. That were not excited or enthusiastic about Donald Trump building the wall and being mean, frankly, and saying absurd things on Twitter and calling people names. They were the ones who thought, 'Hey, listen, I just want to get something done. I want Washington to work again. I feel like I've got to try something completely different.'\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Twitter and YouTube allegedly targeted conservative commentator Steven Crowder, limiting his social media accounts and those of his staff, along with removing certain YouTube videos.\n\nLouderWithCrowder.com recently reported that the Twitter account of conservative commentator Steven Crowder was temporarily limited for violating the sites rules relating to hateful conduct. Crowder's tweet sharing a video of an intern infiltrating a gender fluid panel at the South by Southwest film festival is apparently what violated the sites conduct policy. When Crowder logged into Twitter, he was told that his account was limited for 12 hours, and he must delete the tweet in order to remove the limitation.\n\nAccording to Louder with Crowder, this is why the tweet may have violated hateful conduct policies:\n\nHere's what we think happened. The original video that went out didn't have the word f*ggot soft bleeped. The original video was immediately pulled from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook as the studio team added bleeps for the offensive content. After the bleeps were added into the video, the studio re-uploaded the SXSW undercover video back to YouTube and Facebook.\n\nCrowder's producer Jared Monroe then uploaded the video again, with potentially offensive words censored, but also received a Twitter suspension:\n\nAfter Louder with Crowder scheduled video promotional tweets of the newly censored video, Crowder's suspension on Twitter was increased to a week:\n\nAnd shortly after this the intern featured in the video, who goes by the online handle SvenComputer, was also suspended from Twitter:\n\nYouTube has also deleted the video of Sven Computer attending the South by Southwest conference.\n\nLouder with Crowder notes that Twitter failed to act on multiple reports sent by the conservative comedian after online trolls began posting edited photos of Crowder and misattributing quotes to him in an effort to paint him as racist or alt-right.\n\nCrowder's Twitter account is still reportedly limited, as is Jared Monroe's and Sven Computer's.
In an interview with The Dartmouth Review, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Christina Hoff Sommers, spoke about feminism, political correctness, and the state of free expression on college campuses.\n\nIn the interview, Sommers argued that girls and women are the privileged sex when it comes to educational status.\n\nGirls and women are the privileged sex in education. From preschool to graduate school, and across ethnic and class lines, women get better grades, they win most of the honors and prizes, and they're far more likely to go to college. Today women earn a majority of bachelor's degrees and advanced degrees. Latino girls are now slightly more likely to attend college than white boys. When an education policy analyst looked at current trends in higher education he quipped, only half in jest, The last male will graduate from college in 2068. Our schools have offered untold number of admirable and effective programs to strengthen girls in areas where they languished—in sports, math, and science. Where are the programs to help boys in areas where they falter: reading, writing, grades, school engagement and college matriculation? So far Congress, schools of education, school boards and the Department of Education have looked the other way.\n\nShe also argued that universities must move away from identity politics if they are to return to a place where all ideas are welcome to be explored.\n\nTo save themselves universities must overcome their obsession with identity politics. There are too many classes focused on narrow topics: too few on transcendent works of genius. Students complain, I don't see myself in the curriculum. You are not supposed to. The purpose of education is to take you outside yourself into a larger world. Conservative scholars can't do much to turn things around. They have all but disappeared from campus. So it's up to liberal academics to restore sanity. Will they do it? I'm not so sure. Anyone who challenges the identitarians will face a lot of hostility and be told the check their privilege. Who wants that? But there is one hopeful development. The University of Chicago has indicated that it will not be going the way of safe-space, trigger warnings and censorship. Some have suggested that universities need to be clear about their primary mission: They can pursue truth, at the expense of identity validation and emotional comfort–or they can choose comfort, and admit that they sometimes do so at the expense of truth. Either is fine, but at least students will have a choice.\n\nYou can read the entirety of the interview here.\n\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

Iconic fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld claims Meryl Streep wanted to be paid to wear one of his Chanel dresses to the 2017 Academy Awards.\n\nStreep was reportedly set to wear Chanel on the red carpet before one of her handlers allegedly informed the fashion house to halt production of the dress.\n\nI made a sketch, and we started to make the dress, Lagerfeld told WWD. The German designer said someone from Streep's team called days later and said, Don't continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us.\n\nA genius actress, but cheapness also, no? he said.\n\nStreep, who's nominated for Best Actress for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins, denied that she demanded money to wear a dress at Sunday's awards ceremony.\n\nA representative for the three time Oscar-winner said the claim is absolutely false, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nLagerfeld told WWD that it is Chanel policy not to pay entertainers to wear their couture to awards shows, despite what other fashion houses might do.\n\nAfter we gift her a dress that's 100,000 euros [$105,000], we found later we had to pay [for her to wear it]. We give them dresses, we make the dresses, but we don't pay, Lagerfeld explained.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson
Universities in Britain have offered Irish students up to £110 to travel home and vote for liberalising abortion laws, as recent opinion polls show a serious narrowing of the 'yes' camp's lead ahead of Friday's referendum.\n\nAssisted by the far-left National Union of Students (NUS), universities have set up bursaries to help students fly back for the vote, which would repeal the Eighth Amendment of Ireland's constitution which grants the unborn child an equal right to life as its mother.\n\nStudent newspaper the Tab reported Tuesday that at least six universities are involved in efforts funding Irish students to fly back and cast a vote, including Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham, Nottingham, Goldsmiths, and the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.\n\nAsserting that it supports the right of pregnant people rather than 'pregnant women' to abort their baby, the NUS said it would match any monetary contribution towards a student's travel to Ireland made by local union branches up to a maximum of £110 — which it warns is the cut-off for political 'donations' under Irish law before funding must be declared.\n\nIrish Pro-Lifers Accuse Google of 'Rigging' the Abortion Referendum by Banning Ads https://t.co/6ICDcPsT5a via @BreitbartNews — Thomas D. Williams (@tdwilliamsrome) May 10, 2018\n\nDespite almost unanimous support from the media and establishment and foreign money having poured into Ireland — the target of an international campaign to dismantle its strict abortion laws — opinion polls show repealing the Eighth Amendment has only a narrow lead.\n\nWhile stressing they support the 'yes' camp, the unions at Oxford and Nottingham said the bursaries are available to all Irish students regardless of how they intend to vote. At Cambridge, however, the women's campaign said funding is dependent on voting to repeal abortion laws.\n\nConstant political campaigning by the NUS, which is affiliated with around 600 student unions accounting for more than 95 per cent of higher and further education unions in the UK, has led thousands of students calling for their universities to break ties with the far-left organisation.\n\nReport: More than 100 Radical Speakers Invited to British Universitieshttps://t.co/Msc7m70yPL — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 29, 2017\n\n#LiberateMyDegree, which demands universities dismantle the Eurocentric curriculum and prioritise narrowing achievement gaps between groups over providing high-quality courses, supports 'Preventing Prevent — We are Students Not Suspects'.\n\nThe union's campaign to abolish the government's counter-terror programme has become a vehicle for extremist interests, The Henry Jackson Society think-tank warned earlier this year.\n\nStudents Not Suspects slams the chilling effect Prevent could have on radical Islamic preachers' freedom to speak on campus, while at the same the union's 'No Platform' policy barring speakers with racist and fascist views is routinely used to block anyone with socially-conservative views, and even feminists who believe that male-bodied individuals who identify as transgender are not female.
The Twilight Zone economy we are currently experiencing could implode if interest rates were to ever normalize.\n\nEven mere whispers of this possibility can never be publicly acknowledged by any currently serving central banker; to do so would seriously undermine their legitimacy in the eyes of the public, who have become accustomed to their spoon-fed propaganda. These experts are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the problems we now face. They allow politicians to spend beyond their respective countries' means, then give them blank checks to bail them out whenever they get into too much trouble.\n\nBuilt upon an ever-increasing mountain of debt, any significant uptick in rates could bring the whole financial system down. Most existing borrowers, be they individuals or institutions, would likely be unable to handle higher payments if forced to refinance at pre-2008 levels.\n\nHave you ever met a lender or real estate broker who tried to get you to spend LESS money?\n\nHow many of you reading this right now could make payments on a new 30-fixed rate home mortgage if rates rose from the current 3.6% to 5.0%? What if they increased to 6.0%, where they were in the summer of 2008?\n\nOn a much larger scale, from businesses and entire nations, the hard choice of living within one's means has been rejected by short-sighted voters who seemingly aren't doing the math or thinking of the implications beyond just a few years.\n\nNo one above an elementary school education can deny that it is mathematically impossible to pay down our current debt bubble with sound currency or without using questionable accounting methods. The world's financial system has crossed the Rubicon in its ability to fix this problem without all future growth and productivity gains being consumed by interest rate expenses.\n\nLook at the two charts below, taken from the U.S. Debt Clock, and note the debt per taxpayer sections (a 14x jump from 1980 to 2016). During this timeframe, income has failed to keep pace with the mounting debt.\n\nMarch 16, 1980\n\nMarch 16, 2016\n\nThis next two chart show how the Keynesian shell game has worked since we adopted the fiat money system on August 15, 1971. Debt has grown at more than twice the rate of GDP. This is nothing short of a debt-based Ponzi scheme that has entered the terminal stages. Everything has its limits, even debt. The recent adoption of negative interest rates by over 20 advanced countries as some solution to this failure is akin to financial chemotherapy that will likely damage or kill, rather than provide the needed cure.\n\nThe economy would be in an official financial depression if not for the world's central banks conspiring to push rates down—effectively stealing from savers. This policy is no different than cutting off your leg to feed yourself when on the brink of starvation—you may no longer be hungry, but you'll still bleed out. When the Fed drops rates to benefit people purchasing and refinancing homes, for example, savers have to resort to eating into their principal. This one action is likely going to be the cause of the next mounting financial crisis: pension and insurance failures.\n\nSince Home Mortgage rates peaked in October of 1981, the U.S. economy has experienced an unrelenting tailwind. This fall in interest costs has allowed everyone in the economy, from public to private, to borrow and refinance. This cycle, as depicted in the chart below, highlights just how far rates have fallen since October of 1981.\n\nRather than use the savings gained from the lower rates to pay down the principal on the debt, the opposite has occurred—it has encouraging even more reckless borrowing. The central bankers are playing with fire by allowing this debt to continue to expand. A day of reckoning is on the horizon; one which will likely start in Japan and be followed by Europe. These two economies are in the worst financial shape, hamstrung by falling birth rates and debt loads well above 100% of GDP.\n\nBut aren't corporations doing well?\n\nCorporate earnings are being propped up by rolling (refinancing) their debts into lower and lower rates, and borrowing to buy back outstanding shares. If a firm can purchase 10% of their outstanding stock, then earnings get a nice boost without them ever having to increase sales. This buyback strategy has buoyed some of the largest firms all over the world, as they are the ones able to borrow at the most favorable rates.\n\nLooking at a real world example, one might wonder what might necessitate a company like Apple to borrow money. The most profitable publically traded company in the whole world, with a pristine balance sheet and billions in cash holdings, is borrowing money and buying back stock. This is NOT a recommendation on the purchase of Apple stock, but instead an observation about that nature of what low-interest rates do to pervert the capitalist system. Historically, firms once borrowed to invest in new equipment and R&D. Today, they are engaging in a buyback orgy that is significantly larger than equity purchases by institutions and retail investors.\n\nThe chart below shows how fund flows have been negative for five quarters now, and that even when they have been positive, they are dwarfed by corporate purchases. The largest buyers of stocks have been and continue to be corporations. This is what has been fueling the Fed's wealth effect manipulations. This begs the question: What would happen if this buyback bonanza significantly slowed or stopped?\n\nThe solution to all of this is to stop the manipulation of interest rates and begin the painful reversal by beginning to live within ones means. Stagnation is the best we can hope for going forward. The longer this game of manipulating interest rates go on, the larger the future problems we will have to face. No one likes pain. No one likes change. Nevertheless, those days of whistling past the graveyard have passed. If we act now, the hope of living through this, rather than it crumbling all around us, increases exponentially. We must face reality and own up to our obligations by paying our debts. We must accept responsibility for our misguided collective mindset of choosing to have our cake and eat it too—the philosophy that has led us to this point and that we can no longer afford to indulge.\n\n***Nothing in this article should be taken as an endorsement to buy or sell any security.
Rome (AFP) – Europe's coronavirus hotspot Italy shut all schools and universities on Wednesday in a bid to stop the deadly disease from spreading, as governments bolstered supplies and intensified protective measures.\n\nWith cases and deaths rising around the world even as the rate of new infections slows in the virus epicentre China, Germany on Wednesday warned that the outbreak had turned into a global pandemic.\n\nMore than 90,000 people have been infected and around 3,200 have died worldwide from the virus, which has now reached 81 countries and territories.\n\nItaly reported 28 more deaths on Wednesday taking the toll to 107, the deadliest outbreak outside China.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has so far refrained from declaring a pandemic, but fear of the virus' spread has already prompted panic buying, hoarding and theft, along with warnings over shortages of protective gear.\n\nIn Germany health minister Jens Spahn said the outbreak had become a global pandemic — meaning it is spreading in several regions through local transmission — telling lawmakers we have not yet reached the peak of the outbreak.\n\nThe vast majority of global deaths and infections are in China, where COVID-19 first emerged late last year, but figures from Beijing on Wednesday showed just 119 new cases over the previous 24 hours — the lowest daily number since January.\n\n– Kissing ban –\n\nAs the virus continues its march across the world, governments are scrambling to tighten prevention efforts.\n\nItaly has seen its outbreak continue to swell despite tough measures including a quarantine of 11 towns with 50,000 people in the north.\n\nThe country's new measures include an unpopular month-long nationwide ban on fan attendance at sports events, as well as advice for people to avoid greetings of kissing on the cheek or shaking hands.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conti said the country could tackle the outbreak as long as it remained contained.\n\nBut in case of exponential growth, not just Italy but any other country in the world would not be able to manage the situation, he said in a video message posted on Facebook Wednesday about the new restrictions.\n\nIran, where 92 people have died from the disease, schools have been shut, while major cultural and sporting events have been suspended.\n\nIn the United States, where the death toll rose to 11 on Wednesday, lawmakers in Congress reached a deal to provide more than $8 billion to fight the outbreak.\n\nCountries also continue to crack down on international travel.\n\nIsrael extended its mandatory quarantine measures — already in place for travellers from Italy and some Asian countries — to cover people from France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.\n\n– Skyrocketing prices –\n\nThe WHO has said masks, goggles and other protective equipment used by health workers were running out because of rising demand, hoarding and misuse.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that prices of masks have surged six-fold and the cost of ventilators has tripled.\n\nTedros said the WHO had shipped more than half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but warned that supplies are rapidly depleting.\n\nFrom western Europe to eastern Asia, supermarket shelves have been stripped of supplies in recent weeks, including toilet paper and hand sanitiser.\n\nIn Indonesia, police seized 600,000 face masks from a warehouse after the first confirmed cases of coronavirus sparked panic buying.\n\nIn France, where more than 280 people are infected, the government said it would requisition all face mask stocks and production in the coming months in response to the outbreak.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia the government banned the export of medical masks, and Italy said it was importing 800,000 of them from South Africa, though it needs 10 million in total.\n\n– 'Serious threat' –\n\nAmerican businesses are increasingly concerned over access to goods and the overall economic outlook is more uncertain, the US Federal Reserve said in a period survey released on Wednesday.\n\nThe impact of the virus has spread beyond supply chains — stock markets have rumbled as warnings from financial bodies mount that the virus could push countries into recession.\n\nThe IMF said on Wednesday the epidemic posed a serious threat and would slow global growth to below the 2.9 percent posted last year.\n\nUnfortunately over the past week we've seen a shift to a more adverse scenario for the global economy, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said.\n\nEurozone ministers agreed after a meeting that they were ready to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth, according to Eurogroup president Mario Centeno.\n\nHis comments came after the European Union said two of its employees tested positive for the virus, while Poland, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile all reported their first cases in the past 24 hours.\n\nEven cinemagoers were not immune from the effects of the virus — as the producers of the latest James Bond film pushed back the release of the forthcoming No Time To Die from April to November.
A purported field organizer for Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) 2020 White House campaign warned that catering to the transgender community is an election loser for Democrats, according to a newly-released undercover Project Veritas video.\n\nThe staffer, identified as Angel Alicea, is caught on film expressing frustration over the Warren campaign's intense focus on social justice, particularly, stressing the importance of using pronouns to address others, rather than talk more about how the Massachusetts Democrat will create jobs with wages that improve one's standard of living.\n\nBREAKING: #Expose2020 Part 5: @ewarren Field Organizer @Los_ANGELes2 Blasts Campaign; Caught on Tape Saying They are Self-Destructing on Gender Issues. No One Gives a F**k About a G** D**n Pronoun…People Want to Know How to Create a Job pic.twitter.com/DmM5PNjwSa — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) February 3, 2020\n\nAt the end of the day if we're gonna prioritize pronouns over making sure people have a decent standard of living, that's wrong, Alicea tells a Project Veritas journalist. And when you come from where I come from, no one gives a fuck about a god damn pronoun. People want to know how to create a job.\n\nWhen you put that over making sure people have decent jobs and healthcare, like, it's a fucking no-brainer why we're going to God damn lose an election, he adds.\n\nThese comments stand in stark contrast to Warren, who has made transgender rights a key focus of her presidential platform. Last month, Warren pledged only to appoint a Secretary of Education that a transgender child approved of.\n\nI'm going to have a Secretary of Education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf, and only if this person believes that our Secretary or Secretary of Education nominee is absolutely committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone will that person actually be advanced to be Secretary of Education, the senator told supporters at a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Two weeks prior, Warren vowed to ensure transgender women aren't in the same prisons as men if she is elected president.\n\nWe have to protect all of our people, and it works all the way through the system, the senator vowed. One of the things we have to think about as a nation—we have to stop putting trans women who are incarcerated into prisons with men where they are at risk. It is our responsibility.\n\nI will direct the Bureau of Prisons to end the Trump Administration's dangerous policy of imprisoning transgender people in facilities based on their sex assigned at birth and ensure that all facilities meet the needs of transgender people, including by providing medically necessary care, like transition-related surgeries, while incarcerated, she added.\n\nProject Veritas' latest video is part of its ongoing #Expose2020 series. The journalism outfit recently released footage of several field organizers for Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) presidential campaign. One organizer, identified as Kyle Jurek, warned that Milwaukee, host of this year's Democratic National Convention, will burn and police will be beaten if Sanders is not the party's nominee.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled on behalf of the State of Texas and upheld most of the new anti-sanctuary city law that went into effect September 1, 2017. The three-judge panel unanimously overturned most of the lower court's ruling that temporarily blocked some provisions of the law.\n\nA group of cities and counties sued to overturn the law before it went into effect. In August, U.S. District Court Judge Orlando Garcia a preliminary injunction blocking parts of the law known as SB4, Breitbart News' Ian Mason reported. About a month later, the Fifth Circuit sided with Texas and overturned Orlando's injunction, Breitbart Texas reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, the three-judge appellate panel unanimously ruled the State can move forward with enforcing most provisions of the law, the Texas Tribune reported. The only part of the law that remains unenforceable at this point is the provision that provides punishment to local officials who are adopting, enforcing or endorsing policies that block or limit enforcement of immigration laws. Specifically, the judges said the injunction only applies to the word endorse.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted his response to the court's ruling. Policies upheld by Federal Court of Appeals, the governor tweeted. Allegations of discrimination were rejected. Law is in effect.\n\nBREAKNG: Texas Ban on Sanctuary City Policies upheld by Federal Court of Appeals. Allegations of discrimination were rejected. Law is in effect. — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) March 13, 2018\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton also responded positively to the announcement by the court.\n\nI'm pleased the Fifth Circuit recognized that Senate Bill 4 is lawful, constitutional and protects the safety of law enforcement officers and all Texans, Paxton said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. Enforcing immigration law prevents the release of individuals from custody who have been charged with serious crimes. Dangerous criminals shouldn't be allowed back into our communities to possibly commit more crimes.\n\nPaxton cited the court's decision (attached below) as authored by Judge Edith Jones:\n\nWith one exception, SB 4's provisions do not, on their face, violate the Constitution. For the following reasons, we uphold the statute in its entirety except for the application of the endorsement prohibition, Tex. Gov't Code § 752.053(a)(1), to elected officials.\n\nThe state's attorney general's legal team presented oral arguments on November 7, Paxton stated.\n\nGovernor Abbott made passing a bill to stop sanctuary cities in the Lone Star State during his State of the State Address. This is the session we will ban sanctuary cities, to the joint session of the Texas Legislature. Specifically, the governor referred to State Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock) who filed SB4, calling for sanctions against sanctuary jurisdictions within the Lone Star State.\n\nTravis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez became the poster-child for passing the bill after she quickly reversed her department's policies of cooperating with federal immigration officials shortly after being sworn in in January 2017.\n\nThe governor quickly stripped Travis County of state law enforcement grants. Travis County currently receives $125 million in state and federal grants that flow through the Office of the Governor, Governor Abbott's spokesman John Wittman told Breitbart Texas at the time. The governor's office is currently evaluating how much of that $125 million could be taken away under SB4.\n\nThe bill, which provides criminal and civil penalties to public officials who block enforcement of immigration law, passed the legislature in May and went to Abbott's desk for signature. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas immediately after signing the bill into law, Abbott said law enforcement and other officials implementing sanctuary policies that release criminal aliens with immigration detainers will now be subject to the stiffest penalties in America.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Sheriff Hernandez responded to the courts ruling, stating:\n\nWords just can't express how disappointed I am with this ruling. We are reviewing the Court's opinion to determine any additional steps that need to be taken. We will continue to follow the law as provided to us by the courts in this matter and we will rise to the challenge of keeping Travis County safe, although our ability to overcome fear and foster cooperation within the immigrant community is a greater challenge now.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials reported in March 2017 that Travis County led the nation in the release of criminal aliens in its weekly Declined Detainer Outcome Report. Sheriff Sanctuary Sally Hernandez's (a nickname given to her by her opponent during the 2016 sheriff's race) office 70 of the 206 criminal aliens released by sanctuary jurisdictions, Breitbart Texas reported.\n\nI was shocked at the number of violent criminals set free by Travis County–and these are just the ones that ICE knows about because they were re-arrested, Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughan told Breitbart Texas at the time. There could be many others who have not yet been found by ICE. It's wrong for Travis County to put the public safety at risk for its narrow political purposes, and wrong to put ICE and other law enforcement officers at risk when they have to take to the streets to catch these people, or when they re-offend.\n\nIn January 2018, the Texas Office of the Attorney General confirmed to Breitbart Texas that it was investigating San Antonio Police Chief William McManus for possible violations of the SB4 law.\n\nThe investigation could lead to a criminal prosecution under the SB4 anti-sanctuary city law passed in the 2017 legislative session.\n\nOur office has received multiple complaints alleging that the San Antonio police chief violated Senate Bill 4, the Texas law prohibiting sanctuary city policies that the attorney general has authority to enforce, OAG spokesman Mark Rylander said in response to an inquiry from Breitbart Texas. We have begun our investigation and demanded that the San Antonio Police Department preserve all of its records relating to the incident.\n\nSeveral citizens have filed complaints with the Texas Attorney General's Office regarding an incident on December 23 involving the release of numerous suspected illegal aliens, Assistant Texas Attorney General Cleve W. Doty wrote in a letter to San Antonio officials.\n\nThe Texas Attorney General's Office will investigate these complaints and the procedure in Senate Bill 4 contemplates litigation, Doty continued. We demand that you affirmatively preserve all relevant materials.\n\nThe case is City of El Cenizo v. Texas, No. 17-50762 in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

A bill introduced on March 15 re-categorizes the crime of failing to file firearms transfer papers, making a failure to file punishable at any point during one's lifetime.\n\nCurrent law requires that all firearm transfers be reported to the California Department of Justice via a mail-in form announcing that the gun has changed hands. The Firearms Policy Coalition reports that the form costs $19, and the new bill, Senate Bill 1037, categorizes the failure to file as a continuing offense. The punishment for this offense can range from a misdemeanor to a felony.\n\nThe text of SB 1037 reads:\n\nExisting law requires reports of ownership be filed within certain grace periods for firearms brought or imported into the state by a personal firearms importer or licensed collector. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor. Existing law provides that failure to submit these reports within the grace period is not a continuing offense. This bill would provide that those violations committed on or after January 1, 2017, would be a continuing offense. The bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a handgun, punishable by a misdemeanor or a felony.\n\nThe Firearms Policy Coalition observes:\n\n[California] gun owners are subject to a dizzying array of law at every level of government, and SB 1037 sets a history-making precedent that gun owners should be haunted for life for an act that involved perhaps nothing more than ignorance or forgetfulness.\n\nIt argues that SB 1037 elevates victimless firearms crime to the level of violent crimes as far as the statute of limitations for punishment is concerned.\n\nSB 1037 is sponsored by Sen. Ben Allen (D-Redondo Beach).\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

Home Secretary Priti Patel is just about the only proper Conservative within the Boris Johnson administration — so naturally, the left-leaning Remainer Deep State is trying to destroy her and claim her scalp.\n\nAll week, the media has been full of stories — leaked, of course, by her Deep State enemies in the Civil Service — about what an awful, useless minister Patel is. One egregious rumour claimed that MI5 officials were withholding intelligence from her because they did not trust her. (MI5 has robustly denied this). Other reports have claimed that she is a workplace bully in the habit of swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands.\n\nThe last claim was made by Sir Philip Rutnam, the senior Home Office official who publicly resigned at the weekend in front of a BBC camera crew, in order to cause maximum embarrassment to Patel and the government.\n\nRutnam — nicknamed Sir Calamity because in his time as a senior civil servant he has presided over so many cock-ups and disasters — is the very embodiment of the kind of remote, arrogant, complacent, intractable and devious Deep State mandarin that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings is trying to purge from the Civil Service.\n\nLike most of the Civil Service, Rutnam is an ardent Remainer. Though his job is to implement government policy, Rutnam appeared to spend more of his time trying to frustrate it – especially with regards to the plans for Brexit, which Rutnam claimed, were too ambitious to complete in time for the December deadline.\n\nAccording to the Sun's account of their spat:\n\nBut Ms Patel's allies last night retaliated to dub Sir Philip a classic, old school establishment mandarin who is overly cautious. One said: He is very good at blocking things without saying it. It is never a flat out 'no', just lots of 'ooh minister, that's very courageous'.\n\nRutnam, in other words, was ripe for the chop. But by jumping before he was pushed, he was able to present his departure as a case of high moral principle – while sticking the knife into Patel.\n\nHis pompous resignation letter gives a pretty good idea of the kind of man Rutnam is:\n\nOne of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our 35,000 people. This created tension with the Home Secretary, and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours. I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands – behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out.\n\nIt's really not difficult to read between the lines here. Rutnam – and his fellow civil servants – tried to frustrate Patel rather than help her. Patel wasn't having this and made her displeasure known. This then enabled the Civil Service to pretend that the issue was Patel's workplace bullying rather than its own institutional sclerosis and incompetence.\n\nThe liberal elite hunts in packs, so it comes as no surprise whatsoever to find that the BBC is ganging up with the Civil Service to try to oust Patel.\n\nBREAKING: A formal complaint about Priti Patel's conduct was made when she was Employment Minister at Department for Work and Pensions,@BBCNews has been told. Complaint is believed to have been made by a member of her private office… — Danny Shaw (@DannyShawBBC) March 1, 2020\n\nAccording to an analysis conducted by Conservative Woman, the BBC's coverage has been massively biased against Patel and pro-Rutnam.\n\nBroadcasting House: Lord Kerslake (pro-Sir Philip / anti-Priti) The World This Weekend: Jonathan Powell (pro-Sir Philip / anti-Priti); Lord Butler (neither one nor the other). PM: Dave Penman, Yvette Cooper (pro-Sir Philip / anti-Priti); Crispin Blunt (pro-Priti / anti-Sir Philip) BBC News Channel: Lord Kerslake (pro-Sir Philip / anti-Priti); Owen Jones (pro-Sir Philip / anti-Priti); Cindy Yu (neither one nor the other); Sir Anthony Seldon (pro-Sir Philip / anti-Priti); Yvette Cooper (pro-Sir Philip / anti-Priti); Sebastian Payne (neither one nor the other).\n\nThis is a battle the government has to win. If it loses, what's left of its credibility will be shredded for it will have shown itself to be powerless against the Deep State.\n\nThe Deep State — politically correct, rampantly Europhile, endemically Nanny Statist — is the embodiment of everything the British people voted against when they voted Leave in the Brexit Referendum.\n\nTake yourselves out of the Whitehall protectorate for a moment. Some of the claims being made, hurty emails etc are utterly feeble and petulant and in stark contrast to the needs of ordinary people in the real world where crime & ASB blight lives. #HitJob https://t.co/2ghcb3q26l — Ian Acheson (@NotThatBigIan) March 4, 2020\n\nAs Ian Acheson, himself a former Home Office civil servant, rightly suggests in that tweet, most British people have many, many more important things to worry about than whether or not Priti Patel bullied a senior civil servant so that 'he signed off with stress.'\n\nNo one likes a bully. But equally no one likes the tendency — especially prevalent among the kind of Social Justice Warrior snowflake types rampant in the Civil Service — towards using mental health issues as a way of avoiding responsibility for laziness or incompetence.\n\nAcheson's article for Cap X about his experiences at the Home Office is well worth a read.\n\nHe writes:\n\nBut I have also encountered many more people in public service who allege bullying or go off sick with 'stress' at the point where they are facing exposure and accountability for failure to deliver. This can also be the final throw of the dice for the bureaucrat who, having used all his obfuscatory ammunition to no effect, deploys the 'B' word.\n\nAnd he goes on to spell out just why it's so important that Boris stands up for Patel:\n\nTo put it bluntly, people burying their kids due to knife crime, fearful about violent extremism, plagued by a collapse of civility and antisocial behaviour, marooned in postcodes where the only visible authority is a parking ticket aren't interested in the bruised feelings of some well-heeled permanent secretaries. They want things done. Their preference will be to back a Home Secretary who is on their side and impatient for results. The political rhymes with the personal. And that constituency dwarfs the Whitehall machine.\n\nAbsolutely right. The voters who gave Boris Johnson an 80-seat majority did not do so in order to buoy up the overmanned, overpaid, self-serving Civil Service — not least because that Civil Service is full of people who think that Brexit voters are ignorant, fascistic thickos.\n\nReports today suggest that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is 'sticking by' Priti Patel (who, symbolically, sat next to him on the government benches). Boris is not stupid; his chief advisor Dominic Cummings even less so: lose this one and they lose the entire game.
Tennessee became one of the first states on Tuesday to pass legislation designed to stem the assault on free speech at its public universities.\n\nThe eight page Campus Free Speech Protection Act was signed into law by Governor Bill Haslam after passing the Tennessee House of Representatives and Senate by votes of 85-7 and 30-0, respectively.\n\nThe law mandates that public colleges and universities in Tennessee adopt free speech policies consistent with the University of Chicago's 2015 Stone Report. Chaired by Chicago Law Professor Geoffrey Stone, the report's findings were adopted last year to great fanfare. Despite his emphasis on campus free speech, Professor Stone is hardly a right-wing ideologue. He clerked with archliberal Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, chaired the Board of the American Constitution Society, a leading lefty-leaning lawyers' association, and served on the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe Tennessee law will expressly prohibit the use of so-called free speech zones to limit the areas of campus on which certain viewpoints can be heard. University administrators are prohibited from rescinding the invitations from students or faculty of speakers with whom they disagree or fear will cause disruption.\n\nThe law also demands campuses use the actual legal definition of student-on-student harassment handed down by the Supreme Court, behavior so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims' educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities.\n\nAccording to a group instrumental in advocating free speech on campus, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), far lower standards of harassment are routinely used by administrators to prohibit speech that distresses or causes emotional discomfort to some students.\n\nFinally, the Campus Free Speech Protection Act will forbid viewpoint-based discrimination in the distribution of funds for student groups and prevent faculty from being punished for what they choose to say in the classroom unless it is not reasonably germane to the subject matter of the class as broadly construed, and comprises a substantial portion of classroom instruction.\n\nThe law comes at a time when the ability for differing viewpoints, especially those on the political right, to be heard on campuses has come under simultaneous attack from radical leftist groups and university administrations.\n\nConservative columnist Ann Coulter, for example, saw her invited speaking engagement at University of California Berkeley last month moved, curtailed, and finally canceled because of security concerns. The threat of leftist violence gave administrators the cover needed to add greater requirements on her event.\n\nThose same threats were made good only two months earlier when Berkeley Police and University of California security stood down while violent anti-fascist rioters ran rampant, assaulting students, destroying property, and forcing the cancellation of a much heralded event by then-Breitbart News Tech Editor Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nOn the other side of the country, the same tactics, with the tacit approval of campus leadership, led to the physical assault of a professor at a ruined speaking engagement by Harvard social scientist and American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray at Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nInstead of taking a stand against this agitation and fighting for the diversity of viewpoints in their institutions, universities in recent years have imposed politically correct speech codes on students and faculty, restricted controversial speech to free speech zones, and actively torpedoed primarily right-leaning student groups and invited speakers.\n\nThe Tennessee law represents a growing movement by state legislatures to counter these trends in the public institutions over which they have authority. It represents perhaps the broadest combination so far passed into law of the different types of campus free speech protections being supported by advocates nationwide.\n\nIn the last two years, Virginia, Missouri, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Kentucky have all adopted some version of the Campus Free Expression Act advocated by FIRE, mostly with broad bipartisan support. This relatively narrow legislation bans free speech zones from public universities. Several other state governments, including Berkeley's overseer California, are now considering similar legislation.\n\nA broader piece of model legislation, promulgated by the free-market think tank the Goldwater Institute, incorporates the reasoning of the same University of Chicago Stone Report used in the Tennessee law passed Tuesday to demand a policy of commitment to viewpoint neutral free speech protection by university administrations. This model Campus Free Speech Ac would demand university administrators punish students who disrupt invited speakers and other students exercising their constitutional right to free speech. Most controversially, it would require university administrators to suspend for a year any student twice found to have done so.\n\nLegislatures in North Carolina, Louisiana, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan are all considering versions of the Campus Free Speech Act. North Carolina's bill has already passed that state's House by a vote of 88-32.\n\nThe new Tennessee law incorporates elements of both pieces of model legislation, but takes its own approach, foregoing the mandatory punishments for student speech-infringes and including protections for faculty members who say things that may offend students.\n\nIn a post celebrating the passage of the bill, FIRE Executive Director Robert Shibley said:\n\n[The Tennessee law] is the most comprehensive state legislation protecting free speech on college campuses that we've seen be passed anywhere in the country. It is gratifying to see the Tennessee legislature take decisive action to protect the expressive rights of students and faculty, especially in light of the number of restrictive speech codes across the country and the recent controversies over speech on campus.\n\nFIRE Legislative and Policy Director Joe Cohn told Breitbart News that he was heartened by the bill's passage and that he hoped it would inspire other state legislatures going forward.\n\nThe law will take full effect on January 1, 2018.
On Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked guest Frank Gaffney about a post he wrote on the Center for Security Policy blog, in which he endorsed a call by Jeanine Pirro of Fox News for House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign following the failure of the House Obamacare replacement bill.\n\nAs he wrote in the post, Gaffney stipulated that health care is not my field, by any means, so he did not mean to criticize the substance of the ill-fated House bill.\n\nI think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach, he said. Paul Ryan, who is supposed to be helping President Trump get through his agenda in the House of Representatives and the congress more generally, should have known better. He either didn't, which justifies removal on the grounds of incompetence, or did – in which case I think the argument is that he's simply not a reliable partner for the president in getting this agenda done.\n\nOn either grounds, I think that it would be necessary for the country, not just for the Trump presidency but for the country, to have leaders in both the House and the Senate who want to ensure that the president's projects, the president's agenda, the president's promises to the American people – which I think were momentous, not just for health care reform but in so many other respects, including the return to the prospect of peace through strength, which if course is near and dear to my heart, and I think yours Raheem – is going to be a necessary condition going forward, he argued.\n\nFrom a layman's perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist – well, 'Obamacare Lite' it's been called – approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for, Gaffney said. I think that's what Donald Trump set out to do. That's what he promised the voters. It's what I think you could get a majority of the Congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you're not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support.\n\nIt goes back to kind of the fatal flaws of Obamacare, and just making it a little better at the margins, which is I think, at best, what you could say Ryan was up to. It was clearly unsatisfactory and was, as I say, doomed to fail, he pronounced.\n\nGaffney added compliments to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and the House Freedom Caucus for ensuring that it did fail.\n\nI think they've done a great service, despite all the brickbats being thrown their way, for President Trump as well as for the country, he said.\n\nGaffney conceded that choosing a possible replacement for Rep. Ryan as Speaker of the House was a difficult task.\n\nI think there are a number of people who could probably command the support of the majority of the House, he said. It wouldn't be for me to pick them. Some have been willing to serve in the past. Daniel Webster comes to mind, he seems to be a very presentable guy. It would be obviously up to him or others in the House to stand for this, if in fact Paul Ryan were to create a vacancy – which I hope he will do.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Sen. Tom Cotton successfully blocked House Speaker Paul Ryan from outsourcing 5,000 white-collar jobs to Irish graduates each year, according to multiple sources.\n\nCotton blocked the outsourcing bill by putting a last-minute legislative hold on the proposal, ensuring it could get through the Senate's lame-duck session.\n\nThe move also denied a political victory to Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer, who had pushed for the outsourcing bill. Schumer and other Democrats were expected to claim GOP approval of the Irish giveaway reveals racist motives for apparent GOP opposition to much larger giveaways to people from Africa, South America, India, or China.\n\nThe Arkansas senator's action also prevented a political headache for many GOP politicians who would have faced a backlash from many Americans graduates for not opposing Ryan's bill to outsource jobs to Irish graduates by expanding the existing Australian-only E-3 visa program. The giveaway bill offered no reciprocal benefits for young American graduates.\n\nCotton also aided President Donald Trump by preventing Congress from putting a Hire Irish bill on his desk just two years after Trump promised a Hire American policy in his administration:\n\nU.S. and Irish politicians are quietly cooperating to transfer 5000 white-collar jobs per year from American graduates to Irish grads via the E-3 visa program. A sneak Senate vote is due soon. In 'fair trade,' US retirees could spend their 401Ks in Ireland https://t.co/CKRIerTh4E — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 14, 2018\n\nNationwide, roughly 1.5 million U.S. white-collar jobs are being held by foreign temporary workers, ensuring lower salaries for American graduates. This massive white-collar outsourcing industry exists because the federal H-1B, L-1, J-1, TN, OPT, and CPT visa programs allow U.S. companies to import temporary foreign workers and also provide green cards to roughly 70,000 foreign employees each year.\n\nBreitbart News extensively reported the Irish giveaway bill:\n\nPaul Ryan's jobs giveaway to Irish graduates is prompting Democrats to start throwing about claims of ethnic favoritism. Whatever.\n\nFollowing the money is a far more interesting and revealing option.\n\nBut it is also rarely done by politicians or media. https://t.co/IzzU0HFobX — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 17, 2018\n\nAdvocates for the Irish giveaway will try again in 2019 to pass their bill, perhaps burying it within a routine funding bill or as part of a larger migration and labor legislative package.\n\nA noble effort failed, said an Irish-American website that championed the E-3 visas. IrishCentral.com said: We Irish are used to that and we are used to picking ourselves up and trying harder the next time. Despite Cotton … we will not give up. Given all our people gave to America we can never stop trying.\n\nNationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland:
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has granted two migrant transport NGOs permission to drop migrants off in Italian ports as the country looks at renewing funds for a migrant agency previously defunded by Matteo Salvini.\n\nThe Italian leader granted port access to the Sea Watch 3 vessel with 119 migrants on board on Tuesday, with the vessel docking at the port of Taranto, while the port of Messina is expected to receive a vessel from the Spanish NGO Open Arms, Il Giornale reports.\n\nWe are happy that our guests can finally step on safe land, but there is still a lot that needs to be changed: Shady deals with Libya, further ad-hoc agreements, EU-funded human rights abuses, this must stop! Sea-Watch stated on Twitter.\n\nThe move comes as Democratic Party (PD) Chamber leader Graziano Delrio announced that the government would be looking at reintroducing the protection system for asylum seekers and refugees (Sprar) that had seen its centres closed and defunded by the security decree of former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.\n\nItaly: Migrant Landings Halved in 2019 Due to Salvini Policies https://t.co/qpIN3431zK — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 26, 2019\n\nGiuseppe Civati, a former member of the PD, said that the Salvini migration and security decrees should be totally abolished and advocated the return of the so-called humanitarian protection residency permit which allows migrants who fail asylum claims because they are not legitimate refugees to remain in the country — a policy that was scrapped by Salvini.\n\nA 2017 report claimed that in 2016 just 2.65 per cent of the migrants who entered Italy were genuine refugees, but 21 per cent were still allowed to remain in the country under the humanitarian protection policy.\n\nWhile the number of migrants entering Italy was greatly reduced in the first half of 2019, thanks to the pro-border policies of Salvini, the number of new arrivals has risen since Salvini and his League (Lega) party left the government in September of 2019.\n\nFrom September to today, considering the immigrants arriving in Taranto, Italy has received 6,249 people. In the previous eight months, with the League in government and more favourable weather conditions for departures, there were 4,976 arrivals, Salvini said last month.\n\nItaly: Post-Salvini Left Govt Ups Migrant Allowance, 1,500 Sail from Libya in Four Days https://t.co/EsWhR1euEw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 14, 2020
E-commerce store provider Shopify has reportedly banned the store run by the Trump campaign and Trump organization, TrumpStore.com\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the e-commerce platform Shopify has banned TrumpStore.com, a website run by the Trump campaign and Trump Organization. The removal appears to be in response to the events in Washington D.C. this week.\n\nTrumpStore.com and the Trump campaign's Shop.DonaldJTrump.com, which sold Make America Great Again hats and other Trump-related merchandise, were both offline today following the events at Capitol Hill.\n\nShopify said in a statement: Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence. Based on recent events, we have determined that the actions by President Donald J. Trump violate our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibits promotion or support of organizations, platforms or people that threaten or condone violence to further a cause. As a result, we have terminated stores affiliated with President Trump.\n\nBreitbart News recently reported that both Facebook and Twitter have suspended President Trump's social media accounts, with Facebook extending the ban indefinitely.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the President's decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world. Zuckerberg added: We removed these statements yesterday because we judged that their effect — and likely their intent — would be to provoke further violence.\n\nTwitter is set to restore the President's account later today, Breitbart News will continue to update readers on events as more information is made available.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

The Times of Israel reports: A day after officials in Jerusalem said Israel and New Zealand agreed to end their diplomatic spat surrounding Wellington's co-sponsoring of an anti-settlements resolution at the United Nations, the country's leader rejected any suggestion that patching the rift equaled pulling support for the measure.\n\nIn a statement to the media Tuesday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English had sent a letter expressing regret over the harm the resolution had caused to ties between the countries. On Wednesday, English said Wellington did not regret co-sponsoring UN Security Council resolution 2334 and still opposed Israeli settlement building in the West Bank.\n\nThe resolution expressed longstanding and international policy and we stand by those positions, English told reporters, according to the New Zealand Herald. Whether we agree with a country or don't disagree with them, we certainly prefer to have diplomatic connection and it's good that Israel has seen fit to restore their post in New Zealand.\n\nRead more here.
The billion-dollar GOP mega-donor Koch network, headed by billionaire Charles Koch, is threatening to cut off donations to Republicans who objected to the electoral college results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement to Politico, CEO of the Kochs' Americans for Prosperity Emily Seidel suggested that the group's super PAC will weigh heavy who they will provide campaign cash to in the next election cycles following a riot that took place at the United States Capitol by protestors who opposed the presidential electoral college results.\n\nSpecifically, Seidel hinted that the Koch network would not donate to Republican lawmakers — such as Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO), Ted Cruz (R-TX), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), and Scott Perry (R-PA) — because they objected to the electoral college results.\n\nPolitico reports:\n\nLawmakers' actions leading up to and during last week's insurrection will weigh heavy in our evaluation of future support. And we will continue to look for ways to support those policymakers who reject the politics of division and work together to move our country forward, said Emily Seidel, CEO of Americans for Prosperity and senior adviser to AFP Action, the group's super PAC.\n\n[Emphasis added] Seidel's statement follows months of the network working to operate more independently of the Republican Party. Billionaire Charles Koch has become increasingly dissatisfied with the tactics and policies of President Donald Trump and did not support him during his 2016 or 2020 election bids. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe statement is the latest by the Koch network in which they have indicated strong opposition to the Republican Party's growing economic nationalist base that catapulted President Trump to victory in 2016 and helped a number of House Republicans win their seats in the 2020 election cycle.\n\nFor instance, the Koch network has expressed their wanting to work with President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on issues like amnesty for illegal aliens, expanding legal immigration levels, and returning toa free trade policy.\n\nThe Kochs are the latest to join a corporate donation blacklist in which multinational conglomerates, Wall Street banks, and Big Tech firms have said they will not donate to election-objecting Republicans.\n\nNew York Post Op-Ed Editor Sohrab Ahmari wrote that GOP-corporate divorce is a necessary step forward in order for the Republican Party to get back to its working and middle class roots — representing the interests of the least connected to the Washington, D.C. political establishments. Ahmari asked:\n\nSo why are conservatives fretting about corporate America cutting off the GOP, a process merely accelerated by last week's (disgraceful) mob assault on the Capitol. Did they think building a working-class party was going to be painless? That they could mouth pro-worker rhetoric while continuing to ignore workers' concerns on issues like immigration and wages? A country-club party with blue-collar décor?\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) urged Republicans to use the opportunity to swear off corporate super PAC money so as not to be beholden to wealthy, well-connected donors.\n\nI'm the only Republican in Congress who deplatformed the corporate PACs before they could deplatform me. I don't take ANY PAC money. My Republican colleagues should join me. It makes us more resilient to the cancel culture. pic.twitter.com/X4JWKNvhYO — Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) January 13, 2021\n\nGaetz told Newsmax this week:\n\nI noticed that corporate PACs are now saying that they will not support anyone who voiced objections to this last election and I've got to say I might be the only Republican who might miss them because I'm the only Republican in Congress who deplatformed the corporate PACs before they could deplatform.\n\nI don't take any PAC money and I would invite my Republican colleagues to join me in that because it makes us more resilient in this type of cancel culture that is quite magnified when you see it coordinated with big corporations, big media, and Big Tech, Gaetz said.\n\nIn the last election cycle, the Kochs' super PAC funded the campaigns of former Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS), Sen. Steven Daines (R-MT), Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), along with 30 other Republicans.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.
Approximately half of all teachers in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) district who were ordered to return to work and in-person instruction did not show up Monday after being pressured to stay out by the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), said the district's CEO.\n\nAccording to a report at NBC5 Chicago News, CPS CEO Dr. Janice Jackson said Tuesday 60.2 percent of all school-based staff who were ordered to report to work did so, including 49.7 percent of all teachers and 70 percent of all paraprofessionals.\n\nJackson said the fact that 60 percent of all staff returned was actually significant, considering the fact that they were pressured not to show up by the teachers' union, which continues to cite safety issues due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe report noted Jackson said:\n\nWe have sent notices to staff who did not return to ensure that our expectations are clear. And we are optimistic that more staff will report to work in the coming days. If staff choose not to attend and support the students who are relying on them, we will handle those on a school-by-school and case-by-case basis.\n\nThe CEO continued that the school district has an absent without leave policy which states individuals who are refusing to report to work and who will be considered absent without leave will face progressive discipline.\n\nAccording to the news report, when asked if the CPS policy could lead to teacher firings, Jackson replied, It is a progressive discipline policy.\n\nSo, we hope that by reminding folks of the expectations – look, at the end of the day, it serves no one's interest to fire teachers, so I'm not going to lead with that, Jackson said, continuing:\n\nBut we do have a clear policy around expectations to return to work. We should also be reminded that thousands of individuals in our school system have been reporting to work since the pandemic began: our nutrition support staff, our principals and administrators, some central office staff, as well as security and others throughout the building.\n\nWe fully expect teachers to be treated the absolute same way as any other employee, Jackson said. If they are in essential functions, we are asking them to come back to work and failure to do so we will follow the progressive discipline process.\n\nCPS is engaged in a phased reopening plan in which some students are scheduled to return to the classroom next week for the first time since March, when school closures began due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNBC5 reported CTU President Jesse Sharkey said 1,800 of the approximately 5,000 teachers who were ordered to return on Monday had requested special accommodations, but only 600 received them.\n\nAmong the issues about which CTU has complained is that the district has not developed a full coronavirus testing and contact tracing program. The union said teachers who did return to school as ordered also noted problems with cleanliness, safety protocols, ventilation and more.\n\nREPORT: The Chicago Teachers Union failed to respond to inquiries regarding an investigation into child sexual violence in city schools. https://t.co/bvgdqzGOpk — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 5, 2019\n\nOn Sunday, over 30 Chicago aldermen signed a letter to Jackson and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in which they requested CPS take nine steps prior to allowing students return to class, including setting health criteria for in-person instruction and addressing connectivity issues for remote learners.\n\nIn December, the district endorsed an open letter signed at the Chicago Sun Times by a group of 17 physicians that stated reopening schools is essential and safe.\n\nIn its reopening plan announcement, CPS stated:\n\nWhile COVID-19 remains an incredibly serious threat to our community, the public health data in Chicago and across the nation show that schools are rarely a source of COVID-19 transmission. With this new understanding of COVID-19, we must challenge the assumption that school buildings must stay closed and do everything we can to bring students back to school.\n\nCPS said in a statement to NBC5 regarding the teachers' union's complaints, the union has not identified any area where the district's plan falls short of public health guidelines and CTU's last minute tactics are deeply disrespectful to the 77,000 mostly Black and Latinx families who selected in-person learning.\n\nCTU organizer Jhoanna Maldonado, however, responded the district is trying to divide and conquer our staffs and that the union is ready to take whatever actions we need to take if there is retaliation against teachers who failed to report to work.
The nation's huge population of illegal immigrants may try to avoid medical treatment for China's Wuhan virus unless President Donald Trump suspends immigration enforcement rules, say pro-migration Democrats and activists.\n\nThe government needs to come out, and just be out, and say, 'We're not going to deport you,' said Ally Bolour, a Los Angeles immigration lawyer and a member of the board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. This is a national health emergency crisis. … If you're sick, come on in. We'll take care of you,' she told the Guardian.\n\nDemocrats are also using the epidemic to target the White House's public charge rule. Democrats already oppose the rule because it is designed to exclude legal migrants who cannot provide for their own health care.\n\nFailure to immediately stay implementation of the Rule so that we can take the steps necessary to contain and mitigate the outbreak of the disease puts the public health and safety of our communities at increased risk, said a March 6 letter by 15 Democrat attorneys general. The rule denies green cards to migrants who rely on federal health and welfare programs, and so it is deterring individuals from accessing critical health benefits to which they are legally entitled, said the letter, which claimed that DHS's implementation of the Public Charge Rule during this public health crisis is irresponsible and reckless.\n\nDemocrats are using the epidemic to delegitimize migration rules, says Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter enforcement. There is a pragmatic way of limiting the public health fallout of the disease, and there there is the Democratic effort to undermine immigration laws, to morally stigmatize them using the virus as an excuse, he said.\n\nFederal officials should quietly ignore migrants' illegal status as they try to detect, isolate, and treat all of the Americans who are infected by the epidemic, he said. The government should make clear that they are not going to be checking legal status when they're trying to protect public health, and it seems perfectly reasonable to say that use of public benefits [by would-be migrants], in this case, will not be factored into public charge rules.\n\nThat no-checks policy may become painful if there is a shortage of hospital beds for sick Americans, he said. We're going to have to have some tough decisions if things get bad, he said, so the goal should be to slow the disease's spread so that hospitals can keep pace with the flood of sick Americans and sick illegal migrants, he said.\n\nThe government's failure to enforce immigration laws for many years has created a large population of 10 million to 20 million migrants, who are mixed in the population of roughly 315 million Americans. The resulting flooded labor market keeps many of these illegal or legal migrants — and many Americans — in low-wage careers, in crowded apartments, and in service sector jobs such as restaurants.\n\nIf you continue to discourage people from seeking services under normal circumstances, you cannot expect them necessarily to seek those services just because you as the racist, anti-immigrant president have decided that now it's a good idea, Max Hadler, director of health policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, told the Guardian.\n\nOther Democrats are calling for an enforcement rollback amid the virus, even though they have also backed many pro-migration bills.\n\nWe have to proliferate the access to testing and services, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), whose Latino-dominated district includes many suspected victims. If someone is undocumented — or has a green card — and they feel that they're not eligible for any of these kinds of services, that's just going to worsen the situation, that's going to prevent us from really addressing the coronavirus issue in an effective way, he told the the Hill.\n\nWhat you want in a public health situation like this is for everybody to feel comfortable coming forward if they need to come forward, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) told the Hill.\n\nAnd if we have any barriers to that, it's not that it's bad for them — it might be bad for them — but it's also bad for the entire public, said Jayapal, a former Indian migrant who argues that the nation needs a large inflow of immigrants to perform manual farm labor. Jayapal's Seattle district has had a rash of coronavirus cases, partly because the district is home to many Chinese visa workers and legal immigrants.\n\nHealthcare facilities must be immigration enforcement-free zones so that immigration status does not prevent a person from seeking care, said a statement by several hundred medical professionals. The March 2 statement continued:\n\nThe COVID-19 response should not be linked to immigration enforcement in any manner. It will undermine individual and collective health if individuals do not feel safe to utilize care and respond to inquiries from public health officials, for example during contact tracing. Similar enforcement-free zones have been declared during hurricanes and other emergencies, including after the September 11 terrorist attacks. These policies should be clearly and unequivocally articulated to the public by the federal, state, and local governments.\n\nBut some pro-migration activists are using the epidemic to argue for looser enforcement, even at the southern border where almost a million poor migrants arrived during 2019. The Hill quoted one activist who suggested that the U.S. should admit roughly 30,000 migrants who are now waiting in Mexico:\n\nCindy Anderson, a member of Doctors for Camp Closure — an association of medical professionals who oppose immigration detention — decried camp conditions in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas. I was in Matamoros in January and we were seeing a lot of influenza-like illness at that time. And so any kind of virus, it would spread quickly through a camp like that, just because people are in close proximity with one another, said Anderson. I think the big concern is if someone developed respiratory distress there that very quickly the resources will be overwhelmed.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board added to the demands on March 5:\n\nProponents of closed borders and small social safety nets have a tendency to highlight the tension between citizen and noncitizen, to imply or explicitly state that the only way to help one group is to deprive the other. But the truth is, people on both sides are hanging by a thread. Infectious diseases, especially those like Covid-19, have a knack for penetrating and exposing such false dichotomies.\n\nXenophobia might spread if the administration does not relax enforcement efforts, said the board:\n\nIf citizens struggling to cover their own health care nurture resentments against any group perceived to be getting help to which they themselves are not entitled — or worse, if they grow xenophobic and subscribe to the notion that immigrants carry diseases — they might be compelled to endorse policies even more draconian than those already in play. That would create more anxiety among noncitizen communities, which would lead to fewer people seeking medical care when they need it. From there, the epidemic would only get worse.\n\nPro-migration Democrats, said Krikorian, want a broader statement that immigration laws are suspended for the duration of what they consider the emergency to be.\n\nBut Americans need a more nuanced policy that preserves enforcement while suppressing the disease among the mixed U.S. and illegal populations. It needs to be made clear that to get tested, you don't have to show proof of legal residency, and if you need to be hospitalized, you will be, regardless of legal status, he said.
The New York Times admits a 40-year rise in the number of immigrants living in Orange County, California has transformed the region from a fortress of conservative Republicanism to a Democrat electoral sweep.\n\nThe Times notes in a piece titled In Orange County, a Republican Fortress Turns Democratic that the rapid demographic changes of the county — which now has a more than 30 percent foreign-born population — has swiftly handed the region over to Democrats.\n\nBreitbart News reported that Orange County's booming foreign-born populations of mostly Asian immigrants and migrants from Central America coincided with Democrats sweeping the midterm elections in an area that gave birth to President Richard Nixon.\n\nThe Times now acknowledges the demographic changes are at least partially responsible for the diminishing Republican representation in Orange County:\n\nThere was a steady decrease in white voters in the seven congressional districts that are in and around Orange County between 1980 and 2017, according to census data. In 1980, whites made up 75 percent of the population in the district where Mr. Cisneros won. By 2017, that number dropped to 30 percent. [Emphasis added] The county's immigrant population grew five times as fast as the general population between 1980 and 2000, and while the pace of immigration has slowed, the Latino and Asian populations continues to increase, driven by the children of immigrant families born in the United States. [Emphasis added] … You went from a solid Republican county to one in which Republicans were just barely the majority, and it fell pretty quickly in the past two years, said Ms. Godwin. You have had continued demographic changes. This is a county that went from majority-white to having a majority that are Latino and Asian-American. So that has gone hand-in-hand — particularly with the rising Asian-American population — to voting more Democratic. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn a series of charts, Times reporters Robert Gebeloff and Jasmine C. Lee. reveal that while Orange County has become less and less Republican, the foreign-born population has grown significantly, the share of college graduates has peaked, and the white American population has fallen drastically.\n\nMonths ago, Breitbart News reported the district-by-district breakdown of Orange County's enormous foreign-born populations, which have aided the Democrats' electoral sweep in the region.\n\nCalifornia's 46th District, already a Democrat-held congressional seat, has a foreign-born population that is now reaching 40 percent with four-out-of-ten residents being born outside the United States.\n\nThe other Democrat-held congressional seat in Orange County, California's 47th District, has a foreign-born population of nearly 30 percent.\n\nThree of Orange County's four Republican districts that have flipped to Democrat have foreign-born populations that make up 25 percent or more of the region. For example, California's 39th District — where Democrat Gil Cisneros won over Republican Young Kim — has a 34.1 percent foreign-born population.\n\nIn the 45th District, where Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA) has conceded to Democrat Katie Porter, the foreign-born population makes up nearly 30 percent of the district.\n\nSimilarly, in the state's 48th District, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) — the former speechwriter to President Ronald Reagan — lost to Democrat Harley Rouda after serving in the seat since 2013. That district's foreign-born population is now near 25 percent.\n\nEven in the 49th District, where the foreign-born population remains below 20 percent, Democrat Mike Levin beat out Republican Diane Harkey. The district has anywhere between an 18 to 19 percent foreign-born population with about 55 percent of foreign-born residents arriving from Latin America and nearly 30 percent coming from Asia.\n\nDemocrats have increasingly swept congressional districts whose demographics have been quickly changed due to the country's policy of mass legal and illegal immigration.\n\nThe process known as chain migration, for instance — whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. with them — has imported more than nine million foreign nationals since 2005.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, if chain migration is not ended — as President Donald Trump has demanded — the U.S. electorate will forever be changed, with between seven to eight million new foreign-born individuals being eligible to vote because of chain migration, and overall, an additional 15 million new foreign-born voters.
Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, said Monday that the free speech platform saw 600,000 new users in one day as President Donald Trump has been censored from most mainstream tech platforms.\n\n600,000 new Gabbers today, said Torba.\n\nTorba previously revealed that Gab's traffic exploded as high as 753 percent after Trump and many other conservatives have been purged from Twitter, Facebook, and other big tech platforms.\n\nOur traffic is up 753% in the past 24 hours. Tens of millions of visits, Gab said in response to slow loading speeds on the platform.\n\nTo meet the rising demand, Gab said it would add ten new servers to its platform to alleviate congestion.\n\nGab started as the first free speech alternative to Twitter. Gab allows all legal speech except for pornography. Users can curate their own experience on Gab by creating custom filters. Gab also takes a hard stance against illegal content and incitement of violence.\n\nDue to its free speech policy, Google and Apple have banned the Gab app from their app stores.\n\nThe two tech giants recently banned Parler from their app stores. Amazon Web Services also suspended their servicing of Parler, citing allegedly insufficient content moderation practices.\n\nGab has worked to become resilient from suppression from tech companies that no longer wish to host its domain. For instance, Gab hosts its own physical services to avoid censorship from cloud servicing companies such as Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe free speech company is also reportedly working on a Gab phone to circumvent app store censorship and spur competition in the mobile phone operating system markets.\n\nThe solution, as always, is not government, Gab wrote this week.

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have spent the past year courting the Democratic Party's base with appeals to the working class and sweeping promises to curb climate change. But as they balance their responsibilities to participate in the Senate's impeachment trial and rally voters on the campaign trail, they're turning to private air travel, an option typically reserved for the elite and criticized as environmentally unfriendly.\n\nSanders is expected to charter a flight to Iowa this weekend while the Senate trial is in recess. Warren hasn't finalized her plans but is also considering private travel, and Amy Klobuchar hasn't ruled it out. Only Michael Bennet says he'll be flying commercial.\n\nThe senators are facing an unprecedented challenge in the final days before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. At a time when they would typically barnstorm the state, they're instead stuck in Washington as jurors in President Donald Trump's impeachment case. The little time they have for campaigning makes commercial travel tough.\n\nBut the private planes present unique issues for Warren and Sanders. As the leading progressive voices in a crowded Democratic primary, they often criticize rivals they deem insufficiently loyal to those values. The sudden use of private travel is an example of how ideological rigidity can sometimes collide with White House aspirations.\n\nThis is the problem of presenting your purity above your practicality, said Democratic strategist Chris Lippincott, who has not endorsed any of the 2020 primary candidates. When we think about certain candidates who talk a lot about the environment … you're going to hold them to a different standard.\n\nLippincott applauded the 2020 presidential hopefuls in the Senate for being willing to fly privately, if that's what their campaigns need.\n\nI understand it, he said of trying to live progressive values at all times, but the reality is, there's a big risk of being perceived as being an ideologue and not a problem-solver.\n\nTransportation emissions overall make up the largest share of U.S. climate-damaging emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, air travel pumps out about 3% of overall emissions of climate-destroying carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Surging growth of air travel in Asia and around the world means those emissions will triple by 2050, the United Nations says, and recent studies say even that figure underestimates the explosive growth of air travel and its emissions.\n\nIn March, Sanders' campaign became the first to announce it would provide carbon offsets, donations to environmental groups meant to mitigate the environmental effects of extra emissions. Since then, it had spent about $9,000 on them through September. And during his primary challenge to Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders paid around $14,000 for such offsets.\n\nHis campaign is making payments to NativeEnergy, based in Burlington, Vermont, which is the same company that Clinton used for them during her presidential bid in 2016. That's also the same firm Warren uses, with her campaign paying a little more than $10,000 to it in September.\n\nSome climate advocates said they weren't bothered by the private travel, especially because they view a more carbon-conscious administration as a far better result for the climate than four more years of Trump in the White House.\n\nIf you're a presidential candidate running to try to beat Donald Trump, who is a climate denier to his bones, and that requires you to move around the country … you should do that, said Leah Stokes, a professor and researcher into climate and energy politics at the University of California-Santa Barbara.\n\nWorld leaders fly around in airplanes — this is the modern era, Stokes said. They can't just hop a speedy train to Iowa, she said.\n\nTrump has made a similar point for the opposite reason, poking fun at Democratic environmental plans.\n\nI really don't like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane rights, of 'Let's hop a train to California,' Trump said during a rally last February.\n\nSanders has pledged a $16.3 trillion environmental plan that would declare climate change a national emergency and calls for the U.S. to move to renewable energy across the economy until 2050. Warren wants to spend $3 trillion over 10 years to move the U.S. to 100% clean energy. And both are aggressive supporters of the Green New Deal, a sweeping plan to combat climate change.\n\nSanders recently suggested on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that he'd consider a kind of jet-pooling arrangement in which he and other candidates could share private flights, saying, Maybe we can all chip in, get one plane and come back.\n\nThat opportunity might have presented itself last weekend since Sanders, Warren and others were campaigning in Iowa and then went to South Carolina for Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations and then on to Washington to be in the Senate. But they didn't share private flights.\n\nStill, Sanders' campaign says the senator's comment to Colbert wasn't realistic. Even if several senators were looking to decamp from Washington to Iowa quickly after the impeachment trial concludes each day, they would be headed to different parts of the state.\n\nIt's not just those candidates tethered to Washington by the impeachment trial who often opt to fly private. Former Vice President Joe Biden spent at least $1.2 million on charter jets through September, while Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had spent at least $750,000.\n\nThat was more than Sanders (at least $377,000) and Warren (at least $190,000) over the same period, though impeachment could change that. Spending data through December 2019 won't be ready until the end of the month. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg mostly flies private to campaign stops.\n\nButtigieg's, Biden's and Bloomberg's campaigns all say they are also paying for carbon offsets.\n\nButtigieg faced criticism this summer for his penchant for flying private from presidential rival Beto O'Rourke, who produced an online ad filmed aboard a commercial jet proclaiming No private planes for this campaign. Buttigieg responded during a CNN climate change town hall by saying, This is a very big country, and I'm running to be president of the whole country. O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, dropped out of the race in November.\n\nSanders, meanwhile, drew fire after spending nearly $300,000 on private jets in September 2018, as he crisscrossed the country campaigning for other candidates during the midterm elections.\n\nThe issue also came up in August, when Sanders traveled to Paradise, California, which had been ravaged by wildfires, to unveil his plan to fight climate change. He was unapologetic.\n\nI'm not going to walk to California, Sanders replied when asked about flying private. We do the best we can as an example, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're not going to use fossil fuels.\n\n___\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Britain, France and Germany have launched action under the Iran nuclear agreement paving the way for possible sanctions in response to Tehran's attempts to roll back parts of the deal, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday.\n\nThe three countries, which signed the international agreement in 2015 along with the United States, Russia and China, informed Borrell, who supervises the pact, in a letter that they are triggering its dispute mechanism, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe leaders of the three nations said in a statement that they've been left with no choice, given Iran's actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments.\n\nThe powers said they are referring this matter to the Joint Commission under the Dispute Resolution Mechanism, as set out in the nuclear deal.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement that the three European countries could no longer leave the growing Iranian violations of the nuclear agreement unanswered.\n\nOur goal is clear: we want to preserve the accord and come to a diplomatic solution within the agreement, he added. We will tackle this together with all partners in the agreement. We call on Iran to participate constructively in the negotiation process that is now beginning.\n\nBorrell insisted that the move does not mean that sanctions will automatically be reimposed.\n\nThe mechanism allows two weeks for ministers to resolve any problems, although that period can be extended if all sides agree. If needed, an advisory board would have an extra 20 days to adjudicate.\n\nThe nuclear agreement is aimed at convincing Iran to stop developing atomic weapons in exchange for economic incentives. It's been on life support since President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the United States out in 2018, triggering sanctions that have hurt Iran's moribund economy. Since then, Tehran has gradually rolled back its commitment to the deal.\n\nAfter its top general was killed in a U.S. drone attack earlier this month, Iran announced that it would no longer respect limits set on how many centrifuges it can use to enrich uranium. Tehran said the new move was a remedial step in line with the deal and that it could be reversed.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued new guidance to state and local law enforcement agencies on Wednesday allowing them to release some information about illegal aliens in custody — even if that helped federal immigration agents.\n\nCalifornia passed a state law, SB 54 (California Values Act) that took effect this year and that puts a number of restrictions on how state and local law enforcement could participate in immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Department of Justice sued the state earlier this month, challenging that and two other sanctuary state laws.\n\nIn an exclusive report about the DOJ lawsuit, Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak spoke with United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the lawsuit the day after it was filed.\n\nWe believe that we cannot accept the kind of restrictions that California placed on federal law officers, and we believe that their actions exceeded the Constitution, and we will win in the courts eventually, Sessions told Breitbart News.\n\nSince then, a revolt has spread throughout Orange County, a traditionally conservative part of California, as local authorities have declared their intention to defy the state's sanctuary laws and join the federal lawsuit. San Diego County is also reported to be among those local government bodies considering defiance over compliance.\n\nOn Monday, Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens made the release dates of all inmates — including illegal aliens — public. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Tom Homan praised Hutchens's decision.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown countered by insisting that what Hutchens did was actually compliant with state law. Becerra's new guidance aims to make that clear — and take the sting out of the federal lawsuit.\n\nThe Washington Post reported:\n\nThe guidance is particularly significant because the U.S. Justice Department has sued California over its various laws that benefit those in the country without documentation, alleging the measures obstruct federal law enforcement and harm public safety. The lawsuit argues that the directives are preempted by federal law and thus violate the Constitution's supremacy clause.\n\nThe guidance document makes clear that federal law 'prohibits restrictions on the exchange of information regarding a person's citizenship or immigration status' and says 'all California law enforcement agencies should comply with these laws,' the Post reported.\n\nBut the guidance also spells out how state and local law enforcement can work with federal immigration agents, including transferring criminal illegal aliens into federal custody.\n\nIt also says that while state and local officials should share with immigration authorities 'information regarding a person's citizenship or immigration status,' they should not reveal any other personal information, such as a home or work address, the Post reported.\n\nSome conservative critics of the state's sanctuary policy interpreted Brown and Becerra's new guidance as a concession to the federal government.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
The pro-Common Core New Mexico education secretary who once served as a staffer in former Gov. Jeb Bush's administration in Florida is no longer a candidate for assistant secretary of the U.S. Education Department, reports Politico.\n\nHanna Skandera's name was pulled from consideration for the position, the report says, because about a dozen Senate Republicans were skeptical that they could ever vote yes to confirm her, due to her support for the highly unpopular Common Core standards.\n\nSkandera was deputy education commissioner under Jeb Bush and also a senior policy adviser and deputy chief of staff at the education department under former U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, who served under President George W. Bush.\n\nLike Jeb Bush, Skandera is a proponent of the Common Core standards. She is head of the governing board of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), one of the two federally funded test consortia that developed assessments aligned with Common Core.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on getting rid of the Common Core standards, and a far-reaching network of grassroots citizens across the country are vehemently opposed to the federalized program that was introduced in President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus bill.\n\nEmmett McGroarty, a senior fellow at American Principles Project, released the following statement:\n\nWe applaud the Administration and the Senate for scuttling the nomination of Hanna Skandera due to her past support for Common Core standards and testing. Parents, students, and teachers detest Common Core because it locks children into an inferior education. As President Trump has said, Common Core is a total disaster. We urge the Administration to look for appointees committed to achieving the President's vision that education has to be at a local level. We cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child's education.\n\nThough U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has funded and served organizations that promote Common Core – including Jeb Bush's Foundation for Excellence in Education – since her nomination, she has denied she supports the controversial standards.\n\nDeVos, nevertheless, has surrounded herself with advisers and staff who have ties to Bush's foundation, as well as to Indiana, where Common Core was repealed, but then simply rebranded.\n\nThe secretary recently said the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) essentially does away with the notion of a Common Core, a statement many grassroots parent activists still battling against the Core in their states have rejected.\n\nUpon DeVos's nomination, KOB4 in Albuquerque reported Skandera praised Trump's pick, saying that while she did not know her well, she believed DeVos's policies would not change Common Core in New Mexico.\n\nBreitbart News reached out to the press office at the U.S. Education Department to confirm the report but received no response.
Apple says that it will invest $60 million to support minority entrepreneurs, a move that comes as part of a racial equity and justice project to challenge systemic racism.\n\nThere's a lack of diversity among venture capital and banking funders, said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, to Reuters. We looked for where we thought there was opportunity for our resources to do good things.\n\nThe report added that Apple will invest $10 million in a fund with Harlem Capital, a New York-based early-stage venture firm, and another $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank's Clear Vision Impact Fund, which provides financing to businesses with an emphasis on minority-owned firms.\n\nApple is also investing another $25 million into the Propel Center, a facility in Atlanta where historically Black colleges and universities will collaborate on programs in entrepreneurship, and app development.\n\nApple's new investments are a part of the company's $100 million Racial Equity Justice Initiative, a project that was announced last June, after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.\n\nThe initiative seeks to help dismantle systemic barriers to opportunity and combat injustices faced by communities of color, according to Apple.\n\nThe company also plans to establish an app development academy in Detroit, Michigan, with Michigan State University. The academy will provide a free 10-to-12-month course and will seek to teach 1,000 students skills in coding, design, and marketing every year.\n\nWe wanted to see more Black and brown developers, said Jackson. They tend to be focusing on the southeastern part of the United States. But Detroit has over 50,000 small businesses that are owned by Black and brown people.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook added that we are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world — and these new projects send a clear signal of Apple's enduring commitment.\n\nCook added that Apple is launching the Racial Equity Justice Initiative to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long.\n\nWe are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at Apple, said Cook.\n\nWhile Apple works to prop up other businesses, the company has provided obstacles for others. Last week, Apple banned Parler, an alternative to Twitter, from its app store, effectively excluding the Parler app from all iPhones, after President Donald Trump was banned from Twitter.\n\nApple justifies its decision by claiming that words on the platform may incite violence, a narrative that big tech companies are now using to take action against the president, political dissenters, and their competition — while seemingly ignoring Twitter, where Hang Mike Pence was trending just last week.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.
North Korea launched another ballistic missile on Wednesday morning – or at least they tried to, since the Pentagon is now judging the test a failure, because the missile did not reach Japanese waters. Fox News quotes a U.S. official saying the missile might have pinwheeled in flight.\n\nFurthermore, it doesn't even look like much of a test, because a defense official told Fox it was an older SCUD missile, not one of the new weapons North Korea has been working on.\n\nSecretary of State Tillerson's official response to the North Korean provocation suggested he was not provoked. His statement was exactly 23 words long: North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.\n\nThis unprovoked response to North Korea's flaccid provocation was, in turn, highly provocative to Chris Cillizza of CNN, who suffered a complete meltdown on Wednesday morning:\n\nThat's a total of 23 words, if you're counting. Twenty-three words that leave you more confused when you get to the end of them than when you started. Is Tillerson trying to talk tough? Or is he refusing to give North Korea the attention he thinks they're trying to grab in advance of the US-China meeting? Somewhere in between? Neither? Both? The statement reads, to channel Winston Churchill, like a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. It's Ernest Hemingway but for complicated and delicate matters of foreign policy. It's, in a (hyphenated) word, a head-scratcher.\n\nThe rest of Cillizza's column collapsed into a long argument with himself about whether diplomatic ambiguity is dangerous because misunderstandings can cause international incidents, or if Tillerson's brevity was an appropriate expression of the Trump administration's tough new time for talking is over stance toward Pyongyang.\n\nAt roughly the same time, CNN was running another article from James Griffiths which noted Tillerson might have been doing the right thing by ignoring the airborne middle finger from Pyongyang ahead of the summit between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, and it doesn't much matter what Western powers say about North Korea's behavior anyway:\n\nThe test, which sent a missile into the sea off North Korea's east coast Wednesday, occurred ahead of a hugely important meeting between the leaders of the US and China this week and has been described by one analyst as an insult from Pyongyang to US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. It was an airborne middle finger to Trump and Xi before they sit down for their summit, said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at Australia's Lowy Institute. The US response, delivered via Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was short and sharp — The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. It was very different from previous lengthy, threat-laden responses. And while Tillerson's taciturn comments were instantly criticized online, analysts said it was difficult to gauge if his approach would make much of a difference compared to his predecessors'.\n\nIs the contrary argument that Trump would be somehow giving Kim Jong-un the green light to nuke half of Asia by refusing to respond at length to every missile launch, no matter how half-hearted the provocation? As the Fox News report points out, many analysts believe North Korea is preparing for another nuclear weapons test, possibly during Xi's visit to Washington. Perhaps saving the strong words for that will better convey the seriousness of the new administration's approach.\n\nCoincidentally, former CIA director Michael Hayden gave a speech at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on Tuesday in which he warned North Korea could become capable of hitting Seattle with an indigenously produced nuclear weapon aboard an indigenously produced intercontinental ballistic missile before President Trump leaves office.\n\nHayden said it would be probably a low-probability shot if North Korea actually launched a nuclear missile at Seattle, but stressed there was an inexorability about their developing the capability.\n\nYonhap News reports that Hayden also quoted former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's assessment that Pyongyang would be crazy to halt its nuclear program after the effort already devoted to it, and China regards North Korea as a bad toothache it can generally ignore. He suggested China's attitude could be changed by making the toothache hurt more, with measures such as deploying the THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, and perhaps Japan.\n\nU.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has explicitly described the Trump administration's approach to China and North Korea in these terms: I think the United States has seen China, for 25-plus years, say that they're concerned about North Korea, but we haven't seen them act like they're concerned about North Korea. I think this administration wants to see them act, and they're going to pressure them to do that. Hopefully China will respond favorably, because we know at the end of the day, the only one that North Korea's really going to respond to is China.\n\nFox News quotes Ralph Cossa of the Pacific Forum CSIS joking that North Korea doesn't mind being hated, but they definitely hate to be ignored. Tillerson's supporters applaud him for giving Pyongyang what it hates. It will be up to President Trump to work on Beijing's toothache while President Xi is in Washington.
U.S. manufactured tanks have reportedly ended up in the arsenal of fighters from an umbrella organization of mostly Iran-allied Shiite militias in Iraq that have expressed hostility towards troops from the United States, according to an audit by the top inspector general (IG) for overseas operations.\n\nSome militias from the Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces/Units (PMF/U), also known as Hashd al-Shaabi, have threatened American troops in recent months, urging the United States to entirely withdraw from Iraq now that Baghdad has declared defeat over the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).\n\nAlthough some PMU fighters fought alongside the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, some of those Shiite fighters may have American blood on their hands having clashed with the United States armed forces following the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn a quarterly report issued to Congress, the Lead Inspector General for Overseas Contingency Operation (LIG-OCO), which covers activities by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S. Department of State (DoS), and the U.S. Agency for International Development, auditors found:\n\nThis quarter [October 1, 2-17 thru December 31, 2017] , the DoS acknowledged that some U.S.-provided military equipment sent to support the mission, including as many as nine M1 Abrams tanks, had fallen into the hands of Iranian-backed militias that fought against ISIS in Iraq. The DoS pressed the Iraqi government to prioritize the return of defense articles provided by the United States as designated in the sale agreements. … PMF units had obtained as many as nine M1 Abrams tanks. These tanks, originally provided by the United States to the Iraqi Army, included some tanks seized by the PMF from ISIS after the fall of Mosul and the second battle of Tikrit.\n\nHowever, seven of the nine tanks have already been recovered, notes Foreign Policy (FP).\n\nThe auditors note that U.S. government challenges keeping track of the equipment have intensified since the start of the fight against ISIS in 2014.\n\nLast year, the human rights group Amnesty International obtained government data showing that the U.S. Army had lost track of more than $1 billion worth of weapons and other equipment destined for local allies combating ISIS.\n\nAmnesty suggested that the U.S. was well aware that some of the American equipment was going to PMF fighters, which Baghdad deemed an official component of the Iraqi army in 2016.\n\nAlso last year, Pentagon officials conceded some American taxpayer-funded weapons sent to Iraq to combat ISIS likely ended up in enemy hands as a result of the U.S. Army's failure to accurately track and secure the military equipment.\n\nThe U.S. officials acknowledged that PMF troops might have also gotten their hands on the equipment the U.S. Army lost.\n\nForeign Policy reports:\n\nIn January 2015, a video circulated depicting an M1 flying the flag of Kataib Hezbollah, which the United States has labeled a terrorist group. A second video from February 2016 showed an M1 flying the flag of Kataib Sayyid Al Shuhada, another militia with ties to Iran. In February 2018, the U.S. military and State Department finally admitted that pro-Iran forces were operating M1s. The militias seized some of the M1s from the Islamic State after militants captured them, a U.S. Central Command spokesperson told FP.\n\nDespite recovering most of the thanks from the PMF forces, the United States government has pulled most of the private contractors charged with repairing and keeping the war machines running.\n\nFP notes:\n\nNow, many of Iraq's tanks are immobilized for want of maintenance, potentially jeopardizing the country's ongoing campaign against Islamic State militants. … Iraq bought 140 of the 63-ton M1s for $2 billion starting in 2008 in order to re-equip some armored units that previously operated Soviet-made vehicles—many of which the U.S.-led coalition destroyed when it invaded Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe U.S. has at times provided the equipment to Iraq on American taxpayer-funded loans.\n\nIn the February audit prepared for Congress, the IG points out:\n\nDuring the past two fiscal years, the DoS used appropriated FMF [Foreign Military Financing] funds to underwrite loans totaling $3.8 billion to enable the Iraqi government to purchase, sustain, and maintain military vehicles, aircraft, and weapons.\n\nSince 2012, the Pentagon has paid $320 million alone in American taxpayer funds to General Dynamics for the work starting in 2012.\n\nHowever, most of the workers from the American contractor left Iraq in late December 2017.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's administration faces a crisis after former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's party resigned from the government, taking several cabinet ministers with him.\n\nMatteo Renzi, who heads the Italia Viva (IV) party, announced on Wednesday he could no longer support the Conte coalition government, leaving the alliance of the Five-Star Movement and the left-wing Democratic Party (PD) without a majority in the parliament.\n\nThe move comes after weeks of tensions between Renzi and Conte over various disagreements on policy — primarily relating to how to spend coronavirus bailout cash — along with many threats made by Renzi in the past to leave the government.\n\nIt takes courage, inner freedom, and a sense of responsibility. We did not cause the crisis. It has been building for months. Now, we will leave our seats, Renzi said, according to Il Giornale.\n\nNearly 400,000 Italian Businesses Face Closure Due to Coronavirus https://t.co/MpUWikalvf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2020\n\nBy leaving the government, Renzi also takes away several key ministers who are also members of Italia Viva, including Minister of Agriculture Teresa Bellanova and Minister of Family and Equal Opportunities Elena Bonetti.\n\nEarlier in the day, Prime Minister Conte had met with President Sergio Mattarella and told media that he hoped he could still count on Renzi's support, saying the government could only work with a majority and that Italians would not accept a new government crisis.\n\nSeveral scenarios could unfold following Renzi's move, including a snap election, which is believed to be President Mattarella's prefered scenario, as opposed to a fragile coalition in parliament.\n\nOpinion polls show that an election could see the formation of a new centre-right government, as populist Senator Matteo Salvini's League and the national-conservative Brother of Italy (FdI) scored highly in an Swg poll released this week.\n\nItaly: Salvini and Allies Demand Govt Suspend Taxes in Lockdown Areas https://t.co/dk9AelzI8f — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 8, 2020\n\nThe poll showed Salvini's League as the most popular in Italy at 23.2 per cent. While the Brother's of Italy, led by firebrand Giorgia Meloni, scored 17.2 per cent, just over two percentage points fewer than the Democratic Party which scored 19.4 per cent.\n\nThe League has topped opinion polls for months, but the FdI has seen rapid growth in popularity over the last two years, rising from the 6 per cent at the European Parliament elections in 2019.\n\nOn Wednesday, Giorgia Meloni demanded the resignation of the Conte government, saying: Italians on their knees, the government in disarray. Italy cannot afford to waste any more time. Conte must resign. Elections now.\n\nMatteo Salvini also released a statement on behalf of the centre-right coalition, saying: The centre-right is the country's leading political force and after a summit that confirmed the great unity of the coalition, asks that the prime minister take note of the crisis and resign immediately or, otherwise, appear in Parliament tomorrow to ask for a vote of confidence.\n\nWe rely on the wisdom of the President of the Republic for a quick solution: the centre-right parties clearly reaffirm their unwillingness to support left-wing governments, he added.
This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nChina deploys cruise and surface-to-air missiles in South China Sea\n\nChina's military attacks US pilots in Djibouti with high-grade blinding lasers\n\nChina deploys cruise and surface-to-air missiles in South China Sea\n\n\n\nChinese warship in South China Sea, April 12, 2018 (Getty)\n\nChina has once again escalated its massive military occupation of the South China Sea by deploying offensive anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles systems. The missiles are being deployed on the artificial islands that China constructed in violation of international law, as the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that all of China's activities in the South China Sea are illegal.\n\nAccording to military analyst Gregory Poling, it means that China will soon be deploying warplanes to the area:\n\nThis should be seen as China crossing an important threshold. Missile platforms present a clear offensive threat. [The missile deployment] is a pretty clear threat to the other claimants and furthers China's goal of establishing complete control over the water and airspace of the South China Sea.\n\nEven before this latest deployment, Navy Admiral Philip S. Davidson told the Senate that China already has the military power to control the entire South China Sea, and only war would be able to stop this:\n\nChina's development of forward military bases in the South China Sea began in December 2013 when the first dredger arrived at Johnson Reef. Through 2015, China used dredging efforts to build up these reefs and create manmade islands, destroying the reefs in the process. Since then, China has constructed clear military facilities on the islands, with several bases including hangars, barracks, underground fuel and water storage facilities, and bunkers to house offense and defensive kinetic and non-kinetic systems. These actions stand in direct contrast to the assertion that President Xi made in 2015 in the Rose Garden when he commented that Beijing had no intent to militarize the South China Sea. Today these forward operating bases appear complete. The only thing lacking are the deployed forces. Once occupied, China will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania. The PLA will be able to use these bases to challenge U.S. presence in the region, and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants. In short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.\n\nAs Davidson points out, China has repeatedly lied and hid its true intentions. Originally, the artificial islands were going to be for tourists and scientists, which was a lie. Then the military installations would be purely defensive, which was another lie. And now they're part of a massive militarization in anticipation, when preparation has been completed, to launch a full-scale war on America and its allies.\n\nAccording to an article last month in Chinese media, China is close to announcing how much of each country's territory it plans to annex:\n\nA precise continuous line will split the Gulf of Tonkin between China and Vietnam, go south into waters claimed by Malaysia, take a U-turn to the north along the west coast of the Philippines and finish at the southeast of Taiwan.\n\nChina has also been increasingly threatening an belligerent with Vietnam, Japan and Australia, by demanding that they respect China's illegal sovereignty claims. China has also been increasingly military threatening to Taiwan, and may be close to a military invasion.\n\nChina has repeatedly hidden its intentions, and will continue to do so until it's prepared to launch its attack. China is following exactly the same path that the Nazis followed. Xi Jinping's Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is the same as Hitler's National Socialism. Like the Nazis, the Chinese believe that they're a Master Race that will conquer the world. They'd have to be crazy to believe that they could succeed at that, but the Chinese are crazy.\n\nI frequently like to quote Friedrich Nietzsche, who said, Insanity in individuals is something rare – but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule. The Chinese will not be the Master Race that rules the world. Instead, they'll do exactly what the Nazis did—bring destruction and catastrophe to themselves and the world. CNBC and the Diplomat and Newsweek (20-Apr) and US Senate (PDF, 17-Apr) and South China Morning Post (22-Apr)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nChina's military attacks US pilots in Djibouti with high-grade blinding lasers\n\n\n\nOpening ceremony of China's military base in Djibouti, August 1, 2017 (AFP)\n\nChina's belligerent military actions in the South China Sea are being repeated as well in the horn of Africa.\n\nChinese military personnel are using high-grade blinding lasers to target American pilots and American military crews flying over Djibouti in northeast Africa (the horn of Africa), according to the Pentagon.\n\nThere were several incidents in the past several weeks. No one has lost his life, but several Americans have received eye injuries.\n\nThe Americans are stationed in Djibouti at the Camp Lemonnier naval base which is the primary base of operations and logistics hub for missions across Africa. It supports approximately 4,000 U.S., joint and allied forces military and civilian personnel and defense contractors.\n\nCamp Lemonnier was built in 2001, but is now being challenged by a new Chinese base in Djibouti, built in 2017. The US has formally protested to China's government, and requested that China launch an investigation of the situation.\n\nAs we reported last month, there is a parallel development in progress. Djibouti's strategic port at the entrance to the Red Sea is the Doraleh Container Terminal. A Dubai firm, DP World, had been operating the terminal since 2006, when DP World had signed a 30 year contract.\n\nIn February, Djibouti seized control of the terminal, and abruptly terminated the contract without notice. Next, Djibouti signed a contract with Singapore-based Pacific International Lines (PIL), a company that works with China Merchants Port Holdings, to operate the terminal. So it appears that China is poised to take control of the entire Djibouti seaport.\n\nWhether in the South China Sea or Djibouti, China constantly lies and hides its intentions. China has been attacking American pilots and flight crews with high-powered lasers. We have to assume that this is not some rogue Chinese soldier, but is actual policy of the Chinese military, presumably to test out their laser systems in preparation for war.

In a move that may be deemed uncharacteristic for the Europhile, Angela Merkel's government unilaterally bought 76 million extra doses of coronavirus vaccines for the German people, rather than waiting for Brussels to secure vaccines for all member-states.\n\nEarlier, the EU-27 agreed on a collective vaccine-purchasing scheme whereby Brussels would negotiate with drugs vendors on their behalf and distribute by population the 2.3 billion doses.\n\nFellow member-states have criticised Germany for ordering an additional 30 million Pfizer/BioNTech doses for itself, as well as 20 million CureVac shots. Germany purchased another 26 million — 21 million by Moderna and the rest Pfizer — after other EU nations had rejected them either because of their cost, difficulty in delivering the product, or the vaccines' experimental nature.\n\nBelgium's MEP Frédérique Ries, who sits on the European Parliament's health committee, said that while she did not object to her neighbour buying the vaccines rejected by other states, she said the purchase of 30 million Pfizer vaccines showed a total lack of solidarity, according to The Times on Tuesday.\n\nPolish MEP Witold Waszczykowski, Poland's former foreign secretary and member of the country's governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, was more blunt in his criticism.\n\nIt is selfish behaviour to buy medicine by yourself, disrespecting common decisions, Mr Waszczykowski said. It is another example of the German policy of respecting their own interests above the interests of other EU countries.\n\nGermany — one of the most powerful and pro-EU members of the bloc — maintains that despite unilaterally negotiating with the drugs companies, it has not broken the rules, saying the doses will not be issued until the EU-organised vaccines have been distributed across the bloc.\n\n'Setback for the Free World': EU Trade Deal with Communist China Draws Harsh Criticism https://t.co/CktU0dsAnG — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 5, 2021\n\nOther cracks appear in the EU's vaccination programme, with President Andrzej Duda's chief of staff, Krzysztof Szczerski, saying in response to the Germany issue Poland may consider individual discussions with suppliers if the European vaccine purchasing system completely fails.\n\nCyprus is also in talks with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu over supplying vaccines to the island nation, as the European Union's procurement process was not enough for rapid and mass vaccinations.\n\nThere are other concerns in Europe over Brussels' handling of the vaccine distribution, with senior Czech conservative MEP Jan Zahradil demanding transparency on distribution across the bloc and price, following rumours and contradictory speculation.\n\nIn an effort to rein in its members, The Guardian reports that the head of the EU's powerful executive arm, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen — who is German — is contacting the EU-27's health ministers to ensure that they will continue to follow the bloc's orders.\n\nLast week, von der Leyen had said that the memorandum on vaccine distribution was legally binding, adding: We have all agreed… that there will be no parallel negotiations, no parallel contracts… We're all working together.\n\nThat solidarity in the EU is fracturing over the micromanagement of member-states' vaccination regimes may be unsurprising. Leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage predicted that there might not be an EU in a decade, because the bloc is already split culturally east and west, and financially north and south.\n\nSpeaking a week after the UK left the EU's institutions, Mr Farage said of the division: Just look at what's happening in Brussels: you've got the Poles and the Hungarians, vetoing the budget. You've got a eurozone, which is driving the south into deeper and deeper poverty.\n\nI don't think they'll even be a European Union in ten years' time. I think that we have set the standard, Mr Farage continued, predicting a mainstreaming of eurosceptic thought on the continent in the next two to three years.
ESPN writer Jemele Hill has blasted the Philadelphia Police Department, and implied that racism played a role in the handling of the arrest of two black men in a downtown Philadelphia Starbucks on Thursday.\n\nVideo emerged recently, which showed two black men getting arrested in a Starbucks. A white patron can be seen, and heard, sarcastically questioning police over why they were taking the men into custody:\n\n@Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn't ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it's never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci — Melissa DePino (@missydepino) April 12, 2018\n\nIn addition, the person who shot the video, Ms. DePino, who describes herself as outraged since November 8 on her Twitter profile, assumed the black men were arrested for doing nothing.\n\nMaking matters worse, professional journalists like ESPN's Jemele Hill, also decided to stoke the racial fires before waiting for details to emerge:\n\nMoreover, she derided another Twitter user for merely suggesting that she wait for all the facts before making a judgment:\n\nOnce again, this train is never late … https://t.co/AIYg26HqgW — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) April 14, 2018\n\nScornfully mocking those who suggest waiting for facts, should tell you all you need to know about journalists like Jemele Hill. However, had she waited for the facts, she would have learned some interesting things about the case from Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who is black.\n\nAccording to the AP:\n\nCommissioner Richard Ross said Starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing. He said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn't bought anything, as he said is company policy. He said they then refused to leave. Ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused, and they were then arrested but were later released after the company elected not to prosecute. He said the officers 'did absolutely nothing wrong' and were professional in their conduct toward the individuals but 'got the opposite back.' He did not mention the person who said he was meeting with the men. 'As an African American male, I am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,' Ross said. But he added If a business calls and they say that 'Someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business' (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties and they did just that.'\n\nThis explanation of course, did not fully satisfy Jemele Hill, who apparently believed that the men had been arrested for being black in Starbucks.\n\nIn light of the information provided by the facts train that she chose not to wait for, she shifted her argument to questioning why the police had to embarrass the two gentlemen:\n\nBecause the police had been called, I'm guessing the least they had to do is ask these gentlemen to leave. But why arrest them? Why embarrass them by placing handcuffs on them? I have seen plenty of officers de-escalate situations like these. https://t.co/2aIKIo1K2T — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) April 15, 2018\n\nMaybe they were arrested because trespassing is still against the law? As the commissioner said, the men were asked to leave by Starbucks employees and refused. Which is why the police were called in the first place. The police themselves then asked the men to leave three times, and they refused.\n\nWhen people refuse to comply with lawful orders, they tend to get arrested.\n\nHill then took exception to how long the two men were held in custody. When a Twitter follower asked why the men were held until one o'clock in the morning, Hill said she like an answer to that as well:\n\nThat's another question I'd like to be answered. I get responding to the complaint but they took every step afterward as if the intention was to prosecute to the fullest extent. The fact that this even crossed a prosecutor's desk is mind blowing. https://t.co/Bbyan5RJIJ — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) April 15, 2018\n\nHowever, again, if Hill had waited for the train of facts, she would know that the men were held until the police were told that Starbucks had no desire to prosecute, and then released.\n\nIf the time of day of that release is troublesome to Hill, perhaps she should take it up with Starbucks. Moreover, ESPN might want to have a conversation with Jemele Hill over her commentary on this issue.\n\nAccording to the ESPN social media policy which governs how personalities discuss political and social issues:\n\nThe subject matter should merit our audience's interests, and be worthy of our time, space and resources; we should be in position to discuss the issue with authority and be factually accurate. The topic should be related to a current issue impacting sports, unless otherwise approved by senior editorial management. This condition may vary for content appearing on platforms with broader editorial missions – such as The Undefeated, FiveThirtyEight and espnW. Commentaries on relevant sports-related issues are appropriate, but we should refrain from overt partisanship or endorsement of particular candidates, politicians or political parties. The presentation should be thoughtful and respectful. We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric. Communication with producers and editors must take place prior to commentary on any political or social issues to manage volume and ensure a fair and effective presentation.\n\nJust taking a brief glance at these requirements, it would seem that Hill is, at the very least, in violation of the prohibition against discussing issues that have no relation to sports. The Starbucks arrest had no sports connection whatsoever. Perhaps Hill's work on the Undefeated, a site which covers racial issues, gives her the freedom to address issues without a direct sports connection, but that seems like a debatable point.\n\nHowever, there's no question that she violated the network's rule requiring that ESPN personalities should be in position to discuss the issue with authority and be factually accurate.\n\nIn fact, Hill openly mocked a Twitter user for suggesting that she wait for details to come in. New ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro says that he doesn't believe ESPN is a political organization.\n\nNow would be a good time for him to show that he means what he says.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn
Despite claims to the contrary, the Posse Comitatus Act does not prohibit President Trump from sending military forces to the U.S.-Mexico border. Just as President Trump has the authority to declare a state of national emergency, he also has the authority to send troops to our southern border under certain circumstances.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S. Code, Section 1385, was first passed in 1878 to resolve concerns that the federal military was being used to enforce domestic laws in former Confederate states. Under its original terms, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibited the use of the Army to act as a posse comitatus (which means to act as domestic law enforcement) except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\n\nAfter World War II, Congress included the Air Force as subject to the Act, but strangely it did not include the Navy or Marine Corps, although a subsequent Department of Defense Regulation applies it to them. And as a maritime law enforcement agency, the Coast Guard is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nAs part of his plan to secure America's borders, President Trump has proposed sending U.S. military personnel to the southern border. More recently, the President considered declaring a state of national emergency.\n\nWhile some have claimed that President Trump may lack the legal authority to declared a state of national emergency, others claim that sending troops to the border violates Posse Comitatus. Recently, Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) declared it would be illegal for President Trump to declare a national emergency and send troops to the southern border, stating it would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. Congressman Lieu, who claims to have studied this issue as a military attorney, is incorrect, and to understand why, it's important to understand how both issues are connected.\n\nPresident Trump clearly has the authority to declare a state of national emergency. Less clear is is whether a declared state of emergency qualifies as one of the circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress under which Posse Comitatus applies. Resolving that question through months, or years, of litigation is probably less-than desirable for a President. Fortunately, Congress has already taken specific actions that obviate the need for litigation.\n\nUnder the Fiscal Year 2007 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress granted the President the authority to mobilize the military restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States under a number of circumstances, to include a condition that opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States. Congress also authorized the Secretary of Defense to, upon request from the Secretary of Homeland Security, assist in domestic law enforcement efforts to prevent terrorists, illegal drugs, and illegal aliens from entering the United States.\n\nIn other words, the Posse Comitatus Act's own exception can be triggered under the conditions outlined in the 2007 NDAA. Thus, it is not an absolute prohibition on the domestic use of military forces. Indeed, in 2005, Congress issued a Joint Resolution stating that:\n\n[B]y its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.\n\nWere President Trump to actually send troops to the southern border, it would not be unprecedented. In 2006, President George W. Bush deployed roughly 6,000 troops to the border to support domestic law enforcement activities. And in 2010, President Obama took similar action. Notably, while those actions might have been unpopular, no one seriously questioned whether Presidents Bush and Obama violated the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nWhether President Trump should deploy federal troops to the southern border is a question best left to policy experts. But there should be no question that President Trump certainly can deploy those troops, should he decide to do so.\n\nMike Berry is a leading expert in military law. He spent over seven years on active duty as a lawyer in the Marine Corps, including time spent as an instructor at the U.S. Naval Academy. Berry has represented military clients in high-profile cases involving war crimes, homicide, and espionage, among others.
Missionary Father Bernardo Cervellera says that the Vatican is yielding way too much in its forthcoming diplomatic deal with the ruling Communist Party in China, which risks being limp.\n\nFrom the vague information that is going around, said Father Cervellera in a Tuesday interview with the Catholic online site Crux, China—as stated by the director of Religious Affairs—simply wants to continue its policy of nominating bishops and the pope would just have the function of blessing what they decide.\n\nCervellera, who is also director of AsiaNews.it, criticized the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Paolo Parolin, for suggesting that although we know that this is a bad deal, better a bad deal than no deal at all.\n\nMany Catholics believe that this would mean handing the Church over to the Chinese government, the priest said. These are understandable and sharable concerns.\n\nA better proposal comes from Chinese Cardinal Joseph Zen, who sees firsthand all the problems that the underground Church has, Cervellera said. Zen recommends waiting for a deal where we ask China for more.\n\nFather Cervellera also took issue with the ambiguity surrounding the proposed agreement between the Vatican and the Chinese government, which raises a series of concerns.\n\nThere is a problem with the Vatican's communication, he said. Instead of saying 'we are making a deal,' snippets come out saying that all bishops will be recognized. Naturally this creates difficulties for the Chinese Church because everyone wants to know whether all the bishops, including the illicit (Chinese government appointed) ones, are included in the deal and if those not recognized by the government are included, meaning all the underground bishops.\n\nBecause otherwise the deal risks being 'limp,' he said.\n\nThe present conflict, he added, is practically a battle for investitures, which took place more than a thousand years ago, referring to the 11th-century showdown between Pope Gregory VII and the German King Henry IV over who had the right to appoint ecclesiastical officials in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn the interview, Father Cervellera said he had been receiving information piecemeal regarding the details of the forthcoming agreement, including the worrisome final authority of the Chinese bishop's council to overrule eventual objections by the pope to a given candidate, allowing them to proceed as if nothing happened.\n\nIt's risky because it puts in the hands of the government the possibility to choose all the bishops it wants depending on the criteria it has always had, he said, that is, choosing the most malleable, controllable ones and making them into an instrument of their politics instead of working for the evangelization of China.\n\nMoreover, the danger of Rome reconciling with all illicitly ordained bishops, he said, is that some in fact are not loyal to the Church.\n\nIn secret they say that they follow the Catholic faith, but in public they do what the government wants, he said.\n\nHow can faithful trust these bishops? How can they trust these ambiguous bishops, even if they become official? Benedict XVI once called them 'opportunistic,' and there are many. Even among the seven illicit ones, there are a few opportunistic ones, he said.\n\nThe faithful in the underground Church are freer without the constant control of the Patriotic Association, Cervellera said. One only has to see what is happening in the official Church, which is controlled completely. There are cameras in the parish offices, in the corridors, the police are always there. This is because China greatly fears religions, he said.\n\nThe priest said that the Chinese government fears the Catholic Church more than any other religion, and thus is anxious to procure greater control over it.\n\nA member of the Communist Party once told me this: 'We fear the Catholic Church because you are united,' he said. 'If something happens to a Catholic, immediately all the other Catholics in the world talk, speak, act! We are very afraid of your unity,' he said.\n\nCervellera also said he fears what will happen to the underground bishops, who have been faithful to Rome for so many years, often with great personal suffering.\n\nThe underground bishops are the biggest problem in dialogue between China and the Vatican, since the Chinese government does not want to recognize them, because they don't trust them. These people who have been martyred, who have been imprisoned, who have tried to follow the Vatican's indications and not belong to the Patriotic Association in order to be free for the faith are now set aside, he said.\n\nYou say, let's make a deal, but a deal in order to obtain what? he asked. We lose half the Church, we put the nomination of the bishops in the hands of the government.\n\nIn a deal where the Chinese government chooses the bishops and the pope has to give his blessing, what is to be gained?, he asked. We put the bishops in the hands of the government; we don't give the underground bishops a chance to be recognized… it seems like a complete loss. Why make a deal like that?\n\nFather Cervellera advanced his conjecture that in the present instance, the Vatican is acting out of fear and that is why it is caving in to Chinese demands.\n\nThe Vatican is afraid that the Chinese Ministry of Religious affairs, as it has always promised, will appoint many bishops without papal approval, at least in twenty dioceses, he said.\n\nI imagine that the Vatican is worried that if the number of basically excommunicated bishops grows so much, it might become even harder to build something, he said.\n\nHe said that the Vatican may also fear that in the future things will get worse. So, it's better to take this deal, even if it's bad, as a lesser evil, he suggested.\n\nThe real danger is not so much a schism in the Chinese Church, Cervellera said, since the underground bishops are faithful to Rome and will obey.\n\nThe danger is rather that under government control, the Catholic Church in China becomes a national church of the state.\n\nEven now, he said, when I go to China and meet an official bishop, they don't want to talk, because they say people from the Patriotic Association are there, so we can't talk, we can't talk. I go to talk to a bishop in Peking, and he says, no, we can't talk, because the place is bugged.\n\nWe're practically in an open-air concentration camp, he said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

First Daughter Ivanka Trump will be meeting with victims of human trafficking in Rome as part of President Donald Trump's international trip to Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe meeting was arranged with the Community of Sant'Egidio, a new mission in the Roman Catholic Church to combat human trafficking, according to the National Catholic Register, which notes that the U.S. embassy in Rome has been working with the Church on this issue.\n\nSant'Egido was founded in 1968 by Italian layman Andrea Richard, a historian and former minister in the Italian government to offer services to the poor, build conflict resolution, and to encourage ecumenical and inter-faith dialogue. Human trafficking is also part of its mission, according to the Catholic news site, cruxnow.com.\n\nThe community is based in the Roman neighborhood of Trastevere and is named for the church there in which it held its initial meetings, which is called 'St. Giles' in English, cruxnnow.com reported.\n\nIn addition to meeting with victims, Ivanka Trump is expected to discuss ways the United States and the Church can collaborate on this issue.\n\nSant' Egidio is a favorite of Pope Francis, who has repeatedly praised the group, cruxnow.com reported. At one of his first Angelus addresses on Sunday from the window of the papal apartment, Francis spotted a Sant' Egidio banner in the crowd and said, 'Those people from Sant' Egidio are great!'\n\nBut tensions between the Church and the ministry have existed, according to cruxnow.com.\n\nRep. Francis Rooney (R-FL) served as the U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See during George W. Bush's second term. Rooney said that when he organized a meeting for Bush with Sant' Egidio in 2007, he ran into some pushback from the Vatican.\n\nThere were some members of the Holy See's foreign policy establishment that feel a rivalry with Sant' Egidio and didn't like it, Rooney said in a recent interview for The Crux of the Matter radio show. We had to navigate through that a little bit.\n\nNational Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said this month President Trump's talking points will include religious freedom, cooperating with the Church on humanitarian issues.\n\nMeanwhile, First Lady Melania Trump will visit the Bambino Gesu children's hospital near the Vatican, the largest pediatric hospital and research center in Europe.
Cafe and gym owners in South Korea are filing separate lawsuits against the government this week seeking compensation for losses suffered under federally-mandated business shutdowns during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt the Seoul Western District Court on Tuesday, 203 gym owners belonging to the Pilates and Fitness Business Association filed for 5 million won (US$4,549) each for about 1 billion won [about $913,000] in total, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe association filed a similar lawsuit with the Seoul Southern District Court in December demanding 765 million won (nearly $700,000) for the same reason.\n\nThe South Korean government on December 6 ordered the greater Seoul area to adhere to the nation's second-highest level of social distancing measures as part of an effort to curb a then-surging number of new daily coronavirus cases. The Level 2.5 restrictions forced all indoor gyms in the national capital region to shut down as part of a related assembly ban.\n\nIf the government imposed an assembly ban and other restrictions simply due to the belief that (saliva) sprays more at indoor sports facilities, they must reconsider, Park Joo-hyung, head of Seoul's Pilates and Fitness Business Association said during a press conference outside the Seoul Western District Court on January 12.\n\nPark claimed that only 0.64 percent of last year's coronavirus infections in Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi Province were traced to indoor gyms, according to Yonhap.\n\nWe want (the government) to bring us scientific data or prove our analysis wrong, he added.\n\nSouth Korea's federal government in early January extended the Level 2.5 restrictions in the greater Seoul area to last until at least January 17.\n\nIn announcing the extension, however, the government allowed ballet and taekwondo schools to hold classes of up to nine people, sparking an outcry among gym owners, the Korea Times reported on January 5.\n\nGym owners in the capital region responded to the announcement by opening their facilities in protest of the unfair restrictions.\n\nA policy that applies different standards to the same type of indoor sports facility isn't fair, a Seoul-area gym owner named Oh Seong-young told the newspaper.\n\nGym operators reopened their businesses while following antivirus rules because we can't possibly continue to live like this, he said.\n\nOh's local gym association estimated that more than 300 gyms in the capital region had re-opened their facilities by January 5 in defiance of the shutdown extension.\n\nSeoul coffee shops have been similarly affected by the extended assembly ban in the capital region. A government-mandated Level 2 restriction in the Seoul area from November 23 banned restaurants from offering dine-in services. The order has forced local business owners to try to survive on delivery and takeout orders alone.\n\nOn Thursday, around 200 cafe owners plan to file a suit against the government at the Seoul Central District Court, seeking 5 million won in damages each, the national cafe owners association said Monday, Yonhap reported on January 12.\n\nWe're filing a suit out of desperation because our livelihoods are at risk due to the government's COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] regulations, Ko Jang-soo, the founder of South Korea's national cafe owners association, said on Monday.\n\nWe urge the government to come up with a consistent and fair system, he added.\n\nKim Ho-young, a lawyer representing the cafe owners, said that the restrictions on coffee shops amounted to arbitrary discrimination without rational reason. Kim added that the plaintiffs plan to file a separate petition with South Korea's Constitutional Court.
Pittsburgh Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin had a strong response Tuesday to wide receiver Antonio Brown streaming his postgame locker room speech with players on Facebook Live Sunday after their victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, calling the star wideout foolish, selfish and inconsiderate.\n\nIn the video, Tomlin is heard referring to their upcoming opponent, the New England Patriots, as a**holes.\n\nI'll be bluntly honest here. It was foolish of him to do that. It was selfish for him to do that. And it was inconsiderate for him to do that, Tomlin told reporters. Not only is it a violation of our policy, it is a violation of league policy — both of which he knows.\n\nTomlin acknowledged Brown will be punished internally for streaming the video.\n\nHe also called his language from the video regrettable.\n\nThis thing that is the National Football League, this platform that we have, is a precious and awesome thing. [It's] not something we take very lightly. The responsibility associated with being in this thing just from a role model standpoint is something that I personally embrace.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
After snubbing the NRA's offer to shoot with suppressors firsthand and learn how they really work, the Washington Post (WaPo) ran an editorial asking Congress to turn a deaf ear to the NRA's claim that suppressors protect hearing.\n\nWhen the NRA submitted a letter calling them out for rejecting the invite, WaPo printed the letter but only after deleting the line in which the NRA mentioned that the paper's editorial board refused to come learn about suppressors when asked.\n\nThe original WaPo editorial ran May 29. In it, WaPo admitted the some benefits can be gained from suppressors, but presented them as marginal at best and called on Congress to stand up for the people in general rather shooting sports participants.\n\nThey wrote:\n\nAnd it is the general public upon whose behalf Congress is supposed to legislate, not the tens of millions who participate in shooting sports. Even a marginal increase in risk to the population cannot be justified, unless the harms to the minority from current policy are very severe and there are no means to reduce them other than the proposed legislation. In fact, the harms to shooters are modest — somewhat elevated risk of non-total hearing loss, essentially — and effective alternatives to silencers are readily available.\n\nThe NRA-ILA's Chris Cox was allowed to respond with his own letter, which WaPo published on June 5. However, WaPo editors deleted this line: If the editorial board had accepted NRA's invitation to a suppressor shoot last week, they would have heard for themselves that the Hearing Protection Act is exactly what its title claims: An act that protects hearing.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, WaPo admitted editing out the line when asked. WaPo's editors said, We reserve the right to edit letters. As part of our normal process, we share edited letters with letter-writers at least twice in the process (including a final edited version). The problem here is that WaPo did not edit out a superfluous line that ought not to have been there in the first place. Rather, they took out the line that pulled the covers back on the fact that they had rejected the opportunity to go the NRA event and learn how suppressors actually work. And then, after rejecting that opportunity, had railed against pending suppressor regulation and the NRA.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

Trump allies are rallying around former Virginia Senator Jim Webb to fill the position of Defense Secretary, after the abrupt departure of retired Marine General Jim Mattis.\n\nThe support for Webb may come as somewhat of a surprise, since he is a Democrat and has been largely out of the headlines since the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, when he launched a bid for president.\n\nHowever, supporters say he aligns with President Trump's more realist world view — something that was a problem with Mattis, a foreign policy liberalist.\n\nFormer Navy Secretary and former Asst Sec Def @JimWebbUSA would be someone to consider seriously for SecDef. His foreign policy views line up better with @realdonaldtrump and are not Bush 3.0, Fox News host Laura Ingraham tweeted on December 21.\n\nFormer Navy Secretary and former Asst Sec Def @JimWebbUSA would be someone to consider seriously for SecDef. His foreign policy views line up better with @realdonaldtrump and are not Bush 3.0. — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) December 21, 2018\n\nOn Thursday, the New York Times reported the White House is considering Webb, citing three officials. A source also confirmed to Breitbart News that he is being considered.\n\nThe White House did not confirm any candidates, but indicated a search was underway.\n\nWe will let you know when we have an update. No personnel announcements at this time, spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.\n\nWebb, 72, is a graduate of the Naval Academy and a former Marine captain who fought in Vietnam as a Marine rifle platoon and company commander. He was awarded the Silver Star, the Navy Cross, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts.\n\nWebb, then a Republican, served in the Reagan administration as an assistant secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, and then secretary of the Navy. He then ran as a Democrat senator in Virginia in 2006, serving one term.\n\nWebb has a following among libertarians and foreign policy realists in Washington. He was a critic of the invasion of Iraq, and also disagreed with former President Barack Obama's interventions in Libya and Syria.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News during a conference call Wednesday that he thought the next defense secretary needs to be someone who agrees with Trump on ending unnecessary wars.\n\nThe president deserves people who do agree with him, Paul said. The president campaigned on the fact that we've been at war for too long in too many places.\n\nHe's the first president really in a lifetime who has had the ability to declare victory and say, 'We need to come home.' He needs a defense secretary who agrees with him and will carry out the policy, not try to stymie the policy, he added.\n\nHowever, some who know Webb are skeptical he would be a good fit. While he would have the experience for the job, they say he also has an independent streak.\n\nThere are a lot of advantages out of that, but there is also a big danger, said Jim Hanson, president of the Security Studies Group. Webb's an arrogant bastard. That doesn't always work. [Rex] Tillerson was also an arrogant bastard.\n\nTrump needs an ally. Tillerson and Mattis both didn't agree with him on his foreign policy agenda. They were almost the opposition to Trump. He needs someone who isn't going to fight him on things, he added.\n\nHowever, Hanson said Webb would be good for military reform. He's not a force deployment guy — he's someone who is going to look at the structure of the force.\n\nOther names being floated to the White House include Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), Army Secretary Mark Esper, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, former Missouri Sen. Jim Talent, former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, and retired Army Gen. Jack Keane.\n\nJames Carafano, vice president of the Heritage Foundation's Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute who served as an adviser on the Trump transition team, also recommended that the president choose someone onboard with his agenda.\n\nWe've already seen what happens when you pick someone who's not really a team player. You can't do that on Defense, you can't do that on State. Maybe you can do that on some agency somewhere, but not on the two most key critical cabinet posts, he said.\n\nFrank Gaffney, president and CEO of the Center for Security Policy, agreed.\n\nThe president cannot run the whole government. He has to delegate, and he has to delegate to people he trusts to run the departments the way he would run them if he could run them all, he said.\n\nAnd if you've got people who have a lot of interesting skill sets, but won't do what he wants done, it's a formula for a disastrous administration.
Swiss authorities are confiscating valuable possessions from migrants and taxing them 10 per cent of any money they earn to pay for their upkeep.\n\nAs the migrant crisis sweeps across Europe, Switzerland has introduced the requirement that migrants must hand over any possessions worth more than 1,000 Swiss francs if they wish to claim asylum.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports one Syrian asylum seeker who showed a local TV station a receipt he had been given after handing over cash to immigration authorities.\n\nIt also showed an information sheet which reads: If you have property worth more than 1,000 Swiss francs when you arrive at a reception centre you are required to give up these financial assets in return for a receipt.\n\nThe Swiss migration authority says asylum seekers and refugees must contribute where possible to the cost of processing their applications and providing social care.\n\nIf someone leaves voluntarily within seven months this person can get the money back and take it with them. Otherwise the money covers costs they generate, a spokeswoman said.\n\nThose who do win the right to stay are then taxed 10 per cent of any money they earn for up to 10 years or until they repay 15,000 francs in administrative costs.\n\nA recent attempt by Denmark to introduce similar measures sparked international outrage, with the Washington Post even comparing the measures to the holocaust.\n\nUnder the proposals, migrants would be able to keep assets which are necessary to maintain a modest standard of living, e.g. watches and mobile phones. Furthermore, assets which have a certain personal, sentimental value to a foreigner will not, as a main rule, be seized unless they have [considerable] value.\n\nDanish integration minister Inger Stoejberg took to Facebook to defend the policy, writing: I can see that some foreign media are pouring scorn over (the fact) that we in the future may withdraw asylum seekers' valuables and demand that they should pay for their stay in asylum centres themselves.\n\nThere is no reason to criticise, since it is already the case that if you as a Dane have valuables for more than 10,000 kroner ($1,450, 1,340 euros) it may be required that this is sold before you can receive unemployment benefits.\n\nDenmark proposed the new measures as Sweden tightened its borders, leading to fears thousands of refugees would choose the country as their final place of residence. Hundreds of thousands passed through Denmark last year, but most were simply on their way to Sweden.
Four in five Brits aged between 18 and 30 identify as British, compared to less than half who feel European, a post-Brexit vote poll has revealed.\n\nThose in UKIP areas and the working classes were more likely to feel British, whilst those in London and the South of England purported to feel more European than in the North.\n\nThe survey of 1,994 young adults from England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland was commissioned by think tank Demos and supported by the British Council as part of the Next Generation project.\n\nResearchers noted the areas where people felt more British tended to correlate with the parts of the country that voted to leave the European Union (EU).\n\nBritish identity was strongest in the North-East, one of the most firmly Brexit backing areas of the country, where a whopping 93 per cent said they felt to some extent or to a great extent British.\n\nYet the areas with the highest number of people feeling European were London and Northern Ireland, which voted against Brexit and where 59 per cent identified with the continent.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, which voted by 55.8 per cent to remain in the EU, the feeling of Britishness slipped to 62 per cent. In Scotland, which also voted to remain, just 59 per cent said they felt British.\n\nIn Wales, which voted to leave the EU, just 35 per cent said they felt European, the smallest proportion in the country.\n\nThe study also found that young people in lower socioeconomic groups were less likely to feel European, and those in Labour and UKIP areas were more likely to feel British.\n\nThose in the South of England were also more likely to identify as European as those in the North.\n\nIan Wybron, head of social policy at Demos, told The Sun that those who felt more British had been excluded from opportunities to understand other cultures.\n\nLiving, working and studying abroad offers clear benefits for young people, helping them to secure better jobs, as well as building confidence and intercultural understanding, he said.\n\nBut our research found that a substantial number of young adults are currently being excluded from these opportunities – particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
On Breitbart News Sunday, host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon interviewed James Rosebush, the Deputy Assistant to President Reagan and Chief of Staff to First Lady Nancy Reagan. Rosebush wrote the book True Reagan: What Made Ronald Reagan Great and Why It Matters and discussed the death of Nancy Reagan.\n\nNancy Reagan was one of the smartest people you will ever meet, Rosebush said. She basically wanted to know everything that was going on in the president's life. It didn't mean that she necessarily wanted to influence it, but she wanted to be aware of it and be a staunch supporter with him.\n\nRosebush said there was a real compact between the Reagans and they worked together on so many things. They supported each other in areas of weakness, and Nancy worked hard to ensure Ronald Reagan's success. This relationship ultimately benefitted the American people, according to Rosebush.\n\nI always say the American taxpayer got a good deal with Nancy Reagan, Rosebush said.\n\nBannon and Rosebush discussed how Nancy Reagan really understood political and social issues but often avoided becoming directly involved with policy because she thought it was improper.\n\nShe knew that she was not elected, Rosebush said. She was there in a supportive role and she used her own bully pulpit to draw attention and put a spotlight on things she cared about.\n\nBringing back the gravity and prestige of the presidency was a big deal to the Reagans, according to Rosebush, and it is not just there for the president's aggrandizement. Nancy Reagan had a huge role to play in bringing back that prestige and Rosebush said that when you went to the White House, you felt it.\n\nThis was done to demonstrate the American ideal and American exceptionalism. The White House would the the shining city on a hill that demonstrated American power to the word and gave the American people pride in their government.\n\nRosebush said that Nancy made the White House influential and inspiring.\n\nA major event that Nancy played a key role in was in helping President Reagan after he was shot by John Hinckley, which took an immense physical toll on Reagan. She watched his diet and helped him rehabilitate.\n\nThe assassination attempt changed Nancy Reagan to a certain extent, Rosebush said. It added a degree of fear and uncertainty to her life, but strengthened the bond with the Secret Service and those who were tasked with protecting the president.\n\nThe military and the Secret Service loved the Reagans, Rosebush said. If someone finds out that I worked for the Reagans and they were in in the military and the Secret Service, they tell me stories about how much they loved the Reagans.
A student at Northern Arizona University is reportedly facing academic repercussions for the using the word mankind as a synonym for humanity in an essay for an English class.\n\nAlthough most dictionaries define mankind as the human race, which is gender inclusive, Northern Arizona University Professor Anne Scott is sending a message to a student who dared to use the word that Scott believes is sexist, in a recent essay.\n\nI would be negligent, as a professor who is running a class about the human condition and the assumptions we make about being 'human,' if I did not also raise this issue of gendered language and ask my students to respect the need for gender-neutral language, Scott wrote in an email to the student about her grade. The words we use matter very much, or else teachers would not be making an issue of this at all, and the MLA would not be making recommendations for gender-neutral language at the national level.\n\nScott specifically cites the use of mankind as the reason why the student lost one point out of 50 on a recent English essay in her Critical Reading and Writing in the University Community course.\n\nThe student, Caitlin Jeffers, claims that Professor Scott instructed students to avoid using gender-specific language at the beginning of the semester. Jeffers claim that she wished to test the policy to see if Scott would actually lower her grade on an assignment due to the use of gender-specific language.\n\nAfter receiving her grade on the essay, Jeffers said she requested a meeting with Scott to address her decision to police the language of her students.\n\nShe told me that 'mankind' does not refer to all people, only males. I refuted, stating that it does refer to all people, [but] she proceeded to tell me that I was wrong; 'mankind' is sexist, and I should make an effort to look beyond my preset positions and ideologies, as is the focus of the class, Jeffers claimed.\n\nScott offered Jeffers the opportunity to rework the essay to increase her grade, noting that she must remove the word mankind to do so.\n\nI will respect your choice to leave your diction choices 'as is' and to make whatever political and linguistic statement you want to make by doing so, the professor wrote. By the same token, I will still need to subtract a point because your choice will not be made in the letter or spirit of this particular class, which is all about having you and other students looking beneath your assumptions and understanding that 'mankind' does not mean 'all people' to all people. It positively does not.\n\nScott reportedly also sent an email to the class that she will continue to dock points from students' work when it uses gender-specific language.\n\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

We are witnessing something truly extraordinary. In merely 19 days, a GoFundMe campaign to raise private contributions to build sections of the wall along the Mexico border has raised an astonishing $19.0 million. It will soon be the most successful GoFundMe campaign ever—the current record holder is the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund for victims of sexual assault, which raised $22 million in 2018 over a much longer period of time. The campaign to build the wall should blow past that number in a few days.\n\nLet's put this in perspective. Consider the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Tax Check-Off, which is promoted by the IRS through the 1040 tax form and doesn't require a contributor to give any money beyond what he is already paying in taxes. In April of 2016—normally the highest contribution month during a presidential campaign year—it raised $9.9 million. In a typical month, it raises less than a million dollars.\n\nThe GoFundMe wall campaign was started on December 16, 2018, by Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost three limbs while serving in Iraq in 2004. As Kolfage told me, People are angry about the inaction on building the border wall. They're opening their checkbooks to donate as a way of making their voices heard.\n\nThe astonishing number of contributions that this project has received from ordinary Americans demonstrates just how important the wall is to the American people. Citizens see the crime, wage depression, and other negative consequences of illegal immigration, and they want something done about it.\n\nMore than that, building the wall makes clear that the United States is a sovereign nation that is willing to do what is necessary to control its own border. Indeed, securing a nation's borders is one of the most fundamental obligations that a government owes to its people. For decades, the federal government has failed miserably in fulfilling that obligation. Now, Americans are making a grassroots effort to solve the problem themselves, while sending a message to Washington. As Kolfage put it, This is giving them an avenue to be heard.\n\nThe Trump administration would do well to listen. Constructing the wall was the single most important campaign promise made by the President. Build the wall was the trademark chant at every Trump election rally in 2016. This issue arguably won the election for President Trump.\n\nThe GoFundMe campaign shows that people are not only willing to cast their votes for this cause; they are also willing to give their hard-earned money to it. The President cannot afford to back down on his promise to build the wall. The American people want it. They know that it will work. And if the politicians in Washington won't do it, patriotic Americans will try to do it themselves. They are doing so at https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall.\n\nKris W.

Rep. Steve King (R-IA) is facing new criticism Thursday after comments appeared in the New York Times in which he questioned when the terms white nationalist and white supremacist had become offensive.\n\nThe article, titled, Before Trump, Steve King Set the Agenda for the Wall and Anti-Immigrant Politics, sought to link King's controversial statements with his long-standing support for a tough immigration policy.\n\nThe Times published the following:\n\nMr. King, in the interview, said he was not a racist. He pointed to his Twitter timeline showing him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. (The same office once displayed a Confederate flag on his desk.) At the same time, he said, he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is the culture of America based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? Mr. King said. Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nKing faced a tough re-election challenge in 2018 in which his rhetoric became a campaign issue.\n\nUpdate: Rep.

Over the last few months, liberal entertainers, as well as sports reporters, have been attacking various high profile Americans simply because they are Christian. And this type of behavior is something that Fox News commentator Bruce Riley Ashford thinks must stop.\n\nAshford cites several people in the news who have become targets merely because they are Christian. For instance, early in February sports commentator Tony Dungy was attacked by sports writers because he often includes his Christian beliefs in his own sports analysis. Vice President Mike Pence has been slammed for his Christian beliefs throughout his first year in Washington, but especially during this year's Winter Olympics. And former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow has been a target of ridicule since he first appeared in the national sports spotlight.\n\nIn his February 16 op-ed, Ashford slams those who think that being a practicing Christian is a sign of mental illness.\n\nAshford notes that panelists on The View on ABC TV mocked Vice President Mike Pence for his Christian faith, calling it 'scary' and even saying that his religious beliefs are a kind of 'mental illness,' he wrote. Such comments are an insult to everyone who holds sincere religious beliefs.\n\nThe Vice President slammed ABC for its attack on Christianity. During an interview with Axios, the VP said, It's just simply wrong for ABC to have a television program that expresses that kind of religious intolerance. He added that the whole discussion shows how out of touch some in the mainstream media is.\n\nAshford agrees with the vice president.\n\nPence is right, Ashford wrote. No matter what you think of his politics, his views on public policy issues, or his performance in elective office, he should not be criticized for his Christian beliefs.\n\nAshford also noted the many other media personalities who are attacking Pence for his religious beliefs, and criticized those who put the worst possible spin on the VP's faith.\n\nWhat the media and critics haven't done, and won't do, Ashford added, is to point out that their attacks on Pence are part of a larger and very disturbing trend in American life – an ugly form of prejudice called Christian shaming.\n\nAshford went on to recount the Christian shaming of sports commentator Tony Dungy and former NFL player Tim Tebow. And it's something that Ashford thinks needs to stop.\n\nThe Fox opinionist insisted that there are two things that Americans must understand in this debate.\n\nFirst, there is nothing in the world wrong with being Christian in public, Ashford said. For Christians, our beliefs are deeply held convictions that should shape our identities, organize our lives, and motivate us to be good neighbors and citizens.\n\nAnd why should NBC or its viewers care if Tebow, Dungy or Foles identify as Christians? Would they have the same reaction to somebody on television who identified as Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or Jewish? As an atheist? Ashford added.\n\nAshford reminded readers that the founding fathers enshrined religious liberty into our system for an important reason saying, there is nothing wrong with our quest for religious liberty.\n\nWith his second reason, Ashford claimed that even if they don't realize it, these critics are practicing their own form of religion in public:\n\nThat's right. Each and every American, from the outspoken Christian to the dyed-in-the-wool atheist, has a religion, whether they use the term or not. Something or somebody sits at the center of the lives of everyone, shaping their identities, organizing their lives, and guiding their views of right and wrong. That something or someone functions as the god of that person's life. In other words, every human being ascribes ultimate worth to something or someone – to some person, ideal or ideology. If it is not God, it may be sex, money or power. Or anything else.

Saturday on MSNBC's AM Joy, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) weighed in on President Donald Trump's foreign policy decisions, saying it should scare us all.\n\nWe cannot afford to have this president making military decisions and getting in the position to declare war. That is the purview of Congress. We should be debating this issue, Waters told host Joy Reid.\n\nWe absolutely should be concerned about this president because I believe that he's making decisions that perhaps should scare us all, she continued. He feels as if he has the power to use this military in ways that should frighten all of us.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) media swiftly picked up on a U.S. reporter's as-yet unsubstantiated claim that someone at the White House referred to the Wuhan coronavirus as the Kung Flu in her presence, a fairly popular satirical name for the virus she interpreted as a racial slur.\n\nThe CCP, of course, is eager to suppress all discussion of where the virus originated or China's role in making it into a global pandemic, so Chinese media leaped at the opportunity to recycle American media attacks against President Donald Trump and his administration for refusing to stop talking about it.\n\nThe Tuesday tweet from CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang said, This morning a White House official referred to [the] coronavirus as the 'Kung-Flu' to my face. Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back.\n\nThis morning a White House official referred to #Coronavirus as the Kung-Flu to my face. Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back. — Weijia Jiang (@weijia) March 17, 2020\n\nJiang did name the official, nor did she indicate whether the person in question was speaking confidentially.\n\nWhen White House political counselor Kellyanne Conway said the Kung Flu comment was inappropriate on Wednesday and challenged Jiang to name the person who said it, the CBS reporter's strange reply was, I think you understand how these conversations go.\n\nNo, I don't know how these conversations go, and that is highly offensive, so you should tell us all who it is, Conway shot back.\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday also asked the media to name the White House official who said Kung Flu, but the name had not been made public as of Thursday morning.\n\nChinese state media, like much of the U.S. media, linked the Kung Flu comment with all references to the coronavirus as Chinese or from Wuhan as racist slurs. The state-run Xinhua news service launched such an attack on Thursday:\n\nWhen some U.S. politicians insist on finding scapegoats to cover up their own incompetence in responding to COVID-19, the threat to public health will only worsen. Faced with domestic criticism and deepened public fears, some White House politicians sharpened their rhetoric against China this week, referring to the widespread coronavirus as the Chinese virus, Wuhan virus, or the kung-flu, blaming China for the epidemic, and arousing virus-related hatred. But putting the blame on China is not an easy or quick way out of the twin health and economic crises faced by the U.S. administration. The tactic can only hurt China-U.S. relations and dampen the confidence in fighting the coronavirus, domestically and internationally. When the U.S. public sees that their government has sunk so low as to scapegoat China, fears will only deepen, as shown in the continuous slide in the U.S. stock market despite increasing policy efforts.\n\nXinhua laid out China's propaganda objectives clearly, sweeping aside the Communist Party's role in concealing the virus, punishing doctors who tried to warn about it, and feeding false information to the World Health Organization (WHO) to claim China was a heroic leader in the global response to the pandemic and behaved as a responsible member of the international community.\n\nAccording to Xinhua, all the cool kids in America are saluting Beijing for a job well done:\n\nThe irresponsible and cold-blooded words and actions of some federal politicians stand in sharp contrast with many U.S. states and cities which have expressed sympathy and support for Chinese provinces and cities. American businesses, institutions and people have also donated money and supplies to China. Now Chinese businesses and civil society are supporting the American people's epidemic response. The U.S. politicians should be clearly aware that distracting the world from the shortcomings of their response will lead to nothing but division, domestically and internationally, damage the government's credibility, and make the United States weaker rather than stronger. The only correct way out for the U.S. side is to focus on self-improvement, handle its domestic issues and provide convincing evidence that the spread of the virus can be brought under control as promised.\n\nFor some reason, Xinhua – and most of the American media apparatus – forgot to mention that President Trump began making a point of calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus after Chinese officials began floating insane conspiracy theories that the virus originated in the United States, possibly as a deliberate bio-weapons attack against China.
Signs near schools in Okay, Oklahoma, put would-be attackers on notice that staff members may be armed and are ready to use whatever force necessary to protect students.\n\nThe signs are visible around public schools in the district.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Okay Superintendent Charles McMahan noted that the town's police force was dissolved in 2014, and the district had to make a decision. McMahan said, We don't want to be a soft target.\n\nOne of the signs says, ATTENTION: Please be aware that certain staff members at Okay Public Schools can be legally armed and may use whatever force is necessary to protect our students.\n\nOkay High School's principal, Mark Hayes, supports the carry policy. He told the Muskogee Phoenix, These are our kids, adding, We want to keep [them] safe.\n\nSchool employees who want to arm themselves have to qualify by getting a Council on Law Enforcement Education Training certification or license; possess an Oklahoma Self Defense Act License; and be CLEET qualified with the firearm.

U.S. Chamber of Commerce executives are urging the split Republican-Democrat Congress and President Trump to end the government shutdown by giving amnesty to more than three million illegal aliens.\n\nIn a letter to Congress, Chamber of Commerce Vice President Neil Bradley writes that Republicans and Democrats must come together to grant amnesty to about 3.5 million illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nBradley writes:\n\nWe urge members of Congress and the administration to expeditiously complete legislation to re-open the federal government and seize the opportunity to both improve border security and provide protection for Dreamers and long-term TPS beneficiaries. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce executive claims the DACA amnesty is necessary for the long-term health of the American economy.\n\nThe Chamber supports a deal that combines increasing border security with protection and legal status for Dreamers and long-term beneficiaries of the TPS program, Bradley continues. These are important policy objectives that would improve the near-term and long-term health of our economy while also demonstrating that it is indeed possible for policymakers to make progress on a politically fraught issue.\n\nCorporate interests and the big business lobby have the most to gain from granting an amensty to DACA illegal aliens, as legalizing millions of low-skilled foreign workers would drag down wages for Americans, drive up profit margins for corporations, and leave U.S. taxpayers with the costs.\n\nThe 'Amnesty First' Trap: Trump Supporters Concerned Trade to End Shutdown Would Cause Illegal Immigration Surgehttps://t.co/X7IXb7kdMX — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) January 8, 2019\n\nA DACA amnesty would put more U.S.-born children of illegal aliens — commonly known as anchor babies — on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with a $26 billion bill.\n\nAdditionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid.\n\nAny plan to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens that does not also include provisions to halve legal immigration levels would give amnestied illegal aliens the opportunity to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as chain migration.\n\nThe chain migration inflow from a DACA amnesty has the potential to reach nine million foreign nationals arriving in the country, as every two newly naturalized citizens bring about seven foreign relatives to the U.S. with them.\n\nDespite major opposition from Trump's base of supporters to for an amnesty-for-wall funding deal, the plan has been touted in White House discussions, as it is favored by the billionaire donor class.
The House coronavirus spending bill allows roughly 500,000 college graduate visa-workers from China, India, and elsewhere to stay in their U.S. jobs, regardless of job losses by American graduates in the economic meltdown, according to a lobby group for H-1B workers.\n\nThe measure would prevent U.S. graduates from getting hundreds of thousands of college-grade jobs as the foreign workers' visas expire — despite the colossal job losses being caused by China's Wuhan virus.\n\nThe rule would even allow foreign H-1B workers who are fired to stay and compete for any jobs that come open during the epidemic.\n\nWe have been working behind the scenes to address the immediate concerns of a lot of immigrants, claimed the Facebook post by Immigration Voice, which was posted around 5.oo PM EST. The group continued:\n\nWe take some solace to report, Immigration Voice has convinced the House to include a provision in the upcoming stimulus bill which says – in light of the indefinite closing of USCIS offices and U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, all existing lawful immigration statuses and EADs [Employment Authortization Documents] will be automatically extended for 1 year from the date the legislation is enacted. As per the current language, if you have an H4 EAD, it will be extended for a year. If you have an H-1B about to expire, it will be renewed and you can remain here even if furloughed until the crisis is over. … We need the Senate to agree to add the language into its stimulus in order for the doctors and other critical care workers we have in our community to be able to treat patients and go to work without fear of losing their status if they die. Please call your Senators and make sure they understand the importance of this provision and of the work you do.\n\nImmigration Voice claims to be an independent group, but reportedly works closely with Compete America, an advocacy group formed by the nation's major tech companies, nearly all of whom employees large blocs of Indian and Chinese visa-workers in jobs that could be filled by young American graduates.\n\nThe coalition's members include Facebook, Cisco Systems, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Google, Microsoft, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Immigration Voice claim is unproven, but it matches a new demand from FWD.us, an advocacy group of West Coast investors.\n\nThe group said the federal government should automatically extend visa permits for the nation's population of foreign visa workers amid the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe list of Policy Priorities … that Congress & Elected Officials must take, was posted March 21 by the group's director Todd Schulte, and it said:\n\nWe are in a global pandemic. The third week of March has seen more job loss than any other in our history and more businesses closed … [the Government should] Automatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020.\n\nA policy of automatic renewal would keep roughly 500,000 foreign college-level visa-workers on U.S. company payrolls by the end of 2020, even as many thousands of American graduates are losing jobs amid the economic meltdown caused by China's Wuhan virus.\n\nBut if President Donald Trump used his emergency powers to not renew the work visas, he would open up several hundred thousand good jobs for the American college graduates who are likely to vote in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, agency officials are moving ahead with plans to import 85,000 new H-1B workers in 2020. Breitbart News asked the Department of Homeland Security if the agency is considering curbs on the 2020 award of H-1B visas because of the coronavirus disaster. No changes at this time, a spokesman responded on March 19.\n\nDonald Trump's DHS has taken two steps to speed the delivery of 86,000 foreign graduates into American grads' jobs:\n\nEven as many US white-collars are about to be laid off by US managers & Indian subcontractors.\n\nDespite Trump's 2016 campaign promise. https://t.co/rsgZeHClla — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 22, 2020\n\nU.S.-based companies employ a population of roughly 1.5 million college-graduate visa workers in the United States.\n\nThe FWD.us lobby group was formed by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and other West Coast investors to help push the Gang of Eight amnesty bill through Congress. The group was subsequently funded by a roster of investors and business chiefs, including top executives from Walmart, Google, and Microsoft. The investors strongly support mass immigration because it cuts companies' labor costs and inflates consumer sales.\n\nSince the populist election of Donald Trump, the group's members have tried to defend their supply of visa workers, and of legal immigrant workers, consumers, and renters.\n\nThe group's primary strategy is to shift the public debate away from visa-workers and legal immigration by pushing the media to provide sympathetic coverage to illegal workers, 'DACA' illegals, Central American migrants, New York illegals, and poor criminals.\n\nFor example, the group's call for automatic visa-worker extensions is buried in a press release urging common-sense measures to provide economic support to jobless Americans and small companies:\n\nWe know that this crisis will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable in society, including those harmed and directly impacted by our broken immigration and criminal justice systems. …\n\nProvide zero-interest loan assistance to any small business who needs it and some targeted tax relief for others so they don't fire their workforce. This means making sure restaurants, home health care providers — and not just big companies — can keep people paid and stay afloat.\n\nExpand unemployment insurance and safety net programs and benefits. This should include plans and emergency funds to cover child care and medical care, and specific support for those at the frontlines of this crisis.\n\nRelease people from the public health disaster that are jails, detention centers, and prisons. Federal, state, and local officials should be looking for every opportunity to dramatically reduce incarcerated populations, who are at some of the highest risk.\n\nAutomatically extend or renew visas or immigration benefits that are set to renew before the end of 2020. This should include DACA recipients who may no longer be able to renew because of the closure of USCIS offices and require an active DACA status to be eligible for protection from deportation and to be able to continue to legally work in the U.S. Many DACA recipients are healthcare workers on the front lines of this crisis.\n\nProvide immediate relief from debt collections, immigration enforcement, and eviction.\n\nAlongside the call for automatic renewal of visa workers, the investors' group is also calling for immediate relief … [from] immigration enforcement, the release of many prisoners, and the renewal of work-permits for the roughly 600,000 migrants covered by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals' quasi-amnesty.\n\nAt home? Want to tell Congress what should be in this package? Go to https://t.co/mC34ZjwFZX https://t.co/H6VzGF5kEC — Todd Schulte (@TheToddSchulte) March 22, 2020\n\nA Breitbart News study showed the population of white-collar visas workers to be roughly 1.5 million. At least one-third of those workers — or 500,000 — have their visa status renewed each year\n\nThe overall population of 1.5 million visa workers includes roughly 900,000 foreign workers on three-year H-1B visas, as well as roughly 300,000 foreign graduates on one-year visas.\n\nTwo-thirds of the 1.5 million visa workers are Indians, while the Chinese workers providing the second-largest group.\n\nCompany executives and Human Resources managers use the H-1B program to procure and promote blocs of compliant, disposable, lower-skill foreign college graduates for the many good jobs which are sought by qualified and eager U.S. graduates and mid-career professionals.\n\nThe blocs of H-1B workers sometimes cost more than American professionals, partly because they are often less productive and innovative than American graduates.\n\nBut U.S. managers prefer visa workers because they can be hired and fired as 'gig workers' via networks of coordinating subcontractors, such as Infosys, Tata, HCL, and other Indian companies.\n\nAlso, the federal government rarely enforces routine workplace laws in H-1B workplaces. The government's refusal to enforce the laws means the H-1Bs can be hired, fired, and abused by their bosses, most of whom are Indians who grew up in Indians' own culture. These abuses include workplace intimidation, sexual discrimination, and unpaid overtime hours, Americans tell Breitbart News.\n\nThe government inaction in H-1B workplaces also strips American graduates of routine workplace protections, including protections against commonplace discrimination because of their nationality.\n\nDoJ/EEOC do nothing as US & Indian execs trade US jobs to Indian #H1B workers, cutting Americans out of careers, homes & families.\n\nThis trade choked innovation in Silicon-V, slammed insurance & banking. #SenMikeLee & #S386 will expand it to healthcare https://t.co/qoENwyO6X7 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 9, 2020\n\nMany brand-name American companies in the software, Internet, insurance sectors rely on these visa workers. Numerous American graduates report that native-born Americans are a rarity in most Silicon Valley companies, as well as in insurance and banking industries on both coasts.\n\nEach April, 85,000 H-1B visas are awarded to U.S. and Indian companies via a rushed application and lottery process managed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. An additional cap-exempt 15,000 H-1Bs are awarded throughout the year to non-profit employers at universities, research laboratories, and hospitals. Cap-exempt employers are allowed to hire as many H-1Bs as they wish.\n\nThe current head of DHS, Chad Wolf, formerly served as a lobbyist for the Indian-based outsourcing industry. The group's mix of Indian and U.S. companies use the H-1B program to extract salaries and wealth from the U.S. college-graduate class and to split the gains among both countries' executives and investors, as well as with the visa workers.\n\nDHS on autopilot, says it will speed the award of 85,000 H-1B graduate visa-workers to US employers by barring corporate line-jumping via the 'premium processing' service.\n\nMeanwhile, myriad US grads will lose their jobs in April b/c of coronavirus. @S386https://t.co/LvhiwtqAbK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 19, 2020\n\nMeanwhile, business groups are trying to expand the H-1B program. For example, activists are citing the coronavirus as an excuse for Congress to allow investors to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates for jobs in the healthcare sector. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is also pushing his S.386 bill to reward additional Indians if they take jobs from American graduates.\n\nTrump's failure to set curbs on the H-1B program has angered many of the swing-voting university graduates who supported him in 2016. In March 2016, after much zig-zagging, Trump declared:\n\nThe H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\n\nIn February 2020, a U.S. judge struck down the token H-1B curbs set by USCIS managers since Trump's election.\n\nGovt data shows 1 million Indian contract-workers get white-collar jobs in tech, banking, health etc.\n\nThe Indian hiring ignores many EEOC laws & is expanding amid gov't & media silence.\n\nIt is a huge economic & career loss for US college grads.#S368 #H1B https://t.co/pqEW9yJ89c — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 17, 2020\n\nImmigration reformers are calling for the cancellation of the 2020 H-1B awards amid the economic crash.\n\nAmerican professionals have organized to lobby against the H-1B program via the American Workers Coalition, U.S. TechWorkers, and ProUSworkers.

The sites include SAITJ.org and H1BFacts.com. The scope of this thing is really unbelievable, said one researcher.\n\nOther sites document the conflicts created by diverse foreign business practices in the United States. The non-political MyVisaJobs.com site also provides much information about H-1B outsourcing and green card rewards in multiple industries.\n\nThe federal USCIS agency provides some data, including data about the uncapped OPT program, sometimes called the Mini-H-1B.\n\nThe economic crash means the federal government must stop the inflow of H-1B workers so that sidelined American professionals can get jobs, a Florida-based American computer expert told Breibart News March 19.\n\nFiona earned two college degrees in the early 2000s after she left the real estate industry following the 2007 collapse.

She said her job ended when she was forced out by Indian managers, in part, because of her excellent performance reviews. She is in her 50s, has been unemployed for several months, and fears recruiters will blackball her if she speaks on the record.\n\nShe told Breitbart News, I'm not eligible for unemployment. So I have lived off my savings, and I'm living with my son. I'm still applying for jobs, but they're very few and far between. I can't relocate again because when they cut my contract job, I had to cut my lease off early, so now, my credit is bad. My lease history is bad. I can't go and take the risks that I did before.

A shocking report published Saturday local time by the Epoch Times revealed that crematoriums in China are struggling to keep up with the hundreds of bodies they are receiving, suggesting Beijing is undercounting the number of coronavirus deaths in the country.\n\nThe Epoch Times, a Chinese-American anti-communist newspaper, sent journalists to speak with the heads of several funeral homes and crematoriums in Hubei province – whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicenter of the current novel coronavirus outbreak. The newspaper found that adding up the total number of people cremated per day in several funeral homes yielded a significantly larger number than the official number of deaths tallied since the outbreak began in December.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party alerted the world to the discovery of a new type of coronavirus on January 20, over a month after locals became aware of a disease spreading and 20 days after local officials shut down a wild meat market in Wuhan where the virus is believed to have originated.\n\nAccording to the Epoch Times, the crematoria were handling 4-5 times the usual cremation volume per day. Few of those cremated were officially confirmed as coronavirus cases.\n\nI received 127 corpses yesterday [February 3], and burned 116. Among them, 8 were confirmed [coronavirus cases] on the death certificate and 48 were suspected, a funeral home director in Hubei using the pseudonym You Hu told the newspaper. I am about to collapse, we are under great pressure now.\n\nThe newspaper offered insight into a larger funeral home in Hankou, a Wuhan neighborhood, which it estimated had the capacity to burn 576 people per day. You Hu told the Epoch Times that the backlog of people waiting to be cremated was not due to lack of space in the burners, but lack of sufficient transportation and collapsing staff numbers, as few were sleeping or taking breaks. Due to transportation and staff limits, the Epoch Times estimated that the Hankou crematorium was burning 225 corpses a day.\n\nWith this math, the newspaper concludes that Hubei province incinerated 341 bodies on February 3; China reported 65 deaths nationwide due to coronavirus that day.\n\nThe article went on to state that Hubei province has eight municipal funeral homes. Similarly judging from their capacity for bodies and the amount of time the furnaces are running, the article adds another 135 patients a day to the tally from five of these. The other three, it concludes, burned 476 people a day. While less confident in these numbers since the journalists were unable to speak to their managers, these numbers reveal a rough estimate of nearly 1,000 people incinerated per day.\n\nOf course, the article notes that there is no guarantee that all these people died after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus. It notes that, of the 127 remains You Hu received on February 3 (116 were cremated that day), eight were confirmed coronavirus patients and 48 were suspected carriers. The newspaper also identified another funeral home that took in 22 sets of remains and three were confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nThese numbers, the report argues, do not align with the Communist Party policies issued on handling coronavirus remains.\n\nAs per from the current policy of the Communist Party of China … the funeral home must give priority to the burning of novel coronavirus patients' bodies; other bodies may not be burned on the same day due to funeral culture, rituals, and other reasons, the article notes. Based on this, it can be inferred that the 116 dead [at You Hu's crematorium] basically all died of novel coronavirus pneumonia, or at least suspected of having died of it.\n\nWhat's more, a local ordinance in at least one Hubei county, Yangxin, required crematoria to immediately handle coronavirus victims and prioritize them over other deaths.\n\nThe Epoch Times report is not the first one to accuse the Chinese regime of secretly cremating large numbers of individuals suspected of carrying the novel coronavirus – or refusing to take patients in hospitals and confirm their disease. Last week, the Hong Kong-based website Initium Media published a report contending that the Communist Party is artificially suppressing the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak by incinerating people suspected of having died of it before their deaths can be properly documented.\n\nThe implication that China is also not properly documenting cause of death on people's birth certificates is also not new. Shortly after China revealed the outbreak to the world on January 20, Radio Free Asia (RFA) highlighted the strange death of Xu Dapeng, the founder of the oldest environmentalist group in the country. Xu and his wife lived in Wuhan and both died of pneumonia in January. Neither they nor anyone who was exposed to them were tested for the novel coronavirus, and their cause of death was simply declared pneumonia.\n\nAt press time Friday, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed 31,527 cases of novel coronavirus. Of those, 638 people have died, all but two within China. The government also claimed another 1,568 people have fully recovered from the infection.\n\nThe WHO claimed on Friday that 82 percent of cases have been deemed mild.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
Kurdish Peshmerga forces fighting alongside the Iraqi military on the mission to liberate Mosul from the Islamic State warn that the Iraqi army is too weak to fight ISIS, even with its advanced weaponry, while the Peshmerga is better trained but ill-equipped to fight alone.\n\nNazim Zinal, a Peshmerga military source, tells Kurdish outlet Rudaw that the Iraqi army is simply not a potent enough force to keep the fight going, hence the slow start to the recapture of Mosul. With all the ammunition they [the Iraqis] have ultimately they are too weak, he argued, noting that if the Peshmerga were armed as well as the Iraqi army We would have been near Mosul by now.\n\nThey [the Iraqi army] are not as fast as the Peshmerga who can make advances with basic weapons. They don't make any progress even with their modern weapons, Peshmerga Lieutenant Farid Sabir added.\n\nThe Iraqi military announced that its army had begun the mission to recapture Mosul on Thursday. A city of an estimated two million people before the arrival of ISIS, it is one of two major urban centers controlled by the terror group, the other being Raqqa, Syria. The Iraqi military announced it had recaptured several villages near the city and would be working alongside a U.S.-led coalition fighting from the air. Shiite militias would also be involved in the ultimate battle for the city.\n\nThe first phase of the Fatah [Conquest] Operation has been launched at dawn to liberate Nineveh [province], raising the Iraqi flag in several villages, an Iraqi military statement read.\n\nThe mission appears to be going slowly, as the Islamic State left the villages it abandoned full of mines and other traps designed to kill civilians returning to their homes and opposing soldiers. According to the Kurdish outlet Bas News, at least eight villages have been liberated in the greater Mosul, area, however: Motantar, Tel Sha'eer, Karmrdi, Nasr, Khatab, Koudila, Salahiyah, and Nazra.\n\nWhile the various militias are expected to work together to surround Mosul, tensions between Kurdish forces and those controlled by Baghdad have endured for years. The Peshmerga have often complained of Washington's policy to only arm the Iraqi army and send weapons to the Kurdish forces through Baghdad, rather than directly through the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) headquarters in Erbil.\n\nIn February, the KRG admitted it had begun accepting munitions from Iran, describing it as the first country to provide us with weapons and ammunition directly. Kurdistan Region Security Council head Masrour Barzani, son of President Masoud Barzani, complained then of U.S. support for the Iraqi army over the Kurdish forces. 90 percent of the burden for this war is on the shoulder of the Peshmerga, 90 percent of the work is done by the Peshmerga, but we are only getting 10 percent of the armaments, he argued. The shipments received in the last months of 2015, he protested, were not even close to what we were asking for.\n\nIn February, the peshmerga made public statements questioning whether a battle for Mosul would happen within any reasonable timeframe. Officials from the central government have been talking about the battle for Mosul for a long time, but they [the Iraqi army] are not fully prepared for this battle since their missions are not fully finished in Anbar province,Jabar Yawar, Chief of Staff of the Peshmerga Ministry said then. Less than a month since he aired his concerns, the capture of villages around Mosul has begun.\n\nIn addition to concerns regarding the preparation of Iraqi troops and equipment used by peshmerga, the participation of Shiite militias may also cause discord. Baghdad has friendly relations with rogue Shiite militias in Iraq, many with ties to Iran, but the peshmerga do not. On Thursday, the same day the operation to retake Mosul began, peshmerga clashed with Shiite forces in Salahaddin province, preventing them from entering a Kurdish-controlled town.\n\nWhile the Shiite militias have vowed to participate in the fight against the Islamic State, they have refused to do so with American help, and warned they would shift their focus entirely to fighting Americans should the U.S. send Special Operations forces to Shiite-controlled areas.
CBS News says it has shut down its New York headquarters for two days after two of its employees tested positive for coronavirus\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — CBS News shut down its New York City headquarters for cleaning and disinfecting on Wednesday after two of its employees tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nEmployees will be asked to work remotely for the next two days and broadcasts moved to accommodate the cleaning, the network said. For instance, CBS This Morning will originate out of Washington on Thursday and Friday while the New York offices are cleaned.\n\nPeople who came in contact with the sick employees will be asked to self-quarantine for the next two weeks, CBS News President Susan Zirinsky said in a memo to staff.\n\nAt this point, we anticipate the offices will be open Monday, Zirinsky wrote.\n\nCBS has two separate offices located across 57th Street on the West Side of Manhattan, one primarily housing the staff of 60 Minutes. Complicating the issue for the network is that the two infected workers were stationed in different buildings. The network released no details on how the staff members were infected.\n\nMeanwhile, The Associated Press and NBC News on Wednesday announced work-at-home plans as concerns about the global pandemic grew.\n\nThe AP will allow employees who are able to work at home to do so with the approval of their managers, implementing the new policy on a staggered basis throughout the world through the end of next week. The Associated Press operates out of 250 locations in 100 countries.\n\nFirst in line, effective immediately, are AP staffers in offices where employees have had direct or indirect exposure to someone who has tested positive, or where the government requires people to work at home. These locations include New York, Washington, Chicago, New Orleans, Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul, New Delhi, Singapore, Jakarta, Manila and Iran and Italy, said Gary Pruitt, the news service's president and CEO.\n\nNo AP employee has tested positive for the virus, Pruitt said.\n\nAP is also stopping all non-essential travel, and told employees to avoid work dinners or conferences without approval.\n\nWe must remain vigilant and careful over the coming weeks, Pruitt said.\n\nOther news organizations, like The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN, have encouraged or permitted employees to work remotely in recent days out of concern about the virus.\n\nNBC News said it will allow employees in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to work at home or stagger hours if possible starting Monday. However, the network said this would not affect people who work directly putting together television shows on NBC and MSNBC.\n\nThe network is also limiting non-essential travel and asking its employees to limit large meetings and not bring visitors into the New York office, according to a memo sent Wednesday by NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin.\n\nPeople outside of the New York office are expected to come to work normally, the memo said.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday affirmed his commitment to holding interest rates low for the foreseeable future, saying that even if unemployment falls back to historical low levels that would not be a reason to raise rates unless high inflation threatened.\n\nIn a Q&A session hosted by Princeton University, where Powell got his undergraduate degree, Powell responded to a question about whether he would support a rate increase if the unemployment rate fell below levels that economists once considered a warning sign for an overheating economy.\n\nThat wouldn't be a reason to raise interest rates, unless we start to see inflation or other imbalances that would threaten the achievement of our mandate, he said, referencing the Fed's dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it is because it is basically the monetary policy advocated by Donald Trump in the years when he was regularly criticizing the Fed for raising rates.\n\nThe USA should always be paying the lowest rate. No Inflation! Trump tweeted in September of 2019. It is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing.\n\nTrump was widely lambasted for publicly addressing and criticizing Fed policy. Ever since Clinton, most presidents had kept any disagreements with the Fed away from the public. Trump returned to the earlier practice of presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, who felt free to speak up on monetary policy.\n\nLast year, the Fed undertook a review of its strategies for achieving its goals and its conduct of monetary policy. The review followed several years of inflation coming in below the Fed's target and a series of rate hikes and a drawdown of bond purchases that now look ill-advised. Following the review, the Fed changed its approach so that it would let inflation run higher than the two percent target for some time so that the long term average would be at the target.\n\nIn its December policy statement, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee said it would keep an accommodative stance until it sees substantial further progress towards its dual goals. If he had the time to take notice, the president probably smiled.\n\nTrump may be headed out of the White House but Trumpian monetary policy will be with us for years to come.
U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January, adding to fears that inflationary pressures could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, or CPI, increased 0.5 percent in January, above expectations for a gain of 0.3 percent, according to data from the Department of Labor. The year-over-year increase was 2.1 percent, above expectations for a 1.9 percent gain.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3 percent from the previous month, above forecasts of 0.2 percent. It is up 1.8 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists had expected 1.7 percent.\n\nMarkets reacted immediately. Before the release of CPI, stock market futures indicated the market would open higher. With the news, stocks are set to open higher. Bond yields rose.\n\nInvestors have been focused on the question of inflation in recent weeks. Many believe that higher inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace, which could slow the economy.
In a move that could have wide-reaching implications on U.K. campuses, British universities will be instructed to uphold freedom of speech as a legal duty.\n\nJo Johnson, British Minister of State for Universities and Science has written to universities informing them that they will be expected to uphold free speech for their students, faculty, and visiting guests. The move is being described as a response to the rise of safe spaces and other forms of censorship in higher education.\n\nAccording to Johnson, this means that the use of universities facilities cannot be denied to any individual or body on any grounds connected with their beliefs or views, policy or objective.\n\nAs part of this, the government proposes to raise the issue of freedom of speech, with a view to ensuring that a principle underscoring the importance of free speech in higher education is given due consideration, Johnson wrote.\n\nHe added that speech protections extend to premises occupied by student unions, even if those premises aren't university-owned: It is important to note that the duty extends to both the premises of the university and premises occupied by the students' unions, even when they are not part of the university premises.\n\nJohnson claimed that all institutions will be expected to have an explicit statement expressing their commitment to free speech principles. They are crucial in demonstrating to students that free speech should be at the heart of a higher education community, Johnson finished.\n\nTom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.

A heterosexual couple have lost their legal battle to enter into a civil partnership.\n\nAcademics Rebecca Steinfeld, 35, and Charles Keidan, 40, wanted to secure legal recognition of their seven-year relationship by entering into a civil partnership, rejecting marriage as they claim it carries patriarchal baggage. However, they have been prevented from doing so because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 stipulates that only same-sex couples are eligible.\n\nIn November the couple, who have a seven-month-old daughter, challenged a decision by High Court judge Mrs Justice Andrews to dismiss their judicial review action. But on Tuesday their challenge was in turn dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the Telegraph has reported.\n\nAddressing Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Beatson and Lord Justice Briggs, Karon Monaghan QC advanced the argument that barring the couple from entering into a civil partnership was incompatible with Article 14 of the European Convention, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life.\n\nThey wish very much – and it is of very considerable importance to them – to enter into a legally regulated relationship which does not carry with it patriarchal baggage, which many consider comes with the institution of marriage, she said.\n\nDan Squires QC, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, who has responsibility for equalities within Government, told the court that a decision had been taken within Government to see how legislation extending marriage for same-sex couples planned out before offering civil partnerships up to heterosexual couples.\n\nThe judges agreed with the couple that a potential violation of Article 14, taken with Article 8, had been identified, but Lady Justice Arden dissented on the question of whether the Government's current wait and see policy was justified.\n\nMs Steinfeld said: We are pleased that today's ruling has shown that the Government must act very soon to end this unfair situation.\n\nAll three judges agreed that we're being treated differently because of our sexual orientation, and that this impacts our private and family life.\n\nAll three rejected the argument that we could 'just get married'. All three emphasised that the Government cannot maintain the status quo for much longer – they are on borrowed time.\n\nLady Justice Arden had accepted their case on almost every point, she added, saying: We lost on a technicality, that the Government should be allowed a little more time to make a decision. So there's everything to fight for, and much in the ruling that gives us reason to be positive and keep going.\n\nMr Keidan said: The Court of Appeal has made it clear the status quo cannot continue. The Government should now recognise the benefits of opening civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples.\n\nThe measure is fair, popular, good for families and children, and long overdue. They have everything to gain.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) struggled to explain how she would pay for her $40 trillion new federal government programs during a Sunday interview with Anderson Cooper on CBS's 60 Minutes.\n\nAnderson Cooper asks socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez how she plans to pay for the $40 trillion in big government programs she supports. She could not answer the question. pic.twitter.com/dCpbO5ECmp — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) January 7, 2019\n\nCooper asked Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic Socialist, how she would pay for the trillions of dollars in government programs she supports. But instead of laying out a plan for how she would pay for the programs, Ocasio-Cortez deflected Cooper's question.\n\nNo one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut, Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nThe 29-year-old deflected further, saying the government would pay for social programs the same way the government would fund the Space Force — all while refusing to break down how much taxpayer money would go towards each of her policy proposals.\n\nWe only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, health care, and education, Ocasio-Cortez said. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force, for all of these ambitious policies.\n\nWe pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations, she added. And so for me, what's unrealistic is — is what we're living in right now.\n\nDespite not giving any specifics on how she would pay for the expansive government programs she had proposed, Ocasio-Cortez suggested at another point during the interview that the government should raise the tax rate to as high as 70 percent to fund climate change programs.\n\nThe 60 Minutes interview is not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has struggled to explain how she would fund $40 trillion in entitlement programs she is proposing.\n\nIn September 2018, Ocasio-Cortez deflected CNN host Jake Tapper's question about how she would pay for $40 trillion in government programs like Medicare for All.\n\nThe freshman Democrat also reportedly dodged a reporter's question recently about whether she would take a salary during the government shutdown, simply telling the reporter, I've gotta run!
Mainstream activists are cheering a justice department memo that says the Supreme Court's pro-transgender decision in 2020 does not apply to single-sex sports, education practices, and sexual privacy.\n\nThe Department's regulations recognizing the male/female biological binary [in athletics] carry extra weight and interpretative authority because they were the product of uniquely robust and direct Congressional review, says the January 8 memo, titled Memorandum for Kimberly M. Richey.\n\n[B]ased on controlling authorities, we must give effect to the ordinary public meaning at the time of enactment and construe the term 'sex' in Title IX to mean biological sex, male or female, says the memo, which was signed by Reed Rubinstein, the department's principal deputy general counsel. Congress has the authority to rewrite Title IX and redefine its terms at any time [and] To date, however, Congress has chosen not to do so,  said the memo, which was sent to Kimberley Richey, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights.\n\nFederal law permits schools to provide separate bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers 'on the basis of sex,' as long as the school provides comparable facilities for 'each sex,' the memo says. Therefore, we believe the plain ordinary public meaning of the controlling statutory and regulatory text requires a recipient providing 'separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex' to regulate access based on biological sex,' says the memo.\n\nThe memo is a response to Judge Neil Gorsuch's June 2020 vote in the June 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County court decision. Gorsuch joined with the bloc of progressive justices to declare that Congress's 1964 law against workplace sexual discrimination also endorsed the recent claim that each person's gender identity should be more legally important than their biological sex.\n\nThe memo will help Americans block the efforts by pro-transgender activist groups to remove government recognition of the two sexes. For example, these groups have persuaded Democrats in Congress to adopt sex-less gender terminology in place of traditional terms such as father and mother.\n\nDemocrats censor mention of people's biological sex, via a party-line House vote.\n\nThe language policing promotes the very unpopular 'transgender' claim that each person's sense of stereotyped male- or female-ness is more important than their actual sex. https://t.co/HIEJBQlfpC — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 5, 2021\n\nWe are grateful that there is further clarity into what Title IX [sex discrimination law] means and what it does not, said a statement from Save Women's Sports.\n\nAllowing males to compete in female sports is not progressive; it is abusive, the group, run by female powerlifter Beth Stelzer, asserted.\n\nSingle-sex sports are essential, the organization continued. Sports should not be the platform for political ideologies that would destroy the definition of female sports… The Save Women's Sports team will continue to fight for fair sports and safe locker rooms for females. \n\nThe department's memo was denounced by groups that deny the importance of the two sexes' different biologies. For example, the Human Rights Campaign issued a January 11 statement saying:\n\nThe new guidance categorically denies that Bostock applies to Title IX despite the clear words of the majority opinion that it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, President-elect Joe Biden embraced the radical transgender' claim that the government should treat each person's biological sex as subordinate to their claimed transgender cross-sex status.\n\nIn practice, the transgender claim eliminates single-sex institutions — such as female-only jails for women, female-only sports leagues, female-only changing rooms, and showers — because it says any man can claim a female legal identity without even undergoing surgery or dressing in stereotypical female appearance.\n\nIf that view is adopted by the court or Congress, men will be able to call the FBI to force women to accept their claim of female identity.\n\nBiden has repeatedly said he will support men's claim to female identity and women's claim to male identity.\n\nI will flat out just change the law — I will eliminate those Executive Orders, Biden said October 15, during a televised town hall meeting when he was questioned by the mother of a woman who said her young child is transgender.\n\nBiden is expected to use his regulatory powers in government agencies to enforce that view. For example, he has said that men should be allowed to stay in women-only prisons if they claim to have a female gender identity.\n\nHe has also announced his opposition to Trump's Pentagon rules. Trump's rule does not bar people who claim to be transgender but do require each service member's recorded gender market to match the bright line' of their biology. A 2018 Pentagon report set the policy, saying:\n\nLow rates of full sex reassignment surgery and the otherwise wide variation of transition-related treatment, with all the challenges that entails for privacy, fairness, and safety, weigh in favor of maintaining a bright line based on biological [male or female] sex — not gender identity … After all, a person's biological sex is generally ascertainable through objective means.\n\nBut Biden's opposition will allow men to registers themselves as women in the military's records as women. Once that change is made, female service members would have to submit to the men's demands to be addressed as women in accommodations, promotion, fitness requirements, and the showers.\n\nTransgender people comprise far less than 1 percent of the population, and very few men — and servicemembers — who declare they are transgender undergo genital surgery.\n\nCurrently, few GOP legislators publicly support the popular view that laws should recognize the inherent distinctions between men and women or girls and boys.
This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nMyanmar (Burma) Buddhist separatists in Arakan Army in Rakhine State kill 13 policemen\n\nEU considers revoking Myanmar's trade preferences because of Rohingya genocide\n\nMyanmar (Burma) Buddhist separatists in Arakan Army in Rakhine State kill 13 policemen\n\n\n\nEthnic Rakhine people in Myanmar (Getty)\n\nMyanmar's army has just recently completed most of the job of genocide and ethnic cleansing of Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine State, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee for their lives to neighboring Bangladesh, where they are trapped in refugee camps. Myanmar's army began committing atrocities including torture, rape, beatings, and slaughter, burning down entire Rohingya villages, targeting the Rohingyas, as early as 2011. But they crossed the line into full-scale genocide and ethnic cleansing after an August 25, 2017, attack on Burma police outposts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), killing 8 policemen. At that point, Burma's army began full-scale clearance operations, sending hundreds of thousands more Rohingyas into Bangladesh.\n\nWith most Burmese Rohingyas now in Bangladesh, and with most Rohingya villages burned to the ground, Burma's army may have thought its job was done. But now they have a new problem, and they are launching clearance operations again against a new group, ethnic Rakhines.\n\nEthnic Rakhine rebels – claiming to be part of the Arakan Army (AA), which is a Buddhist ethnic Rakhine army, as opposed to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which is a Muslim ethnic Rohingya army – killed 14 prisoners of war in four police stations in Rakhine State on Friday.\n\nThis has prompted the army to launch localized clearance operations this time against the ethnic Rakhines. Clashes between AA and Burma's army in recent months has already forced an estimated 2,500 people to flee from their homes because of the violence. Many of them are sheltering in local Buddhist monasteries.\n\nMyanmar officials said that four police posts in northern Rakhine came under attack from hundreds of Arakan Army fighters after daybreak on Friday, killing 13 and injuring nine, and triggering the army's new clearance operations in the area. Reuters and Special Broadcasting Service (Australia) and AP and Asia Times\n\nEU considers revoking Myanmar's trade preferences because of Rohingya genocide\n\nTrade unions in Myanmar are begging the European Union not to revoke its grant of trade preferences to Myanmar.\n\nThe trade preference program, known as Generalized Scheme of Preferences (GSP), grants to Myanmar the right to export goods to the E.U. without paying tariffs. The GSP Everything But Arms (EBA) status allows Myanmar to sell any goods except weapons tariff-free into the E.U. The GSP privilege was granted in 2013. Exports from Myanmar to the E.U., especially in garments and foodstuffs, have risen tenfold in the past five years.\n\nAfter months of pressure from rights groups, the E.U. is considering punishing Myanmar for the blatant violation of human rights referring to ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas and the failure of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to resolve the crisis. E.U.'s trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said in October, Our trade policy is value-based. These are not just words. We have to act when there are severe violations.\n\nHowever, trade unions and workers groups in Myanmar say that over one million workers might lose their jobs if GSP is revoked. According to Maung Maung, chairman of the Confederation of Trade Unions Myanmar (CTUM):\n\nOver 700,000 workers from the garment industry and over 400,000 workers in fishery industry will lose their jobs and their families will be in trouble. We don't want to see this situation. So, we request the EU not to revoke GSP.\n\nWithdrawing GSP would also have a significant impact on foreign direct investment since investors who invest in Myanmar to gain access to the EU export market will no longer be attracted.\n\nCard Charles Maung Bo, Archbishop of Yangon and the country's first cardinal, said, I am completely against any form of sanction or embargo against Myanmar. Experience shows that this type of measures only harms the poorest sections of the population. They will suffer the consequences, certainly not the rich and powerful.\n\nAn E.U. review team visited Myanmar in October to assess the situation but has not yet issued an opinion.\n\nThe same team is also considering withdrawing GSP for Cambodia, because of substantial and increasing human rights violations under the Hun Sen administration.

Every year, the United States spends $67.5 billion to ensure the worldwide free flow of oil. Often produced in unstable parts of the world and shipped through insecure chokepoints, the U.S. military works to make sure crude oil from other countries makes it safely onto the global market. Yet while this global oil market benefits some nations, its volatility threatens the American economy and undermines U.S. national security.\n\nFrom technology to the weather, the factors affecting the price of oil are frequent and varied. One key constant, however, is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC), a cartel that uses its significant reserves of crude and concentrated political power structures to exert undue influence on the world price, affecting the U.S. economy as a result. This influence was felt most prominently and recently in our own energy industry. Amid the rising oil prices of the previous decade, a small group of innovative American producers used new technology to unlock the oil held in U.S. shale formations, long considered to be too expensive and limited to produce. This new production rewrote the energy rulebook, and our oil imports were halved.\n\nEven as U.S. crude production rose, industry watchers were unconcerned about global oversupply, confident that OPEC—led by global swing producer Saudi Arabia—would take its usual approach and cut production. At the November 2014 OPEC meeting on Thanksgiving Day, however, that confidence evaporated. The cartel announced it would maintain its production levels, sending prices into a tailspin. In June 24, the price of oil was $110 per barrel. By January 2016, the price was just $26.\n\nAlthough the price crash benefits consumers in the short-term, with average annual household spending on gasoline falling almost 21 percent between 2011 and 2015, the U.S. shale industry has struggled. Since January 2015, more than 220 oil companies have gone bankrupt, taking 150,000 jobs with them and nudging parts of the country that benefited from the oil boom back toward recession.\n\nBut despite this success in decimating America's domestic oil industry, OPEC has not finished yet. Spurred on by domestic issues such as social spending, OPEC is shifting strategy and creating more volatility by bringing in Russia and others to collaborate on production as a supercartel. The group's unprecedented influence stems from its control of 90 percent of global reserves, but these entities do not act in the free-market, profit maximizing manner of American producers. They serve instead as government proxies, generating revenues to support regimes that do not share U.S. strategic priorities.\n\nDespite this clear conflict of interest, our military ensures the free flow of their crude because oil is vital to the U.S. economy, powering 92 percent of our transportation system. The global nature of oil pricing means that no matter how much oil we produce, our economic sovereignty remains jeopardized by OPEC and the supercartel.\n\nTo counter our reliance on this opaque oil market, we must develop a range of policy responses. First, we must develop more resources here at home. Second, we must modernize our fuel efficiency standards to maximize the benefits from the oil we use. Third, we must encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles running on diverse sources of domestic energy, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen. Finally, we must have an honest assessment of our ability to respond to OPEC's actions to influence oil prices.\n\nWork has already begun in Congress on this final recommendation, through the bipartisan introduction of H.R. 545 by Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Collin Peterson (D-MN), Trent Franks (R-AZ) and David Scott (D-GA). The bill creates a Congressional commission that investigates OPEC's influence over the global oil market, examines America's ability to mitigate the cartel's effects and proposes a range of policy responses—trade, diplomatic, statutory and regulatory—to President Trump and Congress.\n\nAs American lives and our economic sovereignty continue to be risked to ensure a free flow of oil for countries that do not share our interests, the time for action is now. The President has rightly prioritized energy security in his America First Energy Plan, stating that his administration wants to, Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.\n\nWith President Trump in office, the opportunity to tackle OPEC's outsized influence has presented itself. The swift establishment of this committee will give it the potential to frame the administration's energy agenda for at least the next four years—and ensure, most importantly, that our energy system truly works in our national interest.\n\nKen Blackwell, a former Domestic Policy Advisor to the Trump Presidential Transition Team, is a Senior Advisor to Securing America's Future Energy.
President-elect Joe Biden is promising to aid Central American countries — but he is also promising to extract more of their valuable young workers and consumers for exploitation inside the United States via the semi-official Hunger Games obstacle course between migrants' homes and U.S. jobs.\n\nBiden's promises to aid Central America obscure the damage and political risks of the Democrats' extraction policies, which are extremely unpopular.\n\nBut Biden's promises are just the latest stage in the multi-decade campaign by allied progressives and Wall Street investors to overcome the public's migration preferences.\n\nThat long campaign has fractured and loopholed what once was expected by the public to be an orderly legal immigration system for legal migrants from south of the U.S. border.\n\nWhat is left is a de facto obstacle course migration system for blue-collar migrants — a chaotic Hunger Games trail of loans, coyotes, cartels, rape, deserts, weather, border laws, barriers, rescuers, transport, judges, and cheap-labor employers.\n\nThe progressives' Hunger Games also cripple the economies of migrant-sending countries because they are extracting workers, consumers, investments, political pressures, and expectations of growth. The departure of people of working age reduces the labor force and weakens the growth of the home country, and this effect is likely to be strongest for countries facing a brain drain, said a 2017 report by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nMark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said:\n\nThe [progressives'] goal is increasing the number of people moving here. If that means that it has to be done in a way that is inconvenient and sometimes even cruel for the migrants, that's okay because the objective is increased immigration at essentially any cost — even the cost to the migrants themselves.\n\nIt is an obstacle course, a deadly obstacle course, said John Miano, an immigration lawyer with the Immigration Reform Law Institute.\n\nHalf of the 3.5M blue-collar migrants who crossed from 2014-2019 are still in the U.S., says DHS data.\n\nAt least 8% got the 1st prize of residency.\n\nSome worked for years, some sent home with unpaid coyote debts.\n\nThe win/loss rate encourages more migrants. https://t.co/JMlAWNb6ND — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 5, 2021\n\nThe chaos has become the immigration system because Congress has proven unable to restore order, said Miano. Congress is involved in so many things now; it can't deal with the things that it is supposed to do … Each time Congress touches immigration now, they make things worse. What we have done is set up a system of incentives for people to come here illegally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump essentially blocked southern migration in 2020 — three years after his inauguration — by making the obstacle course almost impossible to get through. But that win only came after he declared a national emergency and imposed an incomplete but wide variety of border reforms.\n\nBut the next wave of blue-collar contestants is rising, partly because they can catch watch a video from January 2020 of Biden welcoming many more migrants: We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people is cannot absorb people who are in desperate need … is absolutely bizarre.\n\nBiden is now offering to reopen the obstacle course, with some humane sections, even as he also promises to steer more aid and investment to Central America.\n\nMeanwhile, most young white-collar immigrants enter via a years-long pay-for-play system of lotteries, employer abuse, payoffs to universities, kickbacks to managers, and years of bonded labor.\n\nBiden's Promises\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden said December 22:\n\nWe're going to work purposely diligently and responsibly to roll back Trump's [migration] restrictions starting on day one. We will institute humane and orderly responses. That means rebuilding the [legal] capacity we need to safely and quickly process asylum seekers without creating near term crisis in the midst of this deadly pandemic.\n\nBiden was silent on many critical details. For example, he did not say how migrants would be judged as welcome for life in the United States — even though at least 150 million people want that prize. He was silent about how rejected migrants would be deterred from entering the obstacle course, and how they would be sent home — even though 11 million resident illegals are already refusing to leave the United States.\n\nHe also declined to offer assurance to Americans who are worried about their jobs and investment, even though millions of his fellow Americans are unemployed, and even though wages have been flat for decades– aside from a brief spike in Trump's 2019.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Biden declined to explain how his chaotic extraction of yet more workers and consumers from Central America could not contradict his promised economic development in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. His campaign platform declared:\n\nAs president, Joe Biden will renew a robust commitment to U.S. leadership in the region and pursue a comprehensive strategy for Central America by: Developing a comprehensive four-year, $4 billion regional strategy to address factors driving migration from Central America; Mobilizing private investment in the region; Improving security and rule of law; Addressing endemic corruption; Prioritizing poverty reduction and economic development.\n\nThe Hunger Games\n\nThe costs and the randomness – the carrots and the sticks, of progressives' Hunger Games policy – were painfully exposed in a December 22 article by USAToday, headlined: A Guatemalan father brought his 10-year-old daughter to the US-Mexican border and regrets it.\n\nThe article showed how Francisco Sical and his wife, Maria Elvira Ramos, mortgaged their Guatemalan home and redirected the $3,000 microcredit loan from promised construction to a coyote.\n\nYears before, Sical had been allowed into the United States as President George W. Bush pushed his Any Willing Worker cheap labor policy:\n\nFrom 2003 to 2008, Sical had worked in Anaheim, California; Tampa, Florida; Washington, D.C.; and many places in between, laying tile and driving trucks for $12 an hour as part of a vast undocumented labor force that fueled the U.S. economic expansion of the mid-2000s.\n\nBut intermittently tighter rules unluckily blocked his attempted returns in 2013. And in 2018, President Trump's consistent crackdown gave him 30 days for his felony re-entry.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Sical told his wife that he could use one of their three under-18 children to get through Trump's border like her brother and nephew had done shortly before. The brother and his child walked through a 2015 loophole created by a California judge who had ordered border agencies to release migrants with children after 20 days into the U.S. job market. USAToday reported:\n\nI told her, 'Listen, lately the U.S. government is giving children priority.' Ramos' brother had reached the USA with a son a few months before. Immigration visits him twice a week, Sical said. But they let him work in peace!\n\nBut Sical was too slow.\n\nDespite protests by progressives and the many businesses, Trump closed the 2015 loophole by creating the Return to Mexico program. The program stops migrants from getting U.S. jobs as they wait for asylum hearings, and Sical was one of the slower — or unluckier — migrants who were sent back to Mexico and then Guatemala.\n\nThe article also shows the sticks that pressure Latin Americans to head north.\n\nSical sees himself as a failure compared to his peers who got through the obstacle course to win jobs in the United States:\n\nFor Sical, the USA is always on his mind – and in my heart. But, he said, you're left with feelings of resentment. The families who have someone in the United States, every eight days, they go to the bank for the remittance. And us just watching, because there is nothing else we can do.\n\nSical's unpaid loan is a stick that pushes Sical to try again once Biden takes control of the border. USAToday reported Sical is trying to pay down the $3,000 construction loan at $128 a month … [as he] struggled to bring home even $220 a month.\n\nMany progressives deny their cheap-labor migration has any harmful impact on Americans' wages and rents — and then insist that the public's deep opposition to wage-cutting migration is bigotry and can be blamed for the Hunger Games.\n\nThe solution to Sical's problem is more work permits for U.S. jobs, said Andrew Selee, the well-paid president of the pro-migration Migration Policy Institute, The best way of dealing with irregular migration is not building walls but creating labor opportunities for people to work for periods of time in the United States, he told USAToday. Americans don't want those jobs, he insisted, without mentioning employers' pay offers or the coronavirus crash.\n\nThere's no broad recognition of [migration-caused wage cuts] at all, Tom Jawatz, the vice president of immigration policy at American Progress, a leading progressive advocacy group, told Breitbart News on December 28.\n\nJoe Biden's plan to end a series of US cooperative asylum agreements with Central America will spur waves of illegal immigration to the southern border, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Chief Mark Morgan says. https://t.co/H3nPrd3z6P — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 30, 2020\n\nYet decades of data and experiences have persuaded the vast majority of Americans — and many elite economists, lobbyists, and legislators — that migration moves money out of employees' pockets and into the stock-market wealth of investors and their progressive supporters. The recognition comes amid perpetual insistence from business lobbies — and reporters — that supply and demand in the labor market are unrelated.\n\nProgressives also insist they can select deserving Central American migrants with such care and justice that rejected migrants will somehow give up their illegal efforts to get themselves into U.S. jobs and their children into U.S. schools. For example, Biden's 2020 platform says Trump's policies are actually encouraging people to cross irregularly, rather than applying in a legal, safe, and orderly manner at the ports, and continues:\n\n… each [asylum] case should be reviewed fairly and in full accordance with the law. Migrants who qualify for an asylum claim will be admitted to the country through an orderly process and connected with resources that will help them care for themselves. Migrants who do not qualify will have the opportunity to make their claim before an immigration judge, but if they are unable to satisfy the court, the government will help facilitate their successful reintegration into their home countries.\n\nBut that pablum promise sets no limit on the number of eligible migrants and is no deterrent for migrants who rationally — and decently — hope to walk, climb, talk, and lie their way into good jobs for themselves and good schools for their children.\n\nBiden's promise of a safe and orderly process at the border will just invite a repeat and an escalation of 2019, warned Mark Morgan, the acting chief of the Customs and Border Patrol agency said January 5:\n\nIf your strategy consists of releasing you into the interior of the United States once you've illegally entered and have been apprehended, protecting you from local deportation, and providing substantial rewards such as free health care, you have just created a complete system of incentives. Who wouldn't try to enter with Release, Protect, and Reward being the new open border strategy?\n\nIn 2019, almost 1 million rational people entered the Hunger Games in the hope of winning the huge prize of U.S. residency.\n\nThe risk was rational. DHS data shows that roughly 8 percent of 2014-2019 contestants have won the first prize of legal residency. Roughly half of all contestants have won the second-ranking prize of at-least temporary residency, jobs, and wages.\n\nThe Damage to Central America\n\nProgressives pretend remittances from migrants repair the damage done by the Hunger Games to the home countries.\n\nBut the migration-caused economic damage is widely recognized by left-wingers outside the progressive parish in Washington D.C.\n\nOne of the effects of emigration is erosion of human capital, which can have a negative impact on the economic and social development of the countries of origin, said a 2005 report by the United Nations. A 2020 report by a reporter for the Guardian for the Texas Public Policy Foundation spotlighted one example:\n\nAlonso Benítez was considered a model farmer, growing organic coffee in Honduras' western highlands. In recent years, he had switched to organic methods, planted timber-producing trees to diversify his income, and worked with a cooperative to earn a premium on the world price. Benítez also had a large extended family in the area, who pitched in with harvests and lowered his labor costs. But Benítez vanished one day in April 2019 with his 17-year-old son, leaving an elder, 18-year-old son to oversee the farm. He paid a coyote 170,000 lempiras ($7,300) to take him and his son to the U.S. border, according to the elder son, Jordi Benítez. After spending four days in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, the pair were released and went to Houston—where Benítez found work in a gravel pit.\n\nAll told, more than three million people from Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala have moved into the United States, not counting the almost 1 million migrants who were counted crossing in 2019. Only half of the 3.5 million migrants who entered from 2014 to 2019 have been sent home.\n\nThe loss of skilled migrants can compromise the ability of origin countries to develop their own human capital, especially when it involves teachers and health workers, or undermines development prospects as a result of the departure of persons trained in technical, engineering and scientific areas, crucial to domestic technological progress, said a 2011 report by the Organization of American States and the OECD.\n\nDespite decades of agrarian reform, state-led development programs, and billions of dollars of foreign aid spent on international development schemes, remitted wages from people working in the United States have become the most important source of income for many rural communities,' said a 2o13 report by Selee's Migration Policy Institute. The report continued:\n\nA new social order has emerged across Honduras. Many of the markers of status that defined life before the migration boom — such as land ownership, advanced age, education, and political connections—are being replaced by knowledge of how to migrate successfully to the United States and remit earnings to family members in Honduras. Migrants and returnees have become the very models of success for young people in rural areas. At the same time, new forms of social differentiation are emerging. The meaning and value of education, lawful citizenship, and family responsibility have been redefined in the context of the migration phenomenon.\n\nThe remittances [from migrants] are not sufficient for compensating the negative impacts that emigration has on human development in the societies of origin, for example, the loss of the most entrepreneurial individuals, said a 2012 report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nMigration, in many ways, underpins Central American economies and provides an escape valve for these countries, said the 2020 report by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which added:\n\nRemittances sent from the United States prop up households, provide stability to national economies, and spur consumption. Migration has provided some ambitious Central Americans with an escape from poverty. But it has also enabled elites, who see no need to slow migration, as it is a status quo which works for them—and they are content to keep it intact. As a Guatemalan think tank analyst said ruefully after President Trump demanded Guatemala sign an asylum cooperation agreement: We continue doing everything except taking responsibility. …We're not the victims and we need to assume our responsibilities because the United States is no longer going to cover the cost of Guatemala's shortcomings.\n\nThe Hunger Games migration is emptying many towns in Central America. On April 21, the Wall Street Journal reported: COLOTENANGO, Guatemala—Gloria Velásquez is used to saying goodbye. Four of her six siblings have migrated to the U.S. and she, too, is thinking about heading north with her 9-year-old daughter. […] Ms. Velásquez said her four siblings in the U.S. are encouraging her to join them. Her daughter Helen Ixchel likes to teach language and mathematics to fellow children. She wants to learn English and become a teacher. I'm a bit scared [about going to the U.S.] after hearing all the news about the suffering of migrants at the border. But it's my daughter's greatest dream, Ms. Velásquez said. Exporting People: How Central America Encourages Mass Migration: The three Northern Triangle nations spend preciously little on the poor and then reap the financial benefits when they flee, said a Bloomberg headline in 2019: Migration is part of the model, said Seynabou Sakho, the World Bank's director for Central America. A country may not have a big deficit, but at the same time, the needs of its people aren't being met.\n\nIn a few countries, the remittances paper over the economic damage imposed by the progressives' Hunger Games. For Central American countries, the negative effects of emigration seem to be broadly (or more than) offset by gains from their higher remittance receipts, the IOM reported in 2012. Those remittances are huge: Remittances sent to Guatemala represented 11 percent of GDP and 46 percent of household income in 2017 … [I El Salvador] Remittances reached $5.47 billion in 2018, amounting to roughly 20 percent of the country's GDP, said a 2020 report by the Texas Public Policy Foundation. Who gains? Those remittances consist of wages taken from the hands of blue-collar American workers, including many black and Latino hands. Illegal migrant workers rationally take jobs at low U.S. wages, so exempting U.S. employers from the wage-raising pressure to make fair bargains with the tens of millions of Americans who are disabled, parenting, drugged, isolated, or unemployed. Wealthy Americans also gain from the extraction of foreign labor and consumer demand, said a 2013 article titled Dollars, 'Free Trade,' and Migration: The Combined Forces of Alienation in Postwar El Salvador. It argued that capitalists in the destination countries capture surplus labor and value from migrants by paying substandard wages, [as] capitalists in El Salvador also profit both directly and indirectly, from remittances. Joe Biden's pro-migration allies are pressuring him to maximize migration into the United States, despite the public's deep opposition to cheap-labor migration. https://t.co/0P3Uzj6k5N — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 29, 2020\n\nThe deportation of migrants from the United States would shift wealth back to lower-skilled Americans, said a 2018 report by the International Food Policy Research Institute. The trade compression caused by deportations [of lower skill migrants] suggests that the U.S. may experience losses of higher-paying export jobs. Based on the aims of the current U.S. administration, these potential losses must be compared with potential gains in jobs with lower skill levels, said the report, which was validated by the blue-collar wage gains for Americans in 2018 and 2019. after 40 years of flat wages for men.\n\nOne example of the progressives' harm to Americans is their quiet support for the flow of child laborers into the blue-collar jobs needed by lower-skilled Americans. In November 2o20, ProPublica reported:\n\nHonestly, I think almost everyone in the system knows that most of the [migrant] teens are coming to work and send money back home, said Maria Woltjen, executive director and founder of the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, a national organization that advocates for immigrant children in court. They want to help their parents. But whether they stayed in a shelter in Florida or California or Illinois, the teens heard similar warnings from the staff: They had to enroll in school and stay out of trouble. The immigration judges who would decide their cases, they were told, didn't want to hear that they were working. They would ask you: 'Who are you going to live with? Is he going to support you financially?' said one 19-year-old who spent nearly six months at a shelter in New York before a family friend in Bensenville agreed to take him in. And you say yes. 'Are they going to be responsible for you?' And you say yes. 'Are they going to take you to school?' And you say yes.\n\nThe child laborers can bypass part of the obstacle course because of a law passed unanimously in 2008. The law allowed the inflow of at least 315,000 Central American children and youths since 2013, who have reduced pressure on employers to offer higher wages or buy labor-saving machinery:\n\nAround Urbana-Champaign, the home of the University of Illinois, school district officials say children and adolescents lay shingles, wash dishes and paint off-campus university apartments. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, an indigenous Guatemalan labor leader has heard complaints from adult workers in the fish-packing industry who say they're losing their jobs to 14-year-olds. In Ohio, teenagers work in dangerous chicken plants. ProPublica interviewed 15 teenagers and young adults in Bensenville alone who said they work or have worked as minors inside more than two dozen factories, warehouses and food processing facilities in the Chicago suburbs, usually through temporary staffing agencies, and nearly all in situations where federal and state child labor laws would explicitly prohibit their employment. Though most of the teens interviewed for this story are now 18, they agreed to speak on the condition that they not be fully identified and that their employers not be named because they feared losing their jobs, harming their immigration cases or facing criminal penalties. Some began to work when they were just 13 or 14, packing the candy you find by the supermarket register, cutting the slabs of raw meat that end up in your freezer and baking, in industrial ovens, the pastries you eat with your coffee. Garcia, who is 18 now, was 15 when he got his first job at an automotive parts factory.\n\nBut it must be the GOP's Fault!\n\nIn their reports, tweets, and statements, Democrats progressives and executives recognize the obstacle course — but blame everyone else for the human cost of their worldwide invite.\n\nTrump created a horrifying ecosystem of violence and exploitation, says Biden's 2020 platform:\n\nIt is a moral failing and a national shame when a father and his baby daughter drown seeking our shores. When children are locked away in overcrowded detention centers … When President Trump uses family separation as a weapon against desperate mothers, fathers, and children seeking safety and a better life … When children die while in custody due to lack of adequate care.\n\nIn our own little ways—whether as employers, consumers, or homeowners—each of us has long counted on, and effectively encouraged, the development of this extralegal immigration system, Jawetz testified in 2019. At the risk of being provocative, the truth is that our arcane immigration system is so broken that it long ago abandoned the right to expect and deserve compliance and respect.\n\nPlenty of people on 'my side' [of the labor and migration debate] lament the fact that the lack of adequate pathways to channel immigration through the system rather than around it has predictably led to immigration outside the law, Jawetz told Breitbart News December 29. The solution is better tailored and more realistic pathways.\n\nBiden, Jawetz, and other progressives disregard the public's demand for jobs, decent wages, and Americans' right to their own national labor market. Jawetz testified in 2019:\n\nSo, what would such an immigration system look like? For starters, it would have realistic, evidence-based avenues for legal immigration … [where migrant] Workers would be able to find legal pathways into the country to fill needed positions.\n\nThe contradiction between migration and development is not a problem for progressives, said Kirkorian. Ideological libertarians and leftists look at it this way: That any way of getting here, under any circumstances, is better [for migrants] than staying where they are, he said. The development damage done to the home countries is waved away as brain gain or circulation or something like that, he added.\n\nPHOTOS: Human smugglers in Mexico stuffed 71 migrants in the back of a tractor-trailer in an attempt to reach the Texas border. https://t.co/YHtA9W3iGn — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 24, 2020\n\nAnd, of course, once the U.S. economy is flooded with rent-raising, wage-cutting legal (or illegal) immigrants, then blue-collar Americans are denied the right to a tight labor market where employees and employers can bargain as equals as they trade work for wages. Jawetz and other progressives would join with CEOs to steal that bargaining power and decide which jobs need to be filled by low-wage, compliant, and grateful migrants instead of well-paid, free-speaking, indepndent American citizens.\n\nI don't think [progressives] feel a moral duty to fellow Americans, said Rosemary Jenks, the policy director at NumbersUSA:\n\nThey are globalists … [They think] their duty is to focus on [poor foreigners], not focus on their fellow countrymen or on making this country better. They have no sense of what an average American's life is like, but they can say, Oh, I'm a good person because I'm helping these [foreign] people, you know, by bringing up illegal aliens from Central America, I'm reuniting families.\n\nTheir migration strategy is cruelty to ordinary Americans too,' she added.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that Biden and his progressives see large-scale, wage-cutting migration as a core value… the highest values of our nation — and they view migration as far more important than economic development in Central America, Africa, Latin America — or in central Los Angeles, central Detroit, or anywhere else in Americans' home country.\n\nBiden's campaign document says:\n\nJoe Biden understands that [immigration] is an irrefutable source of our strength. Generations of immigrants have come to this country with little more than the clothes on their backs, the hope in their heart, and a desire to claim their own piece of the American Dream. It's the reason we have constantly been able to renew ourselves, to grow better and stronger as a nation, and to meet new challenges. Immigration is essential to who we are as a nation, our core values, and our aspirations for our future. Under a Biden Administration, we will never turn our backs on who we are or that which makes us uniquely and proudly American. The United States deserves an immigration policy that reflects our highest values as a nation.\n\nAs long as Americans oppose the inflow of migrants into their jobs, communities, and futures, then progressives will cheerlead as millions more Central Americans — plus tens of millions of Africans, Indians, Latin Americans, and Asians — risk their lives and wealth in the progressives' Hunger Games.\n\nImmigration [policy] requires making choices, said Miano, and because these progressives don't want to make the choices, they let the coyotes and the desert make the choices for them.
Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Wednesday regarding the Russian metro bombing and also the Susan Rice unmasking controversy.\n\nSaid Gaffney in discussing the unmasking controversy, citing the duration of the effort and potential involvement of others, I think that there's unquestionably a political warfare operation being run by their former boss, Barack Obama. And I think there's a lot of evidence that they're still lashed up with him and therefore i think it's a safe assumption that they are probably performing opposition research, if you wish to call it that, for Organizing for Action… and their purpose for it is pretty clear – destroying the Trump presidency.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate, veteran, and philanthropist known for his donation to conservative and pro-Israel causes, passed away Monday night at the age of 87 at his home in Malibu, California.\n\nThe Las Vegas Review-Journal, the hometown paper of the city Adelson helped build, reported:\n\nSheldon Adelson, who rose from selling newspapers on Boston street corners at age 12 to one of the most successful luxury resort developers, philanthropists and political influencers of his generation, died Monday night at his home in Malibu, California. He was 87. Adelson founded and served as Chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., the world's largest gaming corporation, from its inception in 1988. He had been on medical leave from the company since Jan. 7 to resume his fight against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which he had battled since 2019. … Under Adelson's leadership, Las Vegas Sands pioneered the integrated resort model that now dominates the Strip, combining luxury hotel-casinos with convention centers. Adelson's concept was so popular and financially successful that he became one of the world's wealthiest people.\n\nAdelson rose from poverty to success in business, and served in the U.S. Army. He was raised as a Democrat, but became a Republican over time, and was well-known as a Republican megadonor, the single biggest individual campaign donor in recent election cycles. He also funded conservative groups such as the Republican Jewish Coalition, one of the most active pro-Israel Jewish groups in Washington, DC.\n\nInitially somewhat skeptical of Donald Trump, Adelson eventually supported him, and played an influential role in pushing the administration to adopt bold Middle East policy changes, including the movement of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Known as a hawk for his staunchly pro-Israel views, Adelson helped shape a legacy of peacemaking, as the Abraham Accords came to fruition between Israel and several neighboring Arab states.\n\nAdelson also left his mark on Israeli politics, backing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He funded a free daily newspaper, Israel Hayom, that took an editorial line supporting Netanyahu and his policies.\n\nThe paper remembered Adelson as a visionary and philanthropist in an obituary written by his wife, Miriam, a psychologist:\n\nSheldon was the love of my life. He was my partner in romance, philanthropy, political activism and enterprise. He was my soul-mate. … He was an American patriot: a US Army veteran who gave generously to wounded warriors and, wherever he could, looked to the advancement of these great United States. He was the proudest of Jews, who saw in the State of Israel not only the realization of an historical promise to a unique and deserving people, but also a gift from the Almighty to all of humanity. And Sheldon was kind. He gave readily of his fortune to charitable causes that may literally be countless, as he expected no credit and often preferred anonymity. Although bluff in build and speech – and, in the last two decades, beset by painful sickness – Sheldon was always sensitive to the needs of others.\n\nIn addition, the Adelsons were known for their donations to the cause of treating drug addiction. During the coronavirus pandemic, he continued to pay the salaries of his 10,000 employees, even though they could not work. He also helped import much-needed personal protective equipment (PPE) from overseas.\n\nAdelson is survived by three sons, three daughters, and eleven grandchildren.\n\nJoel B.

A six-justice majority has extended homosexual rights to same-sex couples by ordering the state of Arkansas to allow a non-related or same-sex spouse be named as the second parent on a child's birth certificate, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissented in a decision that reverses what until now was a space on one's birth certificate reserved for the opposite-sex spouse. Both the majority and minority opinions held opposing views on whether the Arkansas law reserves the parental space on the birth certificate for biological parents.\n\nWhen a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples 'the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage' … we reverse the state court's judgment.\n\nThe State uses those certificates to give married parents a form of legal recognition that is not available to unmarried parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not, consistent with Obergefell, deny married same-sex couples that recognition.\n\nWriting for the dissenting justices, Gorsuch wrote, in part:\n\nTo be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a State must recognize same-sex marriages. But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether §20–18–401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go. The statute in ques- tion establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Oberge- fell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders. In an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state supreme court agreed. And it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the Constitution. To the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this Court's prec- edents suggest just the opposite conclusion.\n\nThe statute in question establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate. Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Obergefell—like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders.\n\nThe question before the court in Pavan v. Smith was whether a state violates the 14th Amendment by denying married same-sex couples the same right afforded to married opposite-sex couples under state law to have the name of the birth mother's spouse entered as the second parent on their child's birth certificate.\n\nIn this case, according to court documents, the respondents, who were the plaintiffs in the lower-court action, are three female same-sex married couples and their children. One spouse in each married couple gave birth to a child.\n\nWhen the Department of Health declined to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed as parents, respondents filed suit in circuit court seeking a declaration that petitioner's refusal to issue a birth certificate with both spouses listed violated their constitutional rights, as well as a declaration that certain statutory provisions were unconstitutional. Respondents also sought to enjoin enforcement of petitioner's policy against naming both spouses on the birth certificate under these circumstances and an order requiring petitioner to issue corrected birth certificates naming both spouses.
On Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking for details about a reported FBI plan to pay Christopher Steele for information on the Trump campaign.\n\nSteele is the author of the infamous Trump Dossier, a collection of poorly-vetted and unsubstantiated rumors about President Trump that wound up being promoted by BuzzFeed.\n\nSince the media is currently in very high dudgeon about unsubstantiated allegations, it will doubtless applaud Grassley for his inquiry.\n\nAs Grassley explains to Comey in his letter, the Washington Post reported last week that the FBI reached an agreement a few weeks before the presidential election to pay Steele for continuing investigations of President Trump:\n\nThe article claimed that the FBI was aware Mr. Steele was creating these memos as part of work for an opposition research firm connected to Hillary Clinton. The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for President in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI's independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration's use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends. It is additionally troubling that the FBI reportedly agreed to such an arrangement given that, in January of 2017, then-Director Clapper issued a statement stating that the IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. According to the Washington Post, the FBI's arrangement with Mr. Steele fell through when the media published his dossier and revealed his identity.\n\nOn second thought, maybe the media won't applaud Grassley for digging into this after all. They're currently very eager to promote the idea that the Obama administration was utterly incorruptible and completely above partisan politics. It won't look good at all if the FBI was preparing to hire the creator of the slipshod, frequently ridiculous Trump Dossier until certain media outlets decided to attack Trump by leaking his work.\n\nGrassley asked Comey to provide all of the FBI's records concerning this arrangement with Steele, plus any meetings FBI officials may have held with him. He wants these records squared with FBI policy on funding an investigator associated with a political opposition research firm connected to a political candidate, or with any outside entity.\n\nWere any other government officials outside of the FBI involved in discussing or authorizing the agreement with Mr. Steele, including anyone from the Department of Justice or the Obama White House? Grassley asked.\n\nHe also wants to know how the FBI obtained a copy of Steele's documents, whether it has additional documents that were not published by Buzzfeed, and whether any FBI activity was influenced by the Steele memo.\n\nHalfway down Grassley's list of questions comes what could be the most devastating of his inquiries, considering President Trump's accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped his 2016 presidential campaign:\n\nHas the FBI relied on or otherwise referenced the memos or any information in the memos in seeking a FISA warrant, other search warrant, or any other judicial process? Did the FBI rely on or otherwise reference the memos in relation to any National Security Letters? If so, please include copies of all relevant applications and other documents.\n\nNational Security Letters are one of the FBI's most secretive instruments for obtaining information. They are frequently accompanied by powerful gag orders which forbid the recipient of the letter from discussing it.
There needs to be some consequence for having a sanctuary policy, said Jessica Vaughan, advising the federal government to withhold certain funding from sanctuary city jurisdictions that shield criminal illegal aliens from justice. Sanctuary policies, she added, are killing Americans.\n\nVaughan, Director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, joined Breitbart News's Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour for a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight.\n\nThe federal government should strip at least some federal funding from state and local governments with sanctuary policies, said Vaughan.\n\nShe added:\n\nThe other thing that [the federal government is] trying to do is to deny certain federal law enforcement grants to sanctuary jurisdictions, whether they're cities, states, counties; they're trying to make these grants off-limits for sanctuaries, which makes sense. Why should a jurisdiction get taxpayer money for law enforcement when they're stiffing one of the biggest law enforcement agencies of the federal government. They shouldn't. There needs to be some consequence for having a sanctuary policy. … Hopefully the federal government will be able to deny them some funding.\n\nThe federal government should consider prosecuting state and local officials who implement and enforce sanctuary policies violative of federal law, said Vaughan. Victims of crimes committed by illegal aliens shielded by sanctuary policies should considering suing sanctuary jurisdictions for damages, she added.\n\nShe also argued that Congress should pass some laws that would facilitate imposing consequences on sanctuary jurisdictions, as well as politicians and officials implementing them.\n\nCalifornia has become the new Confederacy, now, observed Mansour, as a Californian.

Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are set to deepen Franco-German ties by signing a twinning treaty which has been criticised as an erosion of national sovereignty.\n\nThe pro-open borders German chancellor and globalist French president are set to formalise their already close co-operation with shared defence, foreign and economic policy, and business regulations in what is seen as a prototype for a more sovereign, united Europe, The Times reports.\n\nAs European Union member states, the countries have already abandoned many of their sovereign rights by ditching their national currencies for the euro, agreeing to open borders within the bloc, and submitting to European courts as their highest legal arbiter.\n\nThe new treaty, styled on the 1963 Élysée Treaty of post-war reconciliation, will also encourage the formation of border town Eurodistricts where French and German towns will merge public transport networks and utilities.\n\nThe countries also plan to coordinate their positions in Brussels and lobby the United Nations to give Germany its own seat on the Security Council — France holding one of five permanent positions in the influential group.\n\nLate last year, Germany called on France to give up its seat to the EU so the bloc could speak with one voice — a request France rejected. Germany began her two-year stint in the Security Council as one of ten non-permanent members in January, with Mrs Merkel telling her country in her New Year's address that she would keep pushing for global solutions to the world's problems, including mass migration and climate change.\n\nMacron: 'Franco-German Couple' Will Stop World 'Descending into Chaos', Warns Against 'Nationalism' https://t.co/sLB3Kmy6ko — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 18, 2018\n\nBoth states will deepen their cooperation in foreign affairs, defence, external and internal security and development and at the same time work on strengthening the ability of Europe to act independently, says the text of the treaty, as seen by Reuters.\n\nBoth states will deepen the integration of their economies towards a German-French economic area with common rules, the document added.\n\nPresident Macron's office confirmed the extension of the Élysée Treaty would enable the two countries to take a lead on handling the challenges they will be confronted with in the 21st century, adding, [We] envisage deepening our engagement in favour of security and prosperity of our peoples in the framework of a more sovereign, united and democratic Europe.\n\nThe developing relationship between Macron and Merkel blossomed at the end of last year, when the French president announced that the Franco-German couple would become the heart of Europe and work to stop the world descending into chaos — making not-so-thinly veiled criticisms of U.S. President Donald J. Trump's policy of putting the American electorate first, rather than globalist endeavours.\n\nTensions between the nationalist-patriotic U.S. president and the globalist-progressive French premier came to a head when in early November Macron called for a real European army to protect the continent from threats from China, Russia, and the United States itself — a NATO ally.\n\nMerkel enthusiastically backed Macron a week later, calling for a real, true European army — the prospect of which was often dismissed as a dangerous fantasy by Remain campaigners in the run-up to the British vote to leave the bloc.\n\nEU Army Plans Advance as Germany Tells France to Give UN Security Council Seat to Brussels https://t.co/b6RL9XbzgY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 29, 2018\n\nThe treaty is set to be signed in the German city of Aachan, which lies on the multi-nation border with Belgium and the Netherlands, on January 22nd, and the agreement will be ratified at both the French and German parliaments.\n\nThere is profound significance to having chosen Aachen, known in French as Aix-le-Chapelle, the ancient Roman spa city that has crossed hands between French and German possession for centuries.\n\nThe city was also the residence and burial place of the early medieval ruler Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor dubbed the Father of Europe for having united the western part of the continent by the 9th century.\n\nAlexander Gauland, leader of the populist, anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD), has condemned the union as a further erosion of our national sovereignty.\n\nWhile Germany and France are uniting to create progressive-globalist union, nationalist and populist groups are working to reshape the EU into a Europe of independent nations ahead of European Parliament elections in May, with right-populist Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini meeting with Poland's conservative leadership in Warsaw on Wednesday.
Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg is promising to nearly double the intake of refugees admitted to the U.S. under the Obama administration.\n\nBloomberg, whom polls show is gaining traction in his quest for the 2020 Democrat nomination, released his proposal for overhauling America's immigration and refugee laws on Monday. The plan, based on policies the mayor implemented during his tenure at the helm of New York City, is being touted as beneficial to not only the country's diversity, but also its profit margins.\n\nThe proposal states:\n\nAs the grandson of immigrants, Mike understands that immigration has been and always will be one of America's greatest strengths. His plan focuses on … tapping into the dedication and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants to grow our economy and enrich our communities.\n\nOne way that Bloomberg hopes to grow and enrich the economy is by increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country annually. If elected, Bloomberg hopes to accept 125,000 refugees if elected—nearly doubling the intake accepted under former President Barack Obama. A portion of the new refugees will be individuals fleeing the impact of climate change, an idea also favored by Bloomberg's more progressive rivals, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Mike will set the target for refugee admissions at 125,000, and—recognizing the changing conditions causing displacement—will also establish a precedent for people permanently displaced by climate change to qualify as refugees, Bloomberg's plan states.\n\nThe proposed numbers stand in stark contrast to the 18,000 refugees President Donald Trump's administration is on track to accept between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020.\n\nTrump's refugee policy, which has shrunk the number of incoming individuals to levels unseen since 1980, is central to his agenda for raising wages and living standards for the American worker. The president and his allies have argued that a tight labor market benefits workers already in the country by pushing companies to invest in skill training and development. It also has the benefit of boosting wages, as there is a smaller pool of workers competing for open positions.\n\nThe president's policy differs from that of his predecessor. During former President Barack Obama's tenure in the White House, the number of displaced persons being resettled in the U.S. increased drastically. Between 2008 and 2017, more than 67,000 refugees on average were admitted into the country. The total would have been larger if Republicans had not stymied Obama's efforts to admit 110,000 displaced persons, most notably from Syria, during his final year in office.\n\nOverall, as of 2005, nearly 860,000 refugees have been resettled across America—a large proportion going to areas that have lagged behind the rest of the country in economic growth since the Great Recession. The incoming refugees have stressed the already depleted resources of state and local governments. The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) estimates that it costs taxpayers more than $64,000 over five years to resettle one Syrian refugee. To resettle an entire family, the cost estimate rises to more than $257,000 over five years.\n\nComplicating matters is the education levels of recently admitted refugees has plummeted, according to data analyzed by CIS. In 1996, only 35 percent of incoming refugees lacked a high school diploma. By 2015, the number had skyrocketed to 51 percent. The low educational attainment levels help explain why 56 percent of refugee households received food stamps or other government benefits in 2015.\n\nDespite the murky economic picture, Bloomberg is not only promising to accept more refugees, but he's also lashing out at those who disagree. Last month, during a campaign swing through Texas, the former mayor attacked Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) for his decision to halt refugee resettlement.\n\nThis is America. We shouldn't be doing this, the former mayor told The Dallas Morning News at the time. It's not good for Texas. It's not good for America.\n\nIt's certainly not good for the people who are trying to get here, Bloomberg added, before claiming America was too wealthy to deny refugees.
Great news, Americans! You lost your jobs, your businesses collapsed, your children were denied an education, your freedoms were stolen, you were imprisoned in your own home, you were forced to wear a mask, you couldn't travel – but it was all worth it because guess what? In 2020, thanks to Chinese Coronavirus, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions fell by ten whole per cent last year.\n\nHappy now?\n\nYou should be, according to the New York Times, which can barely contain its righteous joy.\n\nBelow the headline 'Covid-19 Took a Bite from U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2020', the standfirst crows:\n\n'Emissions plunged more than 10 percent. If the trend can be sustained, it would put the United States within striking distance of one of its major goals under the Paris climate agreement.'\n\nIt begins:\n\nAmerica's greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry plummeted more than 10 percent in 2020, reaching their lowest levels in at least three decades as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on the nation's economy, according to an estimate published Tuesday by the Rhodium Group. The steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks.\n\nThis is not the first time that the leftist media has tried to spin virtue out of the coronavirus crisis. In March last year, you'll remember, the MSM was in ecstasies over the fact that — thanks to the total destruction of its tourist economy — Venice now had cleaner canals.\n\nHere, for example, is the BBC version (But CNBC and ABC and CNN and the rest were all similarly delighted)\n\nResidents of Venice are noticing a vast improvement in the quality of the famous canals that run through the city, which are running clear for the first time in years, and fish can even be seen in the usually murky waters.\n\nWhat's always completely absent from this eco-fascist take on the world is any sympathy for — or even understanding of — the human misery caused by the enforced shutdown of an economy.\n\nThe New York Times article is a case in point. What is striking — and indeed horrifying to anyone who doesn't share the author's eco-loon mindset — is the degree to which the piece appears to see economic shutdowns as a net positive for the planet.\n\nThen, the coronavirus arrived. As governors placed their states under lockdown last spring and Americans sheltered in place, emissions started plunging across parts of the economy that had rarely seen sustained drops before. Transportation, the nation's largest source of greenhouse gases, saw a 14.7 percent decline in emissions in 2020 as millions of people stopped driving to work and airlines canceled flights. While travel started picking up again in the latter half of the year as states relaxed their lockdowns, Americans drove 15 percent fewer miles over all last year than they did in 2019 and the demand for jet fuel fell by more than one-third.\n\nIndeed, the impression given is that the author would be much happier if the economic decline continued indefinitely.\n\nThe steep drop, however, was the result of extraordinary circumstances and experts warned that the country still faced enormous challenges in getting its planet-warming pollution under control. In the years ahead, United States emissions are widely expected to bounce back once the pandemic recedes and the economy rumbles back to life — unless policymakers take stronger action to clean up the country's power plants, factories, cars and trucks. The most significant reductions last year were around transportation, which remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, said Kate Larsen, a director at Rhodium Group, a research and consulting firm. But as vaccines become more prevalent, and depending on how quickly people feel comfortable enough to drive and fly again, we'd expect emissions to rebound unless there are major policy changes put in place.\n\nThis is not coincidental. The idea of 'degrowth' as a virtuous goal is a key tenet not only of hard-left environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion but also of the Great Reset, which sees the economic destruction wrought by Covid-19 not as a crisis but as an opportunity for a 'new normal.'\n\nAs I explain in more detail here, the Green Agenda IS the Great Reset.\n\nThis is discussed in two interviews I conducted with experts on the Great Reset – one, called Patrick Wood who has been following the Great Reset since its beginnings in the early 1970s; another a German economist called Dr Anthony Mueller.\n\nBoth confirmed that the Great Reset — world domination by a technocratic elite in which ordinary folk will own no property and will be subject to CCP-style social credit controls on their freedoms — is closely allied with the environmental movement's concept of 'sustainability' and living within the planet's means. In this view of the world, humans are considered a verminous plague on the planet rather than, as Christians prefer to see it, God's greatest creation made in His image.\n\nOnce you understand this, the authoritarianism with which so many governments have responded to the Chinese coronavirus makes a lot more sense.
An astonishing 10,000 millionaires left France in 2015 thanks to rising social tensions caused by Islamic immigration and terrorism. But while Britain has been warned to expect a similar exodus should racial tensions also rise here, the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union is more likely to keep millionaires within our shores.\n\nOverall last year France lost approximately 3 percent of its total number of millionaires, while it's capital, Paris, lost about six percent of its millionaires. That amounts to some 7,000 people from Paris alone, mostly to the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia and Israel, according to a report by New World Wealth, an agency which compiles data on the global wealth sector.\n\nThe large outflow of millionaires from France is notable – France is being heavily impacted by rising religious tensions between Christians and Muslims, especially in urban areas. We expect that millionaire migration away from France will accelerate over the next decade as these tensions escalate, the report warns.\n\nChina saw the second largest outward flow of millionaires last year, the authors found, followed by Italy, India, Greece, the Russian Federation, Spain and Brazil.\n\nAustralia was the largest recipient of new millionaires, with some 8000 coming to settle within her shores last year, mostly to Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. America picked up 7,000 millionaires, followed by Canada, Israel, the UAE and New Zealand.\n\nLondon saw a net inflow of around 500 millionaires, although many of the 2,500 who left the city moved to other parts of England rather than leaving the country altogether.\n\nMost of the millionaires that left London were UK born whereas almost all of the millionaires that came into the city were from other countries, the report's authors note.\n\nThis may be a trend that continues in future as several wealthy UK born people that we spoke to said they were concerned about the way London and the UK in general had changed over the past decade or so. Australia seems to be their preferred destination.\n\nThe figures were compiled using data collected from investor visa programme statistics of each country; annual interviews with around 800 global high net worth individuals and with intermediaries like migration experts, second citizenship platforms, wealth managers and property agents; data from property registers and property sales statistics in each country; and by tracking millionaire movements in the media, the International Business Times has reported.\n\nBut while tensions prompted by mass immigration were clearly of concern to those leaving Europe, the possibility of a British exit from the European Union was not a concern. If anything, those questioned were more likely to welcome the possibility of Britain being able to regain her borders, making a Brexit more likely to keep high net worth individuals within the UK.\n\nThey were also heartened by the possibility of a re-introduction of the 2 year working visas for citizens from Canada, Australia and New Zealand if Britain did strike on her own, as well as the possibility of the USA being added to the visa list.\n\nAnd they wanted to see stronger links being forged with former English colonies, specifically Australia, USA, Canada and New Zealand, as well as India and China, while hoping for weaker alliances going forward with the EU countries, Turkey and the Middle East.\n\nThe report notes: In our view, a Brexit will not result in an outflow of millionaires from the UK. On the contrary, we believe that wealthy UK citizens are more likely to stay in the UK if there is a Brexit. This view is backed up by the fact that most of the wealthy British people we interviewed voiced concern over the UK's open border policy with Europe.

An article from the Wall Street Journal notes that advisers to the European Union's top court have suggested that Google shouldn't be forced to apply the E.U.'s right to be forgotten rules outside the E.U.\n\nIn a recent article titled Google Nears Win in Europe Over 'Right to Be Forgotten', the Wall Street Journal notes that advisers to the European Union's Court of Justice have argued that search engines such as Google should not be forced to comply with the E.U.'s right to be forgotten rule which allows European citizens to request certain links or information be removed from search engines when their name is searched.\n\nThe Journal writes:\n\nGoogle and other search engines shouldn't be forced to apply the European Union's right to be forgotten beyond the bloc's borders, an adviser to the EU's top court argued Thursday. The recommendation—if followed by the EU's Luxembourg-based Court of Justice—would be a major victory for Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., which has for three years been fighting an order from France's privacy regulator to apply the EU principle globally. Maciej Szpunar, an advocate general for the court, argued in Thursday's nonbinding opinion that if the EU ordered removal of content from websites accessed outside the EU, there was a danger that other jurisdictions would use their laws to block information from being accessible within the EU. There is a real risk of reducing freedom of expression to the lowest common denominator across Europe and the world, Mr. Szpunar wrote.\n\nIt is expected that the courts will make a ruling on this issue within coming months, although the court does not always follow the suggestions of outside advisers when it comes to policy and legislation, it is also not uncommon for them to do so. This makes it even more likely that the court will follow the advice of advisers such as Szpunar.\n\nThis would be a major win for Google which is fully behind Spuznar's suggestion:\n\nBacked by an array of free-speech advocates, the tech company has argued that expanding the territorial scope of the right to be forgotten would infringe on other countries' sovereignty and encourage dictators and tyrants to assert control over content published beyond their countries' borders. The EU's executive arm also argued in September that the right shouldn't be extended overseas. At issue in the case is the right, established by the court in 2014, for EU residents to demand that search engines remove links containing personal information—such as a home address—from searches for their own names. Under the 2014 ruling, search engines must then balance those requests against the public's right to associate the information in the link with that individual, taking into account, for instance, whether the person is a public figure. Since that decision, Google has removed 1.1 million links from search results in the EU. But it left those links intact for the same searches conducted outside Europe.\n\nIf the E.U. decides not to extend the right to be forgotten policy worldwide, it has been suggested that geolocation technology be used to block certain search results for those inside the E.U. but not for those outside of it:
A proposed diversity plan for Apple, which would have pushed the company to hire more minorities for its board of directors and senior management, was rejected by shareholders on Tuesday.\n\nSilicon Beat reports that this is the second year that the proposal has been put forward and the second year that it has been denied. The proposal calls for an accelerated recruitment policy to introduce diversity within the ranks of Apple's senior management and board of directors. Supporters of the policy noted that due to the proposal receiving less than six percent of votes from shareholders this year, it can be blocked from appearing on next year's proxy ballot.\n\nTony Maldonado, the Apple investor who submitted the proposal, discussed its rejection, saying, Apple successfully duped investors and the public into believing that diversity is not something that should be a priority. As a shareholder, I'm disappointed because I know that Apple's shocking lack of diversity leads to a weaker return on my investment.\n\nPat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin Asset Management and co-sponsor of the proposal, said, We're at a critical juncture in the life of Apple – where it needs to pivot from the iPhone and the Mac to captivate consumers again. How can Apple be sure it knows its customers well enough to build the smartest web services and AI assistants when its executive ranks still don't reflect the diversity of key markets?\n\nThe proposal was nearly unanimously rejected, however, receiving only 4.91% of shares voting in favor of the policy and 95.09 shares voting against it. Silicon Beat states that Apple did not respond to a request for comment but did previously urge investors to vote against the proposal in the proxy statement sent to investors in January.\n\nApple stated that they were already taking measures to promote diversity within the company:\n\nApple already provides detailed information about our core values and our most significant charitable contributions on our website at apple.com/diversity/creating-opportunities and apple.com/product-red. Apple's largest charitable contributions, which are made only following extensive internal vetting and approval from one or more of our executive officers, focus on some of the most important issues facing our communities today.
Leading U.S. tech CEO's have followed President Barack Obama's steps in a three-day business and diplomacy trip to Cuba that started Sunday.\n\nEleven CEO's and business leaders joined the president, with a list that included PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman, Marriott President and CEO Arne Sorenson, Air BnB founder Brian Chesky, and Starfish Media Chairman Soledad O'Brien.\n\nSince the leaders' arrival on Sunday, several deals have already been made with the communist island nation. Obama and Google announced on Monday that they had secured a deal to provide Wi-Fi and broadband Internet across the country, and room-renting mobile app Air BnB also announced on Sunday that the rooms they have for rent on the island will now be available to visitors worldwide, something which was previously restricted. Hotel chain Starwood have also announced that they will be building three new hotels in Havana.\n\nOur Cuba policy is focused on helping the Cuban people improve their lives, wrote White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes last week. Since charting a new Cuba policy, the United States has made regulatory changes to open up commercial ties between our countries at a time when a growing number of Cubans are self-employed. In Havana, the President will meet with Cuban entrepreneurs, or cuentapropistas, to hear their experiences. The event will include American entrepreneurs who will share their own experiences with their Cuban counterparts and look for opportunities to build long-term relationships.\n\nThe business deals come amid outrage on social media at President Obama after he stood hand-over-heart in front of a mural portraying communist guerrilla leader and Fidel Castro ally Che Guevera in Havana, Cuba this past weekend.\n\nUsers on social media criticised the president for previously failing to attend both veteran American sniper Chris Kyle's and former first lady Nancy Reagan's memorial services, but finding time to stand at a wreath-laying ceremony in Revolution Square with the former communist leader as a back-drop.\n\nThe move further illistrates an apparent attempt by Western technology leaders to bridge the gap between the West with communist authoritarian countries in a bid to find new audiences. Just last week, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with China's propaganda czar in a growing attempt to reintroduce Facebook across the heavily Internet-restricted country after being banned seven years ago for allowing dissidents a platform to speak.\n\nCharlie Nash is a frequent contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.

The board of directors of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) has moved to direct both the professional and private speech of its members with a ban on what the board considers to be hate speech and harassing speech.\n\nJohn Murawski of RealClearInvestigations reported the story on the wide-ranging new policy, announced a little over a week after Election Day, and reactions to it.\n\nBased in Chicago, the board of directors of the NAR – which claims to be the world's largest trade organization, with 1.4 million members – declared in a press statement it would be making it a violation for Realtors to use harassing or hate speech toward any of the protected classes under Article 10 of NAR's Code of Ethics.\n\nThe protected classes include race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nNAR's Advisory Board recommended that its Code of Ethics apply to every action a Realtor® takes, whether personal or professional, the announcement stated.\n\nThe board said its rationale in instituting the policy:\n\n… directly flows from the requirement to not deny equal professional services or be parties to a plan to discriminate. Specifically, bias against protected classes revealed through the public posting of hate speech could result in REALTORS® not taking clients from certain protected classes or not treating them equally, which would lead to violations of the Fair Housing Act due to overt discrimination or disparate impact.\n\nI applaud NAR's Board of Directors and our Professional Standards Committee for their efforts to raise the bar on the professionalism and private speech of America's 1.4 million Realtors®, NAR President Vince Malta, broker at Malta & Co., Inc., in San Francisco, said in the press statement, and added:\n\nCombatting and overcoming bigotry and injustice starts with each of us. Realtors® today took tangible steps to ensure we are held to the highest possible standard while providing a mechanism of enforcement for those who violate our new policies.\n\nMurawski noted in his report the scope of the new policy:\n\nThe sweeping prohibition applies to association members 24/7, covering all communication, private and professional, written and spoken, online and off. Punishment could top out at a maximum fine of $15,000 and expulsion from the organization.\n\nI was thrilled to hear it, white lesbian Mary Wagner, a real estate agent in Buffalo, told Murawski. I think it's long overdue.\n\nThe new policy has drawn the concern of others, nevertheless, since it allows any individual to file a complaint against a real estate agent, and could be used to censor debate and opinions on race, such as opposition to Black Lives Matter, and gender, such as criticism of men claiming to be transgender and pushing to compete against women in sports.\n\nThe dam has broken and other organizations will look at this, warned Robert Föehl, a professor of business ethics and business law at Ohio University.\n\nIf this is good for real estate agents, why not attorneys, why not doctors? Föehl told Murawski. They're going to be pressured to do what NAR has done. And that pressure is going to be very real, because what organization wants to argue they should allow hate speech by their members?\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) law professor Eugene Volokh told Murawski the significance of the policy is that it is institutionalizing loss of jobs over political expression and enforcing that standard through quasi-legal tribunals.\n\nWhat we're talking about is a new blacklist, Volokh said. One of the things that's troubling about the National Association of Realtors' position is that it is trying to deploy the organized economic power of this group in order to suppress dissenting political views among members.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) on Tuesday provided a warning about the consequences of Georgia voters selecting Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock over Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.\n\nNoem, who has been campaigning for Perdue and Loeffler, told FNC's Fox & Friends that the two Democratic candidates do not stand by law enforcement or enforcing laws, embrace socialism, and want to raise taxes. She warned that if the Democrats run every city and branch of the government, the lawlessness in Portland, OR, could be seen coast-to-coast.\n\nThere is no mother that wants to raise her children on the streets of Portland today, and what we're seeing in Democrat-run cities is what could happen coast-to-coast in this country if we let the Democrats run every single branch of Washington, D.C. and make the decisions going forward, Noem outlined. They have not stood by law enforcement officers. They've not enforced the law in this country, and we're seeing that play out in the streets and the violence that is happening back and forth in the last several months. Listen, Kelly and David love our law enforcement. They recognize that we have laws in this country for a reason, and they should be enforced, and when they're broken, there should be consequences. That is an important discussion in Georgia, but also I recognize people understand the Marxism, the communism, you know, the socialism discussion and what their life looks like six months from now if their expenses go up, if they have less money in their pocket because Democrats have raised taxes. We could in a year and a half, two years see $4 to $5 gasoline as a result of Democrat policy.\n\nSo, it is not just where the country will be 10 years from now. It's about what does your budget, what does your family's opportunities look like if we let Democrats do what they've actually been campaigning on, she concluded.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent
United States Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer says President Donald Trump's commitment to economic nationalism changed the way people think about China as free trade globalists admit their failures.\n\nIn a rare interview with the Wall Street Journal, Lighthizer notes that his tenure has marked a directional shift not only in Washington, DC, but also vastly among the American public with the majority turning on the hyper globalization that has gutted communities across the U.S. for decades.\n\nThat shift has broken with the free trade consensus of ignoring trade deficits, along with its job-killing impact, and moved toward a policy of protecting American industry, jobs, and wages.\n\nWe want a China policy that thinks about the geopolitical competition between the United States and an adversary—an economic adversary, Lighthizer told the Journal, adding:\n\nWe transformed the way people think about trade, and we transformed the way the models are, Mr. Lighthizer said in an interview. My hope is that that will continue. [Emphasis added] … We've protected our automobile industry, our auto parts industry, Mr. Lighthizer said. [Emphasis added]\n\nMeanwhile, critics of Trump's economic nationalist agenda admit the administration's effectiveness in refocusing trade policy to protect American workers:\n\nMr. Lighthizer's free-trade critics acknowledge his influence. He is the most consequential trade representative since President Kennedy created the position in 1963, said Gary Hufbauer, a Peterson Institute for International Economics senior fellow. He reversed the disposition toward globalization. [Emphasis added]\n\nMost notably, Lighthizer is pleading with President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration to keep in place Trump's tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports among other tariffs. Last year, Biden said he would lift tariffs on China but eventually walked back the statement.\n\nIn October 2020, Biden said he plans to allow U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere to decide whether his administration should keep tariffs on China or not. Lighthizer said this strategy did nothing in the past and called it a waste of time.\n\nBiden comes to the White House with an undeniable record of supporting the kind of job-killing free trade and globalization of the American economy that Trump has denounced for decades. That record has helped make Biden friendly with multinational corporations, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street — all of which benefit massively from outsourcing manufacturing to foreign countries that tolerate slave labor.\n\nBefore even taking office, Biden is being lobbied by corporate interests and factions of House Republicans and Democrats to drop U.S. tariffs on China in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Likewise, U.S. companies that make their products in China overwhelmingly say they are optimistic about Biden's presidency.\n\nSince 2001, U.S. free trade with China has eliminated at least 3.4 million American jobs. In 1985, before China entered the WTO, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $6 billion. In 2019, the U.S. trade deficit with China totaled more than $345 billion.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy, as every one manufacturing job supports an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Dan Caldwell, director of policy for Concerned Veterans of America, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow about veterans affairs on Thursday, including details in the new VA Accountability Bill.\n\nRead the bill here.\n\nCurrently, It can take up to two to three years to fire employees that have engaged in misconduct, including misconduct that led to the deaths of veterans who use the VA for their health care, Caldwell told Marlow.\n\nFor example, he continued, individuals responsible for the deadly wait list in Arizona where I'm from: it took seven hundred days to fire these individuals, and most of that time, they were on paid leave sitting at home.\n\nAs opposed to the Obama administration, whom Caldwell says opposed the bill, the Trump administration worked with the VA to develop The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 that would make it easier to fire a bad VA employee. It'd make it much, much quicker and reduces the firing process significantly … by about ninety percent.\n\nThe bill would also prevent workers from being paid during the termination process.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nLISTEN:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reviving the establishment's virtual wall policy on the southern border to soften her uncompromising opposition to President Donald Trump's push for a real fence on the border.\n\nWhat the President is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders … We all support border security, and there is a better way to do it … The positive, shall we say, almost technological wall, that can be built is what we should be doing, Pelosi said January 10.\n\nNancy Pelosi's border security fix: Repair the border roads so it's easier for immigrants to enter U.S.https://t.co/X6ePFKurDQ pic.twitter.com/sYPgLLxHV9 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 10, 2019\n\nPelosi's focus on a technological wall of sensors and drones helps the Democrats hide their push for more migration, despite its impact on Americans' wages, productivity, tax spending, crime, and civic peace, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThey have to make it sound like they are for some kind of enforcement, and so what they say they are in favor of is 'smarter enforcement,' just like the [Barack] Obama administration used to say their ICE strategy of 'prosecutorial prioritization' was really 'smarter enforcement,' she said.\n\nThe Democrats' push for a technological wall, is also very important for the new Democrat legislators elected in swing-districts, she said, adding:\n\nThey know they cannot afford to be seen blocking border security. We have to remember that Nancy Pelosi is not in the Speaker's chair now because voters want to abolish ICE or open the border. The Democrats [in November] won because there were a lot of Democratic candidates who won because they said they were just as hawkish on immigration as Republicans.\n\nPelosi also has to manage her raucous caucus, which includes moderates from swing-districts and progressives who back the Abolish ICE! slogan, Vaughan said.\n\nShe has to satisfy the open borders wing of her caucus [and] not veer too far in the direction of the progressives … I think the Democrats in Congress are more extreme on immigration than most Democratic voters are, but they can't afford to be associated with Abolish ICE! and pro-caravan demands.\n\nOverall, the party want the charade of enforcement, not actual enforcement, and that is true of border security and every other type of enforcement, she said.\n\nOther Democrats are touting technology as a full or partial substitute for a real fence. CNN reported January 4:\n\nIt is nothing more than a symbol when you look at it in this perspective, Bustos said during an interview on CNN's New Day, in reference to President Donald Trump's proposal for a wall. If we have a partial wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our borders safe, all of that is fine. But it has just become this symbol that the president is not going to have any give-or-take when it comes to this $5 billion.\n\n.@RepCheri Bustos says the border wall has become nothing more than a symbol, but notes that in the end, we might have to give or take a little bit. It's just the way the world works.https://t.co/oiGb5OgcB7 pic.twitter.com/2aUrs7YK1Z — New Day (@NewDay) January 4, 2019\n\nPelosi is also trying to shift the debate away from fences and towards amnesties: We need to have comprehensive immigration reform … Dreamers and their families and the rest, she said January 10. Comprehensive Immigration Reform is what this debate frankly should be about, she said.\n\nThat Democrats' opposition to a wall is entwined with Democrats' increasing promotion of migrants above Americans and their children.\n\nOn January 4, for example, Pelosi said that a wall is an immorality — it builds walls in peoples' minds about who should come here.\n\nOn January 8, after Trump's national address, Pelosi downplayed the northward flow of economic migrants. The migrants are a humanitarian challenge, a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counter-productive policies have only deepened, she said.\n\nOn January 10, Pelosi said that Trump's proposed barrier to Central American migration is discriminatory.\n\nIn February 2018, Pelosi gave a long speech in the House where she praised illegal migrants as better than Americans:\n\nWe recognize that they are a blessing to America … the dreamers are all over our country, Mr. Speaker, they are a blessing so across the board … These are the best of the best. They are so fabulous … I was impressed by the cumulative effect that they are making on their country. Each of them with their individual contribution to the greatness of America. So exciting, so proud of them … [They have] great humility about conveying their stories because when you see them and they tell their stories and the passion and the pride — the patriotism, passion, pride, patriotism, that they demonstrate, you will see why anyone who has had the wonderful experience of being in conversation or observing our dreamers, understand why they have had such a high reputation among the American people. some of whom have met them, some of whom have heard about them, some of whom have just catch the spark, catch the spark. Recognize, recognize again the hard work ethic, the commitment to education, to community service, to faith, to family, to the United States of America. It's a beautiful thing … Am I not lucky to be able to become so familiar with so many of these beautiful dreamers? We want to send these people back? This talent, this rich talent, this achievement, this determination, this faith in the future, this patriotism for America? I don't think so. We have to make [an amnesty] happen … Let us acknowledge the dreamers and their optimism, their inspiration to make America more American…\n\nDemocrats are trying to revive the establishment's 'virtual fence' substitute for a physical barrier. G.W. Bush and Obama ran that $1 billion scam from 2005 to 2015, but it only ensured more migrants, lower wages, and Trump's 2016 election. https://t.co/ZAQiunXoKl — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 10, 2019\n\nNationwide, the bipartisan establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.\n\nThe cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines at least five million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.\n\nImmigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices, pricing poor U.S. whites, Latinos and blacks out of prosperous cities, such as Berkeley and Oakland.
Opposition leader and presidential candidate Bobi Wine of Uganda accused soldiers of having raided his home and arrested his security guards on Monday morning during a live radio interview for a Kenyan radio station, Deutsche Welle (DW) reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe army has this morning raided my home, arrested all my security guards and anyone they could see around my premises, Wine wrote on Twitter on January 11.\n\nNo reason for the arrest was given, the pop-star-turned-legislator added.\n\nThe alleged raid on Wine's home occurred as the politician participated in a live radio interview with Kenya's Hot 96 FM station according to DW, a German state-owned broadcaster.\n\nWine is running as a presidential candidate in Uganda's upcoming general election on January 14. He seeks to oust current Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 35 years.\n\nWhile the Ugandan army has not responded to Wine's allegations that its soldiers raided his residence, the Uganda National Police said on January 12, they have credible information that … Bobi Wine plans to stage his own abduction after casting his vote on Thursday [January 14], Uganda's Daily Monitor reported.\n\nUganda National Police spokesman Fred Enanga said Wine will possibly hide at an embassy after voting in the general election, though he did not specify which embassy.\n\nHe will thereafter allege through his NUP [National Unity Platform] networks and bloggers, that he has been kidnapped by state operatives, Enanga told reporters at the police force's headquarters in Kampala, Uganda's national capital.\n\nWine leads the NUP, a social-liberal political party that opposes President Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRM) Party. The NRM has ruled Uganda since 1986, when its rebel wing, the National Resistance Army, helped Museveni seize control of the country through guerilla warfare. Museveni was a vocal Marxist when he took power and remains a loyal ally of the world's largest Communist Party, the Communist Party of China.\n\nUganda has experienced relative political stability and economic growth under Museveni's rule, the U.S. State Department noted in a summary of its bilateral relations with Uganda in December 2019.\n\nUganda has been a reliable partner for the United States in promoting stability in the Horn and East/Central Africa and in combatting terror, particularly through its contribution to the African Union Mission in Somalia, the U.S. foreign policy wing added.\n\nDespite its position as a Western ally, Uganda faces numerous challenges … that could affect its future stability, including explosive population growth, power and infrastructure constraints, corruption, underdeveloped democratic institutions, and human rights deficits, according to the State Department's summary.\n\nMuseveni dismissed alleged foreign interference in Uganda's upcoming general election in a televised speech on January 12. The NRM has previously accused alleged foreign actors of supporting the Wine-led opposition movement to overthrow Museveni.\n\nMuseveni dismissed interference by foreign partners saying they didn't understand that Uganda's strength came from the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), the army and the economy, Reuters reported of the president's speech.\n\nWe therefore don't need lectures about anything from anybody. Because there's nothing we don't know, Museveni added.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News during a press conference call on Wednesday that there remains no appetite for a potential Mitt Romney run for president in 2020.\n\nIncoming Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) published an op-ed on Tuesday, criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Paul quickly took to Twitter on Wednesday, calling Romney a Big Government Republican.\n\nBreitbart News's Kristina Wong asked Sen. Paul if he thinks Romney will plan to run to challenge President Trump in 2020 or if he will endorse Trump for president.\n\nSen. Paul told Breitbart News he thinks there remains no appetite for a Romney presidential campaign in 2020. Paul emphasized that Trump won many traditionally Democrat states, while Romney could not win any of these states.\n\nI think when you look back at presidential electoral politics, what was extraordinary about Trump's run was that he won Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and no Republican has done that, and that includes Mitt Romney, Paul told Breitbart News.\n\nRomney lost the 2012 presidential election to former President Barack Obama by more than 100 electoral votes.\n\nI think Trump's victory was an extraordinary one, and he did it by being, frankly, different, not being a run-of-the-mill establishment Republican. I don't think there's an appetite for a Romney run in the Republican party, nor do I think Mitt Romney-style big government establishment Republicanism is frankly popular enough to win in a general election, Paul continued.\n\nDuring the press conference, Sen. Paul also contended that Romney's attack on Trump is bad for the Republican party and will make it difficult to get things done in the Senate.\n\nThe Kentucky conservative also stated that Romney's sentiment about the president does not represent Utah very well.\n\nFurther, Paul said Romney's opinion of Trump serves as a minority opinion in the Senate Republican conference.\n\nI think you'll find a vast majority [of GOP senators] will have wished he hadn't said it, Paul added.\n\nSen. Paul said that when he differs with the president on policy, he does not resort to attacking his character. Paul explained that although he may disagree with the president on tariffs, he will champion the president's moves on tax cuts, as well as his decision to withdraw American troops from Syria.\n\nOther prominent Republicans also attacked Romney in the wake of his Washington Post op-ed.\n\nRepublican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Romney's niece, criticized the Utah senator in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nPOTUS is attacked and obstructed by the MSM media and Democrats 24/7. For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive, McDaniel tweeted:
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) during a press conference Friday called for a special counsel-like figure to examine what Hunter and Joe Biden did in Ukraine.\n\nI'm going to look at them. Are you going to impeach me? 'Cause somebody should. And I prefer it not to be me. I prefer it to be somebody like Mueller that we could all trust, because it's important to never let this happen again. This is not good foreign policy; this is not good government, Graham said.\n\nI think it's bad foreign policy if you're going to be in charge of dealing with corruption in the Ukraine that your son hook up with the most corrupt company in the Ukraine and turn the Ukraine into an ATM machine, he said.\n\nGraham's remarks come a day after House impeachment managers during the Senate impeachment trial brought up the Bidens, arguing that they did nothing wrong and that President Trump's call for Ukraine to look into what they did was an abuse of power.\n\nGraham said he disagreed with the House impeachment managers' assertions that this had been looked into and nothing found.\n\nIt has been widely reported that Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings for as much as $87,000 a month while his father was vice president and in charge of combating corruption in Ukraine. It has also been widely reported that Burisma was under investigation by the government of Ukraine for corruption, but the case eventually stopped being pursued.\n\nWhat is not clear, however, is whether Joe Biden's call for the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general conducting the investigation to be fired had anything to do with the case against Burisma being no longer pursued.\n\nGraham said at the press conference that the question has not yet been examined, and that Trump asking for it to be looked into is right.\n\nIf one of your family members is getting $87,000 a month from the most corrupt gas company in the Ukraine, and it's your job to deal with corruption in the Ukraine, you're not looking very hard. Somebody needs to look, not to help Trump, but to help us all, because that is not good foreign policy. It is not good government, Graham said.\n\nAnd I don't accept the idea that this has been looked at and there is nothing there. Somebody needs to look at it, and I would prefer it to be outside of politics but somebody will eventually look at it, he added.\n\nHe pointed out that he defended former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. I made sure that Mueller could look at the Trumps. My Democratic friends seem to have no interest in looking at something that screams to reek, he said.\n\nHe also said Trump is frustrated that the media have not been interested in looking into whether the Bidens did something wrong in Ukraine.\n\nNobody in your business has spent 15 minutes telling us about what Hunter Biden did, and is it good foreign policy? He's frustrated because of what he believes is a double standard, Graham said. I am telling you now, that I am going to look at this if nobody does, and that doesn't make me a Russian agent.\n\nHe also said if there were witnesses to be called during the Senate impeachment trial, Joe and Hunter Biden should be called in.\n\nIf there are new witnesses to be called, you would have to start with the ones who refuse to be called to start with, he said.\n\nHow do you try this case, quite frankly if you want more information, and not have Hunter Biden come in? And not ask Joe Biden, 'Mr. Vice President, how could you not know that your son was receiving $3 million from the most corrupt gas company in the Ukraine, and do you think that is good government and good foreign policy?'\n\nFollow Breitbart News's Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.
Around two-thirds of child refugees who were questioned about their age in the UK were revealed to be adults, a government report has found.\n\nIn one year, 65 per cent of asylum seekers assessed were judged to be over the age of 18.\n\nThe report, by immigration watchdog boss David Bolt, revealed the Home Office received 2,952 asylum applications from unaccompanied children, of which 705 had their age disputed.\n\nOf that, 618 cases were resolved, and 402 of them were found to be adults.\n\nIn October 2016, a public row erupted over child refugees as a stream of migrants began to arrive from Calais, some of who looked middle-aged.\n\nThe government had promised not to accept any new-arrivals from safe countries such as France, but campaigners took advantage of a new loophole in migration law aimed at children known as the Dubs amendment.\n\nTory MP Tim Loughton told the Daily Mail: We have been a soft touch in too many cases for asylum seekers who abuse our hospitality by elaborating their credentials.\n\nIt is right we give a safe haven to those who are in danger but too often we have been too trusting.\n\nEXCLUSIVE PICS: 'Child' Migrants Arrive in UK Covered by Blankets https://t.co/a8lzgC7zzQ pic.twitter.com/0g5LRo3CBE — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2016\n\nSince 2006, according to Home Office figures, there have been 12,942 disputes over the age of child asylum seekers, with 46 per cent of them (5,965) found to be adults.\n\nMr. Bolt's report also said officials were shying away from assessing those claiming to be underage.\n\nHome Office staff did not feel confident about making initial age assessments of applicants claiming to be children, particularly judging whether the claimant was 'significantly over 18' and should be entered into the adult process.\n\nThe document added: They received no training to help them make such judgments. Some local authorities were concerned that the Home Office applied its 'benefit of the doubt' policy too readily, and highlighted the risks of wrongly placing an adult with children in their care.
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise spoke on behalf of Republican leadership on Tuesday, asking Speaker Nancy Pelosi not to rescind the 2017 travel ban.\n\nLouisiana Republican Scalise called the No Ban Act bad policy that would not only make it more difficult to vet potentially dangerous entries but harm efforts to contain the global coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to reporters, he said:\n\nI know there is one piece of legislation that's scheduled for the floor this week that I would urge Speaker Pelosi to pull back on, and that is the No Ban Act. You saw at the very beginning of this, President Trump was able to take quick action when so many cases were coming out of China, and we still don't know enough about the genesis of this disease in China and how it may have started there. Unfortunately, they didn't share enough information with us as quickly, where we could have done more things earlier. But at the same time, the president was able to take quick action to limit the number of people coming in from China that had exposure to coronavirus, but the No Ban Act would make it more difficult for the president to keep Americans safe by addressing needs as we see other countries like Iran — you're seeing a large, potential large outbreak in Iran — Iran is one of those countries that we currently have a travel ban on because they don't allow us to properly vet that terrorists aren't coming into our country.\n\nScalise stressed the need for President Donald Trump to have the tools available to prevent American citizens from the increasing threat of the Wuhan-born contagion while the world waits for a vaccine:\n\nThe president ought to be able to keep potential terrorists from coming into our country, but now with this outbreak of coronavirus, the president also needs to have all the tools available to limit, people coming in from countries with a high propensity of coronavirus. You wouldn't want legislation that would make it more difficult. Hopefully, that bill gets pulled this week, but in the meantime, we need to continue to do all that we can to ensure that the administration has the tools they need, and we're working together to inform the public, of the various precautions that they can take as we're trying to find a vaccine.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by California Democrat representative Judy Chu, has been endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union, who characterized it as a response to Trump's racism. Three years after the first Muslim ban, President Trump expanded his discriminatory Muslim ban, targeting more Black and brown immigrants and their families, employers, and educational institutions, they said, continuing:\n\nCongress took a huge step forward today, sending the message to the president and the country that Muslims and other communities of color are welcome here. Now that the bill has passed out of committee, we look forward to its swift passage in the House without any further changes. We must end these bans and prevent presidents from using rank prejudice to discriminate against Black and brown people.\n\nThe No Ban Act was introduced to the House on March 3. At the time of this writing, Pelosi has not responded to Scalise's statement.
We all owe Chief Justice John Roberts a big thank you for confirming the name of the phony, Deep State whistleblower who launched this stupid impeachment hoax.\n\nEric Ciaramella.\n\nEric Ciaramella.\n\nEric Ciaramella.\n\nEric Ciaramella, a CIA analyst and raging partisan who falsely accused President Trump of impeachable crimes, who has a history of working with former Vice President Joe Biden, and who might have had his own agenda in wanting Biden's corruption in Ukraine covered up… Yep, that's him.\n\nAfter much speculation that Ciaramella is the guy, Roberts confirmed it Thursday through his unconstitutional act of commission.\n\nJustice Cuck refused to read an impeachment question submitted by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).\n\nThe question was for House manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), whose staff worked with Eric Ciaramella to cobble together this hoax by way of a fake whistleblower complaint.\n\nIt was a simple and relevant question:\n\nTo the Manager Schiff and counsel for the President: Manager Schiff and Counsel for the President, are you aware that House Intelligence Committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close relationship with Eric Ciaramella when at the National Security Council together, and are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal House impeachment proceedings?\n\nRoberts, who has no authority to do so, refused to read the question.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause, without any authority, he said he would not read questions that reveal the name of the whistleblower.\n\nAnd so, by refusing to read this question, this specific name, Roberts confirmed the whistleblower is, indeed, one Eric Ciaramella.\n\nFor his part, Sen. Paul who, unlike Roberts, is an elected official, was not amused. He tweeted:\n\nMy question is not about a whistleblower as I have no independent information on his identity. My question is about the actions of known Obama partisans within the NSC and House staff and how they are reported to have conspired before impeachment proceedings had even begun. [A]nd are you aware and how do you respond to reports that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the President before there were formal house impeachment proceedings.\n\nWhat's more, by unilaterally refusing to allow valid questions like this one, Roberts is rigging the trial against Trump.\n\nThe Senate is the jury. Paul is a member of that jury. So it is not only outrageous not to allow a juror to ask a question; it is also a violation of the Sixth Amendment not to allow the president to face his accuser, to question and cross-examine his accuser.\n\nNo legitimate jury in the world can make a fair ruling without a good look at the accuser.\n\nWhat's more, it is not even Roberts who would be revealing the name; it is the senator asking the question revealing the name. Roberts is merely reading someone else's question, which proves his motives are not only partisan, but one more example of the chief justice fabricating something out of whole cloth to benefit Democrats.\n\nAfter all, this is the same President John Roberts who singlehandedly rewrote the unconstitutional Obamacare mandate into a tax — something the lawmakers who wrote the Obamacare law specifically said it was not — just so he could protect Barack Obama's signature policy.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Georgia's runoff elections for the Peach State's seats in U.S. Senate are all about divided government, declared Charles Hurt, Washington Times opinion editor, Breitbart News columnist, and author of Still Winning: Why America Went All In on Donald Trump-And Why We Must Do It Again, in a Monday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\nMarlow invited Hurt's analysis the races between Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA) and their respective Democrat challengers, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\n\nYou can't overstate how important this this [sic] race is, Hurt said. I understand people who are so profoundly frustrated with the election officials in Georgia and and the whole process. … [Conservatives'] lives don't revolve around politics in Washington. … Their lives revolve around things that all those things are supposed to be in service of, which is their family, their job, their worship, their kids, their neighbors, their AR-15s. That's what what life is actually about [for] these people.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nHurt remarked, I was talking to a guy from Georgia the other day he was saying, 'I don't care. I just want divided and government. [sic] It's all I want.' Okay, if you want divided government, you have to crawl over broken glass to vote in this election, because that's what this is all about.\n\nIt's all about divided government, Hurt added. If you don't [vote], you're going to give one team all the power. I pray I convinced him. I have no idea if I did, but really, you can't overstate how important it is.\n\nHurt credited President Donald Trump with challenging prevailing Beltway orthodoxies regarding international trade, foreign policy, border security, and immigration.\n\nFor whatever faults you want to find about the [Trump], or you don't like his style about things, he's the only guy that that points out problems, and then Republicans come along and say, 'Oh, okay, yeah, this is a problem,' and then they start to address it, Hurt remarked. I really do mean that. I get why people don't like his style, and I get that there are good Republicans, good conservatives, who don't like him, but this is what it's all about.\n\nHurt concluded, It's all about the fact that [Trump] identifies the problems that Republicans have ignored forever, whether it's lawlessness on the border, or China, or trade, or the wars, or, in this case, election fraud. Of course it is true that this is a problem that has been around for a long time. I don't think we've ever seen the problem as bad as what we saw in this last election.\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
WASHINGTON, DC — Democrats began trying to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump minutes after his inauguration in 2017 and so far have made a total of seven attempts to remove him from office for things such as being impolite to the mainstream media and professional athletes, the Republican Senate majority leader noted on Tuesday.\n\nOpening the Senate floor to the second round of speeches by lawmakers explaining their vote to acquit or convict Trump on the two articles of impeachment approved by House Democrats along party lines, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged:\n\nThe articles of impeachment before us were not even the first ones House Democrats introduced. This was go-around number seven. Those previously-alleged 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors' included things like being impolite to the press and to professional athletes. It insults the intelligence of the American people to pretend this was a solemn process reluctantly begun because of withheld foreign aid. No, Washington Democrats' position on this president has been clear for years. … Here's their real position: Washington Democrats think President Donald Trump committed a 'High Crime or Misdemeanor' the moment he defeated Secretary [Hillary] Clinton in the 2016 election. That is the original sin of this presidency: That he won and they lost.\n\nThe first six attempts failed, but the seventh one finally succeeded, with House Democrats voting to impeach the president and charge him with two articles of impeachment on December 18 — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\n[Democrats'] slapdash process has concluded in the first purely partisan presidential impeachment since the wake of the Civil War, McConnell noted the day after the House majority impeached Trump without a single Republican vote, echoing his recent comment.\n\nCiting previous impeachment efforts in the House that fell short of authorizing inquiries, McConnell pointed out that Democrats had tried to impeach President Trump for being impolite to the press, for being mean to professional athletes, [and] for changing President [Barack] Obama's policy on transgender people in the military.\n\nAll of these things were high crimes and misdemeanors according to the Democrats, he added.\n\nHighlighting earlier pledges from Democrats to impeach Trump as proof, McConnell also said that the December 18 vote was not some neutral judgment that Democrats came to with great reluctance.\n\nIt was the predetermined end of a partisan crusade that began before President Trump was even nominated, let alone sworn in, he proclaimed.\n\nOn Wednesday, there is little doubt the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to acquit Trump, now the third impeached president in American history.\n\nMcConnell noted on the Senate floor:\n\nThe drive to impeach President Trump did not begin with the allegations before us. Here was reporting in April of 2016: 'Donald Trump isn't even the Republican nominee yet… [but] 'Impeachment' is already on the lips of pundits, newspaper editorials, constitutional scholars, and even a few members of Congress.' Here was the Washington Post headline minutes after President Trump's inauguration: 'The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.' … [Democrats'] position was obvious when they openly rooted for the [Robert] Mueller [Russian collusion hoax] investigation to tear our country apart and were disappointed when the facts proved otherwise. It was obvious when they sought to impeach this president over and over.\n\nUnlike the House vote to impeach Trump, the motion to acquit the president may garner bipartisan support.
Witness Meu Peou told a court during an ongoing genocide hearing in Cambodia about a woman the Khmer Rouge executed and ate in front of him.\n\nShe was asked to take off her clothes and her body was cut open, he wept to the court. There was blood everywhere. … [H]er liver was taken out and was cooked for a meal.\n\nThe testimony occurred at a genocide hearing of 'Brother Number Two' Nuon Chea, 89, and the former head of state Khieu Samphan, 84.\n\nAuthorities under these men arrested Meu Peou when he was just a boy. The state claimed he betrayed the hardline communist cadres by stealing rice. He lost over seventeen relatives during the regime. His father starved to death because, as a Muslim, he refused to eat pork.\n\nI had to force myself to eat pork so I could survive, he added.\n\nDuring the regime, Pol Pot held the highest title as general secretary. Nuon Chea served as Cambodia's prime minister, making him Pol Pot's second-in-command. Khieu Samphan ruled as head of state and the president of the State Presidium.\n\nA court convicted the two men of crimes against humanity in 2014. They face charges of ethnic cleansing in this UN-backed court, which includes deaths of 20,000 Vietnamese and 500,000 Muslims.\n\nWhat I want to say today and what I want my countrymen to hear is that as an intellectual I have never wanted anything other than social justice for my country, declared Khieu Samphan at the court last week. I shall shout loudly that I never wanted to agree to any policy that is against the Cambodian people.\n\nThe BBC reports:\n\nServing as chief ideologist, he is believed to have played an integral part in shaping the Maoist regime's radical thinking. Prosecutors say Nuon Chea was one of a small group behind policies that drove city residents into forced labour and starvation in the countryside, and used systematic violence against perceived enemies of the regime. …. During his time in office, Khieu Samphan was the public face of regime and accompanied overseas diplomats on official visits. Like Nuon Chea, he is accused of helping sculpt some of the regime's deadliest policies as one of its top leaders. He publicly endorsed taking measures against the enemies of the revolution in a way that suggests knowledge and support of the policy of executing purported enemy agents, Stephen Heder and Brian Tittemore wrote in their book, Seven Candidates for Prosecution.\n\nLast month, another witness told the court he saw Khmer Rouge soldiers slit prisoners' throats and [eat] their gall bladders. They blasted music through the speakers to drown out the murders.\n\nWhile I was tending cows and buffaloes, I could see how prisoners were killed. Most of them had their throats slit, described Meas Sokha. Two (Khmer Rouge guards) would hold a prisoner tight and another would slit the throat of the prisoner.\n\nHe added, Whenever there were killings, the guards would drink wine together with gall bladders. I knew these gall bladders were from humans. There were many gall bladders dried in the sun near the fence.\n\nIn April, Ouk Him described the murder of a pregnant woman:\n\nOne day, there was a pregnant woman detained at the prison with me and she felt a stomach pain as she was due to deliver a baby. The Khmer Rouge cadre in charge at the prison brought her out of the detention cell, Ms. Him said. After the woman was marched onto the grounds of the prison, in Takeo province's Tram Kak district, Ms. Him said, piercing screams could be heard through the walls of her cell. Then silence. I saw a Khmer Rouge cadre who walked her out come back into the detention cell. Upon his appearance, he raised up his hand with a human liver and heart and shouted, 'Here's the liver and heart from that woman. Let's eat and drink it with alcohol,' she said.\n\nPol Pot led the Khmer Rouge regime between 1963 and 1981. The regime committed genocide between 1975 and 1979, when they sought to install the purest form of communism in the world, leaving one to three million people dead. The country lost 25% of its population from torture, malnutrition, executions, disease, and forced labor.
Thursday while President Barack Obama was hosting a town hall in Fairfax, VA broadcasted on CNN about his gun policy, Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, reacted to Obama's effort on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File.\n\nCox downplayed the town hall and said Obama was not being forthright with his intentions.\n\nLet's be clear what this is really about, Cox said. This president is trying to create an illusion that he's doing something to keep people safe. He needs to do that because the truth is his policies have failed miserably. We saw that materialize itself in San Bernardino when we had a terrorist attack. This president didn't use it as an opportunity to unite this country. He didn't use it as an opportunity to lay out a plan to defeat terrorism. He used it as an opportunity to impose more gun control on law-abiding Americans.\n\nCox next explained to host Megyn Kelly why his organization declined an invitation to participate in the town hall, which he claimed was a result of being allowed to only ask one pre-screened question of the president.\n\nThis is an attempt to distract the American people away from his failed policies, Cox explained. So did we participate in CNN's event tonight? No, we didn't. We were offered one pre-screened question. Megyn, I know that you don't send your questions over to the White House so I would rather have a conversation with you that's intellectually honest than sit through a lecture and get one opportunity to ask a pre-screened question.\n\nDespite Obama having said he would be willing to meet with the NRA in his town hall, Cox dismissed that possibility.\n\nThis president can talk about background checks all day long. But that's nothing more than a distraction away from the fact that he can't keep us safe and he supported every gun control proposal that's ever been made, he added. He doesn't support the individual right to own a firearm. That's been the position of his Supreme Court nominees. That's been the position of his administration. So what are we going to talk about, basketball? I'm not really interested in going over and talking to the president who doesn't have a basic level of respect or understanding of the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners in this country.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor
Following his February 10 use of a concealed carry handgun to stop a stabbing at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, Didarul Sarder is scheduled to receive an honor for heroism from Warren Mayor Jim Fouts.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that Sarder, a valet supervisor, said he was fired for having the gun with him, although using it allowed him to save the life of 52-year-old stabbing victim Stephanie Kerr.\n\nFox 2 that Sarder intervened after seeing one woman repeatedly stabbing Kerr in the neck and abdomen outside the tech center. The suspect in the stabbing is a 32-year-old woman, and police say the suspect and Kerr argued in the lobby, then went outside where the suspect pulled a knife, stabbing [Kerr] multiple times in the neck, back and abdomen. Sarder pulled his gun and ordered the attacker to stop.\n\nHe said, [Kerr] kept saying 'I'm dying, someone help' and it was just natural reaction. I just see this lady getting stabbed. I only had like half a second to think, and I un-holstered my firearm and pointed it at her to drop the knife.\n\nSo MLive reports that Sarder was indeed fired for using a legally concealed firearm in violation of company policy but later rehired. He is now in line for an award. Mayor Fouts said he believes Sarder should have been rewarded instead of fired to begin with, and he plans to show the video of Sarder intervening to save Kerr's life as part of the heroism award presentation.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

President Joe Biden's amnesty bill will try to accelerate the conversion of amnestied migrants into U.S. voters, according to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\n\nWe're going to reduce the time from what is now, what has been [in prior amnesty legislation] 13 years to eight years, Harris told Univision, a Spanish-language TV station January 12. She continued:\n\nWe're going to be tightening up the whole process for green cards, and making sure that we give people a very defined period of time, from the time that they actually apply for a green card through the time of obtaining citizenship.\n\nThe current law says that people who win green cards can become citizens and vote in just five years. Prior legislation also set a multi-year delay — around eight years — between an amnesty and the receipt of green cards.\n\nIf Congress were to approve a seven-year gap between amnesty, green cards, and citizenship, it could allow many of the huge population of illegal aliens to vote in the 2028 presidential election, when Harris may be running for president.\n\nHarris also suggested that Biden's team would try to get citizenship for people who got Temporary Protected Status (TPS) from President Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, or Barack Obama.\n\nThe immigration process is going to be about shortening the time by creating more and greater efficiencies, allowing people who have Temporary Protected Status — and in particular dreamers and TPS holders — to automatically get green cards.\n\nHarris's statement was vague, but her comment about automatic green cards for TPS migrants suggests Biden may push for a law that allows every group of TPS migrants to get citizenship, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe value of Americans' citizenship would be reduced because Presidents would simply be able to give citizenship out to anybody after first selecting them for TPS, said Krikorian. He could award green cards — which permit citizenship — to anybody he wants from any country in any number — it is appalling.\n\nA TPS-to-citizenship rule would further reduce American' power over who gets to be an American, Krikorian said:\n\nIt's a dangerous thing because Congress can change immigration law anyway but that has to be done through a process of debate and deliberation and people have to vote on it, and those people are accountable to voters [every two years]. The President, of course, is accountable to voters but this would make any political control over immigration much more difficult … A president would be tempted to use it for whatever purpose they want at the time. It could be to serve business interests. It could be to serve foreign policy interests, to promote the political objectives of the President.\n\nChanges like this would represent Congress dissolving the American people and importing a new one — [that is] a little bit of an exaggeration, but that's where this is headed, Krikorian said.\n\nHarris did not suggest that the amnesty be coupled with protection for Americans, so the proposed TPS-to-citizen rule would also invert political power in Wahington, Krikorian added;\n\nThe current rule is that the President can keep out anyone he thinks necessary but needs Congress's permission to let people in. This would be the other way around — the President would be barred from keeping people out [by the amnesty] and be empowered to let in anyone he felt like [via the TPS rule].\n\nBiden's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security is Alejandro Mayorkas. When he worked at the department during Obama's tenure, Mayorkas pressured officials to ignore fraud and rapidly grant visas and green cards to migrants.\n\nHarris' promise of more amnesty — and therefore, more workers and lower wages — come as millions of Americans struggle to pay their bills. The New York Times reported January 13 about the rising number of women who display themselves nude to raise funds:\n\nA restaurant worker in Billings, Mont., Ms. Eixenberger, 22, has been laid off three times during the pandemic and was so in need of cash by October that she had to drop out of dental hygiene school. After donating plasma and doing odd jobs, she still didn't have enough to pay her bills, so at the suggestion of some friends, she turned to OnlyFans. She has made only about $500 so far. … Elle Morocco of West Palm Beach, Fla., was laid off from her job as an office manager in July. Her unemployment checks don't cover her $1,600 monthly rent, utility bills and food costs, so she joined OnlyFans in November. … She has made just $250 on the platform so far, despite sometimes spending upward of eight hours a day creating, posting and promoting her content. Ms. Morocco also worries that her presence on the platform will make it more difficult for her to be hired for traditional jobs in the future. If you're looking for a 9 to 5, they might not hire you if they find out you have an OnlyFans, she said. They may not want you if they know you're a sex worker.\n\nJoe Biden's would-be immigration chief says a 'comprehensive' immig. deal would raise wages.\n\nNobody believes that Wall St. cover story – except the people paid to promote it & the estb. journos whose editors don't want them to follow the money.\n\nSee here: https://t.co/t6NqxK7Azv — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) December 9, 2020\n\nUnsurprisingly, Biden's pro-migration, cheap-labor policies are very unpopular, especially among legal immigrants whose wages, jobs, and neighborhoods are at most risk.\n\nMany polls show that the public — white, brown, or black — personally welcomes legal migrants but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first.\n\nIn April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed that 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak? Just 30 percent of Hispanics opposed the border shutdown.\n\nThe polls also show that the public strongly opposes the white-collar visa-worker programs that boost Fortune 500 stock prices by suppressing technological competition and job opportunities for American graduates.\n\nJoe Biden's 2020 plan promises to let companies import more visa workers, to let mayors import temporary workers, to accelerate the inflow of chain-migration migrants, to end migration enforcement against illegal aliens unless they commit a felony, and to dramatically accelerate the inflow of poor refugees to at least 125,000 per year.\n\nMigration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.\n\nMigration also allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, shortchange labor in the cities, impose tight control and pay cuts on American professionals, corral technological innovation by minimizing the employment of American graduates, undermine labor rights, and even get many progressive journalists to cheerlead for Wall Street's priorities.
As the transcript shows, President Zelenskyy recognized precisely the point. He responded to President Trump by noting that [t]he issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty[.]\n\nIt is absurd for House Democrats to argue that any reference to the Biden-Burisma affair had no purpose other than damaging the President's potential political opponent. The two participants on the call—the leaders of two sovereign nations—clearly understood the discussion to advance the U.S. foreign policy interest in ensuring that Ukraine's new President felt free, in President Zelenskyy's words, to restore the honesty to corruption investigations.\n\nMoreover, House Democrats' accusations rest on the false and dangerous premise that Vice President Biden somehow immunized his conduct (and his son's) from any scrutiny by declaring his run for the presidency. There is no such rule of law. It certainly was not a rule applied when President Trump was a candidate. His political opponents called for investigations against him and his children almost daily. Nothing in the law requires the government to turn a blind eye to potential wrongdoing based on a person's status as a candidate for President of the United States. If anything, the possibility that Vice President Biden may ascend to the highest office in the country provides a compelling reason for ensuring that, when he forced Ukraine to fire its Prosecutor General, his family was not corruptly benefitting from his actions.\n\nImportantly, mentioning the whole Biden-Burisma affair would have been entirely justified as long as there was a reasonable basis to think that looking into the matter would advance the public interest. To defend merely asking a question, the President would not bear any burden of showing that Vice President Biden (or his son) actually committed any wrongdoing.\n\nBy contrast, under their own theory of the case, for the House Managers to carry their burden of proving that merely raising the matter was illegitimate, they would have to prove that raising the issue could have no legitimate purpose whatsoever. Their theory is obviously false. And especially on this record, the House Managers cannot possibly carry that burden, because no such definitive proof exists. Nobody, not even House Democrats' own witnesses, could testify that the Bidens' conduct did not at least facially raise an appearance of a conflict of interest. And while House Democrats repeatedly insist that any suggestions that Vice President Biden or his son did anything wrong are debunked conspiracy theories and without merit, they lack any evidence to support those bald assertions, because they have steadfastly cut off any real inquiry into the Bidens' conduct. For example, they have refused to call Hunter Biden to testify. Instead, they have been adamant that Americans must simply accept the diktat that the Bidens' conduct could not possibly have been part of a course of conduct in which the Office of the Vice President was misused to protect the financial interests of a family member.
TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday vowed Israel would do whatever is needed to prevent an economic crisis spurred by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSpeaking at a special meeting he convened with officials including Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron, he said Israel is formulating special procedures to contain the crisis and prepare for from an economic point-of-view.\n\nA steady hand is on the steering wheel. We are meeting on a daily basis and there is a very orderly division of the areas of responsibility, management and backing, Netanyahu said.\n\nI ask that Israeli citizens listen to the instructions that we give, we will work together and will overcome this crisis, he added.\n\nOur policy remains the same: Over-preparation and not under-preparation and above all, caution and not hysteria, the prime minister said.\n\nIsrael could stand to lose between NIS 3.6 billion ($1 billion) and NIS 14 billion ($4 billion), the finance ministry estimated, and that forecast does not account for a nightmare scenario of a widespread outbreak of the virus in Israel, the Hebrew-language Globes newspaper reported.\n\nOne Israeli woman who contracted the disease while on Diamond Princess cruise ship has made a full recovery and is being released from a Japanese hospital where she was quarantined, family members said Tuesday. A second Israeli who returned to Israel on Friday from a cruise ship has tested positive for the virus and is in isolation in Sheba Medical Center.\n\nThe other 11 Israeli passengers were evacuated from the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship Thursday after spending more than two weeks quarantined off the coast of Japan. They are currently in quarantine in Israel.\n\nNational Security Council director Meir Ben-Shabbat, who also attended the meeting, said after that Everything is under control.\n\nWe are constantly assessing risk, he said.\n\nThe Finance Ministry's chief economist Shira Greenberg said so far macroeconomic activity has not been affected by the virus, but the ministry has received reports from companies of potential damage, and in some cases, major companies have already felt significant losses.\n\nIsrael's national carrier El Al Airlines has lost $50 million to date over the crisis, Transportation Minister Bezalal Smotrich said last week.\n\nRon Tomer, president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel who represented the private sector at the meeting, said his organization was working with the Finance Ministry to secure an economic safety net for Israeli manufacturers.\n\nHis remarks came after appeal to the government to help businesses negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Bank of Israel Research Division's latest growth forecast released in January sees the economy growing by 2.9% in 2020, but the bank's governor, Prof. Amir Yaron, said that if the crisis continues, the economic effects will be significant. In the meantime, however, the Bank Of Israel would keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.25%.\n\nGlobal business research firm Dun & Bradstreet found the virus' outbreak on the Chinese economy could cause a drag of approximately one percentage point on global GDP growth if the virus is not contained by the end of the summer of 2020.\n\nA report by the firm found that at least 51,000 companies worldwide, 163 of which are in the Fortune 1000, have one or more direct or Tier 1 suppliers, and a further five million companies have one or more Tier 2 suppliers, in the impacted region in China.\n\nIsrael's tourist industry is likely to be hit biggest, with the country barring entry to foreigners who have been to China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and Japan in the past two weeks and closing its borders entirely to foreign nationals from China and South Korea.\n\nConcerns have also been raised that the virus would stop people from going out to vote on election day next week.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday said the virus did not constitute a good enough reason to postpone the vote.\n\nThe corona[virus] is a big challenge. From the first moment I decided to take abundant preparatory measures that are stricter than any other country in the world. I don't see a reason at the moment to delay the elections, he told Jerusalem Radio.\n\nHundreds of Israelis have self-quarantined over fears they had been exposed to the virus overseas or because they were in contact with South Korean pilgrims who were visiting Israel and who tested positive after returning home.\n\nAround 15 polling stations staffed by EMT service Magen David Adom employees will be set up around the country to allow quarantined Israelis to vote.
Now that Trump has finally turned to the campaign promise that won him the election — build a wall and deport illegals — the Democrats, the media and even most Republicans are hysterical.\n\nJust remember: They were hysterical about Ronald Reagan, too. You don't change history by being a follower, particularly if the people you're following are unimaginative, go-with-the-flow company men.\n\nWhen President Reagan implemented the strategy that won the Cold War, he was opposed by the entire media, as well as foreign policy experts in both parties.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post produced nonstop denunciations of his dangerous policies. There were propaganda movies like The Day After, terrifying Americans about a Soviet strike on our country. Witless college students demanded cyanide pills be stocked in campus health care clinics, on the grounds that Reagan was going to get us all nuked.\n\nOnly after Reagan's policies succeeded did these same hysterics say, Ho hum, no big deal. We always knew the Soviet Union was a paper tiger. New\n\nFrantically rewriting history, they claimed Reagan had merely continued the policies of his predecessors. The truth about their eight-year primal scream is helpfully assembled in my smash best-seller, Treason.\n\nThe Democrats, the media and most of the Republican Party are as fanatically opposed to Trump's ideas about illegal immigration as they were to Reagan's ideas about winning the Cold War.\n\nLike Reagan, Trump has only the people on his side. Unlike Reagan, he doesn't seem as confident that he is right.\n\nSo the people need to be louder.\n\nAll we're getting from the media on immigration is an avalanche of lies, neurotically repeated by people citing one another:\n\nPolls show Americans don't want a wall!\n\nWe're a nation of immigrants!\n\nImmigrants commit less crime than the native born!\n\nStudies show: Black Americans are NOT hurt by illegal immigration.\n\nEvery one of these claims is a lie, as demonstrated in my book Adios, America!\n\nPeople assume a minimal standard of decency in others and think to themselves, Well, Joe Scarborough wouldn't say that if it weren't true.\n\nWhat viewers don't understand is how lazy media personalities are. They are merely quoting what someone told them. They don't know. Their expertise consists of memorizing a set of talking points, like ABBA memorizing the syllables to English words without knowing what they meant.\n\nIf journalists allowed follow-up questions and you could ask, How do you know that? The answer would be, I heard it from a guy at Vox.\n\nThe media go to extremely biased sources; they know nothing, so they're not in a position to challenge them; and even if they were, they wouldn't, because they're on the same team.\n\nAfter a New York Times reporter tracked me down for a quote about the wall, I gave him the following, but he chose not to run it. Why should the Newspaper of Record present the opposition's side honestly?\n\nThere are a million reasons we want a wall, but here are five:\n\n1) The Simpson-Mazzoli Act — passed almost 30 years ago to the day Trump was elected president — came with elaborate promises that it would put an end to illegal immigration. In fact, 30 to 40 million more illegals have poured into our country since then.\n\n2) Notwithstanding the vast number of illegal alien valedictorians, there are also criminals, drunk drivers, drug cartel members and desperately poor people consuming government services meant for the least among us and driving down the wages of our working class.\n\n3) We need a better method.\n\n4) Walls work. See Israel.\n\n5) If we don't get it done now, we never will. Trump is our last chance.\n\nBut instead of explaining to the Times' readers why Trump's promise to build a wall shook the political world to its foundation, the newspaper trotted out campaign adviser Sam Nunberg's boast that he invented build the wall because Trump's mind tends to wander. It was only a dumb talking point, you see, not a serious campaign pledge.\n\nThis is like claiming you were the guy who invented carrying an umbrella when it rains. I'm sorry, Sam, but you're not getting royalties for that.\n\nBuilding a wall is kind of an obvious idea for protecting a border. Not only have walls been used from time immemorial to defend borders, but those precise three words have been used to describe what should happen at our specific border thousands of times before Trump used them, according to a quick Nexis search.\n\nThe current DNC talking point against a wall is that it is a medieval solution to a 21st-century problem! Turn on MSNBC or CNN right now, and you'll hear someone saying it.\n\nSo are wheels. Are Democrats taking tires off their cars?\n\nA roof is a medieval solution. How about Nancy Pelosi replace the one over her house with new technology — like a drone! Drones won't keep anything out, but at least she can see what's coming in seconds before it drops on her head.\n\nMedievalism: 1; Pelosi: 0.
Americans are much more satisfied with the state of the economy and race relations under President Trump than they were under President Obama.\n\nSo says Gallup.\n\nWith the president's reelection reckoning just ten months away, barring some unforeseen turn of events, Trump will have an easy time asking Americans the classic reelection question: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? And if former Vice President Joe Biden is the 2020 Democrat nominee, that question will help to clarify an even starker choice. After all, it is the failed Obama-Biden administration Trump has improved upon.\n\nEvery year Gallup does a survey of the American people's overall satisfaction with the country, and on a number of specific issues. This year, Gallup polled 1,014 adults between January 2-15 and found that overall satisfaction with the country is at its highest level since 2005, and on a number of key issues, Americans are much more satisfied today than when Obama left office — in many cases, by double digits.\n\nOn the issue of overall satisfaction, 41 percent say they are say are satisfied, while 58 percent are dissatisfied. This is the first time since 2005 that number has crept over 40 percent.\n\nHere's the breakdown on some key specific issues, comparing Obama's final month in office, January of 2017, to today — after three years of Trump's presidency:\n\nSatisfaction with the economy soared by a whopping 22 points, from 46 percent to 68 percent.\n\nDespite four years of the establishment media spreading lies about Trump being a racist, satisfaction with race relations jumped 14 points, from 22 percent to 36 percent. What's more, on the position of blacks and other racial minorities, satisfaction rose nine points, from 37 to 46 percent.\n\nSecurity from terrorism leapt 18 points, from 50 to 68 percent; our military's strength and preparedness climbed 15 points, from 66 to 81 percent; crime control increased nine points, from 38 to 47 percent; the way income is distributed was boosted by eight points, from 35 to 43 percent.\n\nOn most every other question of satisfaction, some 20 or so, everything pretty much stayed the same — a slight decrease or increase.\n\nThe only notable decreases were on the (confusing) questions of the quality of the environment — a six point drop from 52 to 46 percent; the level of immigration, a drop from 41 to 35 percent (which might mean people agree with Trump that there's too much immigration, or disagree); and the country's abortion policies, where satisfaction dropped seven points, from 39 to 32 percent. Again, though, we don't know if that means people think abortion policy is too restrictive or liberal.\n\nObviously, this is all very good news, not only for the president, but the country.\n\nAs I wrote last week, there is no question there's a growing optimism in the country, an increase in overall satisfaction, a growing belief we are on the right track. Like I said, I've been following these numbers for going on a decade now, and on the right track/wrong track question, this country has been upside down by 20,30, and even 40 point margins going back to 2006, the last two years of the George W. Bush administration — and except for a few momentary blips, straight through the Obama administration.\n\nPeace and prosperity.\n\nRemember those words: peace and prosperity.\n\nThanks to 9/11 and the terrible wars that followed, thanks to Obama's failed economic policies in the wake of the Great Recession, this country has not enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity in nearly 20 years.\n\nWell, this is what peace and prosperity looks and feels like: job creation, low inflation, no stupid combat overseas operations, low energy prices, stable energy prices, and for the first time in over a decade, real wage increases for working people.\n\nWith their endless racial, Russia, and Ukraine hoaxes, the fake news media are doing everything in their waning power to make us forget that, but the polls show people are waking up, are looking past these left-wing liars to appreciate the actual job the president has done both at home and abroad.\n\nIf Trump can just get out of the way of himself, make his case, pour on the charm, stop the unforced go back to your own country errors, and tweet less, by every standard measure he should be reelected quite easily.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

A controversial policy at the University of Southern California requires students to ask permission in advance if they want speak in certain designated areas of campus.\n\nAccording to a report from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), the University of Southern California recently implemented a policy that requires students to ask for permission before holding any sort of demonstration on campus.\n\nThe legal analysis from FIRE suggests that the policy is unconstitutional under the First Amendment. USC is a private institution, which means they have more leeway when it comes to campus speech restrictions.\n\nUnder First Amendment standards, universities may put in place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on where and when demonstrations can take place on campus in order to limit disruptions to regular college activities and functions. However, forcing students to apply for a permit two weeks in advance in order to conduct all sorts of demonstrations — whether involving a group of three people or one of three hundred — is nowhere near reasonable. Promising students that they'll have the right to hold a demonstration is meaningless and misleading when students are prevented from actually reacting to current and still-unfolding events in the moment. USC must revise this policy so that students are not discouraged from protesting altogether by a burdensome permit application process, and so that students can instead conduct spontaneous expressive activities on campus.\n\nPolicies like the one in question at USC have unfortunately become increasingly common at universities around the country. True liberals should take issue with the reality that students now have to get permission if they want to stand in a campus courtyard with poster boards promoting their political positions. These types of demonstrations have been an integral part of American academic culture, specifically as a result of our country's emphasis on First Amendment principles.\n\nFIRE has given USC its red light rating, which is reserved for schools that substantially restrict speech with at least one policy.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.
Advertisements for former Breitbart Senior Editor MILO's new book DANGEROUS have been banned from Metro stations across Washington, DC.\n\nWashington's Top News reports that advertisements for former Breitbart Senior Editor MILO's new book DANGEROUS have been banned from being displayed in Metro subway stations and cars across Washington, DC. Metro reportedly determined that the advertisement – which features an image of MILO with a quote that reads THE KANYE WEST OF JOURNALISM – violated their policies which ban issue-oriented, political, and other advocacy related advertising. The ads were posted this week and have now been removed, according to Metro.\n\nIn a comment posted publicly on his Facebook page, MILO stated: The Washington D.C. Metro — the public transportation system of the swamp itself — has banned ads for my book. You already knew the mainstream media doesn't want you to read DANGEROUS. Now you can add the government to that list. What leftists fail to realize is that every banned ad, every negative review, and every nasty article about me is a ringing endorsement to the people that really matter — real Americans.\n\nThe policies that the DANGEROUS advertisement purportedly violates are: Advertisements intended to influence members of the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions are prohibited, and, Advertisements that are intended to influence public policy are prohibited.\n\nIn response, MILO stated, Our ads promoted my smash #1 bestseller DANGEROUS just by stating my name, its title, and a quote from the press. We didn't have anything to say about issues or policy unless you consider my face to be a political statement. So I have a simple question for the D.C. Metro. What advertisement could we have posted that *did not* break those policies?\n\nWe were not contacted by the DC MATA or given an opportunity to speak with anyone before our ads began to be pulled down, he stated. We believe that the removal of our billboards constitutes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by a government regulator in violation of the First Amendment and are preparing our response now. We continue to fight to defend free speech against pressure groups that prefer to suppress speech rather than allow the marketplace of ideas to operate.
Jeff Bezos should send Mark Zuckerberg a thank you note.\n\nShares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, have declined over the past two days thanks in part to the intensifying scandal over user data at Facebook. Alphabet's shares have been under-pressure because investors fear that regulators might clamp down on how tech companies deploy user data in a way that could crimp earnings across the sector.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alphabet declined by 0.39 percent, bringing its market cap down to a mere $762.5 billion. Shares of Amazon, which have not yet become collateral damage in the Data Debacle, rose 2.69 percent, bringing its market cap up to $768 billion. So for the first time, Amazon is worth more than Alphabet. The only public company worth more is Apple.\n\nStocks moved slightly higher on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.47 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.15 percent, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.27 percent. The small cap Russell 2000 was close to unchanged.\n\nWarren Buffett's Very Expensive Phone\n\nThis is a head-scratcher.\n\nIn a securities filing, Berkshire Hathaway said:\n\nMr. Buffett will on occasion utilize Berkshire personnel and/or have Berkshire pay for minor items such as postage or phone calls that are personal. Mr. Buffett reimburses Berkshire for these costs by making an annual payment to Berkshire in an amount that is equal to or greater than the costs that Berkshire has incurred on his behalf. During 2017, Mr. Buffett reimbursed Berkshire $50,000.\n\nHow can Buffett possibly be spending $50,000 on postage or phone calls? A very expensive wireless plan, with unlimited data on multiple devices, could run you something like $300 per month or $3,600 a year. It's hard to imagine that he could possibly make up the rest with postage. Remember, these are personal expenses. Could Buffet really be sending out that many Christmas cards?\n\nJay Walking at the Fed\n\nJerome Jay Powell will have his big debut at the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The new Fed chair will conclude his first meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee with a press conference.\n\nThe Fed is universally expected to raise its interest rate target by a quarter of a percentage point, so the actual policy announcement will likely be a non-event. Instead, everyone will focus on what the Fed says about the economy, inflation, and the expected path of interest rates.
According to a report by the Campaign for Accountability, Google has paid researchers that produced papers and projects painting Google in a positive light, including at least one who did not disclose that he had received any funding from them.\n\nPaul Heald, a professor from the University of Illinois, was only one out of more than a dozen who had accepted money from Google, according to the report published in the Wall Street Journal. It is unclear at this time whether the payments had any tangible effect on any of the academic's results. One potential reason for the funding would be to help sway court decisions in Google's favor — with expert analysis to back them up, Google could perhaps try to wriggle its way out of costly legal battles and fines, such as the recent record $2.7 billion fine handed down by the European Union in an anti-trust case.\n\nGoogle told CNBC that they have maintained strong relations with universities and research institutes, ever since it was created from the minds of ex-students of Stanford's Computer Science Department, and that they have always valued their independence and integrity. They went on to explain that they are happy to support academic researchers across computer science and policy topics, including copyright, free expression and surveillance, and to help amplify voices that support the principles of an open internet.\n\nIn a blog post, Leslie Miller, Google's director of public policy, addressed the charges put against the company:\n\nToday the Campaign for Accountability released a report about our funding of academic research. It claims to list hundreds of papers we've in some way funded. The report is highly misleading. For example, the report attributes to Google any work that was supported by any organization to which we belong or have ever donated (such as CCIA)… [Moreover], the researchers and institutions to whom we award research grants will often publish research with which we disagree. In fact, many of the academics listed by the Campaign for Accountability have criticized Google and our policy positions heavily on a variety of topics.\n\nMiller went on to suggest that perhaps the Campaign for Aaccountability was not the most reliable of sources when it came to analyzing Google's work:\n\nThe irony of discussing disclosures and transparency with the Campaign for Accountability is that this group consistently refuses to name its corporate funders. And those backers won't 'fess up either. The one funder the world does know about is Oracle, which is running a well-documented lobbying campaign against us… Oracle is not alone—you can easily find similar activity by companies and organizations funded by our competitors, like AT&T, the MPAA, ICOMP, FairSearch and dozens more; including hundreds of pieces directly targeting Google. We're proud of our programs and their integrity. The Campaign for Accountability and its funders are, clearly, not proud of theirs.\n\nJack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nIn major policy shift, China will demolish thousands of migrant homes in cities\n\nMigrant workers built modern China, and are now being discarded\n\nIn major policy shift, China will demolish thousands of migrant homes in cities\n\n\n\nA rare street protest in Beijing against demolitions of migrant homes and businesses (Getty)\n\nThe mayor of China's capital city Beijing has announced that workers would demolish 15 square miles of homes used by low-paid migrant workers. Many migrants have lived in these homes for years or decades, but now the city is declaring the homes to be illegal structures. The migrants will be evicted and left homeless.\n\nOfficials are not saying how many migrant workers would be evicted by the demolitions this year. However, in general terms, Beijing would like to reduce the population of Beijing by 15 percent, and this would fall most heavily on the estimated 3 million migrant workers living in Beijing, or 450,000. Other reports estimate 8 million migrant workers in Beijing. The larger figure may include suburbs.\n\nIn December of last year, a demolition campaign evicted tens of thousands of migrant workers in just one month alone, so these figures seem to be credible.\n\nSome demolitions had been going on slowly for years, but when a shantytown fire on November 18 killed 19 people, the demolitions and evictions took on a shape that is being described a vicious and cruel.\n\nPeople were given only a few hours' notice before their homes were demolished, and they were forced into the sub-zero December temperatures. The demolitions included small businesses as well as homes, causing many migrants to lose their life savings as well as their source of income. Many migrants had been supporting their families by sending money back to them, but that source of support was cut off overnight.\n\nChinese intellectuals have petitioned the government to halt the evictions, calling them a violation of human rights. Even some state media have criticized the campaign. According to Yi Fuxian, a China population expert, the government has called migrants a low-end population – basically implying that they are inferior quality human beings. China didn't just say this. They actually wrote it into government documents. This is absurd, says Yi. Reuters and Shanghaiist (24-Nov) and BBC and NPR (4-Dec-2017)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMigrant workers built modern China, and are now being discarded\n\nWhenever a large number of foreign migrants travel from one region to another, the reactions of the natives generally range from marginalization to open hostility to violence, sometimes ending in deportation. In Beijing, the migrants are not foreigners. They are ordinary Chinese from farms and rural areas who come to the city to improve themselves, or to earn money to send back to their families.\n\nAccording to China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), there are an estimated 282 million rural migrant workers in China, making up more than one-third of the entire working population of 807 million.\n\nMigrants workers are almost always marginalized and work in low-paid jobs. They are subject to various kinds of abuse, including forced overtime and non-payment of salaries. The vast majority of rural migrant workers are still employed in low-paid jobs in manufacturing, construction, and services. According to NBS figures, the employment by sector is as follows:\n\nManufacturing – 31 percent\n\nConstruction – 20 percent\n\nSales – 12 percent\n\nHousehold services etc. – 11 percent\n\nTransport and logistics – 6 percent\n\nHotel and catering services – 6 percent\n\nOthers – 14 percent\n\nThe millions of migrants living in Beijing, often for decades, were the laborers who built Beijing into the huge metropolis that it is today. Now their work is done, and they are being left cold, broke and homeless.\n\nAlthough news stories have focused mainly on Beijing, thanks to the shantytown fire on November 18, we are apparently seeing a major change in Chinese policy that affects all large cities, and possibly medium-sized cities as well.\n\nThe likely causes of this change of policy are as follows:\n\nBeijing and other large cities suffer from massive traffic jams and massive bouts of choking pollution, calling for a reduction in population.\n\nBeijing and other large cities need to build new roads and other infrastructure, requiring that the illegal homes of millions of migrant workers be demolished. Out with the old, in with the new.\n\nChina has recently changed its one-child policy to a two-child policy, threatening even larger population gains in the large cities.\n\nThere are signs of a great deal of xenophobia between the elite residents of the cities, and the low-paid migrants who do all the work.\n\nThis kind of major demographic policy change can only put strain on China's economy, which is already running on a huge debt bubble and a huge real estate bubble.\n\nFrom the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this split could be significant as the first signs of a new internal rebellion, for which China is overdue. China's history is filled with huge, massive internal rebellions (civil wars), the most recent of which were the White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1805), the Taiping Rebellion (1850-64) and Mao's Communist Revolution (1934-49). The leaders of China's Communist Party (CCP) are well aware of this history, and they are aware that a new internal rebellion is now due, and probably overdue.\n\nChina used to publish the number of mass incidents occurring in the country. The number of mass incidents of unrest recorded by the Chinese government grew from 8,700 in 1993 to about 90,000 in 2010, according to several government-backed studies. The government stopped publishing the figures in 2010, but it is reasonable to believe that the number of mass incidents per year is well into the hundreds of thousands. If even just one of these mass incidents occurred in America or Europe, it would be international news, so the fact that hundreds of such mass incidents occur in China EVERY DAY indicates how socially unstable China is.\n\nSo you already have an economy running on a huge debt bubble, with hundreds of thousands of mass incidents per year, and with millions of marginalized migrants scheduled to lose their homes and their jobs, when the country is well into a generational Crisis era. China's next, massive, historic internal rebellion is overdue, and this new policy could end up being one of the triggers.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is a racist, and unlike President Trump, no one has to lie to prove it.\n\nStop and frisk is not a racist policy. If it's based on an objective criteria of reasonable suspicion or probable cause, there's nothing racist about it. Even if a disproportionate number of black people are caught up in it, it's not a racist policy as long as the criteria is applied equally to everyone.\n\nAs mayor, though, Bloomberg did not apply his stop and frisk policy equally, he deliberately targeted young, black men.\n\nAnd then, in 2015, he bragged about his racist policy to a group of elite white people in a speech he sought to keep secret. Here's Bloomberg in his own words: [emphasis mine]\n\nNinety-five percent of murders — murderers and murder victims — fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it, and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16-25. That's true in New York, that's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of people that are getting killed. You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets. Put the cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods. So one of the unintended consequences is people say, 'Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.' Yes, that's true. Why? Because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is. And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them… And then they start, 'Oh I don't want to get caught.' So they don't bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.\n\nYou are black, so up against the wall.\n\nNaked racism.\n\nIn fact, it's the kind of racism that takes you right back to when Democrats created and enforced segregation and Jim Crow 60 years ago in the Deep South.\n\nHere's another example, this one from 2013, where Bloomberg says the police disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little.\n\nAnd finally, what might be the worst of the bunch, Bloomberg blaming laws against mortgage redlining for the 2008 economic collapse.\n\nThis is wrong on so many levels, I can hardly wrap my head around it…\n\nHere's Racist Mike:\n\nRedlining, if you remember, was the term where banks took whole neighborhoods and said, 'People in these neighborhoods are poor, they're not going to be able to pay off their mortgages, tell your salesmen don't go into those areas.' And then Congress got involved — local elected officials, as well — and said, `Oh that's not fair, these people should be able to get credit.' And once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn't as good as you would like.\n\nRedlining is a racist policy where mortgage lenders refuse mortgages to people who live in a certain neighborhood. Most of those neighborhoods are minority neighborhoods.\n\nSo no matter what the property is worth, no matter how much money you make or how good your credit is, if you live here, we won't give you a mortgage.\n\nIt's an indefensible policy.\n\nIf you believe in individual rights, if you believe everyone should be judged on their own personal merits, redlining is indefensible — as is Bloomberg's wholly ignorant and anti-science comments.\n\nThe 2008 crash was caused by government organizations like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac doling out mortgages to people of every color who could not afford them. Moreso, the crash was caused by a lot of middle class white people who purchased homes they could not afford and then used risky loans on their already over-extended home as a means to turn that home into a credit card.\n\nTo single out redlining is obscene and illogical. The idea that a bunch of inner-city homes, with mortgages worth about half the size of suburban homes, could tank the entire American economy is outright stupid.\n\nYou know, every time Democrats and their media allies attack Trump as racist, they either have to lie or read his mind.\n\nNothing Trump has ever said can be construed as racist, and the Very Fine People Hoax proves Trump's no racist, because if he really was racist, his enemies would not have to manufacture something so desperately fake, so easy to disprove.\n\nBut just like Joe Biden, no one has to take Bloomberg out of context, no one has to misquote or lie about the racist things he's said.\n\nAll you have to do is listen to him.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Over a hundred documents seized in the 2011 special-forces raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan were released to the public on Tuesday, including a handwritten will. The al-Qaeda mastermind made some provisions for his family but wanted most of his $29 million fortune devoted to jihad, for the sake of Allah.\n\nCanada's Globe and Mail reports this document appears to have been composed in the late 1990s and covered money bin Laden had stashed in Sudan.\n\nTwo of bin Laden's top al-Qaeda associates were to be rewarded with one percent of the $29 million apiece. He also set down specific amounts in Saudi riyals and gold that should be apportioned between his mother, a son, a daughter, an uncle, and his uncle's children and maternal aunts.\n\nHe encouraged his family to spend his money on holy war.\n\nI hope for my brothers, sisters and maternal aunts to obey my will and to spend all the money that I have left in Sudan on jihad, for the sake of Allah, bin Laden wrote.\n\nThe Globe and Mail notes another, much more recent, letter in which Osama bin Laden asked his precious father to care for his wife and children if he died.\n\nI entrust you well for my wife and children, and that you will always ask about them and follow up on their whereabouts and help them in their marriages and needs, he wrote to his father in 2008, adding a plea for forgiveness if I have done what you did not like.\n\nIf I am to be killed, pray for me a lot and give continuous charities in my name, as I will be in great need for support to reach the permanent home, he wrote to his father in the same letter, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe AP quotes another letter from bin Laden, addressed to the Islamic community in general, in which he praised jihad as a success following the 9/11 attack.\n\nHere we are in the tenth year of the war, and America and its allies are still chasing a mirage, lost at sea without a beach, he wrote, evidently about a year before U.S. special forces raided his compound, shot him, and dumped his body at sea, far away from any beaches.\n\nThey thought that the war would be easy and that they would accomplish their objectives in a few days or a few weeks, and they did not prepare for it financially, and there is no popular support that would enable it to carry on a war for a decade or more. The sons of Islam have opposed them and stood between them and their plans and objectives, bin Laden continued.\n\nIn other letters, bin Laden said the U.S. was stuck in a quagmire in Afghanistan, much like the Soviet Union before it, and viewed the overthrow of dictator Moammar Qaddafi as a great opportunity for jihad in Libya.\n\nIn fact, he credited al-Qaeda with defeating Qaddafi, who bin Laden described as a truly vile hallucinating individual who troubles us in front of the world. As it turned out, bin Laden was right about post-Qaddafi Libya presenting great opportunities for jihad, thanks to Obama foreign policy, but it would be ISIS that exploited those opportunities, not their progenitors in al-Qaeda.\n\nDespite the sunny outlook for jihad offered by bin Laden in many of these letters, Reuters notes that other correspondence painted al-Qaeda's fugitive leader as paranoid and under intense pressure.\n\nHe warned his lieutenants to look for tracking devices in everything from ransom payments to his wife's teeth. He advised al-Qaeda operatives to remain indoors except on a cloudy, overcast day to evade U.S. surveillance satellites.\n\nHe also exhorted his subordinates to carry out massive terror attacks on American soil to follow up on 9/11, ignoring their protests that al-Qaeda lacked the capability to execute such missions. As one U.S. official put it, bin Laden was somewhat out of touch with the actual capabilities of his organization.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman reportedly bragged to a Middle Eastern leader that he had White House adviser Jared Kushner in his pocket. Kushner may have also violated federal law if he gave bin Salman classified information from President Donald Trump's Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) without Trump's authorization to help bin Salman put his political rivals under house arrest.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday report in the Intercept, before he had his security clearance downgraded from the temporary top-secret level, Kushner had access to the PDB, and he reportedly voraciously consumed information about Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter bin Salman ousted then-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and started to consolidate his power last year, Trump's PDB reportedly contained information on Saudi Arabia's evolving political situation, including a handful of names of royal family members opposed to the crown prince's power grab. Bin Salman arrived in Washington on Wednesday and he and his advisers dined with Kushner.\n\nIn October, Kushner made a secret trip to Saudi Arabia that reportedly deeply unsettled intelligence officials. The Intercept report sheds light on why national security officials were so troubled by Kushner's meeting at the time with bin Salman, who reportedly told confidants that Kushner had discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince. Kushner's attorney's spokesperson denied that Kushner had such discussions.\n\nDays after Kushner left Saudi Arabia last October, bin Salman put many of his political rivals and prominent business executives under house arrest. Three sources who have been in contact with members of the Saudi and Emirati royal families since the crackdown told the Intercept that the Saudi figures named in the President's Daily Brief were among those rounded up and at least one was reportedly tortured.\n\nThose put under house arrest included: eleven senior princes, several current or former ministers, the owners of three major television stations, the head of the most important military branch, and one of the wealthiest men in the world, who has been a major shareholder in Citibank, Twentieth Century Fox, Apple, Twitter, and Lyft.\n\nIt's the equivalent of waking up to find Warren Buffett and the heads of ABC, CBS and NBC have been arrested, a former U.S. official told the New Yorker. It has all the appearances of a coup d'état. Saudi Arabia is rapidly becoming another country. The kingdom has never been this unstable.\n\nBin Salman reportedly told United Arab Emirates (UAE) Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed about his discussions with Kushner, according to the Intercept, and bragged that even he had Kushner in his pocket. According to the report, if Kushner discussed classified information from the PDB with bin Salman without presidential authorization, he may have violated federal laws around the sharing of classified intelligence.\n\nKushner has reportedly gotten so close to Messrs. bin Salman and bin Zayad that he regularly communicates with them directly using WhatsApp, the messaging app that is reportedly popular in the Middle East.\n\nKushner reportedly lost access to his top-secret security clearance because of his secret meetings with foreign government officials and financiers. In addition, officials from at least four countries—China, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Mexico—have reportedly discussed how they can manipulate Kushner by taking advantage of his complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nNational security and intelligence officials have reportedly been worried since Kushner's first days in the White House that his lack of government experience and his business debt were potential points of leverage that foreign governments could use to influence him.
The maroon passport currently held by British citizens will revert back to its original dark blue colour as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, the Home Office has confirmed.\n\nThe classic dark blue design, which was replaced by burgundy-coloured passports in 1988 to comply with EU policy of a single European passport, could be re-introduced as soon as 2019, with a range of contractors currently bidding for its production.\n\nIn 2007, the European Union sought to further dilute the passport's individuality by insisting that the words Her Britannic Majesty, were removed from the first page.\n\nTory MP Andrew Rosindell, who is chairman of the Parliamentary Flags and Heraldry Committee said: It's a matter of identity. Having the pink European passports has been a source of humiliation. It merged us into one European identity, which isn't what we are.\n\nThe old dark blue design was a distinct, clear and bold statement of what it means to be British, which is just what our citizens need as they travel abroad after Brexit, he continued.\n\nThe current contract with passport manufacturers De La Rue expires with the British government in 2019, with the Home Office now accepting proposals from companies to manage £490 million redesign project. Other priorities for the government's new design will include incorporating new mechanisms to combat identity fraud.\n\nResponding to the news, a Home Office spokesperson said: We are launching the procurement process now to ensure there is sufficient time to produce and design UK passports from 2019 when the current contract ends.\n\nThe issue of the British passport was one frequently mentioned by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who pointed out that as well as having the words 'European Union' on the front, it also guarantees British citizenship rights for all 500 million EU citizens.\n\nYou can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com
A woman who claims to have smuggled a pregnant migrant into the United Kingdom has spoken exclusively to Breitbart London, recalling how she was duped into believing that the asylum seeker was Syrian when in fact she was Tunisian.\n\nThe woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity to Breitbart London, recalls how she was interested in the help being given to Calais migrants by activist groups. A girl I had met once or twice was a Facebook friend, she was taking clothes, etc, to the refugees in Calais, she began. I was interested and did a fund raise.\n\nHer story came to light after Breitbart London found deleted Facebook posts from the open borders campaign group on Facebook called Calais Migrant Solidarity (No Borders). The group is associated with migrant violence in Calais, as confirmed by a French police official in early December 2015.\n\nThe original Facebook post was started by a woman who told a story of how she was tricked into smuggling an illegal migrant into the UK. In the post she stated: I have fundraised for the guys in Calais. I have given donations, food, clothes, medicines, and money. I even got talked into smuggling a Syrian woman here who was pregnant. Then found out she was Tunisian. Tunisian women have lots of rights based on French law. The girl and her baby are safe in Norwich and that's good. But I was told it would be a £2,000 fine if we got caught.\n\nHer story sheds light on the relative ease with which people smuggle migrants into the UK, along with the attitude of the activists who may have been involved in pressuring her into committing a crime.\n\nMy partner and I now live in Spain, the woman told Breitbart London, but we used to have a place in France.\n\nWe often drove there and saw the [Calais migrant] Jungle. My partner had little sympathy but I did. The day I was supposed to give clothes, food, money to my friend I had a hospital appointment and I wanted to cancel that. My partner wouldn't let me and said he would take me to the Jungle.\n\nAsked who told her to smuggle the Tunisian into the UK, she replied, I don't even know if I was in that Facebook group. I told my friend (the one I was going to give supplies to) she said there was an emergency. A pregnant Syrian woman. She asked me to help her get to UK. Her [boyfriend] was in UK. She and some others paid for [the lady] to stay in a guest house as she was poorly. She'd hurt her leg whilst trying to board a lorry and was about 8 months pregnant. My friend, let's call her Clare, knew I was going to Calais with supplies. She asked if we would bring the girl home on our return as the person who was supposed to had bottled out. Obviously I was shocked and said it was up to my husband. We did it because she was pregnant.\n\nNo she didn't have passport, our unwitting smuggler reveals, going on to state how her friend also believed the Tunisian woman was a Syrian, and that they had met her in the car park of a Leroy Merlins – a DIY chain in Europe.\n\nWhen asked what happened when the three approached the British border, she replied: Nothing happened at [the] border – a common problem with the Eurotunnel crossing, where large queues can force border guards to fast track commuters. The woman is believed to have slept in the boot of the car.\n\nThey used the Eurotunnel, and she recalls: The worst thing is I was told she was Syrian. She was Tunisian. A mutual friend told us. I don't think it's normal. Most do it for money. So they say.\n\nBut she says she was not paid herself, but rather committed the act out of kindness for what she thought was a Syrian refugee fleeing war.\n\nAll I know about people smuggling is what I have read in mainstream press, she told Breitbart London.\n\nClare got a later boat back to [the] UK and we drove [the lady] to Clare's house where her husband and five kids were waiting. My husband drove. At the time we were happy and pleased to get the woman out of that filthy jungle. I wasn't best pleased to then find out she's Tunisian and was upset when I found out I could have gone to prison!\n\nAsk if she would still have taken the woman if she had known she wasn't Syrian, however, the woman told Breitbart London: Maybe I would have.\n\nSoon after the incident, the woman posted on the Calais Migrant Solidarity group on Facebook, claiming: No regrets, just shocked I did [it] and having nightmares about it.\n\nBut users quickly encouraged her to remove the post and cover up her crime, stating: It can be five years in prison. Be careful. And delete this before it incriminates you. Another said, better to delete, really… 7178 persons on this page! A Facebook user followed up: …and not all of them on the side of refugees.\n\nAs the Facebook conversastion, now deleted, continued, people accused the woman of being a fake who may have catfished members of the group.\n\nWell she needs to stop posting this shit! It's not helping anything or anyone! said one. Another replied: Stop posting about it and delete your previous post, you could be threatening the existence of the group of all we know!\n\nCalais is currently a hotbed of violence and controversy all focused on the migrant camp called the Jungle.\n\nResidents of the town have been evicted, threatened with violence, and it was the site of the arrest of the former head of the French Foreign Legion General Piquemal who participated in a PEGIDA march against the current migrant policy of the French government. Visitors to the Jungle camp, including journalists, are routinely attacked as two Dutch filmmakers recently found out. Even a Shakespeare play, put on for the migrants by left-wing activists, was stopped early due to the activities of knife-wielding migrants.\n\nThis weekend a video emerged showing a Calais native detailing a life filled with iron bars and… Molotov cocktails in the besieged port town, now home to one of Europe's most notorious migrant camps.\n\nI don't know how it happened but one day we found ourselves with thousands of migrants. Actually there are 18,000 at the moment in what they call the 'Jungle'… the police can't even enter the Muslim part [of the Jungle], it is prohibited, said Simone Héricourt.
San Bernardino County Supervisor Robert Lovingood wants to arm all eligible citizens — including county workers — in a bid to prevent or stall another terrorist attack in San Bernardino.\n\nFox LA reports that Lovingood wants citizens to get concealed carry permits, and he wants to see a change in policy at county offices that will allow county workers to volunteer to become authorized to carry concealed weapons as well. And it appears many San Bernardino County residents are thinking the same way. For example, Waiting times for concealed carry permits in San Bernardino County have spiked from 3 months before the shooting, to more than a year, due to the flood of applicants.\n\nAccording to The Desert Sun, the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department received 75 applications [for concealed carry] during the weekend following the attack, when it normally averages 10. By the end of the month, deputies had received 750 applications, compared to a monthly average of 80. And Captain David Teets explained that the demand for concealed carry permits is surging in Riverside County as well.\n\nAn interview is part of the process for acquiring a concealed carry license in Riverside, and Teets explained that the number of applicants has pushed appointments for interviews from an average of eight to 10 months to as far out as 18 months.\n\nWriting in the Daily Press, supervisor Lovingood made clear his belief that empowering the people to protect themselves is a good place to start in the fight against terrorism.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Border Patrol agents working near the Rio Grande River border with Mexico identified five stash houses and arrested nearly 70 illegal immigrants inside. Agents worked with local law enforcement agencies to conduct the raids.\n\nBorder Patrol agents assigned to the McAllen Station teamed up with Homeland Security Investigations and the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office to raid three houses near the border town of Mission, Texas. The combined law enforcement officials carried out the raids on Tuesday and arrested 52 illegal immigrants, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by Border Patrol officials.\n\nRio Grande City agents teamed up with officers from the Rio Grande City Police Department to raid another stash house on the same day. Agents found and arrested six illegal aliens inside the house, officials stated.\n\nOne day earlier, Rio Grande City agents teamed up with officers from the Roma Police Department to raid a fifth stash house in two days. Inside the house, agents found eight illegal immigrants and took them into custody.\n\nIn total, the Rio Grande Valley Sector agents, working with local law enforcement officers and Homeland Security Investigations, carried out operations against five stash houses in two days. The operations to identify and disrupt these human smuggling activities led to the arrest of 66 illegal immigrants. Officials said these migrants came to the U.S. from Belize, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru.\n\nBreitbart Texas reported extensively on the efforts by Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement organizations to crack down on smugglers who warehouse their human cargo in small houses located along the border towns and in interior cities along intermediate stops along the smuggling route.\n\nEarlier this month, agents in the Rio Grande Valley and Laredo Sectors carried out another series of raids that led to the arrests of 227.\n\nMigrants are kept locked inside stash houses near the Mexican border until their journey to the U.S. interior can be scheduled. Often, they are beaten and held for ransom as cartel-connected human smugglers attempt to extort additional money from family members.\n\nThe migrants are now subject to prosecution in criminal court for illegally entering the U.S. according to a zero tolerance policy put in place by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions this month.\n\nIf you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you — it's that simple. If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, we will prosecute you, Sessions said earlier this month.\n\nHowever, the attorney general appears to be having a difficult time enforcing his new policy. DOJ prosecutors and at least one federal judge appear to not be executing Sessions' new policy of zero tolerance for illegal border crossers, Breitbart Texas reported on Tuesday.\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Major League Baseball (MLB) has decided to suspend all political donations in the wake of last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe move comes as several corporations have suspended contributions who voted to decertify the elections.\n\nIn light of the unprecedented events last week at the U.S. Capitol, MLB is suspending contributions from its Political Action Committee pending a review of our political contribution policy going forward, the league told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nOther major U.S. sports leagues could soon follow suit. The National Football League announced that it is evaluating its political contributions, but has not yet committed to stopping or suspending them.\n\nWe are re-evaluating our political giving policies through the Gridiron PAC, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the AP.\n\nUnlike other corporations that only suspended contributions to politicians who voted to decertify, MLB suspended contributions to members of both political parties.\n\nThe Office of The Commissioner of Major League Baseball Political Action Committee has donated $669,375 to Senate and House candidates since the 2016 election cycle, with 52.4% of that money going to Republican candidates, according to The Center for Responsive Politics, the AP reported.\n\nSince 2016, MLB has donated to two senators and nine House members who voted to decertify.\n\nThe Senate Republicans are Ted Cruz (Texas) and Cindy Hyde-Smith (Mississippi), and the House Republicans are Roger Williams (Texas), Kevin McCarthy (California), David Schweikert (Arizona), Steve Chabot (Ohio), Markwayne Mullin (Oklahoma), Adrian Smith (Nebraska), Michael Burgess (Texas), Rick Crawford (Arkansas) and Elise Stefanik (New York), the AP reports.\n\nMajor League Baseball is set to being Spring Training on February 27.
This morning's key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\n\nChina building powerful new radar system in South China Sea\n\nReport: China's military buildup neutralizes America's aircraft carriers\n\nJohn Kerry and Russia announce a new Syria peace plan\n\nChina building powerful new radar system in South China Sea\n\n\n\nAircraft carrier USS George Washington (2008). China's military buildup is neutralizing aircraft carriers.\n\nJust days after satellite imagery showed that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is rapidly militarizing the South China Sea by deploying advanced surface-to-air missile systems, new imagery shows that China appears to be building a an advanced radar system potentially giving China control of the entire South China Sea.\n\nChina has been annexing regions in the South China Sea that have historically belonged to other countries, and continues to use belligerent military operations to enforce its seizures. China has claimed the entire South China Sea, including regions historically belonging to Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. China's claims are rejected by almost everyone outside of China, and China refuses to submit them to the United Nations court deciding such matters, apparently knowing their claims are groundless and that they would lose.\n\nThe imagery is of Cuarteron Reef in the Spratly island chain. This reef is one of those that China has expanded into an artificial island using land reclamation, for the apparent purpose of building military bases. The advanced missile and radar systems would broaden China's control over the entire region, according to an analyst:\n\nIf it is an HF [high-frequency or over-the-horizon] radar, then it would enormously boost China's capacity to monitor ships and aircraft in the South China Sea. Cuarteron is the logical place for such an installation because it is the southernmost of China's features in the Spratlys, meaning that it would be the best place if you wanted early warning radar to give notice of ships or planes coming up from the Strait of Malacca and other areas to the south such as Singapore. This would be very important in a Chinese anti-access area denial strategy that sought to reduce the ability of the U.S. to operate freely in the South China Sea, including bringing forces up through the South China Sea in case of any future crisis in Northeast Asia.\n\nThe US Navy has been challenging China in the South China Sea by conducting freedom of navigation air and sea patrols throughout the region, including within 12 miles of China's artificial islands. This has infuriated the Chinese, but US Navy officials argue that to do nothing would be to allow China to prevent any foreign naval vessel from traveling through the South China Sea, which is one of the biggest commercial routes in the world.\n\nUS Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin is suggesting that it would be valuable if Australia and other nations could join the US in these freedom of navigation patrols. According to Aucoin:\n\nWhat we're trying to ensure is that all countries, no matter size or strength, can pursue their interests based on the law of the sea and not have that endangered by some of these actions. It's up to those countries, but I think it's in our best interests to make sure that those sea lines remain open, I'll leave it at that.\n\nWashington Post and Reuters\n\nReport: China's military buildup neutralizes America's aircraft carriers\n\nCountries such as China, Iran and Russia have spent years and a great deal of money developing integrated systems of surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, submarines, surface ships and aircraft whose purpose is to prevent US aircraft carriers from having freedom of movement, whether in the Persian Gulf, the eastern Mediterranean, or the South China Sea.\n\nAccording to the report from the Center for a New American Security:\n\nOperating the [aircraft] carrier in the face of increasingly lethal and precise munitions will thus require the United States to expose a multi-billion dollar asset to high levels of risk in the event of a conflict. An adversary with A2/AD [anti-access/area denial] capabilities would likely launch a saturation attack against the carrier from a variety of platforms and directions. Such an attack would be difficult – if not impossible – to defend against.\n\nIn order to avoid risk, a carrier would have to operate so far away from the battlefield that the battlefield would be out of the range that the aircraft could travel without refueling. The report concludes that the United States can either operate its carriers at ever-increasing ranges… or assume high levels of risk in both blood and treasure, and suggests that the days of the aircraft carrier may be ending. Center for a New American Security and Washington Post\n\nJohn Kerry and Russia announce a new Syria peace plan\n\nI have to admit I'm totally baffled by what's going on here. Two weeks ago, US Secretary of Defense John Kerry announced a new Syria peace plan, after conferring with the Russians. ( 12-Feb-16 World View — US and Russia agree to a farcical 'cessation of hostilities' in Syria)\n\nThe peace plan made absolutely no sense whatsoever for reasons I gave at the time — Russia and Syria will continue bombing what they claim are terrorist groups, which are pretty much all Sunnis in Syria, and the plan would not apply to the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh) and the al-Qaeda linked Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Nusra Front). And sure enough, the cessation of hostilities collapsed in less than a week. In fact, the peace plan actually worsened the hostilities, since it provided cover for substantially increased bombing and fighting from all groups.\n\nWell, on Monday John Kerry consulted with the Russians and announced a new peace plan — and it contained exactly the same elements as the old peace plan. What the hell do these people think they're doing?\n\nI listened to the analysts, and I heard only two things mentioned that make this different from the previous peace plan:\n\nRussian and American military forces are setting up a communications hotline. That's the big difference, according to one analyst.\n\nHaving been bombing for several months, Russia is running out of easy targets, and now wants some sort of truce.\n\nA spokesman for the opposition rebels says that they won't stop fighting unless Russia and Syria completely stop bombing. Well, they said that they're going to continue bombing.\n\nIn fact, Syria's president Bashar al-Assad responded to Monday's peace announcement by saying that he would respect the truce, except that he reserved the right to attack terrorists:\n\nIt's about stopping the fire… but also about preventing the terrorists from using the ceasefire or the cessation of hostilities to improve their position. It's about preventing other countries, especially Turkey, from sending more recruits, more terrorists, more armaments.\n\nIn other words, al-Assad has no intention at all of respecting the truce, since he considers all Sunnis to be terrorists, including women and children.\n\nAnd then there are the YPG Kurds fighting Sunnis north of Aleppo, driving tens of thousands to flee from their homes and head for the border with Turkey. Turkey considers the YPG Kurds, who are allies of al-Assad, to be linked to the PKK Kurds, who are internationally recognized terrorists, and therefore also terrorists. Turkey has been shelling YPG Kurd positions for over a week now, but wasn't a part of Monday's peace agreement announcement. So who's going to be the first to stop fighting: Turkey or the YPG Kurds? The answer is: Neither.\n\nSo we have a cessation of hostilities which is almost identical to the last one, with the same effect: No one is going to cease hostilities. I have little respect for John Kerry and these politicians, but I can understand how they could do this dance once. But a second time? I'm baffled.

A new study from the University of Washington says that Seattle's minimum wage hike is hurting the very workers it was supposed to help.\n\nThe study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the city's wild hike in the wage to $13 last year caused employers to cut hours, layoff workers, and eliminate jobs\n\nIn fact, the higher wage actually cut employees' salaries by lowering their take home pay by $125 a month, the Blaze noted.\n\nBut that isn't the worst of it. Not only did many workers lose their jobs and others have their take home pay cut, but the study also found that the higher minimum wage cost the city an additional 5,000 jobs that would have been created if businesses could have expanded at the rate seen before the new wage was forced upon them.\n\nThe new jobs could have added up to 3.5 million hours of work for Seattle workers, according to the liberal FiveThirtyEight blog.\n\nPredictably, the higher wage actually hurt the very workers it was supposed to help, according to Jacob Vigdor, UW researcher and co-author of the study.\n\nThe goal of this policy was to deliver higher incomes to people who were struggling to make ends meet in the city, Vigdor said. You've got to watch out because at some point you run the risk of harming the people you set out to help.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com
JERUSALEM (AP) — President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Sunday that the U.S. military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State group, and on Turkey assuring the safety of Kurdish fighters allied with the United States.\n\nBolton, who traveled to Israel to reassure the U.S. ally of the Trump-ordered withdrawal, said there is no timetable for the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria, but insisted it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nThose conditions, he said, included the defeat of remnants of IS in Syria, and protections for Kurdish militias who have fought alongside U.S. troops against the extremist group.\n\nBolton's comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as Trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.\n\nTrump announced in mid-December that the U.S. will withdraw all of its 2,000 forces in Syria. Trump's move has raised fears over clearing the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters in Syria who fought alongside American troops against IS extremists. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nBolton, who is to travel on to Turkey on Monday, said the U.S. is insisting that its Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State group are protected from any planned Turkish offensive. He is to deliver a warning to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week.\n\nWe don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, Bolton said. He said in meetings with Turkish counterparts, he will seek to find out what their objectives and capabilities are and that remains uncertain.\n\nTrump has stated that he would not allow Turkey to kill the Kurds, Bolton said. That's what the president said, the ones that fought with us.\n\nBolton said the U.S. has asked its Kurdish allies to stand fast now and refrain from seeking protection from Russia or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. I think they know who their friends are, he added, speaking of the Kurds.\n\nHe said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford would continue negotiations with his Turkish counterparts this week to seek protection for America's Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nAdditionally, Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who has been serving since August as the special representative for Syrian engagement and was named last week as the American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, is to travel to Syria this week in an effort to reassure the U.S.'s Kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned, Bolton said.\n\nBolton said U.S. troops would remain at the critical area of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region. He defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it's justified by the president's Constitutional authority, adding I'm a strong believer in Article II.\n\nThe U.S. is also seeking a satisfactory disposition for roughly 800 Islamic State prisoners held by the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition, Bolton said, adding talks were ongoing with European and regional partners about the issue.\n\nBolton is to have dinner Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Sunday evening to discuss the pace of the U.S. drawdown, American troop levels in the region, and the U.S. commitment to push back on Iranian regional expansionism. Bolton was expected to explain that some U.S. troops based in Syria to fight IS will shift to Iraq with the same mission and that the al-Tanf base would remain.\n\nBolton also was to convey the message that the United States is very supportive of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets in Syria, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss Bolton's plans before the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBolton on Sunday also toured the ancient tunnels beneath the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City. He watched a virtual reality tour of the historic site and dined there with his Israeli equivalent, as well as U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Israel's ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer.\n\nVisiting American officials typically avoid holding official meetings in parts of east Jerusalem, which is contested between Israelis and Palestinians. Trump himself, however, also toured the area in a previous visit.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem after capturing it from Jordan in the 1967 war, a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians seek east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
The former Archbishop of Canterbury may not agree with professional atheist Richard Dawkins on much, but they align in their opposition to allowing Catholic schools to expand in the UK.\n\nDr. Rowan Williams and Richard Dawkins were two of a list of co-signers of a March 6 letter expressing strenuous opposition to removing a legislative cap that prevents Catholic and other religious schools from accepting more than 50 percent of the student body from within their own faith tradition.\n\nThe Catholic Bishops of England and Wales have registered their displeasure with the law, which they claim unfairly targets Catholic schools.\n\nIn November 2017, the Catholic bishops initiated a petition drive, urging the Conservative government to make good on its campaign promise to remove the cap while noting that the Secretary of State has acknowledged that the rule adversely affects Catholic families. In its election manifesto, the Party had called the regulation unfair and ineffective and recognized that it kept the Catholic Church from opening new schools.\n\nBy forcing Catholic schools to turn away Catholic school children on the basis of their faith, the very principle of a Catholic parent's right to choose a Catholic education is under threat, the bishops said in their petition.\n\nDemand for Catholic schools remains very high, and in December 2016, the Diocese of East Anglia said it would open eight new Catholic schools once the cap was lifted.\n\nIn their letter to The Telegraph, Rowan Williams, Richard Dawkins and more than 60 other signatories—including Dawkins' fellow atheist crusader Philip Pullman—expressed their view that allowing more than 50 percent of students from a single faith would highlight and entrench the differences and prejudices that so often divide society. Diluting the religious population in a school, on the other hand, serves to emphasise instead the common values that we all share.\n\nRichard Dawkins has previously expressed his opinion that all religious education of children is a form of child abuse.\n\nIsn't it always a form of child abuse to label children as possessors of beliefs that they are too young to have thought about? Dawkins asked rhetorically in his 2006 bestseller The God Delusion.\n\nIn that same book, Dawkins expressed his contempt for Catholic education in particular. Asked to comment on publicized cases of child abuse by Catholic priests, Dawkins replied that as horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the long-term psychological damage of bringing the child up Catholic in the first place.\n\nThe letter to the Telegraph could have been lifted directly from the same book.\n\nIt is difficult to bring to mind a more divisive policy, or one more deleterious to social cohesion and respect, than one that allows schools to label children at the start of their lives with certain beliefs and then divide them up on that basis, it reads.\n\nFor his part, Pullman has never concealed his disdain for the Catholic Church, or for Christianity more broadly.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with the Guardian newspaper, Pullman said: I hope the wretched Catholic church will vanish entirely. In the same interview, however, the author expressed his admiration for Rowan Williams, calling him a good and kindly man.\n\nThe question is not why professional God-slayers are attacking the Catholic Church, but rather why the former Anglican Archbishop would join forces with them in this crusade.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

The U.S. Supreme Court granted a request from the Trump administration Tuesday evening to restore a rule requiring women to have an in-person visit with a medical professional prior to receiving abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nIn a 6-3 vote, the Court halted a lower court's decision to allow the mailing of abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol to women who wish to end their pregnancies at home as long as the pandemic continues.\n\nJudge Theodore D. Chuang of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, an Obama appointee, granted a preliminary injunction in July after pro-abortion groups filed a lawsuit.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed the ruling, arguing it would be safer for women to see a doctor prior to taking the drugs because of safety concerns.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in the order:\n\nThe question before us is not whether the requirements for dispensing mifepristone impose an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion as a general matter. The question is instead whether the District Court properly ordered the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to lift those established requirements because of the court's own evaluation of the impact of the COVID–19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic. Here as in related contexts concerning government responses to the pandemic, my view is that courts owe significant deference to the politically accountable entities with the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health. South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in denial of application for injunctive relief) (slip op., at 2). In light of those considerations, I do not see a sufficient basis here for the District Court to compel the FDA to alter the regimen for medical abortion.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, in which she said:\n\nBecause the FDA's policy imposes an unnecessary, unjustifiable, irrational, and undue burden on women seeking an abortion during the current pandemic, and because the Government has not demonstrated irreparable harm from the injunction, I dissent.\n\nIn late April, Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson referred to telemedicine abortion as the silver lining of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJohnson told Democracy Now's Amy Goodman the fact that many states have attempted to include elective abortions among other procedures that should be temporarily banned to preserve scarce medical equipment for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients is unconscionable.\n\nThe CEO of the nation's largest abortion provider said the silver lining of the pandemic has been the launch of Planned Parenthood's new tele-abortion service in which women seeking an abortion have a virtual meeting with an abortion provider and obtain a prescription for abortion-inducing drugs they take at home.\n\nIt is actually a silver lining in this pandemic, that Planned Parenthood and many other health providers have actually been able to really lean into telehealth infrastructure and provide service, she said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has been touting an increase in at-home abortions since its tele-abortion services began nationwide, though many pro-life advocates have concerns about the practice.\n\nSpecifically, mifepristone, one of the drugs used in a medication abortion, is not approved under the FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), but women are obtaining it illegally from overseas.\n\nThis is a medication that definitely has dangers associated with it, Dr. Christina Francis, an Indiana-based OB/GYN and chairman of the board of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told EWTN Pro-Life Weekly.\n\nFrancis said some immediate complications of mifepristone could be:\n\n… hemorrhage, the immediate possibility of infection, and the possibility of failure, where the pregnancy doesn't fully pass from the medication and then leading to sometimes the requirement for emergent surgery for that woman because of either ongoing bleeding or the risk of infection.\n\nFrancis added that because of the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, many women are being influenced by fear right now, and this is being perpetuated by the abortion industry.\n\nOne Planned Parenthood official in New York State boasted in April that the organization's new tele-abortion service is so much in demand that one mother began her drug-induced abortion at home with her children running around behind her.\n\nDr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press (AP):\n\nWe provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance. We provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.\n\nFormer abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino explained in his videos about various abortion procedures that mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, which the mother's body produces to nourish the pregnancy. When progesterone is blocked, the lining of the mother's uterus deteriorates, and blood and nourishment are cut off to the developing baby, who then dies inside the mother's womb.\n\nThe drug misoprostol (also called Cytotec) then causes contractions and bleeding to expel the baby from the mother's uterus.\n\nIn a Washington Update column in May, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins wrote Planned Parenthood's Johnson referring to more tele-abortions as a silver lining of the coronavirus means more deaths — more innocent, unborn, child fatalities made possible by their money-hungry network.\n\nWith Planned Parenthood's tele-abortion expansion to all 50 states, Perkins said, more women will have at-home chemically-induced procedures that carry significant risks:\n\nThey tell women that it'll be simple, natural, safe, and private process. They'll recover in a day, maybe two. What they don't tell them is that they might deliver a tiny, perfectly-formed child. Or that they'll experience labor pains, heavy bleeding, vomiting, or lose consciousness. They don't talk about the depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, and substance abuse that follow. Or the weeks to months of recovery time, usually managed alone.\n\nThis is Planned Parenthood's 'silver lining,' Perkins concluded. Babies who don't have a chance at life, women who are haunted and harmed.\n\nIn September, more than 90 members of Congress wrote to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, urging him to classify mifepristone as a hazard or threat of danger in order to have it removed from the U.S. market.\n\nPro-life millennial group Students for Life of America Called the Supreme Court ruling a life-saving decision and a victory of commonsense.\n\nKristan Hawkins, the group's president said:\n\nThe abortion lobby's misuse of the COVID crisis to force distribution of chemical abortion pill online by running to court shows how little they care about what happens to women taking the deadly drugs. Women have died taking these deadly drugs, and the Supreme Court made the right decision in restoring health and safety standards.\n\nThe National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) President Thomas Glessner applauded the Supreme Court for acknowledging the health and safety concerns associated with abortion-inducing drugs:\n\nIn its first abortion case since Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court, SCOTUS has ruled to protect women from dangerous abortion drugs. This ruling represents a major pro-life victory against an abortion industry that consistently puts profit margins ahead of the welfare of mothers and unborn babies. We hope these federal regulations protecting women will remain in place and that this will be the first of many such rulings to come.\n\nAs the Christian Post reported, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed a bill into law Saturday banning telemedicine abortions in that state.\n\nThe law now requires women to take abortion-inducing drugs in the presence of a physician.\n\nOhio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis celebrated the new law, calling it a victory for life and for women's safety.\n\nAlthough every chemical abortion is a tragedy than ends a baby's life, this law helps prevent further loss of life by protecting women from an abortion industry which puts profits before safety, he said.
Former House Speaker Paul Ryan leaves Congress with one of the lowest favorability ratings a Speaker has ever had, bottoming out at a negligible 12 percent in a final poll from Civiqs.\n\nPaul Ryan leaves office with a 12% favorable rating. https://t.co/MHdynpQTYC pic.twitter.com/ym1ZrMtfj5 — Drew Linzer (@DrewLinzer) January 3, 2019\n\nThe survey showed only 12 percent viewed Ryan favorably, while a supermajority of 71 percent viewed him unfavorably and 17 percent were unsure.\n\nRyan's plummet from the top of the political world into popular obscurity as he leaves government for what he says will be the last time marks one of the most historic collapses of a major figure in the history Republican Party. First elected to represent Wisconsin's first congressional district in 1999, Ryan raced to the top of the GOP conference in the House, quickly becoming a star in grassroots GOP circles and known for the perception that he was somehow a budget whiz.\n\nHe garnered national attention with rebukes of then-President Barack Obama over healthcare, and in 2012 GOP presidential nominee former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney selected him as his running mate. After losing the presidential race in 2012 when Obama and Vice President Joe Biden won re-election, Romney has since left Massachusetts, relocating to Utah, where he ran for the U.S. Senate and won. Romney was sworn into his Senate seat, once held by former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), as Ryan vacated the Speakership of the House for the last time on Thursday.\n\nSince the 2012 election, Ryan had a number of other chances at good political fortune. He assumed the chairmanship of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee in the wake of his and Romney's grand fail of a White House bid. Then, when right wing rebels took out Ryan's predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner, on their third and successful coup attempt and then House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could not assemble the votes necessary to rise up as Boehner's successor, Boehner and other elements of the GOP establishment anointed Ryan as the next Speaker of the House.\n\nRyan's speakership was built on a lie, a broken promise he made to the American people and to the members of the GOP conference: Specifically, he promised he would not run for Speaker without the official endorsement of the Tuesday Group, the Republican Study Committee, and the House Freedom Caucus. He succeeded in securing endorsements from the former two, but failed to earn the Freedom Caucus endorsement even though many of its members did vote for him.\n\nSo, in late 2015, as now President Donald Trump was surging past other Republicans toward the GOP nomination he would win the next spring, Ryan swooped in to take the Speaker's gavel. During his time as Speaker, Ryan frequently opposed President Trump, dating as far back as the early days of the campaign–offering a differing worldview from the president's on key core issues, including most especially immigration and trade.\n\nWhen in October 2016 the Washington Post uncovered the infamous Access Hollywood tape of Trump using vulgar language to describe interactions with women, Ryan held a conference call with members of the House GOP conference urging them to do whatever they wanted with regards to pulling endorsements of Trump.\n\nI am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future, Ryan said during the October 2016 call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017.\n\nRyan repeatedly, over the course of the Trump administration, has taken shots at the president on stylistic and political matters–on everything from the Charlottesville incident to Trump's push to end birthright citizenship.But Ryan did not just oppose Trump stylistically and politically: On major policy fronts, from healthcare to trade policy to immigration, Ryan was a thorn in Trump's side for the whole first two years of his administration–not to mention the rising deficit, increased federal spending across the board, and massive heaps onto the national debt that happened on Ryan's watch under both Presidents Obama and Trump–all from a supposedly conservative Republican who had for years preached fiscal responsibility but failed to deliver.\n\nIn a farewell address and tour on his way out of office at the end of last year, Ryan again spun all these big picture policy and political failures that have marked his tenure in federal office–and his entire time on the national stage–by listing a number of pieces of legislation that saw their way to passage during his time as Speaker. Ryan said in the speech:\n\nTo date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support. And—it is my duty as speaker to say this—nearly 750 bills that the House has passed remain stuck in the United States Senate. But the rest made it into law. We have taken on some of the biggest challenges of our time, and made a great and lasting difference in the trajectory of this country. We began a historic rebuilding of our military and national defense. We enacted new and tough sanctions on some of our biggest foes. We ushered in a new career and technical education system. Record regulatory reform to help small businesses. A long-sought expansion of domestic energy production, to be followed by America's new energy dominance. To stem the tide of opioid addiction, the most significant effort against a single drug crisis in congressional history. Criminal justice reform to give more people a chance at redemption. A landmark crackdown on human trafficking that is already yielding results and saving lives. A VA with real accountability, and finally, better care for veterans. And, after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years. Think about it. We went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive. This is something I worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come. It is one of those elusive generational reforms. It is why we do this.\n\nBut what he leaves out of this glowing self-praise is perhaps most important: He failed to repeal Obamacare, he failed to secure the border or do any big picture immigration deal, in large part because his open borders views were out of line with the rest of the conference, he failed to cut spending, he failed to shrink the deficit, he failed to bring the national debt under control, and he failed to do major welfare or entitlement reforms–things he also spent years pitching.\n\nAnd as such, the American people see right through–at least all but 12 percent of them per this latest poll from Civiqs. And it's not just that poll that shows Ryan leaves office as damaged goods: Gallup, out with a new survey on Thursday, finds Ryan down at 34 percent–a massive drop-off and the lowest he has ever been in Gallup.\n\nRyan's favorability has been measured 12 times by Gallup, including seven times since he reluctantly became House speaker in 2015. Ryan's highest favorability, 48%, was in the wake of the 2016 election when his Republican Party swept both houses of Congress and the presidency. Ryan announced last April that he would not seek re-election to the House, Gallup wrote of its findings. His latest 34% favorable rating is the lowest of his speakership and below his overall historical average of 39%. It has fallen six percentage points since June 2018, including a 12-point drop among Republicans.
LONDON (AP) — Inflation in Britain unexpectedly fell in the year to June, official figures showed Tuesday in a development that's eased market expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates soon.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said consumer prices were 2.6 percent higher in the year to June, down from 2.9 percent the previous month. The consensus was that inflation would rise to 3 percent, which would have been a full percentage point higher than the Bank's target rate.\n\nThe surprise fall, the first since last October, was largely due to falling gas prices at the pump as lower wholesale crude prices were passed on to drivers. Despite the fall, living standards in Britain are still falling as price increases outpace wage rises.\n\nInflation has risen sharply from last June's 0.5 percent, largely because the country's vote to leave the European Union triggered a 15 percent drop in the value of the pound. Though a lower pound may help exporters sell their wares in international markets, all other things being equal, it makes imported goods such as food and energy more expensive.\n\nThe spike in inflation over the past year has caused concern among some rate-setters at the Bank of England. Last month, three of the eight members of the bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to increase the benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point from the record low of 0.25 percent. The rest, though, while acknowledging the inflation spike, thought a rate hike could be counterproductive for the British economy, which grew by less than any other Group of Seven country in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe main uncertainty surrounding the British economy relates to Brexit and what trading relationship the country will have with the EU after it leaves the bloc in March 2019. The British government has only just started full-scale Brexit discussions with the EU and there are fears that the country could end up crashing out of the bloc with no deal, which could result in tariffs being slapped on British goods.\n\nThe pound fell sharply after the inflation data as traders priced in a lower interest rate profile. By late afternoon London time, the pound was 0.2 percent lower at $1.3027. Though that may not seem much, the currency had earlier risen to $1.3126, its highest level since last September, as traders bet that the inflation data would be higher than anticipated and potentially force the hand of the bank to raise interest rates soon.\n\nBen Brettell, senior economist at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said easing inflation, if sustained, could help shore up the British economy in the months ahead as economists had expected real incomes to continue to fall with negative repercussions for retail sales.\n\nIf this fails to materialize the economy could see a stronger second half to the year, he said.\n\nEconomists remain split as to how inflation will pan out over the coming months, largely because there's uncertainty surrounding the value of the pound. However, if the currency stabilizes then the impact of last year's depreciation will start to drop out of the annual comparison and that could see inflation fall back toward target and help support the economy.\n\nBut as with almost everything about Britain, Brexit will remain the driver.
The government of Taiwan is planning to request the purchase of new fighter aircraft from the United States, The Guardian reported today, just as it completes the transfer of two decommissioned U.S. Navy frigates. The move comes amid concerns that the Communist Party in Beijing is seeking to crack down on the pro-independence government of President Tsai Ing-wen.\n\nThe Guardian cites Taiwanese Defense Minister Feng Shih-kuan as alerting the nation's legislature that his government is seeking to purchase more modern aircraft to replace its currently fleet of F-16s. Feng's request for more modern aircraft was a response to a review of Taiwan's defense capabilities recently released by his ministry and published every four years. The review warned that the Chinese government had significantly expanded its ability to attack Taiwan is necessary. China has invested heavily in military construction in the South China Sea, particularly in regions that are not sovereign Chinese territory but China insists has belonged to them since ancient times.\n\nThe fighter jet purchases are part of a greater proposed defense spending increase in the year's budget. The South China Morning Post reports that Taiwan is looking to increase its defense spending from two to three percent of its GDP in 2018, a high not seen since 1999. This would mean spending up to $11.4 billion on defense. Tsai's predecessor, the Kuomintang Party's Ma Jing-yeou, took a conciliatory approach to relations with Beijing.\n\nThe Guardian notes that China is proposing a seven percent increase in its defense spending to $151 billion.\n\nThe budget announcement also featured the revelation that Taiwan was now capable of launching missiles that can hit the Chinese mainland, a distance of nearly one thousand miles.\n\nTaiwan recently expanded its naval capability by receiving two decommissioned American Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates, who began their sail out of American port on March 9. The frigates are expected to begin active duty for the Taiwanese defense forces in May.\n\nThe Chinese government appears concerned with Taiwan's moves to protect itself from a mainland invasion. State propaganda outlet Global Times published a column Friday warning Taipei to abandon hopes of being recognized as a sovereign nation and instead accept the status China insists it has as a rogue province. No soldiers believe Taiwan forces are capable to defend the island if the People's Liberation Army (PLA) launches a comprehensive offensive against Taiwan, the column reads. As long as the Tsai government accepts of the 1992 Consensus, the island's security will be ensured. The eight-year-tenure of Ma Ying-Jeou is the most secure period Taiwan has enjoyed since entering the 21st century.\n\nTherefore, the most important thing for Taiwan is not to provoke the one-China policy. This is the correct political way to protect the island's security, the column concludes.\n\nTaiwan did just that late last year following the election of President Donald Trump in the United States. President Tsai called Trump to congratulate him on his election victory and Trump, in an unprecedented move, accepted the call, implying he understood Tsai to be a fellow head of state. The Chinese communist government condemned Tsai and insisted in assurances from Washington that the Trump administration would not abandon the One China policy, which demands foreign nations also deny Taiwan's sovereignty. Trump reportedly agreed to the One China policy in a February phone call with President Xi Jinping.\n\nTsai, meanwhile, has insisted on respect for her nation's self-governance. In a speech in January, Tsai condemned Beijing for going back to the old path of dividing, coercing, and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan. For the sake of safeguarding regional peace and prosperity, I want to once again reiterate that our commitments will not change, and our goodwill will not change. But we will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation, she promised.
President Donald Trump focused on victims of illegal migration in his first Oval Office address Tuesday night. Democrats — Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — focused on the government.\n\nThat was the observation made by callers to Breitbart News Tonight shortly after both addresses. It was a contrast that illustrated the difference between the parties — and how thoroughly Trump routed his rivals.\n\nThe Democrats' decision to rebut the president's Oval Office address was a catastrophic mistake. Perhaps they made it after the networks perseverated about whether to carry the president's address at all.\n\nDemocrats and the media both share the conviction that President Trump is illegitimate, and therefore not entitled to address the nation without being fact-checked. Their hubris led them into a political trap that will shape the outcome of this debate.\n\nThe first problem was always going to be the setting: no stage can compete with the Oval Office.\n\nThe second was having Pelosi and Schumer appear together. They often repeated the same talking points: for example, they both called the wall ineffective and unnecessary. That was likely by design — prepared by consultants with focus groups, no doubt, believing political messages must be repeated to be remembered. But it sounded inauthentic.\n\nThe third problem was that Pelosi and Schumer failed to talk about the problems Trump raised in emotive terms: the murders, the drugs, the sexual assaults — not just targeting Americans, but targeting the migrants themselves. The victims of the cartels were totally absent from their address. Instead, they wrung their hands about turmoil in the administration. They looked and sounded as if they did not care about the human suffering at the border.\n\nFourth, Pelosi and Schumer failed to bring out their best argument: the supposed cruelty of the family separation policy. The images of children in cages provoked national outrage last summer, and brought the administration to its lowest point. Somehow they failed to bring out that point, which would at least have provided a contrary image to the victims that Trump described. Perhaps they were afraid it would support his claim of a crisis at the border.\n\nFinally, Pelosi did something inexcusable: she accused President Trump of malice. Not only is it unseemly to accuse any president of bad motives, but the word malice has deep connotations in American oratory. At the height of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln urged Americans to have malice toward none. Pelosi implied the opposite.\n\nNo wonder Pelosi and Schumer wanted to debate this issue behind closed doors. They have no case.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

The Daily Beast's Eleanor Clift argued that President Obama's deportation crackdowns look heartless and don't seem consistent with this president's values on Friday's McLaughlin Group.\n\nClift said, Well, these latest rounds of crackdowns have to do with people coming from Central America last year and the year before. And that's because word went out, chiefly from the smuggling operators, that if you get to this country, you can figure out a way to stay and it's all right. So, a lot of mothers and young children and young teens came, and the administration is trying to send them right back. And it looks heartless, and it doesn't seem like it's in keeping with this president's values, but it is the way the law operates. And I'm not sure, the administration could be shifting its policy on this. I wouldn't say this is the last word.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
Former British military officers have warned a new draft Brexit deal means control of UK armed forces could be given over to the European Union (EU) after Brexit.\n\nA new Draft Exit Agreement, announced this week, demands the UK remain committed to the EU's new defence architecture during the 'transition period'.\n\nAs the bloc moves to rapidly expand its coordinated defence capabilities, the draft deal also keeps open the possibility that the UK could be bounced into new defence arrangements during the two-year transition, the pro-Brexit group Veterans for Britain (VfB) explained.\n\nEveryone with an interest in UK defence should be concerned about the 'future defence agreement' in Art 122(2) of the Withdrawal Agreement because it is already mapped out by EU Commission and Cabinet Office (the KitKat).\n\nYour MP probably won't know this.https://t.co/DIc6V6M5OL pic.twitter.com/jevXrfzEpv — Veterans for Britain (@VeteransBritain) March 22, 2018\n\nLt. General Jonathon Riley, an ex-Nato deputy commander and a former commander of UK forces in Bosnia and Iraq, said: The exit agreement shows that the Cabinet Office does not intend to regain the defence autonomy it gave away on paper in 2017.\n\nHe added: It's not wise to stand still in setting concrete and that's what this transition agreement amounts to in terms of defence.\n\nFormer UKIP leader and MEP Nigel Farage commended VfB's interpretation of the draft agreement's phrasing, remarking on social media: People need to know about this. Spread the word.\n\nVfB said in a statement: As a result of a below-radar deal reached 15 months ago, the UK will now be transitioning via a third country arrangement, that provides a u-bend route for the UK to come back fully under EU authority in the future.\n\nPolitical commentators in academia and the media are largely yet to grasp the small print of what is really going on. By that time, it will of course be too late.\n\nPlease do one thing for your country this week: sign + share this petition with friends, family and colleagues. Let's make MPs notice complex structures made 2017 that bind UK to EU defence decisions.\n\nProposed for exit treaty.\n\nUnnecessary as we have NATO.https://t.co/t6QNDEaBUV — Veterans for Britain (@VeteransBritain) February 18, 2018\n\nThe draft agreement, announced this week by Brexit minister David Davis and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, says the UK shall continue to contribute to the financing of many defence and foreign policy structures until the end of 2020.\n\nThis includes the European Defence Agency, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, and the European Union Satellite Centre, as well as to the costs of Common Security and Defence Policy operations.\n\nFurthermore, the EU and UK can reach an agreement governing their future relationship in the area of defence, and it can become applicable during the transition period, the draft agreement adds.\n\nVfB added: The revelations even mentioned EU officials being given a permanent status within [Ministry of Defence] and Foreign Office.\n\nThe UK would be committed to EU rules, policies and structures in everything from space to defence research, foreign policy and the development of its own military equipment.
A Central Valley farmer with whom President Obama met and posed for photo-ops in 2014 is slamming the White House's new water plan, saying he was misled about Obama's intention to listen to farmers' demands for water.\n\nI did have a sense of hope and he could have helped us, Joel Del Bosque told local ABC News affiliate KFSN 30. My focus was just telling him what we do we grow food for the country and we can't do it without water.\n\nInstead, however, President Obama's eight-page executive action plan on water, released Tuesday, says nothing at all about increasing farmers' access to water. Instead, it calls for data collection, communication by federal agencies, new research, and papers — in other words, more bureaucratic activity, rather than more water storage or water allocations.\n\nIn observance of World Water Day on Tuesday, the White House convened what was billed as a first-of-its-kind summit on water. The meeting, which the Fresno Bee reports was attended by California Democrats including Rep. Jerry McNerney and Rep. Jared Huffman, focused on water conservation — but did not address the fact that the federal government prioritizes the endangered delta smelt fish over the needs of farmers, often flushing out hundreds of thousands of acre-feet to sea.\n\nCalifornia's Republicans, who back a water bill that is stuck in the U.S. Senate, did not attend.\n\nOn Monday, Breitbart News participated in an aerial tour of California's reservoirs with the Westlands Water District, noting that some reservoirs remain far below capacity — while others, like Folsom Dam, are already releasing water.\n\nDel Bosque told KSFN that President Obama had missed an opportunity to use the recent El Niño rains, which have filled some reservoirs, to address farmers' needs. As you know we've had more rain and snow in the mountains and those were opportunities that have been lost to move water … I have 800 acres, no crops and I've got hundreds of thousands of dollars of plastic in there with the finest irrigation system you can buy, and I have no water to put in there, he said.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, who accompanied Obama on his visit with Del Bosque in 2014, issued a statement Tuesday praising the White House's water policy, saying the Obama Administration is confronting this reality and planning for the future.\n\nJoel B.

New York City has reached a $180,000 settlement with three Muslim women after they sued the NYPD for forcing them to remove their hijabs for mugshots.\n\nThe lawsuits, which sought to change the NYPD's policy on Muslim women refusing to wear their head coverings in mugshot photos, were settled in Brooklyn federal court Monday, the New York Daily News reported.\n\nEach woman received a $60,000 settlement.\n\nThe cases, dating back to 2012, began when a Brooklyn teen only known as G.E. was arrested for getting into a fight with two girls.\n\nWhen NYPD officers brought her to the 62nd precinct, they instructed her to remove her headscarf. The teen refused the officers' orders, and was taken to a private room where a female officer took her photo separate from the men.\n\nAfter being taken to a Brooklyn jail for booking, officers informed her that they could not accommodate her request because no female officers could take the photo and the camera was in a fixed spot.\n\nThe teen claimed that she felt exposed, violated, and distraught after a male officer took her mugshot photo of her without her hijab while officers and prisoners watched.\n\nThe NYPD issued an order that changed its policy on people who refused to remove their headscarves in March 2015. The resulting policy change required officers to inform people that the NYPD provides the option of taking booking photos in a private room with an officer of the same gender.\n\nIn Islam, it is considered sacrilegious to remove the headscarf of a Muslim woman by force. It is typical for only a Muslim woman's husband or her family members to see her without her headscarf.
In a recent article, NBC News provides an insight into the moments leading up to the decision by Facebook and Twitter to blacklist President Donald Trump. One Facebook executive betrayed the depth of progressive groupthink amongst the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe when they reported said: We don't have a policy for what to do when a sitting president starts a coup.\n\nIn an article titled How Facebook and Twitter Decided to Take Down Trump's Accounts, NBC News describes the scenes internally at Facebook and Twitter before the companies' decision to permanently suspend President Donald Trump from their services. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claims this blacklisting action was not coordinated, but nevertheless, the companies show eerie similarities in their process.\n\nNBC News writes in its account of Facebook's decision:\n\nEarly the next morning, from his vacation home in Kauai, Hawaii, Zuckerberg held a phone call with Sandberg, Bickert, Clegg, Kaplan and other executives. Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, was on the call, along with Neil Potts, the public policy director for trust and safety policy, and Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams, among several others. Zuckerberg said he had decided that Trump's attempts to incite violence and undermine the democratic process were grounds for an indefinite suspension. No one voiced a dissenting opinion, the people familiar with the call said. Shortly thereafter, Zuckerberg published a Facebook post explaining that the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\n\nA Facebook executive commented on the decisions stating: This is not normal. These are extraordinary circumstances. We don't have a policy for what to do when a sitting president starts a coup.\n\nA short while later, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey discussed the best course of action with Vijaya Gadde, the company's legal chief, and a number of other Twitter executives. Dorsey approved a permanent ban, although he would later post a series of tweets noting his worries about doing so and his power to heavily influence the global public conversation.\n\nRead more at NBC News here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) can attribute his success, largely, to the capitalist system he regularly rails against, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday.\n\nParker is spearheading JCN's anti-socialism, pro-capitalism Iowa bus tour, trailing Democrat candidates and spreading the message that Socialism takes, Capitalism creates — a message seen loud and clear on the bus. The first day of the tour brought the bus to Des Moines, Iowa, where President Trump held his latest rally. There, Parker spoke to enthusiastic Iowans, some of whom had been standing outside for two days in anticipation of the rally.\n\nWe also spoke to college students about 20 years old who have been here since 1:00 a.m. and you know they're excited. They're pumped up. There are thousands of people here, and the line just keeps growing and growing and growing, Parker said Thursday afternoon, explaining the purpose of the bus tour.\n\n[We are] talking about the Trump administration's policies and how they have really helped not only small business, but all Americans, ordinary Americans, do well in the last three years, she said. And you know, we see that in the results with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, and we want to spread that message that capitalism and the free market is what creates this kind of environment where people have the opportunity to pursue their American dream.\n\nThe U.S. has the largest and wealthiest middle class in the history of the world. You could even say, in fact, that capitalism created the middle class, so we want to highlight the benefits of capitalism, and we want to show what socialism does in other countries where it depresses the economy, it takes away choice, and it prevents people from having the opportunities that we have in America, she explained.\n\nThe Hawkeye State tour, which will lead up to the Iowa caucuses on February 3, comes at a time when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the Democrat candidates who has openly touted socialist policies, is rising in the polls. He currently leads in Iowa, according to the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nHowever, Parker says — despite his rhetoric — he is the perfect example to demonstrate the success of capitalism.\n\nIf you have an entrepreneurial spirit, this is the opportunity to create it in this country. I mean, look at Bernie Sanders himself. He wrote a book. He made a million dollars because he wrote a book, she told Breitbart News. He created a product, consumers wanted to buy it, and they did. And he had success out of it. He is the American dream story because of entrepreneurism. Because of our capitalistic system, he has been successful. He's the perfect example, actually.\n\nSanders, whose campaign has focused, largely, on the demonization of the wealthy, has defended his own status as a millionaire, telling the New York Times last year, I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\n\nI didn't know that it was a crime to write a good book, which turned out to be a best-seller, Sanders told a crowd during a campaign stop in Gary, Indiana, in April.\n\nHats off to him, Parker said. He even said you can write a book, too, and make a million dollars, and that's absolutely true because of the capitalistic, free market system we have in this country. We can all write a book just like Bernie did.\n\nParker also emphasized the instrumental role the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has played in jumpstarting this economy, one of the primary policy achievements JCN uses to demonstrate the economic success of the administration.\n\nWe played a pivotal role in helping it get across the finish line in a previous campaign called Tax Cuts Now. We really highlighted and helped amplify small business owners at the front and get their voice out there so that Washington heard that small business owners really needed tax cuts, and we got their stories out there, she explained, pointing to the success that those business owners have since experienced.\n\nThey said if they had tax cuts and they were able to keep more of their money, that they would reinvest that money into jobs, expand their businesses, and grow the economy, and it's exactly what they've done, she explained. I mean we have members all over the country share their stories about how many people they've hired.\n\nWhen asked how to address the critics, particularly the younger voters who are captivated by Sanders' socialist rhetoric, Parker emphasized the importance of highlighting the successes of small business owners.\n\nIn one instance, Parker mentioned a small business owner in Pennsylvania who was able to hire 29 people. He also doubled the size of his facility and for the first time ever, offered a 401k to his employees.\n\nThat was a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, she said.\n\nThose are important things to point out when you can directly tie it to a policy of the administration, she told Breitbart News.\n\nNow, the government can't create jobs. They've never created a job ever, but they can create the right environment so that small business, which is the engine of this economy, can create jobs, and that's exactly what we've seen under this administration and the policies that have come out of it, she added.\n\nParker also highlighted the nonpartisan nature of JCN members. They, Parker said, just want policies in place that foster a positive business environment, allowing them to grow.\n\nWhat I find with them [JCN members] is they are not partisan. Their customers are Democrats and Republicans and independents, and what they're trying to do is create a product customers want to buy.\n\nThey are not partisan, but they want the policies in place that will help them succeed and grow their businesses, she added.\n\nThe Jobs, Jobs, Jobs bus tour will carry on through the Iowa caucuses and head to New Hampshire ahead of the state's February 11 primary. Parker is hopeful that they, during the bus tour, will have the opportunity to interview some of the Democrat candidates and discuss some of their policies.\n\nFor now, though, Parker said Iowans, particularly at Trump's Thursday rally, were excited about the economy and how it's working for them.
On the third Monday of February, Americans celebrate George Washington's Birthday, often inappropriately called Presidents Day. Even more unfortunately, this holiday doesn't even fall on Washington's Birthday due to the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill, which pushed numerous holidays to Monday in order to create more three-day weekends. Washington's real birthday does not occur until February 22.\n\nThe sad result of the attempt to create more long weekends is this uninspiring, mishmash holiday that falls between Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's on February 12, and ends up being barely more than a bland, generic February day off to clean house. This is a shame; the Father of Our Country deserves better.\n\nDavid Azerrad of the Heritage Foundation justly called the holiday insipid, and lamented the fact that a celebration of Washington was lumped in with a menagerie of other second-rate presidents. Washington, the 'indispensable man' of the revolution who was rightly extolled for being 'first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,' has now been lumped together with the likes of James Buchanan, Jimmy Carter, Franklin Pierce and John Tyler, he said.\n\nIt is particularly unfortunate that there is not a more proper celebration of Washington in 2016, as the United States gears up to choose its next president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. George Washington set a precedent of presidential leadership and dedication to Constitution.\n\nWashington came into office as a great man: the hero of the American Revolution, a great warrior, general, and leader who had also made himself wealthy through hard work and shrewd business practices at his Mount Vernon plantation. Having already willingly resigned his commission to the Continental Congress at the end of the Revolutionary War, he ended any discussion of military dictatorship for the new country. Washington was aiming for something much higher than being simply one of history's great commanders and conquerers.\n\nWhat made Washington truly great is that he eschewed great man politics. Though the story of the American Revolution can largely be told through Washington's life, he believed that the ideas and the constitutional government that were produced by it were far larger than himself.\n\nIn 1776, John Adams wrote, There is no good government but what is republican…[T]he true idea of a republic is 'an empire of laws, and not of men.' That, as a republic is the best of governments, so that particular arrangement of the powers of society, or in other words, that form of government which is best contrived to secure an impartial and exact execution of the law, is the best of republics.\n\nThis is what Washington, Adams, and the Founding Fathers fought for and dedicated their lives to. They were creating a republic based around the idea of ordered liberty. Washington was undoubtedly a great man, but knew that to establish a grand republic to survive the ages the new country would have to thrive without the perpetual need for great men wielding unlimited power in high office.\n\nThe historian and political philosopher Harry Jaffa wrote in his book, A New Birth of Freedom:\n\nAmerica's Founding Fathers denied entirely any right of Caesar… Caesarism, which became the ultimate origin of the divine right of kings, was accordingly anathema to Americans. The American Founders looked toward and empire of freedom unprecedented in human history. They meant to combine power greater than that of the Rome of the Caesars with freedom greater than that of the roman republic or any other republic of antiquity.\n\nWhen constitutional crisis emerged, such as in the National Bank debate authorization conflict, Washington did not simply mock the idea of following the founding document as some modern politicians have. Washington consulted the greatest legal minds of his generation and settled on policy he believed was in the scope of the the Constitution's original intention.\n\nIt was this adherence to ideas and the rule of law that separated Washington from a Napoleon Buonaparte—another great man who helped topple the French Monarchy to established a republic, but eventually drove his nation to an empire of arbitrary rule. And it was the commitment to the Constitution and ultimately the virtue of the American people that allowed America's founding generation to create an empire of liberty. Washington understood this when he become the first president of the United States. He said in his inaugural address, The sacred fire of liberty and destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\n\nThe great historian of the founding, Forrest McDonald, summarized the importance of Washington in his book The Presidency of George Washington.\n\nGeorge Washington was indispensable, but only for what he was, not for what he did, McDonald continued. He was the symbol of the presidency, the epitome of propriety in government, the means by which Americans accommodated the change from monarchy to republicanism, and the instrument by which an inconsequential people took its first steps to becoming a great nation.\n\nIt should be particularly apparent in the minds of Americans today—after the passing of the great Originalist Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia—how fragile American liberty is. This country as it was founded will not survive if leaders do not commit to circumscribed governmental power. It will be even worse if the people no longer care to hold them accountable and in check.\n\nThis makes the celebration of Washington's life so important at this time.

Highlanders in Poland's winter capital of Zakopane are rebelling against lockdown, with hundreds of businesses vowing to reopen in defiance of government restrictions.\n\nSebastian Pitoń, who has emerged as leader of the Górlaskie Veto — Highlanders' Veto — movement, was previously best known as an architect whose Tolkienesque designs were the subject of a Snopes article, as some people had doubted that viral images of his beautiful if eccentric traditional buildings were real.\n\nNow, he cuts an exotic figure in the international media, holding press conferences in the traditional dress of Poland's southern highlanders as ad hoc spokesman of some 200 businesses which have promised to end this madness.\n\nPitoń, who believes the lockdowns are destroy[ing] Poland and Polishness and will destroy the middle class, small and medium-sized enterprises and kill several hundred people a day if they continue, says the entrepreneurs he represents are this determined because they realise they won't survive another month – so they have no choice.\n\nZakopane is heavily reliant on tourism, and in particular on the skiing season, so has been hit hard by restrictions designed to combat the Wuhan virus pandemic.\n\nThis is our last chance to veto this government policy, which is ruining us, Pitoń has said — and, perhaps slightly cheekily, invited Polish president Andrzej Duda to come down to the Tatra mountains for a skiing trip himself, saying he could become a modern-day Casimir — a legendary Polish ruler remembered as the Restorer for returning from exile to reunite much of his realm a thousand years ago.\n\nWhile Poland moved quickly to ban travel from coronavirus hotspots in the early stages of the pandemic and was an early adopter of masking rules, its lockdowns have not been as stringent as in some countries, and the national-conservative government has announced 1 billion złoty (£196 million) in state assistance for highlanders impacted by closures — but Pitoń has dismissed the funding as scraps and akin to bribing the public with their own money.\n\nI hope our action… will make all of central Europe get off this crazy train which is heading for destruction, the lockdown rebel said.\n\nPoland to Pass Law Protecting Online Free Speech Against Big Tech Censorship https://t.co/TUH7XEjOFu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 26, 2020\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomery
The Supreme Court will decide Friday whether to review the case of an Indiana law banning abortions performed solely because the unborn child has Down Syndrome or another disability.\n\nIn October, the Indiana Department of Health filed a request to the Supreme Court to hear the case of Commissioner of Indiana Department of Health v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana, to rule whether a State may prohibit abortions motivated solely by the race, sex, or disability of the fetus.\n\nAn Indiana judge ruled in September 2017 for abortion giant Planned Parenthood in a suit brought against HEA 1337, a state law banning gender-selective abortions and those based on a prenatal diagnosis of disabilities such as Down syndrome.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Tanya Walton Pratt, an Obama appointee, issued a permanent injunction against Indiana's Sex Selective and Disability Abortion Ban, which was signed into law in 2016 by Governor and now Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe law prohibited abortions based on the sex or race of the child or a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome or any other disability. The law also required that the remains of aborted babies be disposed of in a dignified fashion proper to human remains, rather than merely thrown out in the trash.\n\nTwo Notre Dame scholars published an essay in the journal Public Discourse Wednesday arguing that it is time for the Supreme Court to provide some much-needed clarity to the vexed jurisprudence of abortion, especially by confirming the modest proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution—originally aimed at advancing the cause of equality among people—does not forbid states from acting to prevent invidious and lethal forms of discrimination against the disabled.\n\nIn their essay, O. Carter Snead and Mary O'Callahan note that Indiana law HEA 1337 mirrors those passed by Ohio, Louisiana, and North Dakota and that several other states have introduced analogous bills.\n\nLike other states, Indiana lawmakers wished to curtail the use of prenatal technologies to screen unborn children, which are used to target those with disabilities for termination in a modern-day form of eugenics, the authors observed.\n\nWhile in recent years Iceland and Denmark have aborted virtually all unborn children prenatally diagnosed with Down Syndrome, the United States does not lag far behind, they state, with rates hovering around 67 percent.\n\nThe present state of affairs has induced advocates and scholars to begin acknowledging the negative message that these selective abortions send about the value and equality of individuals with disabilities already living and working in the world, the article states.\n\nIndiana's legislation sought to combat discrimination against people with disabilities or perceived defects targeted by selective abortions.\n\nMoreover, these anti-discrimination laws are strongly aligned with much-admired federal laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which aims to provide a 'clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities,' the authors observe.\n\nRegardless of our nation's polarized views on the policy and politics of abortion, it is clear that our Constitution does not include a right to abort children merely because of disfavored characteristics, the authors conclude.\n\nThe stakes associated with the Court's silence are too high, and it therefore has a duty to correct this error with all haste, the state.\n\nIf the Court decides to hear the case, it will be the first on the issue of abortion since the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe case is Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc., docket number 18-483 of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFollow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) promised Sunday to advance racial, economic, and environmental justice during the new congressional term.\n\nPelosi delivered her speech after the House of Representatives elected her to lead the House; however, Pelosi enters the 117th with a slimmer majority, giving her less leverage against House Republicans. Further, Pelosi reportedly failed to secure a majority of House representatives to vote for her for Speaker.\n\nPelosi thanked Democrats for the confidence they placed in electing her Speaker.\n\nThe California Democrat also expressed praise in serving as Speaker of the most diverse House of Representatives in the history of our country, with a record-shattering 122 women.\n\nPelosi said that now is certainly a time for our nation to heal and noted that the House's most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus. And defeat it, we will.\n\nPelosi said that many of the country's essential workers come from communities of color and low wealth and that we must be there for them.\n\nShe said that the House of Representatives will pursue economic, racial, and environmental justice during the 117th Congress.\n\nPelosi said:\n\nTo build back better in a way that advances justices in America. Indeed the pandemic has pulled back the curtain on and showing and even worsened the disparities in our society. We must pursue justice, economic justice, justice in health, racial justice, environmental and climate justice; the list goes on.\n\nFor instance, Pelosi has promised to hold a vote to repeal the Hyde Amendment during the new congressional term. She said it's long overdue to eliminate the Hyde Amendment.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), who will chair the House Appropriations Committee in January, said in December that the Hyde Amendment is a discriminatory policy because, allegedly, many minority women lack the funding to pay for an abortion.\n\nRep. Jim Banks (R-IN) noted that should Democrats successfully eliminate the Hyde Amendment, then American taxpayers would be funding abortions.\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Coronavirus patients could be chosen for treatment based off of their potential value to society or by lottery if hospitals are overrun, an emergency protocol drafted by Britain's socialised health care system has warned.\n\nThe emergency triage document was first published in the Journal for Medical Ethics in November but is now being sent to National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across the country.\n\nThe document said that when resources are sufficient, then health decisions should be based solely on what is best for every patient, according to The Telegraph.\n\nHowever, the document went on to say that When resources are insufficient, decisions need to include a broader view on what is ethically fair for the wider community (society).\n\nOther ethical considerations are more complex and opinions differ considerably. Some judge that an individual's potential to contribute to maintenance of the critical infrastructure throughout the epidemic may be considered in determining priority for allocation of ICU care, the protocol said.\n\nOthers have proposed that people who participate in research to improve treatments or vaccines during an epidemic should be given some priority for treatment, it went on to say.\n\nThe draft protocol said that in the event that patients were deemed to have a similar chance of survival and level of contribution to society, then a random allocation, such as a lottery, may be used.\n\nThe authors of the draft protocol claimed that the document does not represent current policy in the United Kingdom, but is a research document for the purposes of discussion.\n\nThe national alert level was raised on Monday to 'Level Five', meaning that there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days.\n\nMillions of Life-Saving Scans Missed as NHS Ground to Halt over Coronavirus: Report https://t.co/JlZoLZWL1q — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 18, 2020\n\nAn NHS doctor who has been campaigning for the government to publish national advice on rationing of care or population triage, Dr Moosa Qureshi, said that the publication of the advice demonstrated a failure of leadership.\n\nWe are appalled that NHS doctors are now having to draw up their own guidelines as a direct consequence of the Health Secretary's abdication of responsibility, said Dr Qureshi, referring to Tory government minister Matt Hancock.\n\nQureshi went on to warn that ad hoc policy-making from local teams at NHS trusts will only lead to inconsistency and inefficiency that could lead to large numbers of avoidable deaths.\n\nAn NHS spokesperson claimed: The NHS has been clear that no patient who could benefit from treatment should be denied it and, thanks to the hard work of nurses, doctors and countless others in creating surge capacity and hospitals working together and that has not happened.\n\nHowever, it is vital that we cut the spread of the virus and everyone can play their part by following the advice on 'hands, face, space' and staying at home.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, Professor Neil Mortensen, said that the NHS will likely be forced to delay possibly life-saving cancer operations, amidst the spike in Chinese virus cases.\n\nIn August, a survey conducted by the Queen's Nursing Institute (QNI) found that ten per cent of care homes in the United Kingdom were told by NHS managers to introduce do not resuscitate (DNR) orders for elderly coronavirus patients during the first wave.\n\nCoronavirus: Doctors Pressuring Senior Citizens to Sign Do Not Resuscitate Forms https://t.co/w8iodz1va9 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 8, 2020\n\nFollow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulka
San Francisco police are reportedly preparing for a possible pro-Trump demonstration at Twitter's headquarters today following the recent permanent blacklisting of President Donald Trump's account.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reports that police are bracing themselves for a possible protest at Twitter HQ following the suspension of President Trump's Twitter account last week. A San Francisco Police Department spokesman stated that the department is aware of a possible demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street.\n\nPolice have reportedly contacted Twitter representatives and plan to have sufficient resources to respond to demonstrations and any calls they may receive across the city. A Twitter spokesperson stated that the company's main priority is worker safety, telling the Chronicle: While we respect people's right to express their views, we've been transparent about the factors leading up to our decision last week.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department declined to answer whether or not there was any indication that protestors would be coming from out of the state or how many they expected to appear, stating that policy prevents them from discussing police planning and strategy.\n\nA number of users on the independent pro-Trump forum TheDonald.win have called for supporters to gather outside Twitter's HQ on Monday morning to protest the company's permanent ban of President Trump. In a post on Saturday, one user allegedly advised attendees of the protest to bring megaphones and whistles, wear body cameras, and carry zip ties to citizen arrest violent agitators.\n\nBusinesses near Twitter's HQ reportedly told the Chronicle they plan to maintain scheduled business hours on Monday.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Swedish populist leader Jimmie Åkesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats (SD), is now tied with Christian Democrat leader Ebba Busch-Thor as the party leader with the most confidence of Swedish voters.\n\nThe survey, conducted by polling firm Novus, is the best result ever for the SD leader showing him tied with Ms Busch-Thor at 31 per cent, and three points ahead of second-place winner and leader of the Left Party Jonas Sjöstedt, broadcaster SVT reports.\n\nPrime Minister Stefan Löfven, the leader of the Social Democrats, has seen a steep decline in confidence among voters according to the survey, dropping six percentages points to 23 percent, putting him in 4th place.\n\nLöfven commented on the results blaming the sharp increase in bombings, the high number of shootings and gang-related violence in 2019 saying, It is not so strange with the situation we have had in the autumn with far too many shootings and too many blasts. There is a worry and there is anger.\n\nJust Eight Per Cent of Swedes Think Leftist Govt Will Solve Gang Violence https://t.co/dAZgbOIJxR — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 1, 2019\n\nThen it is not so strange that it is the party sitting in the government that this anger is directed at, he added.\n\nThe new poll comes just over a month after the Sweden Democrats topped another poll taken by Demoskop in which they garnered the support from nearly one in four Swedish voters.\n\nI've long argued that we would become the biggest party sooner or later. Throughout the years we have consistently talked about gang crime, escalating insecurity, migration policy that has not worked and integration policy that has made the situation worse, Åkesson said.\n\n2019 has seen major gains for the Sweden Democrats, particularly in the European Parliament elections in May in which they nearly doubled their previous election result, seeing the most gains of any Swedish party.\n\nThe situation for the Social Democrats, however, has continued to decline, and while the party won the European Elections, it saw its worst EU Parliament vote in history.
TEL AVIV – A piece in the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsa opined that the detention of 10 American sailors just hours before President Obama's final State of the Union address effectively kidnapped the foolish U.S. president himself by casting a shadow over his authority.\n\nTareq Al-Homayed, former editor of Al-Sharq Al-Awsa, estimated that the international incident proved Iran does not intent to moderate its positions ahead of next week's expected lifting of a decade of sanctions imposed on the Iranian regime.\n\nAl-Homayed's article was translated into English by the Middle East Media Research Institute, or MEMRI.\n\nAl-Homayed wrote:\n\nWhen Iran's Revolutionary Guards seized two American naval craft in the Gulf on Tuesday evening [January 13, 2016], with ten American sailors on board, it was not the sailors who were the important point, but the fact that the Revolutionary Guards effectively kidnapped U.S. President Barack Obama [himself only] a few hours before he was to deliver his final State of the Union address, towards the end of his second term in office.\n\nThe crisis of the American sailors [detained by] Iran ended [just] a few hours after their arrest, but it was Obama's speech that was hijacked, since the Iranians deprived Obama of the opportunity to appear as the strong man who had forced Iran to capitulate on the nuclear dossier.\n\nIn the Saudi editor's analysis, the sailors' arrest deprived Obama of the chance to boast of the legitimacy of the nuclear agreement and to tell America, which is divided on the Iranian issue, as is the entire world, that Iran has changed and will once again become an active member of the international community [a country] that renounces violence and respects international treaties and agreements.\n\nAl-Homayed called Obama foolish for trusting the Iranian government. Some may say that the Iranians' conduct was foolish, and this is true – but so was placing faith in the Iranian regime!\n\nHe continued:\n\nHence, the arrest of the Iranian sailors [right] before Obama's address exposed the weakness of the American president and sparked doubts even in those who defend his foreign policy, especially [his policy] towards Iran's [behavior] in our region.\n\nEmbarrassment was apparent even among the White House staff, as manifest in leaks and excuses conveyed by Obama's staff to the U.S. media during the sailors' detention.\n\nThe biggest embarrassment was over Obama's handling of the incident… and [the question of] whether or not he would refer to it in his pre-prepared speech. So what we witnessed was not so much the abduction of the sailors but the abduction of the American president himself. His ransom was the missed opportunity to present himself as a strong president enjoying the legitimacy of achieving the nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\nWith the premeditated intent to abuse the American president and to present his weakness to all, the Revolutionary Guards arrested the American sailors, and in fact kidnapped Obama himself, [just] days before the expected implementation of the nuclear agreement they will not submit and that Obama is too weak to boast of victory over them.\n\nAl-Homayed believes the incident was also aimed at the domestic Iranian audience, with hardliners in the country seeking to solidify their grasp on power ahead of expected economic changes following any major sanctions relief.\n\nLikewise, the Revolutionary Guards seek to tell anyone, in Iran and outside it, that their hand is still uppermost in Tehran, despite everything that has happened to Iran recently, after the wild attack on the Saudi Embassy in Iran and Tehran's apology to the [UN] Security Council for this.\n\nAdditionally, the IRGC's action [i.e. detaining the sailors] is a response that embarrasses the propaganda of the Iranian president [Rohani] and his men – particularly the wily foreign minister [Zarif] and others – who claim that they want peace and openness, as they market lies and corrupt accusations against Saudi Arabia.\n\nAl-Homayed concluded by criticizing Obama for failing to oppose Iran's larger regional strategy, including Tehran's hostility toward Saudi Arabia.\n\nObama's predicament is not manifested only in his kidnapping, but [also] in that he wants to take a neutral stand vis-à-vis the recent Iranian hostility against Saudi Arabia and the entire region. But he himself became a victim of Iran when [Iran] kidnapped him [just] before his final State of the Union address, and wrecked his opportunity to present himself as an accomplished hero when [his accomplishments] are in fact not yet completed.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief.

BRUSSELS (AFP) – The EU warned Poland on Thursday it may take legal action to stop logging in a UNESCO World Heritage forest, risking a new clash with Warsaw's right-wing government.\n\nBrussels gave Poland one month rather than the usual two to address its concerns about the ancient Bialowieza forest or face being summoned by the EU's top court.\n\nOne month was considered the right time considering the urgency of the situation, European Commission spokesman Enrico Brivio told reporters.\n\nHe said Poland's reply to requests to stop large-scale logging in the forest was not satisfactory amid concerns it could cause irreparable biodiversity loss.\n\nThe Bialowieza forest includes some of Europe's last primeval woodland and has been granted protected status by the UN heritage organisation.\n\nThe threat comes with Brussels and Warsaw already at loggerheads over changes to Poland's constitutional court which the EU has warned could merit sanctions as a systemic threat to the rule of law.\n\nSince the populist PiS administration came to power in Warsaw in October 2015, it has come into conflict with Brussels on several fronts.\n\nThe EU launched both the logging inquiry — based on a complaint by environmentalists — and the rule of law investigation last year.\n\nIf the logging case goes before the European Court of Justice, Poland could face fines.\n\nBut if found at fault on the rule of law Poland could face the far more serious prospect of seeing its EU voting rights suspended.\n\nThe Bialowieza forest straddles Poland's eastern border with Belarus and is home to unique plant and animal life, including a herd of some 800 European bison, the continent's largest mammal.\n\nThe vast woodland includes one of the largest surviving parts of the primeval forest that covered the European plain ten thousand years ago.\n\nThe Polish government began logging in May last year, saying it was clearing dead trees to prevent damage caused by the spruce bark beetle, and insisting the policy was entirely legal.
China has begun another large-scale military exercise presided over by President Xi Jinping, the state propaganda outlet Global Times revealed.\n\nPresident Xi, who as well as being the leader of the Chinese Communist Party also serves as chairman of the Central Military Commission, reportedly ordered the exercises during a large Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) ceremony broadcast to 4,000 military units across the country.\n\nAt the ceremony, which took place at a military training base in Northern China with 7,000 PLA troops and 300 armed vehicles, Xi reportedly inspected his troops and ordered them to strengthen combat readiness and put military training in a strategic position, as well as their overall capability to win.\n\nThis is the first time since the founding of the country that instructions on military training have been directly issued by the chairman of the CMC, and it shows that improving combat readiness is now a strategic mission for the Chinese military, Xu Guangyu, a retired major general, told the Times.\n\nThe core of improving combat readiness is to maintain and promote combat capability. China can't copy the US' measure to improve combat capability through actual combat overseas since our national defense policy is defensive rather than offensive, he continued. Therefore, military training becomes extremely important for China,\n\nThe Global Times article also quotes the words of the Chinese military expert Song Zhongping, who claimed the ceremony demonstrated the new norm of military training after the 19th CPC National Congress and it also reminds the military that the world is not peaceful and crisis awareness for the military needs to be increased.\n\nChina has conducted a number of military exercises over the past year, which include exercises on the Korean Peninsula as well as drills in and around Taiwan, increasing fears that they are planning to colonize the self-ruled island by force.\n\nSpeaking at China's 19th Communist Party Congress in October, Xi vowed to invest heavily in the nation's armed forces through the next several decades. The People's Liberation Army, he promised, would reach full modernization capacity in 2035 and become a world-class military by 2050 that can fight and win wars across all theaters.\n\nSome of his military reforms have included the restructuring of managerial authority across the PLA, as well as retiring a number long-serving generals and replacing them with younger officers more supportive of his leadership. Some analysts see his control of the military as even tighter than that of former dictator Mao Zedong.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel stood firm Monday on her refugee policy, despite a drubbing in regional elections described as a debacle in which disgruntled voters turned to the anti-migrant AfD.\n\nMerkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was at the receiving end of voter anger, suffering defeats in two out of three states in Sunday's elections — including in traditional stronghold Baden-Wuerttemberg.\n\nThe stinging result for the conservative CDU was accompanied by a surge in backing for the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), which had sparked outrage by suggesting police may have to shoot at migrants to stop them entering the country.\n\nAfD's double-digit score in all three states indicates that the public outrage fuelling far-right movements such as France's National Front and Austria's Freedom Party has also gained a firm foothold in Germany.\n\nSunday's elections were the biggest since Germany registered a record influx of asylum seekers that reached 1.1 million in 2015, and the vote was largely regarded as a referendum on Merkel's decision to open the doors to people fleeing war.\n\nThe mass-circulation Bild newspaper described it as a day of horror for Merkel, as calls multiplied for her to change tack.\n\nWhile acknowledging that some had cast protest votes, the German leader refused to change her position.\n\nI think that the approach is correct, she told journalists, reiterating her strategy of a common European policy to bolster the security of the EU's external borders and cooperate with Turkey to stem refugee flows.\n\n– 'We need clarity' –\n\nEven though she admitted that Balkan states had done Germany a favour by closing their borders to migrants — a move that led to a significant drop in new arrivals — Merkel insisted just days ahead of an EU summit that we can see from pictures out of Greece that that is not a sustainable solution.\n\nMerkel is increasingly isolated on the European stage as she has refused to impose a cap on arrivals, a decision that is irritating her neighbours who say it encourages migrants to keep coming.\n\nAhead of Thursday's summit in Brussels, when leaders are due to finalise a deal with Turkey on stemming the migrant influx, Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said Merkel must stress that Germany is no longer willing to take in an unlimited number of refugees.\n\nWe need clarity. Everyone must know that it is a false hope to think that Germany would simply wave people in, he told Die Welt daily.\n\nMerkel's strident critics in the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, also piled on the pressure after the regional polls, which serve as a key test ahead of general elections in 2017.\n\nThe main reason for the poor CDU showing is the refugee policy. It makes no sense at all, CSU chief Horst Seehofer said at a party meeting on Monday.\n\nDemanding changes, Seehofer said: It can't be that after such an election result, the answer to the electorate is: everything will go on as before.\n\n– 'Black Sunday' –\n\nIn the aftermath of the vote described as Black Sunday for the CDU by news website Spiegel Online, Merkel also came in for criticism for unwittingly allowing the AfD to flourish.\n\nFor most of the past decade, Merkel enjoyed stellar popularity ratings as she pushed middle-ground policies which helped her party capture voters from the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). But critics say it has left her conservatives' right flank exposed.\n\nIn Sunday's vote, the AfD gained as many as one in four votes in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, emerging as the second biggest party there.\n\nAfD leader Frauke Petry called it a good day for democracy while Austria's Freedom Party hailed the German party's success as a win against the EU juggernaut.\n\nNevertheless, the irony is that Sunday's polls showed there is no obvious successor to Merkel, as the CDU's biggest mainstream challenger and junior coalition partner — the SPD — emerged weakened in two out of three states where it came in behind AfD.\n\nAnd Julia Kloeckner, touted previously as a possible CDU successor to Merkel, failed to lift the party to a win in Rhineland-Palatinate with a campaign that challenged Berlin's line on asylum.\n\nEven Seehofer acknowledged that Merkel was still the right chancellor, while the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung questioned who had the clout to force her to reverse her stance on refugees.\n\nThe party has less choice than ever for its succession, it noted.

Twitter announced it shut down more than 125,000 pro-terrorism accounts primarily linked to the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).\n\nLike most people around the world, we are horrified by the atrocities perpetrated by extremist groups, the social media firm said in a blog post tweeted from its account. We condemn the use of Twitter to promote terrorism.\n\nSince mid-2015, we have suspended over 125,000 accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist acts. Read more here: https://t.co/FQJeOTtPLz — Policy (@policy) February 5, 2016\n\nAs the nature of the terrorist threat has changed, so has our ongoing work in this area, it added. Since the middle of 2015 alone, we've suspended over 125,000 accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist acts, primarily related to ISIS.\n\nTwitter said its rules make clear that such acts, or any violent threat, are not permitted on its service.\n\nBy shutting down thousands of terrorism-related accounts, the firm said it has joined the fight against ISIS and other jihadist groups.\n\nThe social media platform claimed it has increased the size of the teams used to screen accounts for possible links to terrorist activity in an effort to rebut criticism that it needs to do more to counter extremism on its platform, notes The Washington Post.\n\nWe have increased the size of the teams that review reports [of terrorist activity], reducing our response time significantly. We also look into other accounts similar to those reported and leverage proprietary spam-fighting tools to surface other potentially violating accounts for review by our agents, said the company. We have already seen results, including an increase in account suspensions and this type of activity shifting off of Twitter.\n\nThe social media firm has been under pressure by the Obama administration and groups that track jihadi activity online to take more action to counter violent extremism on the Internet, including ISIS propaganda.\n\nTwitter said it cooperates with government entities and NGOs working to fight extremist content online.\n\nUnited Press International (UPI) reports, The company's announcement comes less than a month after White House officials and tech company executives discussed methods for combatting terrorist use of social media to recruit and expand their influence.\n\nPositioning itself as a defender of freedom of speech, the firm said, We have always sought to strike a balance between the enforcement of our own Twitter Rules covering prohibited behaviors, the legitimate needs of law enforcement, and the ability of users to share their views freely – including views that some people may disagree with or find offensive.\n\nThere is no 'magic algorithm' for identifying terrorist content on the Internet, so global online platforms are forced to make challenging judgement calls based on very limited information and guidance, it added.\n\nBrett McGurk, President Obama's special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, expressed his support for Twitter's actions soon after the social media's announcement.\n\nHere's how anyone can report an #ISIL propaganda account to #Twitter in 6 easy steps, via invaluable @sawabcenter. https://t.co/2dKFWiS7ZQ — Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) February 5, 2016\n\nIn January, the widow of a military contractor killed in terrorist attack in Amman last November sued Twitter, alleging that Twitter knowingly permitted the terrorist group ISIS to use its social network as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits, reports the Post.\n\nThe Florida woman is seeking damages for allegedly violating the Anti-Terrorism Act by providing material support to terrorists, adds the report. Her civil suit was filed in federal court in Oakland, Calif. Though national security lawyers say her case is unlikely to succeed, it has increased the pressure on social media companies to remove posts linked to terrorism.\n\nTwitter reportedly began carrying out mass suspensions of accounts linked to ISIS and other terrorism groups in early 2014, shutting down 10,000 accounts last April over a 24-hour span.\n\nAn agenda obtained by The Washington Post revealed that an unusually large gathering of President Obama's top national security officials last month, including the attorney general and FBI director, met with tech firm senior executives in Silicon Valley to discuss ways to use technology to disrupt paths to radicalization to violence and identify recruitment patterns as well as to measure efforts to countering radicalization.\n\nThe gathering followed the president's televised call after the deadly San Bernardino, Calif. shootings last December for tech leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.
Nashville Public Library officials informed Nashville's chapter of Black Lives Matter members that the group's open to black and non-black people of color only meetings policy is prohibited on public property.\n\nThe library didn't cancel anyone's meeting, library spokeswoman Emily Waltenbaugh said after Black Lives Matter members moved their Saturday meeting to a church located a mile away.

White supremacy won't stop this movement. pic.twitter.com/HpbmMjVnT9 — BLM Nashville (@BLM_Nashville) February 19, 2016\n\nCrutchfield continued to make it clear that his Black Lives Matter chapter just wants to hold meetings in what he calls black only or non-white safe spaces.\n\nLet's be clear: @BLM_Nashville meetings are safe spaces for black folks and non-black POC. — Joshua (@Crutch4) February 19, 2016\n\nBlack Lives Matter Nashville released the following statement on its website:\n\nAfter several months of meeting at the North Branch library, on Wednesday (2/19), the Nashville Chapter of Black Lives Matter was contacted through email and by phone that library administrators received complaints regarding BLM's policy of general meetings being open to black and non-black people of color only. Although meeting rooms are available to local organizations for use of a cultural nature, we were informed that due to the library policy of open meetings for meeting room use, all future meetings held at the library would be cancelled. Ironically, all cancelled dates were in February during Black History Month. The Nashville Chapter of BLM has this policy in place to center the voices and experiences of people of color that have historically been excluded or segregated within supposedly public spaces. Black and/or people of color only spaces are often questioned and viewed with suspicion, though there is seldom any interrogation of white-only board rooms and staffs. However, we view these spaces as integral to healing and community building, particularly to those who have experienced racialized violence and ardently maintain this policy as imperative to the work and mission of BLM.\n\nWe understand and even honor the importance of the library as an invaluable site of accessible information, community events, and safe space, often especially for disenfranchised people without homes and people of color, but if it cannot or will not support our values we will continue to meet elsewhere. The decision has outraged Black Lives Mattermembers. But Nashville Public Library officials said they're following a library policy that specifies all meetings at their facilities must be open to the public and news media.\n\nWaltenbaugh insisted that her staff did not intend to cause controversy. She said library policy must be enforced to ensure fairness for all community members, regardless of race.\n\nThe Nashville Public Library system is committed to civil rights and has a department devoted to the topic, Waltenbaugh said.\n\nFollow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.
NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel argued that under the Obama administration we had quite a bit of an inconsistent policy towards the Middle East on Friday's broadcast of HBO's Real Time.\n\nEngel began by saying that ISIS is undoubtedly a creation of the Iraq War, and the Bush administration's military actions broke the Middle East's status quo unleashed a lot of demons that had been pent up inside the region.\n\nHe added, And then, over the last, very soon to be eight years, of this administration, we had quite a bit of an inconsistent policy. And what we've been left with is that old status quo is totally destroyed. All of the demons are out, and it's represented by ISIS, which is this kind of primordial ooze, that had always been there, and has been unleashed.\n\nEngel further stated that ISIS would eventually go away.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
WASHINGTON D.C. — Socialist Latin American nations and small Caribbean island states that benefit from Venezuela's oil supply have expressed disdain towards U.S.-backed efforts by the Organization of American States (OAS) to find a solution to Venezuela's political and humanitarian crisis, reminding member states of the international body's non-intervention policy.\n\nDuring a meeting of foreign ministers from the 34-nation bloc OAS to consider the deepening concern of the member states regarding the ongoing situation in Venezuela, socialist Nicaragua and Bolivia as well as the Caribbean countries of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines suggested that the international body should stay out of the crisis and allow the Venezuelan people and government of socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro to resolve the issue.\n\nTom Shannon, the U.S. State Department's undersecretary for political affairs, condemned Maduro's actions, namely the socialist dictator's crackdown on peaceful protests and dissent.\n\nOur goal is to return to full respect for the rule of law, full respect for freedoms of political expression and participation, said the American official at Thursday's OAS meeting, joining other member states in calling for urgent action to alleviate the crisis.\n\nThe collective commitment to promote and consolidate democracy that we the nations of the Americas have enshrined in core OAS instruments remains a model for other regions in the world, Shannon continued. Today is an opportunity for us to demonstrate this commitment remains alive and well and relevant to the current plight of our Venezuelan neighbors.\n\nNevertheless, member states agreed to postpone the meeting to a later date in June after nearly five hours of discussion.\n\nThe meeting came as anti-Maduro protests raged in Venezuela. Food and medicine are also scarce while inflation is believed to be in the triple digits following four years of recession, fueled by failing socialist economic policies and the decline in global oil prices.\n\nCiting economists Orlando Ochoa and José Guerra, Venezuela's El Nacional reported in March that the Maduro government counts on the support at the OAS of small islands of the Caribbean that benefit from the supply of Venezuelan crude oil.\n\nThese Caribbean nations are Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Haiti, added the news outlet.\n\nOchoa was proven to be right at the OAS meeting on Thursday. Socialist Nicaragua, a staunch ally of Venezuela, has also benefitted from Venezuelan's oil supplies.\n\nThe representative of Nicaragua expressed the Central American countries opposition to the meeting altogether, arguing that Venezuela is the victim of a political lynching.\n\nNicaragua condemned and rejected the attempt to ''subvert the rights'' of a sovereign country, declared the country's diplomat Luis Alvarado.\n\nWe demand the end of the political lynching,'' added Alvarado.''Nothing can be imposed on the great and sovereign nation of Venezuela. It is absolutely essential that these actions cease.''\n\nNothing we do will be useful without Venezuela's participation and involvement, noted Alvarado.\n\nVenezuela did not attend the meeting and has begun the process to withdraw from the OAS alliance altogether.\n\nEchoing the Nicaraguan diplomat, Bolivia's Foreign Minister Fernando Huanacuni Mamani accused the OAS of choosing ''aggression'' and confrontation over dialogue.\n\nBolivia is a member of the socialist Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, known by the acronym ALBA for its name in Spanish.\n\nDr. Everson Hull, the representative for Saint Kitts and Nevis, stressed constraints in the form of OAS policies that allegedly prevent the international body from intervening in chaos-ridden Venezuela.\n\nWe are duty bound to respect the provision set forth in the OAS charter, which is very explicit with respects to the constraints to which we are subjected as we seek to fashion a solution [to the situation in Venezuela, said Dr. Hull.\n\nQuoting the OAS charter, he reminded the member states,The Organization of American States has no powers other than those expressly conferred upon it by this charter, none of whose provisions authorizes it to intervene in matters that are within the internal jurisdiction of the member states.\n\nThe representative of Antigua and Barbuda said his country also opposed the convocation of Thursday's meeting to find a solution to Venezuela's problems.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda did not agree with the convocation of this meeting because we are committed to the principle of non-intervention as set out in the charter of the OAS, declared Ronald Sanders.\n\nThe ambassador for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines also highlighted the OAS's non-intervention policy.\n\nAmb. Lou-Anne Gaylene Gilchrist, said, The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expresses its outstanding respects for the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention.
Because science is the pursuit of knowledge, and political actions almost necessarily restrict personal freedom, science, laws, and regulations should use the best available data. Using bad data undermines both the pursuit of truth and the legitimate justification of laws and regulations.\n\nEveryone, from the far left to the far right on the political spectrum, should be able to agree about this.\n\nSadly, in the field of climate research and climate policy, good data, when not ignored entirely, is increasingly twisted to fit the narrative claiming that humans are causing a climate crisis. Climate action partisans, in pursuit of political power and ever increasing resources, force data to fit their delusion that humans must forego modern, industrial civilization to save humanity and the earth from climate doom.\n\nThis problem is more than evident in a recent report from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on global temperature trends. Between them, the two agencies operate the most accurate, comprehensive system of temperature measuring instruments in the world. But rather than cite data from their best sources when NASA and NOAA reported global temperatures on January 15, they chose to use severely compromised data from temperature readings adjusted—in a process called homogenization—they and others gathered from biased monitoring stations.\n\nNASA and NOAA announced that 2019 was the second warmest year since modern record keeping began in 1880, helping to make the 2010s the warmest decade on record.\n\nThese claims are based on the utterly unreliable adjusted temperature measurements recorded by surface temperature stations scattered across the globe. These measurements, at least the raw data from them, are usually sufficiently accurate to inform local inhabitants of the temperature and weather anomalies in their area on a particular day, but as measures of actual trends telling us something important about whether humans are causing global warming, most of them are virtually worthless.\n\nAs has been hammered home repeatedly over the years by meteorologist Anthony Watts (who is also a Senior Fellow with The Heartland Institute), many of the monitoring stations throughout the United States fail to meet the standards established by the agencies themselves for reliable data measurement. Watts recorded hundreds of stations on pavement, at airports collecting jet exhaust, located next to artificial sources of hot and cold, such as air conditioning systems or commercial grill heat exhausts. Many of these stations were once located in rural areas, but are now surrounded by development, and others are rural stations where data is not recorded or monitored regularly.\n\nAfter Watts' 2014 revelations, the U.S. Office of the Inspector General issued a scathing report, almost entirely ignored by the media, that found lack of oversight, non-compliance, and a lax review process for the climate recording network led it to conclude program data cannot be consistently relied upon by decision-makers. In a panic, during the investigative process that resulted in the Inspector General's report, NOAA closed approximately 600 of its most problematic weather stations.\n\nNumerous reports have shown data manipulation is not limited to the United States, but is common across the globe. Temperatures recorded at pristine rural monitoring stations in far flung locations such as Australia, Paraguay, and Switzerland have been inexplicably homogenized so that past temperatures are now reported as cooler than were actually recorded, and recent temperatures are now reported as warmer than were recorded, necessarily making the temperature rise at these locations over the past century appear steeper and larger than the unadjusted data indicate.\n\nNOAA violated its own rules when it undertook a similar adjustment process for recording ocean temperatures, beginning in 2015. As David Rose wrote for the Daily Mail, [NOAA scientists] took reliable readings from [ocean] buoys but then 'adjusted' them upwards—using readings from seawater intakes on ships … even though readings from the ships have long been known to be too hot. When you mix bad data with good, you no more produce reliable results than you do by adding muddy river water to purified bottle water to produce safe drinking water.\n\nNASA and NOAA's new report is another instance of garbage in, garbage out, in which their use of bad data produces flawed results, which, based on experience, will be used to push bad policies.\n\nNASA and NOAA jointly or separately operate the U.S. Climate Reference Network, the gold standard of surface temperature data, global satellites, and weather balloons. The temperature data recorded by these three independent, unbiased temperature-measuring networks show minimal warming over the past 40 years. Yet the agencies ignored these data sets in their recent report—proving their dogmatic belief in a human-caused climate catastrophe.\n\nNASA and NOAA are like toddlers trying to fit square pegs into round holes, and just as likely as toddlers to throw fits when their efforts are stymied by reality.\n\nThe Trump administration should steeply cut NASA and NOAA's climate budgets until agency heads and career staff get the message they will not be rewarded for repeatedly telling sky is falling climate scare stories, when the truth about temperature and climate trends is, in fact, far from alarming.\n\nH.

President Donald Trump has made strengthening the military a priority in his administration, including in 2017 reserving military service to men and women based on their biological sex and not their gender identity.\n\nOn the campaign trail Joe Biden promised if he were elected president he would return to the military policy of the Barack Obama administration that allowed men and women to serve in the military as their preferred sex.\n\nThis is the civil rights issue of our time – if this fails think of all else that fails, Biden said. It would have a profound effect on who we are as a people.\n\nSky News interviewed a 27-year-old who has been living as a man since she was a teenager:\n\nNic Talbott has dreamt of a career in the military for years. He enrolled in a training programme while at university and spent his weekends in camouflage crawling through mud, or strategising in mock battle scenarios. But a tweet by Donald Trump in July 2017 destroyed all of his plans. The president's tweet declared: The United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military. Mr. Talbott said: It was like my entire future had just been taken away in one moment over social media for no good reason.\n\nThis ban treats transgender people as lesser people, Talbott said. This ban implies that we are not as worthy, we are not as capable, and none of that is true at all.\n\nMr. Biden has made clear his commitment to protecting the rights of the LGBTQ community, Sky News reported. Mr. Biden promised that during his first 100 days in office he would pass a law that would make discrimination against the LGBTQ community illegal.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com
Amazon has narrowed the future location of its second headquarters, called HQ2, to 20 cities. 19 cities in America and Toronto, Canada, remain in the running for the $5 billion project.\n\nCNN reports that only 20 cities are on the shortlist to become home to Amazon's second headquarters. Amazon initially began deciding where to place their new HQ by examining 238 cities and regions from across all 50 states and several North American locations outside of the United States, now the 20 cities being considered include:\n\nAtlanta, GA\n\nAustin, TX\n\nBoston, MA\n\nChicago, IL\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nDallas, TX\n\nDenver, CO\n\nIndianapolis, IN\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nMiami, FL\n\nMontgomery County, MD\n\nNashville, TN\n\nNewark, NJ\n\nNew York City, NY\n\nNorthern Virginia, VA\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nRaleigh, NC\n\nToronto, Canada\n\nWashington D.C.\n\nAnnounced in September of 2017, the new Amazon building will be called HQ2 and will cost approximately $5 billion to develop and operate. Amazon estimates that the building could create up to 50,000 high-paying jobs in the city they choose to construct it in. Holly Sullivan of Amazon Public Policy commented on Amazon's decision to cut down their list of 238 cities to only 20 saying, Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity. Through this process, we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Amazon's plans to build the new HQ, cities across America began attempting to entice Amazon to develop the building in their city. Kansas City Mayor Sly James bought and reviewed as many as 1,000 Amazon products in an attempt to convince Amazon to locate there while Stonecrest, Georgia, offered to rename the city Amazon, Georgia, and give the company 345 acres of land on which to develop their new HQ for free. However, it seems that many of these locations didn't fit Amazon's criteria which included being close to a major airport and the city's ability to attract talented tech workers.\n\nAmazon stated that they will be working closely with each of the 20 locations to dive deeper into their proposals over the next few months. Amazon has stated that the HQ2 building will be a full equal to their campus located in Seattle. The company estimates that between 2010 and 2016, the Amazon campus generated $38 billion for Seattle's economy.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is lipstick on a pig.\n\nOcasio-Cortez – Occasional Cortex, as she's known, because she's so thick she doesn't even know how stupid she is – is the lipstick, obviously.\n\nAnd the pig is the Green New Deal itself which isn't remotely new, or particularly green, and which is far too expensive and damaging to merit the flattering term 'deal'.\n\nBut since with the telegenic dancing congresswoman promoting it it's not going to go away, perhaps we'd do well to examine it in more detail.\n\nNatural Gas Now blog has the dirt.\n\nThe Green New Deal is just a warmed-over version of Bernie Sanders's 2015 Keep It in the Ground Act.\n\nOn November 4, 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced the Keep It in the Ground Act which, according to The Weekly Standard, would enact [350.org founder Bill] McKibben's vision in toto. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced a companion bill in the House a few months later. But soon after, the #NoDAPL protests at Standing Rock—which were supposed to galvanize public support behind the Keep It in the Ground movement and usher in the dawn of the post-fossil fuel era—turned violent. Recognizing that extreme activism was not generating the public support they needed to upend U.S. energy policy, the leaders of the KIITG movement made a deliberate decision to change their tactics. Almost overnight, orchestrated militant actions were replaced with promises of guaranteed green jobs for all. Since then, Sanders and Rep. Huffman have abandoned the Keep It in the Ground campaign entirely and instead now publicly and enthusiastically endorse the Green New Deal.\n\nIt's part of a wider movement orchestrated by veteran Canadian eco-agitator Bill McKibben and his 350.org network.\n\nA month after the election, Sanders hosted the National Town Hall on Climate Change Solutions—featuring Bill McKibben, activist Van Jones, and Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—to introduce the Green New Deal to the world. While this event looked like a gathering of disparate groups throwing their support behind this new movement, it was actually a gathering of compatriots working together to promote their common agenda. Specifically:\n\nBill McKibben was one of just five people Sanders named to the Platform Drafting Committee at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n\nVan Jones , who served as President Obama's environmental adviser and who wrote The Green Collar Economy, was hand-picked by McKibben to be one of only 20 messengers for 350.org, who acted as global spokespeople espousing 350.org's Keep It in the Ground philosophy.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez who found her political awakening fighting the constructionof the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock, was a campaign organizer for Sanders' 2016 presidential run and campaigned with him in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe shock troops of the Green New Deal are known as the Sunrise Movement, which sounds like a new thing but it's not. It's simply a repurposed version of an old, failed campaign of 350.org's – the college divestment network.\n\n350.org is so invested in the Green New Deal that it is quietly transforming its college divestment campaign, the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network, into the Sunrise Movement, which serves as shock-troop protesters for the Green New Deal. For example, as college divestment campaigns close up shop, they encourage their followers to check out Sunrise Movement! In addition, two co-founders of the Sunrise Movement, Sara Blazevic and Varshini Prakash, left the Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Network to create the Sunrise Movement. Sunrise activists have protested on Capitol Hill and, encouraged by Ocasio-Cortez, have engaged in sit-ins in congressional offices, including three in the offices of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), to push House Democrats to create a special committee next year focused entirely on climate change initiatives.\n\nUltimately, this campaign is a throwback to the worst of the Obama era – and betrays the hallmarks of one of the Obama era's most notorious and discredited figures, Van Jones, who wrote the book The Green Collar Economy on which the Green New Deal is based.\n\nVan Jones was one of the early proponents of the Green New Deal concept, which he outlines in his 2008 book, The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems. An Amazon book review describes the book as a re-imagining of FDR's original New Deal that makes the government 'a partner' of the people, and sets about defining the principles of a 'smart, supportive, reliable' partnership. This also happens to be exactly what Ocasio-Cortez promises in her version of the Green New Deal. Wiki said, The book is a detailed proposal for a 'Green New Deal.' In 2009, Jones resigned from the White House under a cloud for supporting the view that President Bush was complicit in the September 11 terror attacks, and his treatise on the Green New Deal failed to get traction.\n\nHere's why, even though the House Democrats have shown no immediate interest in pursuing it, the Green New Deal remains a clear and present danger.\n\nUnder the Green New Deal, Congress must develop a plan for the transition of the United States economy to become carbon neutral by 2030. And to accomplish that, the U.S. will need to make big investments today to jump-start and develop new projects and sectors to power the new economy, which are estimated to be in the tens of trillions of dollars. Some of these activists are hoping to get that money by diverting the trillions of dollars needed to build and upgrade our current energy and transportation infrastructures to entirely rebuild the U.S. economy to suit their Utopian and unrealistic world view. With hundreds of state and local officials and likely 2020 presidential candidates signing on to support the Green New Deal, this campaign isn't going anywhere. And neither is its supporters' strong aversion to the oil and natural gas that has made the US a leader in affordable energy, environmental progress, and economic advancements.\n\nThis is why I call Ocasio-Cortez a Care Bear Communist. She comes across as ditzy, cute, approachable but the policies she wants to enact are pure hard-left poison.\n\nAnd she really shouldn't be underestimated. She has youth on her side: imagine the damage she's capable of doing between now and the time she's Nancy Pelosi's age! And, as Laura Perrins notes here, she knows how to exploit her beautiful woman privilege to the max:\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a looker and I hazard a guess has had the privilege of turning men into gibbering idiots for most of her adult life. I have little doubt she has been trotting out utter nonsense and yet can make it look convincing and credible because she has hardly ever been challenged on it. This is what happens when beautiful women grow up in Leftist circles and are rarely called out for mixing up a billion with a trillion. This builds confidence and sense of entitlement and soon you end up with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then suddenly when she enters Congress and her policies are examined by people on the Right, she thinks this is down to sexism. No. it's not your sex we have a problem with; it's the socialism.\n\nAmen, sister.
On Friday's edition of Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM, actress and bestselling author Sam Sorbo will join Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour as a special guest and co-host.

Less than seven years after British Eurosceptics were laughed at for expressing concerns about a coming European Union army, the bloc has revealed the official uniform of its new 'standing corps', as the first of 10,000 recruits prepare to deploy to the field.\n\nFrontex, the European Union's combined border force and coastguard, revealed the new uniform in a social media post on Monday, showing off the navy uniform complete with EU-flag identification patches and military side cap. The force said: For the first time, the European Union has its own uniformed service – the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps.\n\nPreviously, officers seconded to Frontex from national forces denoted their new role by wearing an armband with a symbol of the European political project — a ring of gold stars on blue — on their right arm.\n\nFor the first time, the European Union has its own uniformed service – the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps. And here's a sneak peak of the uniform they will be wearing to represent the 🇺 at its borders #StandingCorps pic.twitter.com/3bZrsy16t7 — Frontex (@Frontex) January 11, 2021\n\nThe troops of Frontex in their own European uniforms comes less than seven years after Brexiteers were told they believed a dangerous fantasy for saying the European Union was moving towards having its own armed forces — of which the paramilitary Frontex is the first phase.\n\nThe so-called standing corps recruited its first inductees during 2019, who were sent to academies in Poland for training. According to reports at the time, the first Frontex standing corps officers are due to deploy in early 2021.\n\nWhile the first wave of recruitment expanded Frontex past 1,000 civilian troops wearing a European uniform, by the EU's own reckoning they intend to expand the force to 10,000 operational staff by 2027.\n\nFrontex executive director Fabrice Leggeri said in 2019 of the force that its officers would be armed, and be able to deploy to an EU member-state and exercise executive powers such as carrying out border controls.\n\nEU Army 'Already Taking Shape' Brags German Defence Minister https://t.co/8Ofyx37gtW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 12, 2019\n\nThe European Union has long operated military forces and organised foreign deployments, although they have been comprised of military units on loan from member states working under EU command, rather than new uniformed personnel in EU uniform and reporting directly to Brussels. EUNAVFOR's Operation Atlanta has seen EU warships and aircraft operating in the Indian Ocean continuously for 12 years, with participating personnel and ships wearing the EU's blue and gold flag.\n\nIn other cases, soldiers from EU member state's armies have worn identifying patches with the EU flag, and even blue cravats for ceremonial work.\n\nWhile the paramilitary police-style Frontex is the European Union's first uniformed armed service, it seems unlikely to be the last. European leaders frequently discuss the need for a combined European conventional armed forces, with EU Commission boss Ursula von der Leyen — the former German defence secretary before she went to Brussels — calling for credible military capabilities in 2020.\n\nShe said at Davos: There is a European way to foreign policy and foreign security policy where hard power is an important tool. In 2019, she boasted that Europe's army is already taking shape. Indeed, in 2019 the EU already had 47 joint defence projects underway, including a joint fleet of warships, electronic warfare systems, and airborne refuelling aircraft.\n\nFarage: Von der Leyen Wants to Build 'Updated Form of Communism', Advance EU Army https://t.co/WvcFetxY43 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 16, 2019\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron hit a similar note in 2018 when he said the EU needed its own armed forces to protect ourselves from external threats. Incredibly, among the threats Macron listed was the United States of America — prompting President Donald Trump to call the claim very insulting.\n\nThe advancing state of European Union militarism is surprising, perhaps, given the strong terms in which the claims that plans were on the table were dismissed, or simply laughed off, by pro-Brussels EU loyalists in the pre-Brexit vote era. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, one of the chief cheerleaders for the EU in Britain — and now a top Facebook executive after the unceremonious end of his political career — infamously belittled Nigel Farage on stage during a debate in 2014, accusing him of holding a dangerous fantasy when the Brexit leader cited a future EU army.\n\nAt a one-hour BBC debate on the future of Britain's membership of the European Union, Farage pointed out Mr Clegg's record on Europe, saying: The whole point of the [EU] constitution, which you supported, was to make the European Union an economic and a military superpower. And now you deny the fact they are trying to build a European airforce.\n\nClegg attempted to hit back with a line that would come to be repeated through the Brexit campaign as an example of the haughty disdain the Westminster elite held voters in, when he said: No, no, no… it is a dangerous fantasy. It's just not true! I want to explain the truth and reality, not this fantasy world you keep talking about that simply doesn't exist.\n\nWhile Clegg was subsequently proven wrong time and time again with following pronouncements from EU leaders on wanting an independent EU army, he still wanted the last word. An opinion piece in 2017 — three years after the original debate, and after Britain had voted to leave the EU — the then-former deputy PM insisted he'd been right all along, stating EU troops in starred fatigue? Not so much.
A source within one of the European Union's security organisations has told Breitbart London exclusively that to his knowledge, no widespread discussions are being had at an EU level about the spate of migrant rapes that have taken places across the continent – with Cologne, Hamburg, Helsinki, Paris, Salzburg, Zurich, and more cities now affected. EU leaders are said to be unwilling to admit the cause: Brussels policy on open borders immigration and migrant quotas.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, the source told Breitbart London this afternoon that the EU has no real analytical ability to help it inform policy decisions, therefore when an incident like this happens, there is no one to help guide the process. Instead, while Brussels is happy to dictate an open borders policy, and a policy of mandatory migrant quotas – it simply will not and cannot deal with the fall out.\n\nEU chiefs have been unusually silent on the issue of the migrant rape epidemic, with no real statements or leadership from the Presidents of the European Commission, European Council, or European Parliament on the matter.\n\nThe security source said: Half the problem is no effective analysis is applied to these things in Brussels as there's no real analytical capability to inform policy decisions. So the dots between Brussels and EU policy on the one hand and security implications, social cohesion etc, particularly in the medium to long term – the second and third order effects you might say – on the other are never joined. That is a serious and systemic problem.\n\nI can't guarantee that it's not been/being discussed in the cabinets of other institutions – as there is virtually no cross institutional information flow, coordination or cooperation on these things.\n\nThe news that the EU is unable or unwilling to deal with such a serious problem and global news story serves to underline points made by Eurosceptics that the organisation is not interested in the people of Europe, but rather, the political expansionism, the career political classes, and the bureaucrats: the European elite.\n\nBut pro-EU types will likely argue back that this is further evidence that the EU needs to function as a unified government, so that institutions find it easier to share information and respond in time. Indeed, some may go so far as to say that a pan-European police force is the only answer to presumably orchestrated crimes like this across European borders\n\nOur source concluded: The final point is that I suspect nobody will admit Brussels policy is inherently linked to what happened in Cologne – they will not welcome such a link – and the attitude will therefore be that such matters are for member states.\n\nLumping the blame for the mass migration at the feet of EU member states is likely to cause consternation – especially from Eurosceptic governments like those in Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia – though those countries – which have been stricter on immigration and related crime, are the ones who have suffered less from migrant crime in the past few weeks.\n\nOver 1.4 million people are believed to have entered Europe from the Middle East and North Africa this year. While many estimates suggest the number is far fewer, these do not include the number of overstayers – those told to leave who don't – and those who remain beneath the radar and do not register, according to EU sources.\n\nFollow Raheem Kassam on Facebook and Twitter for the latest updates
WASHINGTON (AP) — After weeks of delay and strategizing, the U.S. House is planning to vote Wednesday to send the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate to start the trial on removing him from office.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi met privately Tuesday at the Capitol with House Democrats about next steps, ending her blockade a month after they voted to impeach Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nPelosi suggested the House vote on Wednesday to transmit the charges and name the House managers for the case, according to several Democrats who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting.\n\nThe action will launch the Senate proceeding, only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history, a dramatic endeavor coming amid the backdrop of a politically divided nation and an election year.\n\nTrump was impeached by the Democratic-led House last month on charges of abuse of power over pushing Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and obstruction of Congress in the following probe.\n\nThe trial would then begin in a matter of days.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the Senate on Tuesday scoffing at what he called the bizarro world of Pelosi's impeachment strategy that delayed transmitting the charges for weeks.\n\nDo these sound like leaders who really believe we are in a constitutional crisis, one that requires the ultimate remedy? McConnell asked. He rejected Pelosi's recent suggestions that whatever the Senate verdict, Trump will be impeached forever.\n\nIt will fall to the Senate to end it with serious and sobriety, he said.\n\nMcConnell was meeting behind closed doors later Tuesday with GOP senators as they negotiate the terms of the trial.\n\nSenate Republicans are signaling they would reject the idea of simply voting to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Trump as he has suggested. They are considering whether to allow a vote on such a motion to dismiss and another to subpoena testimony from new witnesses.\n\nI think our members, generally are not interested in the motion to dismiss. They think both sides need to be heard, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who is part of the GOP leadership, said Monday.\n\nTrump suggested over the weekend he might prefer simply dismissing the charges rather than giving legitimacy to charges from the House, which he considers a hoax.\n\nIt was an extraordinary suggestion, but one being proposed by Trump allies with support from some GOP senators, including McConnell.\n\nBut it is clear McConnell does not have the votes needed from his GOP majority to do that.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine is leading an effort among some Republicans, including Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, to ensure the ground rules include the possibility of calling new witnesses.\n\nMy position is that there should be a vote on whether or not witnesses should be called, Collins said.\n\nRomney said he wants to hear from John Bolton, the former national security adviser at the White House, who others have said raised alarms about the alternative foreign policy toward Ukraine being run by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nI expect that barring some kind of surprise, I'll be voting in favor of hearing from witnesses after those opening arguments, Romney told reporters Monday.\n\nDemocrats have been pushing Republicans, who have a slim Senate majority, to consider new testimony, arguing that fresh information has emerged during Pelosi's monthlong delay in transmitting the charges.\n\nWe want the truth, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday as the chamber opened. He said that in other presidential impeachment trials the Senate called witnesses.\n\nDo Senate Republicans want to break the lengthy historical precedent? Schumer asked.\n\nMcConnell is drafting an organizing resolution that will outline the steps ahead. Approving it will be among the first votes senators take after they are sworn as jurors by Chief Justice John Roberts for the Court of Impeachment.\n\nRepublicans control the chamber, 53-47, and are all but certain to acquit Trump. McConnell is hesitant to call new witnesses who would prolong the trial. He prefers to model Trump's trial partly on the process used for then-President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999.\n\nSenators say if witnesses are allowed, some Republicans may also try to subpoena Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine while his father was vice president.\n\nIt takes just 51 votes during the impeachment trial to approve rules or call witnesses. Just four GOP senators could form a majority with Democrats to insist on new testimony. It also would take only 51 senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Trump.\n\nMost Republicans appear willing to go along with McConnell's plan to start the trial first then consider witnesses later, rather than upfront, as Democrats want.\n\nCollins is pushing to have at least the promise of witness votes included in the organizing resolution. She and the others appear to be gathering support.\n\nI've been working to make sure that we will have a process that we can take a vote on whether or not we need additional information, and yes, that would include witnesses, Murkowski told reporters.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Daly, Andrew Taylor and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report.
