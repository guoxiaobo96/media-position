From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A recycling center that employs adults with intellectual disabilities should have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to its workers, federal labor officials said. The U.S. Department of Labor recently announced that employees were rightfully owed $540,000. Montgomery Arc and two of its partners – Hanan Center and McInnis Recycling Center – will now pay $541,597 in back wages to 80 employees, federal officials said. The deal is part of a settlement between the organizations and the federal agency, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reports. The organizations were supposed to provide services to the employees in exchange for paying them less than minimum wage, the newspaper reports. But the agency found that it failed to provide services required by federal guidelines.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: More than two dozen tribal groups oppose a federal land-use proposal that could open large areas of wilderness to future mining in rural Alaska. The opposition is in response to a proposed Bureau of Land Management update to its resource management, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The Bering Sea-Western Interior Resource Management Plan covers 21,094 square miles in Alaska's western and interior regions. The agency announced its preferred proposal in March, known as Alternative C, which would make mining an option on nearly all the land in the plan. The proposal would increase available mining land from the current 13,594 square miles established in the 1980s.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: All students in the Flagstaff school district will be provided with iPads under a loan program that starts this week with middle and high school students and continues with elementary school students at the start of the next school year. Flagstaff Unified School District voters in 2018 approved a bond measure to provide $10.6 million to pay for the tablets, cases and other accessories. The district won't require students to use the iPads, but officials say opting out could affect the potential of classroom learning, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Students and their parents have been asked to sign a new loan agreement, to review an existing agreement on responsible use of technology and to pay a nonrefundable $25 annual device protection plan fee. Scholarships for the fee are available for families in need.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The director of the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council says up to $200,000 may have been stolen from the organization that provides financial assistance, housing and food to the needy. The Times Record reports that CSCBC director Marc Baker said improper invoices had been submitted for vendors that had already been paid. The newspaper said Baker last week reported anywhere from $30,000 to $200,000 of duplicate invoices since July. Fort Smith police spokesman Aric Mitchell said an investigation into Baker's allegation would likely begin Monday. Baker said he contacted the FBI because the funds include money from two federal grants, but he was referred to Fort Smith police. The agency's website says it provides services such as housing, food, utility payment assistance and dental programs to low-income residents in about a dozen western Arkansas counties.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Homeless people facing a ticket or arrest by San Diego police could have the infractions cleared if they agree to stay for 30 days in one of the city's shelters, according to a report. The program could help stabilize lives and get people connected with services, while also allowing officers to enforce laws on the street, San Diego police Capt. Scott Wahl told the Union-Tribune. The San Diego Police Department launched a neighborhood policing division in 2019 that includes outreach teams and officers who enforce quality-of-life laws that often involve homeless people. Last summer, police began offering shelter beds in lieu of citations to homeless people who had been contacted for encroachment, illegal lodging, littering or other minor infractions. But while about 300 people took the offer, many left the shelter within a day or two, Wahl said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state is starting off 2020 with plenty of snow in the mountains. Mountain snow moisture statewide is 122% of the usual amount for this time of year, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. High-country snow moisture is up 30% compared to this time last year. All areas measured by the federal agency have above-average snow moisture. Early-season snows boosted snowpack in the northern part of the state. Snow has fallen in southern ranges more recently, evenly boosting snowpack levels statewide, the Denver Post reports. Light mountain snow is forecast in northern Colorado in the days ahead. Much of Colorado's mountain snow moisture accumulates in late winter and early spring.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFairfield: The state and AT&T have signed a deal designed to improve cellular service on the Metro-North commuter rail line. The agreement, announced Friday, gives the telecommunications company access to the right-of-way along the rail line, where the company plans to install a series of small cell nodes. Gov. Ned Lamont says that will provide better cellular coverage and higher data speeds for train passengers. The Democratic governor also announced that 132 recently purchased rail cars will be designed in partnership with industry experts and equipped with rooftop antennas that amplify 4G and 5G signals in the train.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Authorities who launched a two-day sting in response to a rash of shootings in the capital city say they seized guns and drugs. The operation targeted Dover's Capitol Park neighborhood, where there were four shootings in the last two weeks of the year, Delaware State Police spokeswoman Master Cpl. Melissa Jaffe said. A drive-by shooting on New Year's Day also injured two teens. No arrests were made, but Jaffe said authorities seized a loaded Smith & Wesson .40-caliber pistol, a black tactical-style ballistic vest and a loaded assault rifle, as well as 656 baggies of heroin. Police said in a news release that officers had learned the contraband was being hidden on state and county land. The effort involved more than 60 troopers and law enforcement officers from multiple other agencies.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district saw one of the nation's highest numbers of bank branches close in 2019, WTOP-FM reports. Only New York and Chicago saw more closures than the 57 last year in the D.C. market, according to MagnifyMoney. As more Americans use digital and mobile banking, firms are looking to save on overhead and earn on real estate by closing down expensive physical branches. An increase in mergers may also be to blame, WTOP reports, with the FDIC pegging such mergers as at a 17-year high.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials say there were nearly 3,400 hepatitis A cases in 2019. According to statistics through Saturday, there were 3,395 cases – including 63 new cases reported the prior week. To underscore the outbreak, the Panama City News Herald reports the state totaled 1,175 reported cases of hepatitis A in the five previous years combined – with 548 of those cases in 2018, according to state Department of Health data. Hepatitis A can cause liver damage and is spread through such things as fecal matter. That can include transmission by people not properly washing their hands after going to the bathroom and contaminating food or drinks. Health officials urge people to get vaccinated against the disease. As of Saturday, Pasco County had the most cases in the state in 2019, with 414.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: Terry Patterson plans to run a dozen marathons in 2020 as he keep logging road race miles at the age of 65. Patterson, of Macon, ran his first marathon, the local Cherry Blossom Road Race, in 2002. He began entering more races and hasn't stopped. In fewer than two decades, Patterson says, he's completed 83 marathons in all 50 states. He estimates the total distance he's run during road races exceeds 10,000 miles. I do get a lot of accolades for how old I am, Patterson told WMAZ-TV. And I do brag about how fast I can run. He's showing no signs of slowing down. Patterson ran a 3-hour, 52-minute marathon in Seattle last fall. In April, he qualified for the Boston Marathon. He's signed up for 12 marathons this year and hopes to add his first race overseas in China. His first marathon of the new year will be closer to home, at nearby Robins Air Force Base on Jan. 18.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Big Island geothermal power station that was knocked offline by a volcanic eruption hopes to produce lower-cost electricity under a new agreement with a state utility, company officials said. Puna Geothermal Venture and Hawaiian Electric Light Co. are seeking approval of an amended power purchase agreement submitted last week to the state Public Utilities Commission. Hawaiian Electric said Puna Geothermal agreed to sell electricity from its restored and enlarged facility, the state's only geothermal power plant, at a reduced price that would save a typical residential customer $7.50 to $13 a month. Puna Geothermal is working to resume normal operations after the Kilauea volcano eruption that began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes in lower Puna. Lava destroyed the company's substation and covered geothermal wells, while cutting off road access.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal agency has ordered a company to pay four employees tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid overtime and travel time after the company violated labor laws. An investigation by the U.S. Labor Department found that Intermountain Concrete Polishing paid employees straight-time rates for all the hours they worked, including workweeks that exceeded 40 hours, the Idaho Statesman reports. The company also failed to record or compensate employees for travel time when they worked several hours away from their homes, officials said. The Meridian-based floor polishing company must pay $47,676 to four employees for violating overtime and record-keeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, federal officials said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state will stop collecting fines against drivers who are ticketed after cameras catch them violating red lights, Comptroller Susana Mendoza said Monday. She said poor and minority motorists appear to be most affected by the $100 tickets, which can double if not timely paid. She also noted a federal investigation of relationships between some communities and a red light vendor. The new policy starts Feb. 6. This system is clearly broken, Mendoza said. I am exercising the moral authority to prevent state resources being used to assist a shady process that victimizes taxpayers. A 2012 state law allows local governments to use the comptroller's office to collect debts. Unpaid traffic tickets, for example, can be deducted from tax refunds. Mendoza said communities can hire private debt collectors instead.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Children's Museum of Indianapolis set an attendance record during 2019, breaking a mark that had stood for a decade. The museum had just over 1.3 million visitors last year, topping its 2009 record by about 8,300 people, officials said. Ten years ago, the museum's attendance was boosted by a King Tut exhibit and the opening of an Egypt exhibit. In 2019, special exhibits included Star Trek: Exploring New Worlds and PAW Patrol Adventure Play. The new mark also comes after the museum, north of downtown Indianapolis, opened its $24.5 million outdoor Sports Legends Experience in 2018. Museum CEO Jeffrey Patchen says it strives to provide fun and imaginative exhibits that appeal to all, from children to grandparents.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: A business lobbying group is trying to halt the city's new ordinance that is supposed to help convicted felons find work. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry filed a petition for injunctive relief against the city in Black Hawk District Court on Friday, arguing cities don't have the authority to pass laws like Waterloo's. The ban the box ordinance prevents companies from including a question on applications about whether prospective employees have been convicted of crimes. But in its petition, the ABI points to a 2017 Iowa law that bans cities and counties from passing some business-related ordinances. The local governments can't preempt federal or state rules about business practices like benefits and hiring practices. The Legislature passed the law because some county officials – including those in Polk County – wanted to raise the minimum wage.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Psychiatrists are so hard to come by in some rural parts of the state that doctors from outside its borders now commonly treat patients through video conference. Kansas, like the rest of the U.S., is seeing an increase in patients seeking mental health treatment. The state can't find enough doctors, nurses and therapists to treat them, and providers say the problem is worse in the state's least-populated rural areas. The Kansas News Service reports the High Plains Mental Health Center in northwestern Kansas has long struggled to attract psychiatrists for patients in its 20-county coverage area. Executive Director Walt Hill stopped even trying because it typically took him more than a year to fill a position. Attracting psychiatric nurses is hard, too. So Hill turned to providers who conference in from Kansas City, Missouri; Texas; and Oklahoma.\n\nKentucky\n\nOlive Hill: Carter Caves State Resort Park is offering more than 200 activities at its Winter Adventure Weekend this month. Among the activities during the four-day event are cave tours, winter survival, rappelling, ice climbing and guided hikes. There will be 243 workshops and field trips offered for people ranging from beginners to advanced winter adventurers, based on difficulty and skills required. Registration is $20 per person, with additional charges for some field trips and workshops. Registration is available online or, pending availability, at the site. The event is set for Jan. 23-26. The park is in Olive Hill and has a lodge with a restaurant, cottages and campground.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new high school is preparing students for careers in coastal protection and restoration, anticipating a future with ongoing climate change and sea level rise. New Harmony High School opened in fall 2018 and currently serves about 100 south Louisiana students. Besides their traditional classes in math, literature and history, New Harmony students take science classes that tackle environmental issues. The school currently has grades nine and 10, with plans to expand to 11th and 12th grades. The state charter school's mission is intricately tied to the state's future. A multitude of issues from the leveeing of the Mississippi River to oil and gas development have made Louisiana ground zero for coastal land loss. The state estimates it has lost just over 2,000 square miles of land – a tract about the size of Delaware – since 1932.\n\nMaine\n\nEast Machias: Atlantic salmon laid a record number of eggs in the East Machias River last year, according to a conservation group that tracks the species' status in the wild. The fish are considered endangered in the U.S. by the federal government, and they only appear in a handful of Maine rivers. The Downeast Salmon Federation said the high number of eggs shows that efforts to bring them back in Maine's river systems are working. Biologists counted 61 of the nests the fish build for spawning in the East Machias River. The Downeast Salmon Federation's executive director, Dwayne Shaw, said that's six times the number counted in the river since the federation started tracking the fish's egg nesting patterns two decades ago. The federation counted only 10 of the nests in 2018, the Bangor Daily News reports. That was about an average number. The nests carry about 4,000 eggs each.\n\nMaryland\n\nGreenbelt: Residents, civic associations and local governments in counties that would be crossed by a proposed high-speed, magnetic levitation train linking Baltimore and Washington say they are weighing options to fight the plan. The Washington Post reports the city of Greenbelt is among those opposing the so-called maglev project. Last month, the city issued a request for services to attorneys and law firms willing to take on the fight. Other options being weighed to oppose the $10 billion plan include lobbying lawmakers and organizing protests, the newspaper reports. Critics say the train would offer little benefit to communities it will pass through because it would only stop in Washington, Baltimore and the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Opponents are worried about construction impacts. But supporters say it will ease traffic congestion, create jobs and boost economic development.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group of families in the state is fighting a recent court ruling that found au pairs should be treated as employees entitled to minimum wage. An organization called Au Pair Families of Massachusetts is planning to lobby for legislation in the Statehouse on Wednesday, the Boston Globe reports. A federal court ruled Dec. 2 that au pairs in Massachusetts were entitled to earn state minimum wage and overtime, which could raise host families' costs by as much as $333 per week. Many host parents agree au pairs should have additional protections but argue the new changes will make the program less accessible in a state that has some of the nation's highest child care costs. The au pair program, overseen by the U.S. State Department, was launched as a cultural exchange program in which young people live with families in other countries while helping with child care and some housework. Host families paid at least $197 a week for a maximum of 45 hours of work before the ruling.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A statue of the robot featured in the 1987, Detroit-set film RoboCop is nearing completion ahead of its debut at a science museum. Organizers of the Kickstarter campaign website who crowdfunded Robocop for the city posted some photos last week with an update of the statue with a note that its final form is coming later this winter at the Michigan Science Center, The Detroit News reports. Organizers wrote in the update that the statue is 11 feet tall with his head on and that his stainless steel base weighs half a ton. He is big, he is clean, he is bronze, he is perfect, they wrote. It has been almost a decade since the idea came about. A Twitter user, who tagged then-Mayor Dave Bing in a tweet, noted that Philadelphia has a statue of another movie icon, Rocky Balboa, and that RoboCop would be a GREAT ambassador for Detroit. The campaign that launched in 2012 raised $67,436 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide. Since then, Giorgio Gikas, one of Detroit's premier sculptor conservators, has been creating the work.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSherburn: A rural veterinarian who has taken in dozens of miniature horses since they were seized because of maltreatment says she wants to be paid for caring for them for a year and a half. Shirley Kittleson says the bill for their care has topped $325,000. Kittleson filed a lawsuit last month against the Humane Society and Watonwan County for nonpayment. Kittleson was asked to care for the herd of 72 after the Animal Humane Society and Watonwan County sheriff seized the horses from a farm in Odin in June 2018. The farm's owner, Michael Johnson, was convicted of two counts of animal neglect. Watonwan County told Kittleson soon after she sent them a couple of monthly bills that the horses were the responsibility of the Humane Society. Kittleson said she could find new homes for the horses, but the Humane Society won't release the herd, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: As the 2020 Legislature prepares to convene Tuesday, the future of hemp in the Magnolia State is hazy. There were a few attempts to legalize hemp production in the 2019 session, but all failed. Now, as farmers in surrounding states are already cultivating and selling hemp, Mississippi remains one of only three states where production is illegal. A task force on hemp production met three times last year and weighed pros and cons of the issue. Farmers crowded into a room in the Capitol to hear about a new crop they might soon plant. Agricultural experts explained the benefits and hardships of growing hemp without taking a hard stance on the issue, but law enforcement officials on the task force were deeply critical of hemp legalization. The task force ultimately produced a report that included these findings, though it doesn't include a recommendation on whether to legalize hemp. Last year, the House passed a bill legalizing hemp production. That bill stalled in the Senate.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A memorial to soldiers downtown has been damaged by vandalism, including a spray-painted message of No war. The vandalism was discovered Sunday morning. It wasn't immediately clear if it was in response to the airstrike that killed a top Iranian official, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an attack that's drastically raised tensions between Tehran and Washington. About 150 people marched through downtown St. Louis on Saturday in opposition to further military action against Iran. The Missouri Historical Society's director of marketing and communications, Leigh Walters, said it is sad that anyone would deface a memorial to those who have made the supreme sacrifice for their country. The memorial opened in 1938 to honor World War I soldiers and reopened in 2018 after a two-year, $30 million renovation.\n\nMontana\n\nBig Sky: Gallatin National Forest officials are warning backcountry enthusiasts to take extra care after three snowmobilers escaped injury in a weekend avalanche near Big Sky. Forest forecaster Alex Marienthal said in a Sunday advisory that the snowmobilers were caught Saturday in a 1,500-foot-wide, 4-to-6-foot-deep slide on Buck Ridge. Marienthal says similar avalanches have broken naturally on sugary and weak layers hidden deep inside snowpack in recent days. More can be expected. Backcountry visitors are urged to avoid slopes that are wind-loaded with snow and to avoid steep slopes that may hide persistent weak layers of snow. Two snowmobilers were killed in a Jan. 1 avalanche near Lake Dinah, northwest of Seeley Lake. The West Central Montana Avalanche Center had issued an avalanche warning for the area after more than a foot of heavy, wet snow had fallen overnight.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state lawmaker concerned about prison overcrowding plans to propose building a new 300-bed work release facility in Omaha. State Sen. Steve Lathrop tells the Omaha World-Herald he'll introduce a bill calling on the state to begin planning a new community corrections facility. Building the new facility could cost more than $40 million, but Lathrop's bill would only require the state to plan for the new work release facility. Nebraska's prisons currently hold 2,006 more inmates than their design capacity of 3,535 inmates, putting the prison system at 157% of its design capacity. Lathrop says the state is facing a prison overcrowding crisis and needs to address the issue. A consultant recommended expanding Omaha's community corrections prison in 2014, but the project was never done. Lathrop says work-release facilities can help better prepare inmates to return to society.\n\nNevada\n\nWells: A historic hotel damaged in a 2008 earthquake is getting restored. The El Rancho Hotel and Casino in Wells is expected to see a new life after the small Elko County town received grants to fix it up. The city has secured funding from the federal Community Development Block Grant program and the Nevada Commission for Cultural Centers and Historic Preservation to help restore the property. Restoration is estimated to cost about $500,000 to the city as well. City manager Jolene Supp says the payoff will be worth it. The city plans to reopen the building as a community center, restaurant and small-business incubator. Originally a hotel-casino and later a community center and banquet hall, the El Rancho served the town of 1,200 since it was built in 1949. A 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit Wells in February 2008, damaging hundreds of structures in town, including the hotel.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: This year's New Hampshire Women's Rally will feature speakers on reproductive health, climate, immigration, and electing women to office from the bottom to the top of the ticket. The fourth annual rally is scheduled for Jan. 18 outside the Statehouse from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. It's called March on the Polls. Some of the groups at this year's event will be Planned Parenthood NH Action Fund; the NH Women's Foundation; Equality Health Center; NH Sierra Club; Granite State Progress; Rights & Democracy NH; NH Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy; and MomsRising. More details can be found on Facebook.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nIsland Beach State Park: Officials hoped they would collect 200 discarded Christmas trees to bolster dunes at the park but have received 10 times that amount. State Department of Environmental Protection officials, who operate the park, said they collected some 2,000 Christmas trees Saturday during a drop-off event. DEP officials say the trees help catch sand and support the dunes, which provide protection to the island during storms. The dunes also provide habitat for about 400 plant species and numerous types of birds. The island is made up of nearly 1,900 acres of dunes and beaches and remains one of the few remaining undeveloped barrier island beaches in the northeastern United States, according to state officials. Now, state officials are looking for volunteers to help move and place the Christmas trees into specific dune areas. Volunteers and state workers will meet at 8 a.m. Saturday. Volunteers must pre-register online.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Native Americans go without medical insurance at a much higher rate than the state's other residents, according to a state-commissioned study from the Urban Institute that explores gaps in medical insurance coverage by race and ethnicity as well as age, location and education level. New Mexico fares relatively well overall in terms of paid access to health care services in comparison with the U.S. as a whole. The study found that 187,000 non-elderly residents go without health insurance – about 10.5% of the state population. The national average is just over 11%. Among Native Americans, 37,000 people go with insurance – or 16.2% of the population. Health insurance coverage also is relatively scarce in the northwest area of the state that is home to the Navajo Nation. The Urban Institute found that Native Americans working in the health care and educational fields are especially prone to go without health insurance.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Throngs of demonstrators joined by elected officials walked solemnly across the Brooklyn Bridge in a solidarity march Sunday against anti-Semitism and all acts of hate. The No Hate, No Fear march was organized by New York's Jewish community in the wake of recent anti-Semitic attacks, including a knife attack at a Hanukkah celebration north of New York City that left five people wounded and a fatal shootout at a kosher grocery in Jersey City, New Jersey. The crowds of participants, thousands strong, jammed the streets in lower Manhattan as they waited their turns to get across the bridge. It is wonderful that we are doing this and sad that we still have to do it, said Claudia Stoller, 31, of Manhattan. But it was never lost on me that the Jewish community could always be targeted and should always be ready to be strong.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheboro: The North Carolina Zoo says it had a record-setting number of visitors in 2019. The zoo has announced it saw 917,309 visitors in 2019, a record and 85,000 more than in 2018. We are thrilled to welcome so many guests from North Carolina and around the world to our zoo, Zoo Director Pat Simmons said. We have plans to keep improving our programs and guest experience so that even more people can enjoy the zoo in the future. The facility says it is the world's largest natural habitat zoo. It is home to more than 1,800 animals and 52,000 plants.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials say high winds caused a power outage that led to a produced water and oil spill in Dunn County. The state Department of Environmental Quality was notified Monday of Sunday's spill at a salt water disposal facility operated by Hunt Oil Co., about 8 miles northwest of Halliday. Officials said the equipment failure caused by the power outage led to multiple tanks overflowing. Initial estimates indicated about 27,720 gallons of produced water and 15,540 gallons of crude oil overflowed the tanks. Most of the spill was contained on site, but winds blew some of the material onto pastureland. Produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas development. It is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Records show the Cuyahoga County prosecutor is on track to send about 100 children to adult court to face criminal charges for the second consecutive year, a practice criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio as being unnecessary in most cases. As of mid-December, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court records indicate 99 teenagers had cases bound over to Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in 2019, cleveland.com reported. Nearly 9 in 10 of those juveniles are black, records show. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley, whose jurisdiction includes Cleveland, said many of the juveniles his office prosecutes as adults previously were charged in juvenile court and then committed more crimes. O'Malley, a Democrat who took office in January 2017, told cleveland.com in October that he does not apologize for trying to keep the community safe.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge facing a felony charge of failing to file her state income tax returns has been removed from presiding over criminal trials. The Oklahoman reports Oklahoma County Judge Kendra Coleman was reassigned Friday by Presiding Judge Ray C. Elliott to handle victim protective order requests and mental health cases. Coleman is facing a felony charge for failing to pay state taxes in 2017, was admonished by the state Supreme Court for failing to pay her taxes and more than 60 parking tickets, and has been found in contempt by the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. Coleman's attorney, Joe White, has called the felony indictment false on its face, saying the taxes were eventually paid. The judge's attorney has also said the contempt citation must be more specific about the allegations against her.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state's correctional facility for girls and young women had among the highest rates of sexual victimization in 2018, according to a federal report. In the report, 42 girls and young women at Albany's Oak Creek Youth Correctional Facility were surveyed; 14.3% reported being sexually victimized in 2018. That's more than twice the national average of 7.1%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Oregon Public Broadcasting says the report does not distinguish sexual abuse reports in individual facilities made against staff versus those made against other youth. Other Oregon facilities above the national average include St. Mary's Home for Boys in Beaverton at 11.1% and the Rogue Valley Youth Correctional Facility in Grants Pass at 10.3%. All other Oregon juvenile facilities fell below the national average. The National Survey of Youth in Custody conducted the report.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Michael Fitzpatrick, a former congressman from suburban Philadelphia who served four terms in the U.S. House before handing off the seat to his brother, died Monday morning after a long battle with melanoma, his family said. He was 56. Michael Fitzpatrick passed away peacefully this morning, surrounded by family, after a long and arduous battle with melanoma, Fitzpatrick's family said in a statement released by county Republican Party officials. Fitzpatrick, who also served as a Bucks County commissioner, worked during his time in Congress to establish the Washington Crossing National Cemetery. He decided against running for a fifth term in 2016. His brother, Brian, a former FBI agent, ran instead and won and continues to hold the seat. Fitzpatrick, of Levittown, is survived by his wife and six children.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: The annual Rhode Island National Guard Open House Air Show in Quonset Point will resume in 2020 after having been canceled last year because of troop deployments. This year's show is scheduled for June 27-28 at the Quonset Air National Guard Base in North Kingstown, the National Guard announced Friday. The air show debuted in 1992 and has been canceled twice – once in 2013 because of federal budget cuts and last year due to a large number of deployments within the Rhode Island National Guard. Officials said they expected more than 500 troops to be deployed last year during the traditional time frame of the air show. Officials say this year's show will include an F-22 Raptor demonstration, the U.S. Air Force Academy Jump Team, a World War II heritage flight and the Geico Skytypers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFlorence: Authorities are investigating the fatal shooting of an airport public safety officer officer in Florence. A man shot and killed the officer Sunday morning during a traffic stop at Florence Regional Airport, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said in a news release. Florence County Coroner Keith von Lutcken identified the victim as Jackson Ryan Winkeler, 26, of Dillon, WPDE-TV reports. The suspect, 37-year-old James Edward Bell, initially fled but was later captured by Florence County deputies, officials said. Winkeler also volunteered with the Latta Fire Department, which lowered its flag to half-staff Sunday.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A company has awarded holiday bonuses its 120 employees likely won't forget. Myrl & Roy's Paving gave its workers $10 million in bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $400,000 depending on length of employment and job duties. One of the owners, Sue Unzelman, says they wanted to thank the employees for their hard work and loyalty. It's something we really wanted to do, reward their loyalty, their stick-to-it-ness, she says. I can't tell you how happy I was to see the reactions, the tears in the room. Unzelman and her siblings are selling the second-generation company to L.G. Everist, a rock mining company with pits and quarries in the region. Myrl & Roy's Paving began over five decades ago after Myrl Unzelman and Roy Schultz left their jobs in a road construction business and bought a $500 dump truck, a rake and a shovel.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The latest design plans for the city's most ambitious development project reveal a complex new downtown district anchored by Amazon's office campus and an entertainment district similar to L.A. Live. The 25-story Grand Hyatt hotel will be the first tenant to open in the fall in the 17-acre Nashville Yards development. Two office towers for an Amazon operations hub are also well under construction. But most of the site work is still either in the preliminary stages or has yet to begin. San Diego-based Southwest Value Partners expects to spend $1 billion to create the district in the next few years. The entire project, which includes new street designs with pedestrian plazas, stretches from Broadway to Church Street. It will be fronted by a 1.3-acre park along the railroad tracks running through the Gulch.\n\nTexas\n\nLubbock: Police say a man who shot at a police officer early Sunday was then fatally shot when two officers returned gunfire. Police say in a news release that 30-year-old Drew Nichols Wallace-Flores was killed in the shooting in a southwest Lubbock neighborhood. Police say the officers were investigating a report from a resident of seeing a man on security video checking vehicle door handles in the neighborhood shortly after 5:30 a.m. Sunday when the man fled as one officer arrived. Police say the officer gave chase on foot, and as the second officer arrived, Wallace-Flores fired at the first officer, and both officers returned fire, killing Wallace-Flores at the scene. The names of the officers were not immediately released. Police say both are on paid leave pending an investigation into the shooting.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: The state's number of drug overdose suicides has potentially been underreported by 33%, according to a new study. Published in the journal Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, the study came to the conclusion after looking at 2,665 overdose deaths from 2012 to 2015 in Utah, the Provo Daily Herald reports. Paul Nestadt, one of the paper's authors, says the nation's opioid epidemic has clouded suicide classification across the nation. If you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, Nestadt said. State health officials say roughly 630 Utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year. Utah's suicide rate is above the national average, causing the deaths of 22.7 per 100,000 people in 2017, compared to a national rate of 14 people per 100,000. According to the study, that rate could be significantly higher.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: Leaders of a hospital that is a critical provider of psychiatric and addiction services in the Green Mountain State say the facility faces the possibility of sale or closure amid a disagreement with state officials over funding. Brattleboro Retreat serves more than half the people in Vermont who need psychiatric care, and it provides all of the child and adolescent psychiatric care in the state, according to its chief executive officer, Louis Josephson. Michael Smith, secretary of Vermont's Agency of Human Services, says he has rejected a request for an additional $2 million in funding from Brattleboro Retreat. That request would be in addition to a financial package valued at an estimated $16 million for new beds and a recent rate increase valued at an estimated $3.5 million per year, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A cancer patient says her faith in humanity has been restored after she received thousands of pieces of mail from around the world this holiday season. The Free Lance-Star reports Jean Lee, 61, hoped a few cards would help as she battled the depression of ongoing treatments for a cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 2003. So the Stafford County woman posted a request on Facebook, asking people to tell her about their lives and hometowns. That led to a segment on a Washington TV station, and her story continued to spread. Lee said she received a package from Antarctica, a scarf from England, Kona coffee from Hawaii and a clock-jewelry box made by inmates at a Tennessee correctional facility, who paid $25 to ship it to her, the newspaper reports. When I say this whole experience has given me hope, that's coming from a woman who was very jaded, Lee told the newspaper.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The city is planning to write off hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid utility bills dating back two decades as it looks to upgrade its payment software. The proposal would forgive more than $450,000 in payments and late fees accrued by 174 ratepayers during the years 1999 to 2013. The Spokesman-Review reports a city official says those payments would be legally difficult to recoup. Nonpayment of utilities, including charges for trash collection, sewer and water services, can result in late fees, liens placed on a property and termination of service. But the debt that is being considered for forgiveness may have been incurred by businesses no longer located in the area or residents who died or moved away. Spokane City Councilwoman Candace Mumm says she wants to make sure city officials have done everything to secure payment before writing the debts off.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state has announced its initial slate of events for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. The yearlong commemoration will start Wednesday with a reception ahead of the governor's state of the state address, Secretary of State Mac Warner's office said. Women will wear early 1900s-style clothing at the event. Other events throughout the year include a documentary showing, a lecture series, a gala, a women's suffrage march at Marshall University and more. Events are being posted online on Warner's website and through a social media account. Warner is leading a coordinating committee to plan events for the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A driver shot and wounded two children who threw snowballs at a car, police said. Officers who responded to a shooting report Saturday night on the north side of Milwaukee found the injured children and gave them first aid until they were taken to a hospital. The children are a 13-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. Both suffered non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, police said in a news release. Investigators say they're looking for the driver of a white Toyota who fired at the kids.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An operation to kill the mountain goats that have invaded Grand Teton National Park and threaten the existence of the park's struggling bighorn sheep herd began Sunday, officials say. A large swath of the high Tetons, including the north and west slopes of the iconic Cathedral Group, will be closed to the public as aerial gunners contracted by the park spend up to a week locating and shooting at the approximately 100 goats, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. We're trying to be efficient and effective – so doing this as fast as possible in the most efficient way – and we believe that the aerial operations does that, park spokeswoman Denise Germann said. She had no prediction about how many animals would be targeted but said it's possible that at least one more week of aerial shooting will occur, depending on how this operation goes.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State medical groups are sponsoring a video contest to explain why it's important to wear a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Alabama Department of Public Health, the Alabama Hospital Association and the Medical Association of the State of Alabama are sponsoring the Mask Up Alabama video contest. A Health Department news release says the contest is for Alabamians of all ages to share why they feel it is important to wear a mask. The videos should be 30 seconds or less and need to highlight basic information related to mask-wearing and COVID-19. The deadline for submissions is noon Jan. 11. There is no fee to enter the contest, and the full rules can be found on the Health Department website. A statewide panel of judges will pick the top 10, and then the five winners will be chosen through a public online voting process. The first-place winner will receive $600, and the second- and third-place winners will receive $400 and $200 respectively. Two other honorable mention videos will be posted online along with the winners' videos for use by media outlets and on social media.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services says it has allocated $3.2 million in federal coronavirus relief aid to hire two public relations firms based in Anchorage to help with coronavirus communications across the state. Blueprint Alaska LLC was first contracted in June and is expected to work until April, and Brilliant Media Strategies was first contracted in October and is expected to work through June, Alaska's News Source reports. Blueprint Alaska was initially awarded a two-month, $440,000 contract approved by department communications director Clinton Bennett and deputy commissioner Sana Efird through emergency procedures that allowed the firm to bypass the normal competitive bidding process. The contract has since been extended three times, and the firm can be paid up to $1 million for its services, department officials said. Elizabeth Manning, department communications manager, said those services include messaging on social media, mailing information to residents, and setting up events related to safety guidelines and vaccine distribution.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State health officials have reported 5,158 new cases of COVID-19 and three additional deaths. The latest figures released Monday by the Arizona Department of Health Services come as the number of people hospitalized due to the virus hits a new high. Officials say 54% of inpatient hospitalizations across the state are COVID-19-related. The number of patients in intensive care units due to the virus is also at a record high for Arizona. According to state health officials, only 7% of ICU beds remain available. The crush of COVID-19 patients has caused some Phoenix- and Tucson-area hospitals to suspend elective surgeries and turn away ambulance patients or transfers from other hospitals, while still accepting walk-in patients needing emergency care. Hospital officials have discussed triage protocols that the state could order to decide which patients get access to limited resources.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of hospitalized patients with the coronavirus remained at a record level Sunday as Arkansas continued to grapple with a surge in virus cases. There were 1,234 people hospitalized with the virus Sunday, up from Saturday's record level of 1,216 hospitalizations, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. The state also saw 2,033 more cases of the virus and 20 more deaths, Hutchinson said. New cases lead to increased hospitalizations, which affect anyone needing treatment in a hospital, not just those with COVID-19, he said. Over the past two weeks, there were 1,056 new cases per 100,000 people in Arkansas, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. That ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins. One in every 162 people in Arkansas tested positive for the virus in the past week.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The pandemic is getting worse in Los Angeles as the coronavirus spreads rapidly within households and Californians let their guard down, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said Sunday that the nation's most populous county is recording a new COVID-19 case every six seconds. Garcetti said on the CBS program Face the Nation that he's concerned news of a vaccine rollout has made everybody so hopeful that they feel they can relax their behavior. We cannot. We cannot let up, the mayor said. This is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion. Overall, Los Angeles County is seeing high compliance of mask-wearing and people abiding by stay-home orders, Garcetti said. Despite that, the state is reporting enormous numbers of new cases, including more than 12,400 in Los Angeles County on Sunday. This is the fastest acceleration of new cases than at any other time during the pandemic, the LA County Department of Public Health said in a weekend statement. The county, which has a fourth of the state's population of nearly 40 million, has seen 40% of its virus deaths.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A statewide relief fund for those in need because of the coronavirus pandemic has been taken offline after raising nearly $23 million since March. The Colorado COVID Relief Fund website indicates contributions aren't currently being accepted, and a statement on the site says that over 12,000 generous Coloradans have stepped up to support our neighbors at times of greatest need. The website provides an email address for those who want to continue contributing to relief efforts. Elizabeth Kosar, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jared Polis, wrote in an email to The Denver Post that a seventh round of grants was recently distributed. Conversations are underway with the philanthropic community and the Legislature about the best way to sustain support for Coloradans for the recovery phase of the pandemic in a more permanent infrastructure, so this will likely be our last round, she said. The fund was started in March with $2.8 million. At the time, the governor said the money would be spent on medical supplies, volunteer services, nursing home and homeless shelter staffing, cleaning supplies, and helping struggling workers, families and small businesses to help weather the storm of coronavirus.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The leader of Connecticut's largest teachers union is urging school superintendents statewide to switch all classes to remote learning until at least the middle of this month, citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Jeff Leake, president of the Connecticut Education Association, said many students and educators were to return to classrooms Monday, before potential virus surges from the holiday season are over. He said many school districts already have moved to strictly distance learning through mid-January. While no one is more eager to return to the classroom than Connecticut's dedicated teachers, detecting and stopping the spread of COVID-19 must be the top priority, Leake said in a statement Sunday evening. He also called on the state to mandate more coronavirus testing and said a new survey by his union and the American Federation of Teachers shows that schools are not the safest places for children or educators amid a pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont and state education officials have been allowing local school officials to decide whether to switch to all-remote learning but have been advocating for schools to be kept open, saying it's better for students.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state's poultry processing plants and health officials say they are well-prepared for a winter surge of coronavirus cases. Dr. Rick Pescatore, the Delaware Division of Public Health's chief physician, said the implementation of best practices is mostly complete. DPH cultivated a close relationship with the plants as they rolled out coronavirus testing for employees in late spring. We've been able to strengthen our relationships with the poultry companies and others, and so we've been able to empower them throughout the year to take this on, Pescatore said. Poultry workers also fall into the category of critical infrastructure personnel. Pescatore said they would be some of the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine. But vaccination will most likely be on a volunteer basis and not required as a condition of employment.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 2,000 faith leaders and religious activists are calling on members of Congress to honor the result of November's election and avoid a delayed and drawn out objection this week when President-elect Joe Biden's win is set to be certified. Signatories to the statement released Monday include many prominent religious liberals, such as Barbara Williams-Skinner, co-convener of the National African American Clergy Network, and the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of Washington's Episcopal diocese. Also signing on are a handful of evangelicals who have criticized President Donald Trump despite his overwhelming popularity among white evangelical voters, including World Vision president emeritus Rich Stearns. As faithful citizens, we are praying for a peaceful, smooth, and dignified transfer of power, said the statement, whose signatories were shared with the Associated Press ahead of their release. A delayed and drawn out objection on January 6th would not overturn the will of the American people and change the outcome of the election, it said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state posted nearly 10,400 new coronavirus infections, and the state's death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic ticked upward by nearly 100, the Florida Health Department reported Sunday. Since the outbreak began, the state has recorded more than 1.3 million of its 21 million residents infected with the disease. In all, 21,987 have died. As of Sunday morning, 6,956 people were hospitalized because of COVID-19. The new numbers come after a record surge in new cases. On New Year's Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. On Saturday, health officials reported a two-day total 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus and 217 new deaths.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 21.2% as 56,334 cases were reported. The previous week had 46,488 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Georgia ranked No. 8 among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Within Georgia, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Upson, Pike and Hancock counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Gwinnett County, with 5,089 cases; Cobb County, with 4,226 cases; and Fulton County, with 4,153. Weekly case counts rose in 137 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week's pace were in Gwinnett, Cobb and DeKalb counties. The share of Georgia test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.1% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows. In the latest week, 218,514 tests were administered; a week earlier, that figure was 277,425.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaii's optional coronavirus notification app is expected to launch statewide Wednesday. The AlohaSafe Alert app aims to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by notifying users about potential exposure to someone who tests positive for the virus, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. When the app senses another app in use nearby, the devices will exchange a secure, random, anonymous code. A person's location, name and other identifiable information would not be included. A user who tests positive would get a text message with the option to notify other app users who may have been exposed. The notification would go out to all users who were within 6 feet of the person who tested positive for at least 15 minutes. The app has already launched on the Big Island, Lanai and Maui. For me, the big takeaway is this is one other way that we can start protecting our island against the coronavirus and keep all of us safe, Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said. He acknowledged that not everyone will use the app but called it an extra tool that will speed up contact tracing.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials have released a new plan involving methods to deal with a microscopic pest in southeastern Idaho that threatens the state's billion-dollar industry that supplies a third of the nation's potatoes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture late last week released the final rule that takes effect at the end of January. It sets out years­long criteria for killing off the pests and reopening quarantined fields to production. The new rule follows a 2018 court decision in a lawsuit filed by potato farmers that found the U.S. government illegally quarantined some Idaho potato fields infested with the pale cyst nematode first discovered in 2006. Farmers with quarantined fields aren't allowed to sell potatoes grown in them. Nematodes feed on potato roots and can reduce crop production by 80%. When the pests were first discovered, Canada, Mexico and Korea would not accept Idaho potatoes, and Japan banned all U.S. potatoes. The countries ultimately lifted their bans, the latest coming late in 2017 when Japan opened its market again.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Central Illinois Foodbank plans to use an anonymous donor's $500,000 gift to expand its reach during a time of growing need amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, its leader says. Outside of grants, the donation is the single largest gift in the food bank's 38-year history, and the gift's timing is impeccable, said Pam Molitoris, its executive director. She said the donation will be used to address the growing need for food assistance throughout the group's 21-county service area as the pandemic's economic impact continues into 2021. The timing is impeccable as we think of gearing up for possibly an extended period of time of high need, Molitoris said. This gives us that motivation and that inspiration that we can get it done. The food bank distributes over 10 million pounds of food annually to more than 160 food pantries, soup kitchens, residential programs and after-school programs in its region. Since March, the group has provided food at 85 drive-thru distribution events in underserved urban and rural areas. The food bank has increased its distribution by nearly 2 million pounds, a 25% increase since the same time last year.\n\nIndiana\n\nWhiting: Some Illinois residents fed up with their state's second ban on indoor dining amid the pandemic are heading to restaurants in adjacent Indiana so they can dine out with others. Restaurants in Illinois towns like Calumet City and Lansing that border northwest Indiana say they are seeing customers lured away by Indiana eateries not subject to the same restrictions, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Sylvia Coco, who owns Kilroy's and Dixie Kitchen and Bait Shop in Lansing, said her business is off substantially, perhaps more than than 50%, and one constant has been the looser rules for restaurants and bars in the Hoosier State. Indiana is pretty much open and doing whatever they want, Coco said. Tom Dabertin, a board member of the Whiting-Robertsdale Chamber of Commerce, said he's noticed the influx of Illinois diners. We're seeing increased business in both restaurants and stores, even at local drive-thrus, he said. We're seeing a lot more traffic and revenue due to the bans in Illinois. People come here to eat a meal and then shop.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: As Iowans on food stamps are set to receive increased benefits under a new stimulus package signed into law Dec. 27, those seeking to use their electronic benefit transfer cards to order groceries online are seeing their options grow. Aldi, in partnership with the delivery service Instacart, on Dec. 17 became the latest grocery chain to offer the service to Iowa participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. The chain joined two large retailers, Amazon and Walmart. During the pandemic, more retailers in Iowa have joined other states in a pilot program to allow for grocery delivery and curbside pickup to participants in SNAP, an option long unavailable for them. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend limiting visits to grocery stores and using online services when possible. Food Bank of Iowa president and CEO Michelle Book said that in addition to helping people remain safely at home during the pandemic, broadening options for ordering groceries online using EBT payments will help those who lack transportation and would have to spend considerable time on a bus to travel to a supermarket.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Topeka Presbyterian Manor began giving the COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff Saturday, as part of a watershed moment in nursing homes' fight against the coronavirus that has ravaged their communities. As part of a partnership with CVS, the retirement community began administering the first round of vaccinations Thursday to at-risk residents in health care and assisted living, as well as essential health care workers. There's no doubt the senior population has been hit hard by the virus, along with the health care workers who've treated them, Heather Pilkinton, executive director at Topeka Presbyterian Manor, said in a release. We couldn't be happier to know there's finally a bit of light at the end of such a difficult year. As part of the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, CVS is administering the Pfizer version of the COVID-19 vaccine to Kansas' retirement homes and communities. Nursing homes first began distributing shots Dec. 28. All of those receiving vaccines in the next few days will need to receive a second dose 21 days after their first inoculation.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: After months of watching mostly from the sidelines as Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear doled out pandemic relief and issued orders to combat the spread of the coronavirus, Republican lawmakers are ready to put their own imprint on policymaking in Kentucky. Republicans begin this year's legislative session in an increasingly dominant position after expanding their House and Senate supermajorities in the 2020 election. Wielding the power to override any Beshear veto, Republicans will be able shape legislation to their liking, including bills dealing with COVID-19 or policies for the post-pandemic world as vaccines roll out to more people. They've signaled their intent to rein in some of the governor's emergency powers. The General Assembly convenes its 30-day session Tuesday. Passing another state budget tops the agenda – a heavy lift after lawmakers opted to pass a one-year budget, rather than the traditional two-year spending plan, in 2020 because of uncertainties caused by the pandemic. Other virus-related issues are also expected to receive considerable attention. Those include efforts to provide protections from lawsuits for businesses that followed virus protocols.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has unveiled the list of 107 pharmacies that will begin offering the coronavirus vaccine this week to people ages 70 and older. With demand certain to outstrip limited supplies and interest running so high, the state website crashed within minutes of the information's release Monday. The Louisiana Department of Health quickly reworked the website to get the list back online. Hoping to avoid long lines seen in other states with people awaiting vaccination, the agency stressed that appointments for the immunizations are required. Still, people started showing up at their local pharmacies and inundating them with phone calls days ahead of the expanded eligibility, seeking vaccines for themselves or elderly family. Gov. John Bel Edwards' administration called for patience. Patients who arrive without an appointment will not be vaccinated. Do not arrive at a location without an appointment, the health department said as it announced the list. An estimated 640,000 people in Louisiana are newly eligible for the shot this week, but only about 10,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine were initially shipped to the state's pharmacies for this cohort, leaving each pharmacy with no more than about 100 doses available to their customers.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A group of Republican lawmakers plans to travel to the Statehouse on Tuesday to call on their colleagues to get back to work, accusing Democratic leaders of dragging their feet. Legislative leaders countered that the work already is underway and that the appropriations committee is meeting Tuesday. Republicans protested in the summer and fall when the Legislature failed to reach a consensus for reconvening during the pandemic. The current plan is for the bulk of committees to convene in a few weeks. Republican Rep. Shelley Rudnicki, of Fairfield, said her group will gather in the House Chamber to make a point. We are a co-equal branch of government, and the governor is making decisions without any input from the Legislature. It's time for us to get to work, said Rudnicki, who accused the governor of unprecedented and draconian actions while the Legislature was sidelined. Republicans decried some of Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' executive orders imposed because of COVID-19, but the Legislature failed to reconvene when Republicans and Democrats couldn't agree on the scope of work to be conducted. Rudnicki acknowledged Tuesday's action is a symbolic gesture since both chambers are controlled by Democrats.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Students in central Maryland will continue to attend school virtually at a time about half of the students in the nation will be able to go back to their school buildings. The Baltimore Sun reports there is no clear idea of when those Maryland students might get back to in-person classes. Few students in suburban Maryland counties have been back inside a school during the pandemic. Experts say the reasons include politics, union opposition, and the failure of federal and state leaders to set clear guidelines as the pandemic began. Meanwhile, a contingent of some parents are furious that schools aren't open. And they say they've sent emails and letters and held protests with no success. Maryland's governor and state superintendent have advocated for schools to reopen. But they have stopped short of ordering schools to open because they say that it is up to local school boards and superintendents.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Dozens of positive coronavirus cases have been traced back to Christmas services at a church, authorities said. The Woburn Board of Health has been working with the state to notify people who attended one of four services Dec. 23-24 at Genesis Community Church in Woburn, Mayor Scott Galvin told The Boston Globe. The church is cooperating with authorities, the mayor said. At least 44 cases have been traced to the church, authorities said. Genesis said in a statement that it is encouraging anyone who attended the services to get tested, whether symptomatic or not, and helping those who need to quarantine to prevent further transmission. Services are now being held online. We are deeply saddened to learn that people within Genesis tested positive for COVID-19 and we are doing all we can to make sure this does not spread any further, the statement said. Under state guidelines, houses of worship are limited to 25% of capacity. The church said it took proper precautions, including preregistration to attend and requring masks and social distancing.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarquette: The state's Upper Peninsula turned into a COVID-19 hot spot during the latest surge as nearly 1,400 children got sick from the virus, overall infections tripled, and deaths spiked even more – all while many infected Yoopers went to work, church and weddings when they were symptomatic, ignored social distancing and refused to cooperate with contact tracers, according to new data obtained through open records requests. In the past two and a half months alone, more than 13,500 people in the U.P. contracted the novel coronavirus, a threefold increase since the pandemic began in March, the data shows. The death toll during this second wave was even starker: 337 dead in 10 weeks, compared to 46 deaths in the previous seven months. Children were especially hard-hit: 1,388 schoolchildren got COVID-19 in the second wave, compared to 149 in the previous seven months. This harrowing U.P. snapshot is based on new, demographical data obtained by Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation's Documenting COVID-19 project in collaboration with the Detroit Free Press.\n\nMinnesota\n\nVerndale: A central Minnesota restaurant owner has turned one of the state's favorite winter shelters into an indoor-outdoor dining experience during the coronavirus pandemic. Brian Hagen, who owns the Pirates Den on busy U.S. Highway 10 in Verndale, is serving his meals in fish houses. As the temperature last week dipped into single digits, patrons could be seen basking in the glow of space heaters in the kind of village usually spotted on wintertime Minnesota lakes, the Star Tribune reports. We love it! It just feels so Minnesotan, said Becky Munston, who made the 30-mile trip from Perham to celebrate the birthdays of her husband, Mike, and their friend Tim Wacker. Hagen said his phone has been ringing off the wall since he posted his plan on Facebook. Also the owner of a fish house manufacturing company, Hagen said the idea came to him when he looked at some unsold fish houses in his inventory. People are fed up with the COVID and the shutdown, he said. They want to get out, have a cocktail, have a meal prepared for them.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: A new device aimed at helping in the recovery of people with COVID-19 shows promising results, says a doctor who has been using the device. Dr. Brian Rifkin, a nephrologist with Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg who is working with pulmonologist Dr. Steven Stogner, said the Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter has helped most of the patients who have received the treatment as part of their recovery. We have treated 17 patients to date, he said in an email. Twelve have been discharged, four are still hospitalized and one died of complications unrelated to COVID or Seraph treatment. In general, it only takes one treatment, which lasts four to six hours, to begin seeing results, Rifkin said, with patients beginning to see improvement in the first 48 hours after treatment. The filter works in a manner similar to dialysis, which removes blood from a patient, filters it and reintroduces the cleansed blood to the patient's bloodstream. A dialysis filter has pores to remove waste and water from the body in a patient with kidney failure, Rifkin said. The Seraph filter, in contrast, has coated beads that bind various particles.\n\nMissouri\n\nO'Fallon: A 32-year-old assistant prosecutor in the Kansas City area has died from the coronavirus. Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney Jean Peters Baker said on Twitter that JoEllen Engelbart died Saturday. Engelbart is among 5,562 Missourians who have died from COVID-19. The state passed the 400,000 mark in confirmed cases over the weekend and added another 1,196 cases Monday, bringing the total to 402,957. The state reported no new deaths Monday. Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox said Monday's numbers may have been affected by limited reporting from counties due to the New Year's holiday. While many hospitals across Missouri remain dangerously crowded with COVID-19 patients, the numbers have stabilized enough in recent weeks that St. Louis County on Monday allowed indoor dining to start again, albeit with restrictions. Under the new order, capacity is limited to 25%. Another provision requires the establishments to maintain records of a customer's name and contact information in case contact tracing becomes necessary. That provision has drawn criticism from some, including Republican County Councilman Tim Fitch.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: New Gov. Greg Gianforte has signaled he won't continue a statewide mask mandate in place since July, though he said he plans to wear a mask himself and get vaccinated against COVID-19. If Gianforte, a Republican, reverses former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock's mask order, Montana will be just the second state after Mississippi to lift its mandate. Thirty-eight states now have statewide mandates. I trust Montanans with their health and the health of their loved ones, Gianforte said in a recent interview with Kaiser Health News. The state has a role in clearly communicating the risks of who is most vulnerable, what the potential consequences are, but then I do trust Montanans to make the right decisions for themselves and their family. Gianforte has said he plans to announce his COVID-19 policy for the state the week he assumes office, according to the Associated Press. He was sworn in Monday, becoming the state's first Republican governor in 16 years. Montana is the only state where control of the governor's office is changing parties as a result of November's election. And among the 11 governors being sworn in this month, Gianforte will be the only one new to managing his state's response to the pandemic.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials who are leading the state's pandemic response said Monday that they expect a large increase in coronavirus vaccinations over the next two weeks after a slowdown over the holidays. Nebraska has given 36,360 vaccinations so far out of the 94,697 doses in its possession, according to new data on the state's tracking portal. Most who have received initial doses at this point are front-line health care workers who were given first priority. Nebraska began vaccinating people Dec. 15 but saw sharp drops in daily doses administered Dec. 25 and the two following days. The numbers rose to roughly 3,000 per day afterward but dropped again to 1,579 on Jan. 1, according to the data. Certainly we would like to see more vaccines go out more quickly, but if you look at relative to what's going on in the rest of the country and the holidays and everything, we expect we'll see a pickup in the pace of vaccines, Gov. Pete Ricketts said at a news conference. Ricketts said the slowdown was compounded by health care workers who took time off for the holidays and weren't available to get vaccinated.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Instruction resumes Monday in Las Vegas-area schools, but most students won't be in classrooms. Nearly all the more than 330 campuses in the sprawling Clark County School District will return to the distance-learning programs adopted last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The district is among the largest in the U.S., with more than 300,000 students, and a Las Vegas Review-Journal report found that most of the other nine have restored at least some in-person instruction. Clark County school trustees are approaching a decision Jan. 14 about whether to adopt a phased-transition timetable for reopening Las Vegas-area campuses, even with COVID-19 case numbers continuing to surge. An agreement last month between district administrators and the teachers union calls for a phased return to in-person classes, starting with preschool through third graders. District Superintendent Jesus Jara has said a date for resuming in-class instruction will be depend on the coronavirus pandemic, and the best-case scenario could see some students in class in February.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Turkey sightings are on the rise in the state, possibly because of the coronavirus pandemic. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said results from its 2020 winter survey reflect 2,309 flocks totaling 40,476 turkeys statewide. That was more than four times as many turkeys counted in 2019 and twice as many as reported in 2018. With many people spending more time at home last winter, there was an increase in backyard bird feeding as well as bird watching, which may have contributed to the uptick in reports, said Allison Keating, a state turkey biologist. More than 46,000 people have tested positive for the virus in New Hampshire, including more than 1,300 confirmed cases announced Sunday that include numbers for several days. Eleven additional deaths were announced, bringing the total to 780. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Hampshire decreased over the past two weeks, going from 766 new cases per day Dec. 19 to 750 new cases per day Saturday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Attorney General's Office has convened a grand jury that is investigating state-run veterans homes – where 202 people have died from COVID-19 – for possible criminal charges. A subpoena and letter dated Oct. 23 from the office's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit demand that a records custodian from the New Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus supply a litany of documents to investigators and possibly appear before a state grand jury to give testimony. It is not known whether the grand jury is focusing exclusively on the veterans homes in Paramus, Menlo Park and Vineland or is also looking at other nursing homes statewide with high numbers of deaths, as Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced he would do last spring. Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, said Monday that he would not offer any specifics on the investigation. The Paramus and Menlo Park facilities have seen a combined 191 residents and two caregivers die from COVID-19 since the pandemic began in March – among the highest COVID-19 death tolls at nursing homes across the nation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: More than 230,000 residents have signed up since the state launched its vaccination registration website two weeks ago, state health officials said Monday. The New Mexico Department of Health said the site has been updated to allow people to complete a comprehensive profile that includes personal medical conditions, employment information and other data. Officials said the site was created to help manage distribution once more vaccines become available. Those who register will be notified when they become eligible and shots are available in their area. Health Secretary Dr. Tracie Collins has said the state is working on plans for distribution to groups beyond the initial waves of front-line health care workers and staff and residents at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Our highest priorities remain the same: ensuring that vaccine goes to those who are most exposed to infected people or infectious materials, and preventing vaccine from going to waste, Collins said in a statement issued Monday. The state also plans to launch a call center to provide additional support for those who wish to register or ask questions about the process.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that he won't receive the coronavirus vaccine until the general public – including Black, Hispanic and poor New Yorkers in his age group – is able to receive it. Cuomo made the pledge during recorded remarks to the congregation at Abyssinian Baptist Church. Race or income will not determine who lives and who dies, he said. I move around a lot and come into contact with many people, and I would feel much safer if I took the vaccine, but I will not take the vaccine until the vaccine is available for my group in Black, Hispanic and poor communities around the state. Cuomo is considered an essential, public-facing worker and would be eligible to receive the vaccine in the second phase of distribution, along with high-risk, elderly members of the general public. Subsequent phases will prioritize high-risk and low-risk members of the general public. Cuomo noted that the pandemic has exposed racial disparities in the health care system, both in the availability of testing and in the rates of infection and fatalities. Black people have died at double the rate of whites and Hispanics at one and a half times the rate, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State education officials recently estimated educators can't account for about 10,000 to 15,000 public school students this school year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers and educators worry more students are falling through cracks in the system than is presently known, as the coronavirus pandemic upends students' learning plans and keeps some out of virtual or physical classrooms. David Stegall, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction's deputy superintendent of innovation, told lawmakers last month that a survey the state conducted of some districts concluded that the whereabouts of about 0.7% to 1% of the state's 1.5 million K-12 public school students are unknown. This happens when a school has lost contact with a student, often because the student dropped out without alerting the school or moved elsewhere without the parent notifying the school or responding to repeated requests to get their kid back in class. If a student misses at least 10 consecutive days of school in North Carolina, they are typically unenrolled, and the school works to account for them.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state's efforts to make its legislative session safer during the coronavirus pandemic should also make it easier for citizens to observe the proceedings and participate in government, leaders and longtime observers say. Legislative leaders have spent more than $2.6 million in federal COVID-19 relief money to beef up livestreaming and remote technology to allow people to watch committee meetings and floor sessions in real time. The public will be able to give remote testimony and not have to worry about driving to Bismarck in the middle of winter. They will be able to follow certain issues that they're interested in from the committee room to the chamber, and if it passes and goes to the next chamber, they'll know everything that's said, everything that's done, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner, who spearheaded the upgrades. House and Senate floor sessions have been livestreamed, archived and indexed online since 2013, The Bismarck Tribune reports. But much of the action, including hearings on bills, takes place in committee meetings, North Dakota Newspaper Association attorney Jack McDonald said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The newly elected state Senate president will be sworn into office from his home Monday after contracting COVID-19 over the holidays. Senate President Matt Huffman experienced mild symptoms before the new year and is doing well, spokesperson John Fortney said. Huffman, a Republican from Lima, joins a list of more than a dozen Ohio lawmakers who have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began in March. Huffman was chosen to succeed former Senate President Larry Obhof for the 134th General Assembly following a session filled with pandemic-related hurdles, a federal bribery scheme and infighting within the majority party. Fortney said Huffman will return to the Statehouse after following CDC quarantine guidelines and Senate policy. The Ohio Statehouse has become the scene of a partisan divide over mask-wearing in recent months, with Republicans continuing to push down Democrats' motions to require all Statehouse staff to wear masks while in session and committees.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has set a new record for COVID-19 deaths in a week, as health officials on Sunday reported more than 8,000 new cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus over two days. Oklahoma had 170 deaths from COVID-19 over the prior seven days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The previous one-week record of 168 deaths was set in early December. State health officials recorded 5,002 new cases of the virus Saturday and another 3,015 on Sunday, as well as 20 additional deaths. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. There were more than 36,000 active cases of the virus in Oklahoma and 1,910 people hospitalized with it Sunday, according to the State Department of Health. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Oklahoma has come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: An anti-mask rally is planned for Saturday outside the WinCo Foods store in south Salem after an employee allegedly denied service to a customer who refused to wear a mask. WinCo stores, like many businesses, have adopted a policy requiring customers and employees to wear masks inside the store. Their policy allows for some medical exemptions. It is unclear whether a video of the incident – titled Senior Citizen Denied Food at WinCo Grocery Store for Not Bowing to the Mask Police – is connected to a string of videos showing people entering businesses in Oregon and refusing to put on masks while filming employees. The video was posted on YouTube and Parler, a microblogging website favored by conspiracy theorists, right-wing extremists and those fleeing what they claim is censorship on other social media sites. The rally, set to take place outside the store at 1 p.m. Saturday, comes in the wake of a string of right-wing protests that have resulted in violence, arrests and property damage in Salem.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Along with once again being able to dine indoors, Pennsylvanians were able to go to the gym or watch a movie at a theater starting Monday, under an easing of restrictions by Gov. Tom Wolf. The updated state guidance is the next step in the state's relaxation of the closures Wolf put in place in December to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Our mitigation efforts over the past several weeks are working, and I thank everyone who abided by the restrictions put in place to protect us, Wolf said. Every time we make a small decision to avoid risk – or take steps to make our actions a little bit less risky – we are helping to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. But just because a business or church can open doesn't mean it will. Wolf has encouraged Pennsylvanians to stay home as much as possible and continues to urge vulnerable residents, such as those over 65 or with preexisting medical conditions, to remain home as much as possible. And while much of the focus has been on the restaurant industry, museums, aquariums and wedding reception venues are among the other businesses allowed to reopen.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A recently retired state Supreme Court justice has tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting a change in at least two swearing-in ceremonies. Francis X. Flaherty, who retired Dec. 31, was supposed to swear in new Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Warwick Mayor-elect Frank Picozzi on Tuesday. News of the positive test came in a news release about Picozzi's ceremony. On his Facebook page, Picozzi said he has spoken with Flaherty, and he's as disappointed as I am. District Court Judge Stephen Isherwood will take Flaherty's place. House spokesman Larry Berman said Monday that Flaherty called Shekarchi on Saturday to advise him that he would not be able to administer the oath of office to him. Supreme Court Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg will step in for Flaherty to swear in the speaker.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The superintendent of the state's public schools said Monday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and was experiencing mild symptoms but would continue to do her work from home. Cases of the virus have rocketed to record highs in South Carolina recently, and the news of Superintendent Molly Spearman's positive test came the same day the state's 780,000 public school students returned to classes following the holiday break. In a tweet, Spearman said she learned Sunday that she had tested positive for the virus Dec. 31 and is fortunate to have only mild symptoms. Spearman said she had already been quarantining after her husband and son tested positive earlier last week. While isolating, Spearman said, I plan to continue to work from home and meet virtually as so many others in the education community have done this school year. Just before Christmas, Gov. Henry McMaster's office announced that the 73-year-old Republican had tested positive and would receive outpatient monoclonal antibody treatment for mild symptoms. His wife, 73-year-old Peggy McMaster, also tested positive but was asymptomatic. A spokesman said Monday that both were out of isolation and feeling well.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: One of the state's largest hospital systems announced Monday that it is planning to increase testing for the coronavirus, as the state saw a drop in new cases but a high positivity rate of testing. Monument Health, the largest health care provider in western South Dakota, plans to test more people who do not have symptoms of COVID-19, including running mass testing events. Hospital administrators said the availability of testing supplies has improved in recent weeks. The state Department of Health reported 111 new coronavirus infections and no new deaths Monday after the New Year's holiday weekend, for the lowest daily tally in three months. But the positivity rate of RT-PCR tests, which detect the virus's genetic material, topped 16%. Emily Leech, Monument Health's director of laboratory services, said a community's test positivity rate should ideally be below 5%. We're doing everything we can to increase testing in our communities, she said in a statement. Monument said its volume of testing in December was about half the rate in November, when the state saw a surge of cases.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city's once-thriving party scene – a hefty chunk of its economic base – took yet another direct hit in the Christmas morning bombing that tore up blocks in the center of downtown. In the hours after the attack, tourism and marketing officials rushed to cancel a new ad campaign, already delayed as coronavirus cases surged, aimed at luring out-of-town visitors. Now the question of when tourists will be welcomed back is weighing heavy on minds and pocketbooks across town. We're predicting January and February tourism to be virtually nonexistent, said Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. CEO Butch Spyridon. The only thing I know is it will be bad. Many honky-tonks, bars and restaurants that managed to limp through the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns are now unsure when they can safely reopen. Honky-tonk owner Steve Smith said he's so frustrated that he's losing sleep and called on Mayor John Cooper to reinstate regular hours. The city is in the third phase of its COVID-19 reopening strategy, and bars and restaurants must have last call at 10 p.m. Downtown business owners have argued for months that it's safer to allow them to operate as much as possible with social distancing measures so people aren't having parties at homes or other places where they're in closer proximity.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas Capitol, shuttered to the public since the coronavirus pandemic took root in March, reopened Monday with protocols in place aimed at minimizing the risk for new infections. At this time, a mask worn over the nose and mouth is required at all times inside the building, said an online message from the State Preservation Board, the agency that operates the buildings in the Capitol complex in the heart of Austin. The state will also provide no-cost coronavirus testing for anyone who wants it before they enter the building. Also, capacity will be limited, and social distancing is required. Only one of the four public entrances will be open. Before the building was officially reopened, a large tent was erected outside the entrance on the Capitol's north side to administer tests. Only a few visitors stopped by during the first hour of operation. The reopening comes just eight days before the start of the 2021 legislative session.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Republican Spencer Cox called for unity amid hateful rhetoric in national political discourse after being sworn in Monday as Utah's first new governor in more than a decade. Cox denounced misinformation and division that he said have further taken hold throughout the pandemic. As he stood in front of red rock in southwestern Utah, Cox referred to a group of anti-mask protestors who lined a road to the ceremony calling for an end to the state's coronavirus restrictions. We are more divided than at any time in our lifetimes as the news is filled with civil unrest and protests, including one right outside this venue here today, Cox said. We are facing a crisis of empathy, a scourge of contempt. Very little feels 'united' about the United States today. The new governor said that it's not too late and called on the state's residents to join together. Cox is succeeding Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who chose not to run for reelection after more than a decade in office. Cox, who became Herbert's lieutenant governor in 2013, won the gubernatorial election in November.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Legislature is getting ready to kick off the 2021 session with almost all of the pomp and circumstance occurring remotely. Even as late as Monday, some of the moving parts of the Wednesday opening of the 2021 session were still developing. Once lawmakers are sworn in and settle into their jobs, the primary focus of this session is expected to be the state's continued response to the coronavirus pandemic. We are trying to make it a normal first day of session, except that we are on Zoom, said Democratic state Rep. Jill Krowinski, the presumptive incoming speaker of the House. All of the same traditions will be happening. The House will be governing remotely for at least all of January and February, she said. The Senate will also be meeting remotely, but Lt. Gov.-elect Molly Gray will be sworn into office Thursday in the Senate chamber. Gray said she would then preside over her first session from the podium in the Senate chamber while senators will be attending remotely. Republican Gov. Phil Scott will be sworn in for his third term Thursday, after which he is scheduled to give his inaugural address.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: More than 1,400 long-term care facilities in the state are expected to receive doses of the coronavirus vaccine in the coming weeks. The Virginian-Pilot reports CVS and Walgreens will administer the vast majority of the doses. The pharmacy chains are partnering with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take vaccines directly to the facilities so residents don't have to travel. Virginia is putting front-line health care workers and long-term care residents in the top-tier priority group for immunizations. The state has received 388,000 vaccine doses collectively from Pfizer and Moderna. State health officials said nearly 65,000 vaccinations had been administered before New Year's Day. But that number is believed to be low because of lags in reporting. No one has received the complete two-shot series because injections must be spaced three or four weeks apart, depending on the brand. Long-term care facilities are also rushing to get consent forms signed by residents or the individuals who make decisions for them.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: King County is starting 2021 with plans to buy as many as a dozen hotels to permanently house hundreds of homeless people and provide them with services. We have every reason to believe that homelessness will get a lot worse after this pandemic unless we take bold action, said Leo Flor, director of the King County Department of Community and Human Services. The initiative is called Health Through Housing, KING5 reports. It uses revenue from a 0.1% sales tax increase to develop a network of apartment-like shelters, with the goal of getting people out of tents, off sidewalks and into safe, clean homes. The county hopes to eventually house 45%, or 2,000 people, of its chronically homeless population of 4,500. The goal for 2021 is to create housing units for 1,500 people countywide, in former hotels and nursing homes throughout the county. Flor said hotel owners are already approaching the county and offering their properties, which are struggling to fill rooms during the pandemic.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Officials announced Sunday that an officer at the Saint Marys Correctional Center in Pleasants County died Saturday while under treatment for COVID-19. Cpl. Mark Rustemeyer, 58, had worked at the prison since 1998. The prison has 253 active cases of the new coronavirus. Rustemeyer's was the first virus-related death of a state corrections employee.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Legislature kicked off its two-year session Monday with an inauguration unlike any before it, with Assembly Democrats skipping the event because they thought the COVID-19 precautions were inadequate. During the ceremony, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of Rochester announced he had reached a deal with his fellow Republicans who control the state Senate on new coronavirus legislation. He said he wanted to act on the bill this week, but he did not immediately release a copy of it. It was unclear if it could win the support of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who renewed a call earlier in the day for compromise legislation. For the Assembly's inauguration, members of both parties wore masks. In the Senate, Democrats wore them, but many Republicans did not. In both houses, lawmakers kept one or two desks between them to limit the spread of COVID-19. Democratic Sen. Lena Taylor of Milwaukee pleaded with Republicans who eschewed masks to think about Wisconsinites who are more vulnerable. Anybody in this body not wearing a mask does not care about my father, who has the blood type that is most susceptible, Taylor said. I have the right to tell you I do not appreciate the disregard for life.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: After closing last March through May in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Devils Tower National Monument has set visitation records every month since September. August saw more 113,000 people visit the park that month alone, more than 13,000 visitors than in 2019. September saw a record number of visits at 68,726, 6,000 more for the month than 2019. October continued the trend with nearly 30,000 people coming to the park, up from October 2019's 17,290 visitors. November typically sees a steep decline in tourists to Devils Tower. In 2020, more than 9,000 recreational visits were recorded – a nearly 110% spike over 2019. Overall, the park had seen 420,330 recreation visits last year through November, down only 7% from 2019 despite the pandemic's impact, the Gillette News Record reports. Ogden and Rosanne Driskill, owners of Devils Tower KOA campground, both said 2020 was by far the best year they've ever had in terms of business. The vast majority were distancing in an RV, were tired of sitting in a city, locked in a room where they couldn't get any fresh air, Ogden Driskill said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
A statewide task force assembled by Gov. Gavin Newsom to tackle the homelessness crisis in California is proposing an amendment to the state's constitution that would allow for sanctions on cities that fail to make progress in getting people off the streets.\n\nThe 13-member group, California's Council of Regional Homeless Advisors, is co-chaired by Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.\n\nWe've tried moral persuasion. We've tried economic incentives, Steinberg told the Los Angeles Times on Monday. But all of it's optional. Why should this be optional? It shouldn't be. It mustn't be. Thousands of people are dying on the streets, and people are telling us this is a priority.\n\nThe plan was announced Monday, the same day Newsom hit the road on a weeklong homelessness tour starting north of Sacramento in Nevada County, which will receive $1 million out of the $650 million emergency aid allocated in the state budget last year.\n\nThose funds are now being rolled out, and Newsom shared in his budget briefing last week that he hopes to add $1 billion this year to fund a statewide response to the crisis.\n\nHomelessness isn't just a concern in our cities, Newsom said in a statement, it's a suburban issue and a rural issue, too. No Californian can say that homelessness is someone else's problem.\n\nLater this week, he has plans to stop in the Inland Empire, Los Angeles, the Central Valley and the Bay Area.\n\nHomelessness has been on the rise in California, growing by more than 16% between 2018 and 2019, despite statewide efforts to find solutions. More than 150,000 Californians are currently without housing, the majority of whom sleep outside or in vehicles each night. The Bay Area city of Oakland, grappling with skyrocketing housing costs, has seen the most dramatic rise. Tent encampments line the sidewalks and fill freeway underpasses. In only two years, homelessness there increased by 47%.\n\nOakland's Mayor Libby Schaaf is a member of the task force and said the move will help coordinate and streamline efforts to ensure all jurisdictions do better.\n\nWhen something matters we make it the law, and it's time to make ending homelessness the law she said at the task force meeting.\n\nLocalities would be responsible for setting big goals with timelines. Jurisdictions that fall behind — including the state government itself — could find itself in legal trouble, and be sued by the state.\n\nThe California Legislature has until June 25 to approve a state constitutional amendment before it can be put to voters in a ballot measure this November. If enacted, California would be the first state to create such a mandate. There are no details yet on how much it would cost taxpayers.\n\nThe California State Association of Counties, an organization that represents California's 58 counties, offered cautious support but wants more information.\n\nCounties are the service providers in our communities and will continue to lead to tackle the crisis of our time, homelessness, the association wrote in a statement, calling the recommendations big and bold steps toward progress.\n\nA legally enforceable mandate can only work with clarity of who's obligated to do what and what new sustainable resources will fund it; that's the ticket for clear expectations and accountability, the association added.\n\nThe plan replaces a previous idea floated by Steinberg that recommended the state deploy a right-to-shelter model, a strategy used in New York that requires unhoused people to accept any available shelter offered. It was widely criticized by homeless advocates.\n\nMore:Homeless women fight to stay in Oakland house\n\nImplemented under former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the policy enabled the police to crack down on encampments and arrest anyone unwilling to stay in shelters.\n\nI believe we can avoid some of the undesirable aspects of the 'right to shelter' as it has manifested itself in New York, Ridley-Thomas told Politico last month after it was proposed. But I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that less people die on the streets in New York than they do in California.\n\nGabrielle Canon is a California Reporter for the USA Today Network, based in Sacramento.

Brant James\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nOne day before on-track activity begins for the 2017 season, NASCAR changed its deterrence policy to hone the process of discovering and punishing violations stemming from inspections failures.\n\nKey among the changes announced Thursday is the series issuing immediate penalties for violations that will impact a team's ability to compete on the weekend in which it was found non-compliant. Also, series inspectors will scrutinize cars only for engine, fuel system and safety compliance on a first check, which in theory would keep teams from finding the benchmark for how close their attempts to manipulate bodywork had come to the edge.\n\nTemplates will be checked at a pre-qualifying inspection and teams will be required to return to their garage stalls under watch from an official to make any necessary repairs.\n\nPHOTOS: HISTORY OF THE DAYTONA 500\n\nThe P1 through P6 penalty structure in use since 2014 will be eliminated to make enforcement immediate. Numerous penalty options will include lap penalties, loss of pit stall selection or practice time and series officials will be given leeway to levy penalties for repeated misconduct.\n\nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE:\n\nDenny Hamlin thinks new rules will eliminate Daytona hangover\n\nDanica Patrick's former sponsor plans to counter sue Stewart-Haas Racing\n\nThe most severe penalties – formerly P5 and P6 – now will be dubbed L1 and L2 and likely would be dealt with the following week, as has been the norm. Infractions in those areas include certified chassis, fuel storage, gear ratios, minimum weight and height, traction control, telemetry, electronic fuel injection, fuel additives, tires, illegal testing and fewer than 17 lug nuts. The lug nut issue still could invoke an encumbered finish for a race-winner.\n\nWarnings will no longer be issued for two failures of the Laser Inspection Station, but four offenses could lead to the loss of pit stall selection.\n\nFollow James on Twitter @brantjames
Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her decision not to donate money to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in protest of a policy to blacklist organizations that back Democratic candidates running against incumbents.\n\nI give quite a bit to fellow Dems - we've fundraised over $300,000 for others (more than my 'dues'), w/ over 50% going to swing seats, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Friday.\n\nDCCC made clear that they will blacklist any org that helps progressive candidates like me, she said. I can choose not to fund that kind of exclusion.\n\nThe New York congresswoman was reacting to an article by Fox News, which reported that some fellow House Democrats were upset with her decision not to pay the $250,000 dues. It also noted that there were 97 Democrats who hadn't paid as of records from October, but that more may have paid up before the end of the year.\n\nThe DCCC is the campaign arm of House Democrats. It made its policy official last year that it would not do business with vendors that work with Democratic caucus members' opponents. Ocasio-Cortez won her race in an upset over longtime incumbent former Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018.\n\nHow dues work: 'Extortion' or team effort? Lawmaker perspectives from 2016\n\nThe DCCC website says its mission is to support Democratic House candidates every step of the way to fortify and expand our new Democratic Majority. The DCCC assigns fundraising amounts to congress members based on their levels of leadership and committee assignments, and money is used to boost Democratic members in contested races.\n\nLawmakers can meet these quotas by either fundraising for the DCC or donating from their own campaign, though meeting the quotas isn't mandatory.\n\nSometimes the question comes: 'Do you want to be in a majority or do you want to be in the minority?' Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said of Ocasio-Cortez, according to Fox News. And do you want to be part of a team?\n\nOcasio-Cortez says that she's not the only one who doesn't pay the dues. She said she wants to raise money for progressive candidates by putting it straight into their pocket, according to Fox News. She raised more than any other House Democrat in the third quarter of 2019, according to reports.\n\nI'm happy to support some incumbents, but it's not just a blanket rule, she added.\n\nExpanding a House majority is critical, which is why I regularly (and happily) fundraise sizeable amounts for fellow members. I also believe that a Dem majority should be transformative, which is why I give strategically. Seems fair, no? Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nThis isn't the first time she's been critical of the DCCC. Last year, Ocasio-Cortez called on her supporters to pause donations to the DCCC in response to the policy.\n\nThe @DCCC's new rule to blacklist+boycott anyone who does business w/ primary challengers is extremely divisive & harmful to the party, Ocasio-Cotez tweeted in March. My recommendation, if you're a small-dollar donor: pause your donations to DCCC & give directly to swing candidates instead.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, another freshman Democrat part of the progressive group of congresswomen of color dubbed the Squad, also criticized the DCCC at the time.\n\nThe fact that I challenged an incumbent meant a lot of folks were told not to come anywhere near my campaign. But I was lucky to build a dynamic, innovative team of staff & consultants who understood the challenges our campaign faced, and who were willing to take a risk, Pressley said.\n\nThe policy risked undermining an entire universe of potential candidates and vendors - especially women and people of color - whose ideas, energy, and innovation need a place in our party, Pressley said.\n\nAOC:'In any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party'\n\nFor its part, the DCCC has raised $125 million in 2019, surpassing its record for a non-election year, according to CNN. Its chairwoman, Cheri Bustos, told Fox News that paying the dues is always up to individual members.\n\nWe're raising record amounts of money from our members, Bustos said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has criticized the Democratic Party as being too big of a tent, and set herself apart ideologically from more moderate members, saying that they would not be part of the same political party were it not for the United States' two-party system.\n\nShe has endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president.
Jon Campbell\n\nGannett\n\nALBANY, N.Y. — New York will study whether it's plausible to legalize marijuana for recreational use as neighboring states move ahead with it, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday.\n\nCuomo called on lawmakers to approve funding for a feasibility study as part of his annual state budget address, in which he laid out his spending proposal for the coming year.\n\nThe study would examine the effect legalization in Massachusetts, Vermont and possibly New Jersey would have on New York and what types of potential roadblocks could exist if the state were to relax its marijuana laws, particularly as the Trump administration has given prosecutors more leeway to prosecute federal-level marijuana laws.\n\nCuomo's announcement comes after at least nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized small amounts of marijuana for recreational use.\n\nMore:Illinois says it won't stop sick girl from using medical marijuana at school\n\nPreviously:Vermont's governor indicates he'll sign pot legalization bill headed to his desk\n\nThat includes two of New York's neighboring states: Massachusetts, whose voters approved legalized pot in 2016, and Vermont, where lawmakers voted in favor of it earlier this month.\n\nIncoming New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has also said he supports legalizing recreational marijuana.\n\nNew York's study would be led by the state Department of Health, which would work with State Police and other state agencies to examine the issue, Cuomo said.\n\nThis is an important topic, it is a hotly debated topic — pardon the pun — and it would be nice to have some facts in the middle of the debate once in a while, Cuomo said during his 40-minute address.\n\nNew York is one of 29 states to allow marijuana use for medical purposes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nMore:Marijuana sellers undeterred by threat of federal prosecution\n\nMore:Uncertainty roils American marijuana industry over feared federal crackdown\n\nBut New York's program is one of the most restrictive in the country. The drug is not permitted in smokable forms, with certified patients instead able to purchase items such as creams, oils and pills.\n\nCuomo has long expressed caution over relaxing the state's recreational marijuana laws, and many of the restrictions in the medical-marijuana program were insisted on by him.\n\nAs of Jan. 9, there were 40,934 certified patients in New York's medical-marijuana program, according to the state Department of Health.\n\nRobert Mujica, Cuomo's budget director, said neighboring states' moving ahead with regulated marijuana programs spurred the need for the new study.\n\nMore:How will legalizing marijuana impact police work?\n\nMore:Pot initiatives: Predicting the next 15 states to legalize marijuana\n\nI don't know how long it will take, Mujica said. We just announced it. But again, once the states around you start to regulate an activity or allow it, there is leakage, there are criminal justice impacts, there are economic impacts, and so we want to see what goes on.\n\nThe study was cheered by one of the marijuana companies active in New York's medical program.\n\nGovernor Cuomo's commission to legalize marijuana could be a game-changer that puts New York at the center of a national movement gaining momentum by the day, Hillary Peckham, chief operating officer of Etain Health Inc., said in a statement.\n\nFollow Jon Campbell on Twitter: @JonCampbellGAN
Bill McGee\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nThere's been ample coverage of how January's snowstorms led to widespread disruption of the nation's commercial aviation system, which airline tracking sites confirmed led to more than 12,000 canceled flights. We've seen the requisite video of empty airport terminals, and heard how vacations were disrupted and business trips were scrapped.\n\nBut while such disorder can be frustrating and expensive for adult travelers, consider how flight disruptions can affect unaccompanied minors as young as five years old. Allowing your child to fly alone is a choice that ultimately is up to each family, so understanding all the policies, procedures and risks is critical.\n\nWhat's more, there have been some changes made to the airlines' UM programs in recent years, and of course there are new fees — and fee hikes — for those who want their kids to travel alone. In addition to the fare, there's now a charge of $300 round-trip on the Big Three carriers.\n\nNew rules, new costs\n\nAmong U.S. scheduled passenger airlines, only Allegiant doesn't accept unaccompanied minors, and prohibits travelers under 15 from flying alone. As for the 10 largest domestic carriers, there are key differences in ages, fees and other policies, so it's critical to review the airline's rules (see below).\n\nLast month, United altered its UM policy, so that it now covers children five to 15 rather than five to 12. United therefore matched American's and Delta's age requirements, and the Big Three all charge the same fee of $150 each way.\n\nIn researching past policies, I found that about 15 years ago, all U.S. airlines cut off their UM programs for kids who had reached 11, 12 or 14. Cynics might be forgiven for concluding the trend toward expanding the upward age limits to 15 and 17 has coincided with the industry's ancillary fee revolution. That said, it should be noted there are considerable differences in such fees, ranging from a low of $25 on Alaska to a high of the aforementioned $150 on American, Delta and United.\n\nConsider the following comparison (all fees based on one-way travel, per child):\n\nAlaska: $25; $50 connecting flights\n\nHawaiian: $35 within Hawaii; $100 to/from North America\n\nSouthwest: $50\n\nVirgin America: $75 short-haul; $100 medium-haul/long-haul; $125 Mexico\n\nFrontier: $100\n\nJetBlue: $100\n\nSpirit: $100\n\nAmerican: $150\n\nDelta: $150\n\nUnited: $150\n\nIn addition to differences in fees, there are differences in rules concerning check-in, seating and prohibitions.\n\nThe risk factor\n\nEvery year there are media reports about UMs who are misplaced in the system; last summer it was an 11-year-old boy lost at Newark Liberty Airport and his family alleged United Airlines failed to provide a required escort. Most of these stories end with a safe return after anxious moments. There have been lawsuits and media accounts documenting alleged molestation incidents on flights, but these are extremely rare statistically.\n\nThe concern is that not every airplane always arrives when and where it is scheduled. As someone who worked in airline flight operations, I know the risk of a flight being canceled or diverted is statistically unlikely. Consider the U.S. Department of Transportation's most recent domestic airline delay statistics, which reflect November: During that month, 16% of domestic flights were delayed, while 1% were canceled and .2% were diverted to other airports.\n\nThankfully, the odds of a flight not operating to its destination are quite small, but those odds increase exponentially during irregular operations like last week's snowstorms or during summer thunderstorms. And unfortunately, most kids fly during the summer and winter breaks. What's more, for a variety of reasons, commercial aircraft are sometimes forced to divert en route, as we saw last week when an American Airlines flight from Miami to Milan encountered severe turbulence and landed in Newfoundland, or this week after an alleged altercation between flight attendants.\n\nThe question is, are all parents and caregivers aware of the risks of canceled and diverted flights? Ultimately the decision to allow a child to travel as a UM is a personal one, and can only be made on an individual basis. But considering ALL the risks should be a part of such equations.\n\nHelp on deciding\n\nFor those who are considering a UM program, here are some key suggestions.\n\n• Fly early in the day. The chances of not reaching a destination generally increase as the day grows longer, so early is best. In addition, some airlines — such as Delta — prohibit UMs on redeye flights between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.\n\n• Be clear about the differences between non-stop, direct and connecting flights, and don't confuse non-stop and direct (which generally includes stops but no change of aircraft). Always select non-stops if they're available, even if they're more expensive, but realize that some itineraries will require connections. Some airlines only allow younger UMs to fly on non-stops, but others permit it, so it could be up to you to choose the best flight options.\n\n• According to the DOT, regional airlines operating on behalf of larger domestic carriers have higher percentages of delayed, canceled and diverted flights.\n\n• An adult is generally allowed to accompany the child to the departure gate. But make sure the flight is airborne and en route before leaving.\n\n• Adults at both the departure and arrival airports should use airline apps to track the flight's progress in real time.\n\n• Discuss whether the child should carry a cellphone.\n\n• Policies vary, so inquire about the specifics: Who will accompany the child onto and off the aircraft? Where will the child sit? Will other passengers be called upon to assist the child? Upon arrival, should the child remain seated while all other passengers depart?\n\nThere is no shortage of online advice for speaking to your child about what to expect, as well as tips for how to dress, what to pack, etc. (With some airlines, snacks are included in the UM fee.) The DOT has created When Kids Fly Alone, a lengthy guide to understanding UM policies. AirSafe.com also offers safety tips. And Airlines for America, the industry lobbying group, offers travel tips for UMs as well.\n\nBill McGee, a contributing editor to Consumer Reports and the former editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, is an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher who worked in airline operations and management for several years.

The Justice Department's antitrust division leader sent a letter to NCAA President Mark Emmert on Friday that expresses strong concerns about the association's direction on rules regarding athletes' ability to transfer and to make money from the use of their names, images and likenesses.\n\nProposed changes in both areas are scheduled to be on the agenda of Monday's meeting of the Division I Council and Thursday's meeting of the Division I Board of Directors.\n\nBut in the letter — a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY Sports — Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim says one part of the NCAA's prospective approach to regulating athletes' involvement in name, image and likeness deals may raise concerns under the antitrust laws.\n\nMore generally addressing other rules that will remain in place, he wrote: Ultimately, the antitrust laws demand that college athletes, like everyone else in our free market economy, benefit appropriately from competition.\n\nDelrahim took the additional step of addressing the NCAA's desire for Congressional intervention now that six states have passed various name, image and likeness laws. The NCAA would like federal legislation requiring changes in the association's name, image and likeness rules to include protection from legal challenges to the alterations it makes as a result.\n\nVOTE DELAY:NCAA votes on landmark name, image and likeness rules changes could be delayed\n\nWhile the Division expresses no views on the need for any such legislation, Delrahim wrote, should Congress deem such legislative immunity necessary we would anticipate it will be the narrowest possible immunity and one that would contemplate a collective representation of college athletes' rights as a condition of any such immunity.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Delrahim said that he wrote the letter to Emmert in connection with the upcoming NCAA meetings, as well as conversations between Justice Department officials and the NCAA that cover several years.\n\nBecause we understand that the NCAA is considering changes to their rules, Delrahim said, we want them to benefit from the Antitrust Division's views as part of our ongoing dialogue, so as to avoid any misunderstanding on what the law requires.\n\nDelrahim's views on the NCAA are not new. He has expressed them in various forums as far back as 2018. He is an appointee who will be leaving the Justice Department just before the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. But his letter includes a closing reference to David Lawrence, a career official in the department who is chief of the Competition Policy and Advocacy Section. In the interview, Delrahim also expressed confidence in the likelihood of a continuity of approach to the NCAA by the Biden administration.\n\nThe transfer rule change would address the five remaining Division I sports in which athletes generally are prohibited from playing for one year if they change schools. Under the proposal, athletes in Bowl Subdivision football, men's and women's basketball, baseball and men's ice hockey would no longer have to sit out the first time they change schools.\n\nBut the letter takes issue with other aspects of the transfer process that are set to remain in place, and Delrahim, referencing prior interactions between the department and the NCAA, wrote:\n\nOur expectation is that our engagement with the NCAA over its transfer rules will … result in the NCAA's removal of unnecessary anticompetitive barriers that stand in the way of college athletes transferring between schools. Of course, the Division stands ready to enforce the antitrust laws if necessary.\n\nAthletes must notify their current school of their intention to transfer before contacting, or being contacted by, another school. And once athletes provide notice of their intent to transfer, NCAA rules allow schools to reduce or cancel their financial aid at the end of the ongoing academic term — or immediately if notice is given between academic terms.\n\nThus, Delrahim wrote, college athletes must risk losing their current scholarship – not to mention alienating their coaches — in order even to explore the possibility of transferring to a new school. The NCAA ... should consider seriously whether these rules, taken together, unreasonably deter students from entering the transfer process and, as a result, leave college athletes without a competitive alternative to their current school.\n\nDelrahim's letter uses equally strong language in addressing not only the NCAA's proposed approach to name, image and likeness.\n\nWhile the NCAA's proposed changes would give athletes new and significant abilities to make money from their name, image and likeness (NIL) and other activities, they include various restrictions and would require athletes to disclose their name, image and likeness activities to what is described as an independent third-party administrator. While numerous details about this entity remain undefined, the NCAA's required statement of rationale for rules change says the disclosure requirements will ensure integrity of the recruiting process, and evaluate NIL activities for possible malfeasance.\n\nAt issue is the prospect of athletes being offered deals that college athletics administrators say could be viewed as thinly veiled recruiting inducements.\n\nDelrahim wrote: Pursuing a goal of promoting amateurism does not insulate the NCAA's rules from scrutiny under the antitrust laws. … The antitrust laws limit the NCAA's ability to restrict competition among college athletes, coaches, and schools. For example, if the NCAA adopted a rule that fixes the price at which students can license their NIL, e.g., based on what the NCAA determines to be a 'fair' market value, such a rule may raise concerns under the antitrust laws.\n\nIn the interview, Delrahim expanded on this idea in the more specific context of the proposed third-party administrator.\n\nThe devil will be in the details – who's on that board and who they answer to ... because who appoints them and what their points of view are can be outcome-determinative, he said. While we applaud efforts to increase integrity in the process, we must be very careful to ensure that a board does not operate as a backdoor way to limit competition. You know, athletic directors' and coaches' salaries are not subjected to such a process. We want to ensure that the NCAA imposes only the narrowest form of competitive restriction that is necessary.
The airline industry is mourning the loss of Herb Kelleher, Southwest Airlines co-founder who died Thursday (Jan. 3).\n\nThe larger-than-life, bourbon-drinking Kelleher helped launch Southwest in 1971, creating the USA's first big low-cost carrier and then shepherding it through the upheaval of airline deregulation and into the modern era.\n\nKelleher is universally regarded as a true visionary in American aviation, and his legacy in the industry that survives him is hard to overstate. Among the innovations that he'll forever be associated with include:\n\nMore:Everyone has Herb stories: Remembering Southwest Airlines co-founder Herb Kelleher\n\nHappy employees (and customers)\n\nContentious labor relations have been a hallmark of the modern airline industry, but that wasn't true at Southwest under Kelleher. He famously believed that happy employees would lead to happy customers.\n\nYour employees come first, goes one oft-quoted Kelleher line. And if you treat your employees right, guess what? Your customers come back, and that makes your shareholders happy. Start with employees and the rest follows from that.\n\nIndeed, Southwest's friendly and folksy employees were often cited by passengers as fast-growing Southwest enjoyed strong customer-service ratings from the 1980s into the 2000s.\n\nMore:Southwest Airlines user's guide: 12 tips for flying the popular, polarizing carrier\n\nUnderscoring Kelleher's strong ties with labor, the Southwest pilots union took out a full page ad in USA TODAY when he stepped down as the company's chairman in 2008. The ad's message: Thank You Herb!\n\nLow fares\n\nSouthwest debuted in an era where most big airlines were full-service carriers. But Southwest went a different direction under Kelleher.\n\nLow fares became Southwest's calling card.With this emphasis, Southwest eschewed first-class seating and maintained an egalitarian first-come, first-served seating policy that has persisted to today.\n\nCritics have labeled that boarding process as a cattle call, but Southwest's fares won it many converts over its first three decades.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY:Southwest Airlines reveals five new routes as it extends schedule into fall\n\nSouthwest was known for aggressively pricing its cheapest seats, especially when it entered new markets. That forced incumbent carriers to match Southwest's fares, sometimes running out established legacy rivals who couldn't turn a profit by matching Southwest's fares.\n\nIt was a new phenomenon for the U.S. airline industry as it shifted from a time of heavy regulation into the modern era that resulted from 1978's Airline Deregulation Act.\n\nWhen Southwest entered new markets, its presence was so pronounced that the U.S. Transportation Department coined the term the Southwest Effect in a 1993 report that looked at the effect expanding low-cost carriers were having on airfares.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY:Southwest says 'Southwest Effect' still going strong\n\nSouthwest, aided by advantageous fuel-hedging contracts, continued to bill itself as the USA's low-fare leader into the current decade. But today it faces leaner competitors in American, Delta and United, all of which have pared costs in bankruptcy filings since 1978. Today, those carriers typically match or even undercut Southwest's fares.\n\nBut Southwest's low-fare approach has spawned a new wave of ultra low-cost carriers (ULCCs). The airlines, which include U.S. carriers Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant, are growing today using many of the tactics pioneered by Southwest.\n\nNo frills\n\nSouthwest's open-seating concept never caught among at its U.S. competitors, but several of its other low-fare selling points have.\n\nSouthwest famously offered peanuts instead of full-service meals that were standard in decades past. Southwest's insinuation was that customers booking its cheapest fares were essentially flying for peanuts – making the lack of meals worth the trade-off.\n\nWhen Southwest announced earlier this year that it would stop serving peanuts to help protect passengers who have severe peanut allergies, the move made national news since the carrier was nixing a snack that was been nearly synonymous with Southwest itself.\n\nEven Southwest's lack of first-class seating offered another no-frills template for modern low-cost carriers. A number of low-cost carriers have emulated Southwest's coach-only approach, with European giant Ryanair among the most prominent.\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos (story continues below)\n\nEfficiency\n\nKelleher's Southwest capitalized on efficiency like few other airlines of its time.\n\nFor starters, Southwest used only one type of aircraft: the Boeing 737. By sticking to a single aircraft type, Southwest has reduced complexity on everything from maintenance and training to route planning. Southwest's Boeing 737-only fleet plan has continued to today, though it briefly had Boeing 717s in its fleet following its 2010 acquisition of AirTran Airways.\n\nAnother Southwest hallmark was the 10-minute turn, a reference to how long a plane would stay at a gate between flights. The quicker a plane could get back in the air, the more flights (and revenue) could be squeezed into Southwest's schedule.\n\nOur planes pull into the jetways, board passengers and pull out again in 10 minutes or less, Kelleher said in a 1982 commercial where he's walking toward a Southwest flight only to have the cabin door close without him.\n\nOf course, the 10-minute-turn was an ambitious goal even decades ago. Today, Southwest's turn times have increased as it has grown and expanded into increasingly congested airports, but the airline still attempts some of the quickest turns in the industry.\n\nSouthwest bucked another industry trend by using a point-to-point route network for its flights. That's instead of the more common hub-and-spoke method used by modern airlines where most passengers flying between mid-sized and small markets must fly to a big airline hub to connect to their final destination.\n\nInstead, Southwest simply added flights between cities where it thought it could make money, often flying many flights throughout the day. That didn't mean Southwest flyers didn't connect, but it wasn't over a hub.\n\nBy spreading its flight schedules over a national network Southwest was able to spread its costs and resources more evenly. As Southwest has grown, it does have some cities that essentially function as hubs. Still, Southwest refuses to call any of its busiest bases a hub – a holdover in thinking that persists from Kelleher's days.\n\nSecondary airports\n\nIf your preferred airport is a so-called secondary airport, you can thank Kelleher's Southwest for bringing them into the mainstream.\n\nThose types of airports – think Chicago Midway instead of Chicago O'Hare or Oakland instead of San Francisco – were a staple of Southwest's growth under Kelleher.\n\nIn fact, Southwest's history is inextricably tied to the secondary airport in its hometown: Dallas Love Field. The airline initially began flying in 1971 with service between three cities within Texas (Dallas Love, Houston and San Antonio), its status as an intra-Texas airline shielding it from federal commercial airline restrictions that existed at the time.\n\nIn 1974, the new Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW) airport opened. It was intended to be a single major hub serving the metro area, but Southwest resisted, figuring its business model based on short, frequent flights would be disrupted if Dallas customers had to make a longer drive to DFW. This turned into a decades-long battle to expand access at Love Field.\n\nBeyond Love Field, however, secondary airports were key to Southwest's growth strategy from its founding well into the 2000s. The less-congested airports typically did not suffer as many money-sucking delays as their bigger counterparts; some also offered lower operating costs.\n\nInstead of Chicago O'Hare, Southwest picked Midway when it expanded to Chicago in 1985. When Southwest first expanded into the Northeast in the 1990s, it picked airports like Baltimore (instead of Washington Reagan or Dulles) and Providence, Rhode Island, and Manchester, New Hampshire (instead of Boston). Even in the New York City area, Southwest's 1999 debut came at Long Island's MacArthur Airport – a development that revitalized the then-sleepy airport located about 55 miles from Midtown Manhattan.\n\nWhile Southwest pioneered that trend in the U.S. under Kelleher, the airline has moved away from that as it has become one of the world's biggest. Southwest is still the dominant airline at Chicago Midway and Houston Hobby, but it is increasingly seeking out primary airports popular with business travelers. Today, Southwest flies from both San Francisco and Oakland. Its presence at Long Island/MacArthur has shrunk while it has expanded at New York LaGuardia and Newark Liberty. Similarly, Southwest's addition of Boston in 2009 foretold eventual schedule reductions in nearby Providence and Manchester.\n\nBut Southwest's secondary-airport strategy lives on in the U.S. budget carriers of today, as anyone who has flown Spirit from Niagara Falls, New York (instead of Buffalo), or Allegiant from Mesa, Arizona (instead of Phoenix), can attest.\n\nARCHIVES: Here it is: Southwest confirms new look for its planes
Kirk Spitzer\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTOKYO — Despite a rocky start to the year, Tokyo's stock market is poised to record solid gains in 2016, two of Japan's leading stock analysts said Tuesday.\n\nI'm actually relatively optimistic about the market, said Ryota Sakagami, chief equity strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. He said the benchmark Nikkei 225 index is likely to finish the year at around 22,500 points — a hefty jump from Tuesday's close of 17,750.\n\nAlso bullish: CLSA Securities Japan strategist Nicholas Smith. Profits are at an all-time high and are likely to stay there, Smith said. A Nikkei of about 21,000 is a reasonable peg for the market at the end of the year.\n\nSakagami and Smith told foreign correspondents in Tokyo that both internal and external factors — including a weak yen, low crude oil prices and lower corporate taxes — are likely keep corporate profits high and boost share prices.\n\nMarkets worldwide took a beating in January, mostly on sliding oil prices and weak economic news from China. For the month, the Dow average dropped 3.9%, the Nikkei 5.1% and China's Shanghai SE Composite Index more than 30%.\n\nDespite a slowdown in China, the global economy is likely to grow, albeit slowly, and the U.S. economy should remain strong, underpinning Japan's equity markets, Sakagami said.\n\nAs Japan's population ages and shrinks, an era of labor shortages has arrived, he said. That will force employers to pay higher wages, boosting consumer spending and shoring up prices for personal consumption stocks.\n\nThe markets also got a boost from the Bank of Japan last Friday, which unexpectedly adopted a negative interest rate policy for the first time. The move means that the bank will charge interest on deposits it holds rather than pay interest as a way to stimulate the economy by spurring banks to lend more.\n\nBank of Japan surprises with negative interest rate\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the policy change, effective Feb. 16, is intended to boost personal consumption and business investment. The below-zero rates will apply to commercial bank deposits held by the central bank in excess of required minimums.\n\nThe Nikkei has climbed 3.5% since Friday's market opening, and the yen has fallen to 120.66 to the dollar from 118.50 on Friday.\n\nSmith said the negative interest rate bomb is likely spur business spending by signaling that the yen, which had strengthened to nearly 75 to the dollar in 2011, will remain weak. That will prod companies to spend money on higher wages and capital investments, rather than hoard yen in anticipation of climbing exchange rates.\n\nWhen we moved from 75 yen up to 120, many executives were saying, 'I don't believe it's going to stay there. It will be back at 75 in no time.' So they weren't spending on capital expenditures and they weren't increasing wages, Smith said. So it was very important for the Bank of Japan to say, 'No, this 120 yen is where it's going to be and where it's going to stay.'
Raf Casert, Associated Press\n\nBRUSSELS - The sheer waste of food had been bothering teacher Marijke De Jongh for so long that two years ago she set up a pop-up restaurant to serve perfectly good groceries and meat that were approaching their expiry date.\n\nWith her Rekub team, she followed it up with an app that brings thousands of consumers to retail shops were they can buy food closing in on its sell-by date.\n\nStill, the efforts of a small group of conscientious consumers are no match for the masses that still waste food from farm to fork.\n\nThe European Court of Auditors on Tuesday chided the European Union's executive branch in a report, Combating Food Waste, that decried the bloc's lack of effort in reducing the food waste. It estimated the EU wastes 88 million tons of food a year for a population of 510 million.\n\nThe Commission is not combating the food waste effectively, said ECA member Bettina Jakobsen, noting a lack of strategy and inspiration being used to tackle the problem.\n\nThe report said more efforts should be made all along the food chain and special precautions should be taken when setting farm policy to make sure that less produce is discarded. An EU study, however, shows about half that waste can still be tied to households, not policy.\n\nThe ECA also recommended making food donations easier, since they are still mired in legal and tax issues that sometimes become a disincentive for food producers to give food away. It said with better EU regulations that could be turned around.\n\nAt the same time, De Jongh continues to try to make a difference at a local level in Antwerp, northern Belgium. After her pop-up experiment in 2015, she is planning a permanent Rekub eatery now.\n\nWe have to keep this moving and put it on everyone's radar, she said.
AP\n\nClemson linebacker Ben Boulware is the team's top tackler and a lightning rod for criticism on Twitter. Some of the tweets cuss him out, others he laughs off.\n\nBut one was way out of line: His father had to contact the police after one person picked on Boulware's little sister.\n\nIs it really that serious? You have to find my little sister and say something to her? Boulware said. It's football. Sorry that I ruined your day so much, that I tackled your quarterback too hard. It's ridiculous.\n\nThe bigger the stage, the more fans talk about and taunt college players behind a Twitter handle. It's a fact of life circa 2017. Ben Boulware knows that well. It's a part of life as a college celebrity, and it means learning how to respond — or not respond — with the public watching every post.\n\nI hear it every day. I don't care, Boulware said. If they want to take five minutes out of their day and tweet at somebody you don't know, you're a loser. Go do something with your life. Talking negative about somebody, it's just so lame. Don't you have something better to do?\n\nIs the best option to shut up? Snipe back? Engage with the fan? Go dark?\n\nBoulware's father, Jamie Boulware, contacted the Anderson County Sheriff's Office after daughter Bailee, a Clemson junior, received a threat. He was told it wasn't likely anything would come out of it.\n\nThe Twitter fallout has lightened up since the Louisville game, Jamie Boulware said. He asked a couple of the offenders to visit him at the family tailgate so they could talk, but they didn't take him up on it.\n\nIt's a shame that these days people can say things like that without consequences, he said.\n\nAll four playoff teams have stories about Twitter nastiness, and most players try to restrain themselves from firing back.\n\nClemson has a no-social-media policy during the season, a plan voted on by the players. Alabama coach Nick Saban lets players know that what they say on social media is part of their brand, for better or worse.\n\nThis is sort of something that we're constantly trying to address with players so that they can brand themselves in a positive way, Saban said.\n\nFormer players can only marvel at what their successors have to deal with. Ex-Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy doesn't think he would have been mature enough to handle the starting job as a freshman like Jalen Hurts , partly because of social media critics.\n\nI definitely couldn't have handled it as an 18-year-old, especially if I was an 18-year-old in 2016, said McElroy, now an analyst for the SEC Network. It's only been six years since I finished, and the world's changed quite a bit in a very short period of time. It's a tall order for sure and it does take a remarkable amount of maturity.\n\nAnd restraint.\n\nWashington quarterback Jake Browning avoids some of the in-season attention, good or bad, by staying off Twitter. His last Tweet before the Huskies semifinal loss to Alabama came on Aug. 7: Hello fall camp. Goodbye Twitter.\n\nOhio State guard Billy Price says he could get a false start and I get crucified on Twitter. He says that's just reality and there's nothing players can do but try to get better. It's also a splash of reality because they've gotten so much in-person praise during their careers.\n\nThat's the cold, hard truth of it, Price said. Especially in this program, because the truth comes at you fast. It's hard, especially as a young guy when you're not ready for that. You've never been told you suck because you're in high school and you're around your hometown and people love you.\n\nYou go to Wal-Mart and people love you. You see the little old lady at church that loves you and you give her a hug and say, 'Hi, Mrs. Smith.' But once you come here, the truth comes out. You got beat, you lost. Just get better. That's what it comes down to.\n\nThen again, he didn't much appreciate people tweeting at his girlfriend that your boyfriend's trash.\n\nWashington wide receiver Dante Pettis grew up seeing and hearing people criticize his father, Gary Pettis, a former major league outfielder who won five Gold Gloves and is now the Houston Astros' third base coach. He said there will always be people who say bad stuff.\n\nIf that's what they think that's what they think, Dante Pettis said. Maybe they're jealous of where we are, maybe they wish they could be here. But at the end of the day we know what we're doing is good so that's all that matters.\n\nAlabama tailback Damien Harris, one of the Crimson Tide's more frequent posters, said one user once said he hoped he would break his leg and have a career-ending injury.\n\nHe got some backlash in September after posting comments about a presidential debate , which later was a topic in his political communications class.\n\nPeople were all like, 'Stick to football. You don't know what you're talking about,' Harris said. So I'm like, 'Since I play football, that means I can't be involved in something that affects me?' That stuff didn't make sense. Just like everything else, you read it and then you move on.\n\nWashington running back Myles Gaskin said he tries not to spend much time looking at responses to his posts. His solution: Block the worst offenders.\n\nIt's definitely part of the game, Gaskin said. People are going to say what they've got to say but at the end of the day true fans of UW and anybody that supports this university, I feel like they'll only give us constructive criticism. They'll always have our backs.\n\nAnybody that is out there saying mean stuff I know you've got something better to do. Don't bother me with it. That's the way I look at it.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports writers Pete Iacobelli, Mitch Stacy and Tim Booth contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
Associated Press\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Representatives of four countries will meet in the Afghan capital Kabul on Monday for a second round of talks aimed at bringing an end to Afghanistan's war by charting a roadmap to peace, a Foreign Ministry official said.\n\nSenior officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, China and the United States would meet for one day, a week after discussions in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, said Shekib Mostaghni, the ministry's spokesman.\n\nForeign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani was due to open the meeting, taking place at the Presidential Palace in the center of the capital.\n\nSecurity in parts of the capital was tight with a heavy armed police presence.\n\nThe Taliban have not been invited to this meeting, nor did representatives attend a previous meeting in Islamabad last week.\n\nThe meetings seek to revive a process that was derailed last July after the first and only face-to-face meeting between Afghan government and Taliban representatives in Islamabad.\n\nThat initiative faltered when Kabul announced that the insurgent group's leader had secretly been dead for more than two years.\n\nA subsequent meeting was cancelled and relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan chilled, as President Ashraf Ghani publicly blamed Pakistan for using the Taliban to wage war on his country.\n\nMostaghni said the meeting would be attended by the same officials that met in Islamabad last week: Afghanistan's Deputy Foreign Minister Hekmat Karzai, U.S. envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard G. Olson, his Chinese counterpart Deng Xijun and Pakistani Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry. Sartaj Aziz, a senior foreign policy adviser to Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pentagon's senior envoy to Pakistan, Lt. Gen. Anthony Rock were also present.\n\nThe discussions are seen as preparatory meetings laying the foundation for a direct dialogue between representatives of the Kabul government and the Taliban, though that is not seen taking place for many months.\n\nThe Taliban have intensified their war in the past year, following the drawdown of international combat troops in 2014.
Ford and Volkswagen are working toward a major announcement on Jan. 15 during a key car industry event, the Detroit auto show, according to people close to talks about an alliance between the two automakers.\n\nSources in the U.S. say the situation is fluid but hopeful. Nothing is definite, a person familiar with the discussions told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nVolkswagen and Ford have been talking since summer about areas of potential cooperation.\n\nThe auto companies agreed not to discuss anything publicly this week, sources told the Free Press.\n\nOur memorandum of understanding with VW covers conversations about potential collaborations across a number of areas, said Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake. It is premature to share additional details at this time. We look forward to sharing an update soon.\n\nMore:Follow the latest from the Detroit Auto Show\n\nMore:Toyota Supra is back: 2020 Supra will be revealed at Detroit auto show in January\n\nMore Money:People left key fobs inside their cars and auto theft hit an 8-year high\n\nVolkswagen spokesman Mark Clothier declined to comment, saying company policy prohibits speculative discussion.\n\nMultiple sources told the Free Press that breadth and details of the expected alliance are still not final, though ongoing talks have included a cost-cutting partnership involving electric and driverless technology.\n\nBoth Ford and VW sources have said in recent months that talks are proceeding as hoped. The companies also have said any partnership won't be a merger or include equity stakes.\n\n'Big, bold move'\n\nNews of a potential announcement won praise from industry analysts.\n\nThis is a very big, bold move, said Charles Ballard, an economics professor at Michigan State University. The scale of the proposed alliance tells us a lot about the wrenching changes that are being wrought in the industry by trade wars and changes in technology and consumer preferences.\n\nJon Gabrielsen, a market economist who advises automakers and auto suppliers, said partnerships are critical to all serious players moving forward.\n\nThe global auto industry is rapidly becoming one in which major scale is critical, he said. Ford's scale is not large enough, and VW has insufficient presence in the U.S. In addition they each have significant challenges in China and in trying to be the most competitive in electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles for the future.\n\nJohn McElroy, host of Autoline This Week and the son of a retired Ford executive, said the alliance could be massive in terms of industry transformation, even if the news leaks just a bit at a time.\n\nIf VW is able to use Ford's development in autonomy and if Ford is able to use Volkswagen's development in electrification, it's not just the cost savings that is important – and that would be big – but it's getting products to the market much, much faster, he said. Bang! This is cost savings and time savings.\n\nHe continued, Additionally, Volkswagen is looking at having Ford build vehicles for VW in the U.S. market. That would be such a win-win for both companies. Volkswagen has nowhere near the market share that it should have as the largest or second largest car company in the world.\n\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said a partnership with VW is a very significant step in the right direction for Ford.\n\nThe move would recognize the realities of a changing market in which the cost of competition is high and growing, he said. This is an opportunity for two companies to combine resources, drive economies of scale and get ahead of the curve on electric cars.\n\nThe move, Masters predicts, could result in more jobs in both companies.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Volkswagen announced the immediate hiring of an Apple executive, Alexander Hitzinger, 47, who worked as senior director of hardware engineering, as the new member of the Brand Board of Management for Technical Development at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles.\n\nHe will be in charge of driverless technology activities for VW, the company said.\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: phoward@freepress.com or313-222-6512.

Lisa Marie Pane\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThe gun industry is holding its biggest annual trade show this week just a few miles from the site where a gunman slaughtered 58 concertgoers outside his high-rise Las Vegas hotel room in October using a display case worth of weapons, many fitted with bump stocks that enabled them to mimic fully automatic fire.\n\nGun control advocates, meanwhile, pointed to the irony of the location and planned a protest to renew calls for tighter gun sale regulations, including expanded background checks.\n\nWe're trying to show the connection between the industry that makes all the money and the damage that their products cause, Lee Goodman, an organizer with Chicago-based Peaceful Communities, said Tuesday. His organization advocates for a rewrite of the constitutional Second Amendment right to own guns.\n\nWhat exactly will be among the thousands of products crammed into the exhibition spaces at the National Shooting Sports Foundation's SHOT Show convention, running Tuesday through Friday, will be a bit of a mystery, shielded from the public and, this year, members of the general-interest media.\n\nOne thing is known: Slide Fire, the leading manufacturer of bump stocks, a once-obscure product that attracted intense attention in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, won't be among the exhibitors.\n\nThe Texas-based company hasn't said why it's not on the roster of more than 1,700 exhibitors, although it was last year. It didn't return messages seeking comment. The company also isn't on the list of those attending this year's National Rifle Association annual meeting or other prominent gun trade shows.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre Oct. 1, Slide Fire had so much trouble keeping up with demand it temporarily stopped taking orders for the product. It has since resumed.\n\nFrom purely a public relations standpoint, it wouldn't be a surprise at all if bump stocks just sort of disappeared this year, said Robert Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment. That's a PR no-brainer.\n\nStill, the convention floor is likely to have plenty of other devices that gun-control advocates have taken aim at in recent years: accessories that make it easier to carry a firearm, shoot it or reduce the noise it makes.\n\nOn the list of products they oppose are trigger cranks, which, like bump stocks, make it easier to fire a long gun rapidly, and assault pistols, which look remarkably like short-barreled AR- and AK-style firearms but skirt certain federal restrictions because they aren't designed to be shot from the shoulder.\n\nMore:Here's the difference a 'bump stock' makes when firing a rifle\n\nEditorial:A month after Las Vegas carnage, bupkis on bump stocks\n\nFor a person from the general public, I think the thing that would startle them the most about the SHOT Show … is just the sheer scope and the vastness of this show, said David Chipman, a former agent with the federal agency that regulates firearms and now a senior policy adviser with the gun safety organization founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a shooting in 2012.\n\nSHOT Show has been held for 40 years, half that time in Las Vegas, and this year's gathering was scheduled well before the bloodshed last fall. It will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. More than 65,000 visitors are expected at the gathering, a place where connections are made and deals worth millions are struck.\n\nThe general public is not allowed to roam the aisles; the only people who can attend are those with direct ties to the industry: manufacturers and dealers of firearms or associated products. Although a few reporters from general-interest news organizations attended in recent years, NSSF this year restricted access to about 2,500 journalists from trade publications and media.\n\nThe show's location and timing 3½ months after Stephen Paddock's murderous attack have heightened awareness of the event.\n\nReport:Vegas shooter bought 55 guns in 1 year\n\nThe gun industry has not been responsible and responsive to addressing the gun violence issue in America, said Po Murray, chairwoman of the Newtown Action Alliance, in the Connecticut town where 20 children and six educators died in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012.\n\nKristin Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence in Washington, D.C., accused events like the SHOT show of adding to the national problem of weapons and violence.\n\nWe're allowing it to exist, Brown said, and we're doing almost nothing to address the loopholes in the law that allow private sales to happen at gun shows and over the internet.\n\nBrown also called donation-based compensation for the hundreds of Las Vegas shooting dead and injured inadequate.\n\nWe do almost nothing for victims, whose only fault in this case was to attend a concert, she said.\n\nGoodman planned a protest Wednesday outside the Sands Expo Convention Center at the Venetian resort, and a 3-mile walk to the outdoor festival venue near the Mandalay Bay resort, from which Paddock fired thousands of rounds from assault-style weapons into a crowd of 22,000 attending a country music concert.\n\nMichael Bazinet, NSSF director of public affairs, said that while those attending are well aware of the tragedy that occurred nearby, they also know that legal gun ownership and the lawful commerce of arms is something quite removed from the act of an individual such as this. And that's not to diminish the tragedy at all. But people come to the show do make that distinction.\n\nThe show comes as the gun industry's fortunes have waned after nearly a decade of unprecedented sales. No longer concerned about the federal government restricting gun rights, Americans have scaled back their firearm-buying sprees.\n\nWhen SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade, was launched, its emphasis was on hunting and the outdoors. Over the decades, it has evolved and grown and now has huge sections devoted to the law enforcement and military community. No sales are allowed at the show, firing pins are removed from all guns on display, and there is no live ammunition.\n\nThere are so many companies that want to exhibit, there isn't enough space. The waiting list is several hundred names long.\n\nKevin Michalowski, executive editor of Concealed Carry Magazine, has been going to SHOT Show for more than a decade and said he doesn't anticipate this year's event will have a different feel from other years. He said it's a close-knit industry accustomed to being put under the microscope by the media and by gun-control advocates.\n\nThis is not just a group of redneck gun owners as are often portrayed by the mainstream media. This is serious business, he said. Millions and millions of dollars are exchanged, and it helps the economies of many, many states, it helps the economy of the U.S.\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Ritter in Las Vegas contributed to this report.
AP\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — As a general philosophy, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin treats each individual season as its own unique entity, with no direct through line from one to the next.\n\nConsidering his quarterback's current state of mind, probably a good idea.\n\nWhile Tomlin believes the Steelers have a championship caliber team a couple days removed from an ugly blowout loss to New England in the AFC title game, his franchise's most important player isn't guaranteeing a return in 2017. Roethlisberger said during his weekly appearance on 93.7 The Fan that he needs time to reflect before coming back for a 14th season.\n\nI'm going to take this offseason to evaluate, to consider all options, to consider health and family and things like that and just kind of take some time away to evaluate next season, if there's going to be a next season, all those things, Roethlisberger said.\n\nRoethlisberger will turn 35 in March and is under contract through 2020. Knee injuries have forced him to miss time in each of the last two seasons and while Pittsburgh ripped off nine straight wins on its way to the AFC North title and its first appearance in the NFL's final four in six years, Roethlisberger wasn't terribly sharp. He threw 10 interceptions over Pittsburgh's final seven games, though the two-time Super Bowl winner didn't receive much help on Sunday against the Patriots, as dropped passes, a groin injury to running back Le'Veon Bell and occasionally questionable playcalling — not to mention Tom Brady at the peak of his powers — played significant factors in the worst postseason loss of his career.\n\nWhile Roethlisberger cautioned he's not by any means saying he's not coming back, the father of three considered it prudent to take a step back before deciding if he has the energy to make another push.\n\nThat's fine by Tomlin, who wasn't alarmed by Roethlisberger's admission mostly because they've had similar discussions in the past.\n\nThat's football, Tomlin said. Obviously I'm hopeful that he returns and the potential of his return or not returning will weigh heavily on our planning. That's life. He's the most significant component of what it is that we do. We'll plan and react accordingly.\n\nRoethlisberger is one of three Steelers remaining from the team that beat Seattle in the Super Bowl 11 years ago. The exodus includes tight end and Roethlisberger's longtime friend Heath Miller, who retired last February at age 33.\n\nIt seems unlikely Roethlisberger — who has three seasons left on the five-year, $100 million deal he signed in March 2015 — would walk away considering the Steelers (13-6) figure to be in the mix again next season. Wide receiver Antonio Brown is still under contract, Bell will become a free agent but is expected to stick around and Martavis Bryant will be eligible for reinstatement after missing all of 2016 for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. The offensive line that allowed Roethlisberger to be sacked just 17 times in 14 games will remain intact.\n\nThere's plenty to be optimistic about. And the oddsmakers don't seem concerned about Roethlisberger's intentions, making the Steelers the early second choice (along with Green Bay) to reach next year's Super Bowl in Minneapolis.\n\nSome other takeaways as Tomlin put the finishing touches on a successful if not triumphant year.\n\nBATTERED BELL: Tomlin said Bell had been dealing with the groin injury that limited him to just six carries against the Patriots for some time but that the All-Pro had found a way to manage it without missing practice. Tomlin said he didn't feel the problem was significant enough to put Bell on the NFL-mandated injury report, pointing out the entire team could be placed on the report due to various bumps and bruises associated with playing four-plus months.\n\nBROWN NEEDS TO DELIVER: Tomlin downplayed the notion that Brown needs to become a more mature player even though Tomlin publicly chastised Brown's decision to livestream portions of the locker room celebration following a divisional round victory over Kansas City. He's a dynamic player (and) there are responsibilities that come with being a dynamic player, said Tomlin, who added outlining the responsibilities is normal operating business for all players.\n\nSEE YOU IN 2017?: Linebacker James Harrison will become a free agent in March and turns 39 in May but has already publicly talked about making another run.\n\nSECOND GUESSING: Tomlin became the eighth coach to win 100 games in his first 10 seasons, remarkable in most places, but maybe not in Pittsburgh. It's a standard Tomlin embraces. My goal was to be world champs and we weren't that, Tomlin said. You can describe that in whatever way you choose to. In that vein I've only been successful one time in 10 years and I'm OK with that.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
Olgu Okumus\n\nOilprice.com\n\nLast Friday, oil prices surpassed $70 per barrel. With OPEC's decision to reduce oil production, oil prices continue their rise. While Iran's oil minister stated in early January that OPEC has no interest in prices jumping over $60 per barrel, no major changes have yet come from OPEC, and market players continue to wonder what can cause the price rise to reverse.\n\nSome analysis, built on conventional market principles, sees the cause of this tension as ongoing conflict in the Middle East — these analysts now await a strong reaction from Russia to change trends. However, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) notes, the explanation may be more unconventional.\n\nSince oil prices surpassed $70 per barrel on Friday, much international analysis narrows the cause to tensions in the Middle East — or more precisely, Iraq's decision to join OPEC's agreement to rein in output and ongoing conflict. Jabbar Ali Hussein Al-Luiebi, Iraq's oil minister, announced his country's decision to join OPEC's agreement with other suppliers to rein in output until the end of 2018. The deal should continue, he said. The market now is stabilizing somehow, but it's not yet stable.\n\nDespite Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh previously stating that members of OPEC are not keen on increased brent crude prices above $60 a barrel because of shale oil, so far no immediate policy shift came from OPEC on Friday before markets closed. Many analysts, putting the Middle East at the heart of the cause, also projected that tension and the Afrin operation might push prices up to $80 per barrel.\n\nMore:Market speculation: Oil traders have never been this bullish\n\nMore:Trump's 30% tariff on imported solar panels may cost jobs\n\nMore:Energy companies to White House: Infrastructure plan should include more than crumbling roads, bridges\n\nThus, raising questions about the foundation of this analysis is now important. Do we need to fear? If so, who or what can stop this price hike? Answers vary upon how seriously the shale revolution is taken, as seen in two expert interviews with Bloomberg this week. Related: The World's Most Innovative Gas Field\n\nEd Morse, Citigroup's global head of commodities research, told Bloomberg he doesn't know how OPEC will react, but he seemed confident regarding Russia's reaction. He expects Russia to call for a pause in the agreement during OPEC's summer meeting, as rising oil prices are endangering the ruble, and the Russian Central Bank is already considering an intervention.\n\nHowever, the IEA's 2017 World Energy Outlook projected that China will overtake the United States as the world's largest oil consumer around 2030, as well as predicting the U.S. shale revolution will turn the country toward export, making the U.S. a net oil exporter by 2020. That said, the IEA estimates prices for oil will remain in the $50–70/barrel range — suggesting that, even if the U.S. does become an energy exporter (as predicted), this will not be a game-changer for the U.S. economy.\n\nBased on that projection, in his Bloomberg interview, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol drew attention to the fact that OPEC's decisions today have a different nature than they did before the shale revolution. This is the new game in town, he noted.\n\nIndeed, Birol's comment is clear. Growing U.S. shale production will push down oil prices over the long term. The countries who did not see this happening, such as Russia, now face severe economic challenges. The time of blaming Middle East conflicts for oil price fluctuations or passively expecting a Russian reaction seems to be ending, and it's time to begin replacing traditional energy analyses with unconventional ones.\n\nIt looks like the shale revolution — not Russian intervention or OPEC strategy — will be what ultimately causes prices to reverse.\n\nDr. Olgu Okumus focuses her research on energy politics and local energy transition.

Erroll G. Southers\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nAfter the deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol last week, terms like protest, riot and sedition are being used to describe what occurred. Make no mistake, it was a terrorist attack.\n\nAn American mob constructed a gallows outside the Capitol, carried a Confederate flag through the sacred halls of democracy and placed improvised explosive devices at the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees. Inside the Capitol, windows were smashed and offices ransacked. One attacker brought 11 Molotov cocktails and an assault rifle, another stalked the Senate floor with a fistful of flex-cuffs. Ultimately, a police officer was killed and dozens of other officers were hurt.\n\nThe hundreds of Trump supporters who stormed into the Capitol were a fraction of the thousands who had marched there after the president exhorted them to do so. But their actions, and the presence of white supremacists and anti-government extremists scattered among those who remained outside, made manifest the documented and dangerous threat these domestic extremists have posed for decades. The discussions they are having online suggest this attack was intended to be independence day and the beginning of a second civil war.\n\nBiden inaugural is not the finish line\n\nWhile images of the U.S. Capitol being overrun are terrifying, we should not be too surprised. Extremist groups have been discussing and planning audacious attacks for some time. Most recently, in October, the FBI stopped a plot by white supremacist and anti-government extremists to kidnap the Michigan and Virginia governors.\n\nThese and other wicked ideas are increasingly pervasive in online forums. Extremists participating in these virtual communities are gleeful over the Capitol attack and are using it to recruit members in advance of violence on Inauguration Day.\n\nAs a country, however, we should not see the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden as a finish line, after which the extremist threat might seem to stand down. There is no finish line in homeland security. Even when every person who participated in the Washington, D.C., attack is identified, arrested, charged and convicted in accordance with the exiting president's own executive order, extremists will remain.\n\nWhile the U.S. Capitol was invaded, ominous protests in state capitals revealed the scope of this extremism. In Salt Lake City, 400 people converged on the Utah Capitol and a photojournalist was attacked. In Georgia, about 100 people, some of them armed, prompted the secretary of state and his staff to evacuate. In St. Paul, 500 people descended on the Minnesota Capitol, where a protester characterized the day as 1776 — the start of the American Revolution.\n\nCapitol breach:Sacking of U.S. Capitol adds to rare national security failures. Police the police.\n\nProtests in other states were largely peaceful, and it would be incorrect to presume every person who participated was an extremist. Therein is our national challenge. How can we distinguish between those expressing a constitutionally protected political opinion, those who might be susceptible to violent extremist action, and those who are already planning for their next attack?\n\nThere are necessary policy and legal discussions to identify and address the scale of white supremacy and anti-government extremism in the United States. Security will come not just through mitigating the threat but also diminishing it.\n\nPublic trials for the Capitol attackers\n\nRadicalization to violence does not occur overnight, and likewise coaxing someone back from extremism is not a simple endeavor. Nor is it always successful. Judging by the clothing patches donned on Jan. 6, the flags they waved, the coded hand signals they flashed to one another and, for some, their known affiliation with hate groups, the Capitol attack included people adhering to multiple violent ideologies. It is reminiscent of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which was perplexing in part because right-wing extremist groups typically do not collaborate in that way.\n\nAs a nation, we need a nuanced strategy for addressing each violent ideology, hybrid derivative and group. Part of that effort will be shoring up trust in information sources, public leaders and our very democracy. People need to understand where opinion ends and extremist ideology begins, and right now that is a nebulous line for too many. Some American leaders have progressively dumbed down a significant portion of the American public, mixing news spin with half-truths and half-baked conspiracies. When people have no interest in education, real news, conducting research and inviting discussions with people of opposing views, they become the sheep for the violent shepherds' extremism.\n\nTrump mob attack on the Capitol:10 urgent security questions that need answers\n\nWe also need to make an example of those who attacked the U.S. Capitol. They must receive the full measure of justice to show that violent action will always fall in the face of law and order. Those who stormed the Capitol by force in a bid to prevent or delay the business of the United States government, in this case affirming Biden's election win, should bear the full weight of prosecution for seditious conspiracy. Their trials should be public, demonstrating the enduring strength of democracy and our legal system.\n\nThroughout U.S. history, there are only a handful of dates that live in infamy, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt said of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Jan. 6, 2021, is now one of them. But it is also a day that showed a violent mob, adaptive adversaries and a disgraceful, appalling president cannot bring down our democratic system.\n\nErroll G.

Ledyard King and Eliza Collins, USA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – As lawmakers grapple with the complex issue of immigration and the fate of nearly 800,000 DREAMers, one voice seems conspicuously missing from the effort: Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nThe Florida Republican was an original member of the Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group of senators that crafted the last comprehensive immigration bill in 2013. It passed the Senate but died when the GOP-controlled House refused to take it up.\n\nBut Rubio has not been involved in the latest immigration overhaul effort which is now starting to take shape on Capitol Hill at the prodding of President Trump.\n\nFive of the original Gang of Eight, and one new Republican senator, are now the focus of attention on Capitol Hill and they announced Thursday they have the framework of a deal. Members of the group presented an outline to President Trump Thursday, who did not endorse the plan.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said there is no deal yet, but we still think we can get there. It is also not clear House Republicans are interested in accepting the work of a bipartisan Senate working group.\n\nWe have a proposal in principle that we're sharing with our colleagues and I think there's gonna be a lot of interest, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who went to the White House Thursday. I think that will matter to the president.\n\nRubio downplays his absence from the various groups working on the issue, pointing out he does not sit on the Judiciary Committee, which handles immigration legislation. And he's encouraged others are getting involved, in hopes that it forges a broader solution both parties can get behind.\n\nI'm glad that there are some new voices involved in this, he told reporters Wednesday, pointing to GOP Sens. James Lankford of Oklahoma and Thom Tillis of North Carolina who had been in some negotiations, though are not part of the bipartisan group of six. That's a positive development.\n\nWhat Rubio didn't mention was the heat he took from Tea Party stalwarts for getting involved in a bill four years ago that would have provided a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. The effort landed him on the cover of Time Magazine with the heading The Republican Savior, no doubt further rankling conservatives.\n\nSome of those conservative activists never forgave him even after he endorsed a border-security-first approach proposed in the House, saying his support of what they viewed as amnesty in the Senate bill was a betrayal they wouldn't forget.\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2016, they didn't. Instead, many opted for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and billionaire Donald Trump, according to exit polls in states such as Alabama, Idaho, Michigan and Mississippi among others.\n\nThere's a lot of grassroots conservatives that refuse to forgive him on the Gang of Eight stuff on the last go around, said David Bozell, president of the conservative organization ForAmerica.\n\nBozell said that the issue wasn't that Rubio tried to come up with a solution, but rather that he failed to sell it to conservatives. And, Bozell adds, his fellow Republicans abandoned him.\n\nSome Capitol Hill Republicans deciding how far to go on immigration now are looking back at Rubio's experience as a cautionary tale.\n\nSen. Rubio's fall from political favor came from prioritizing getting an immigration deal passed over getting a deal that was good for American wage-earners and communities, said Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA which is a group that advocates for reduction in legal immigration. Others in a rush to pass another amnesty at almost any cost should be chastened by the Rubio story. \n\nRubio still believes in finding a solution for those immigrants, especially the DREAMers who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents and view this country as their only home.\n\nThe latest congressional effort to solve the immigration issue was prompted by President Trump's September announcement that he would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in March and begin wholesale deportations. Trump gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution for immigrants covered by DACA, which was an executive action by former president Barack Obama.\n\nI've long supported doing something on that front, Rubio said last month. And really the debate in the Republican Conference is not whether to do something about it. I think the debate is what to do about it, how to do it. That's a shift from where we might have been two, four, six years ago. And I think that's true of the White House too, generally.\n\nMore:Trump clears up his immigration position: A border wall must be part of any DACA deal\n\nIn extraordinary public negotiation with Congress, Trump promises to sign DACA bill\n\nOn DACA, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis wants to find middle-ground\n\nBut the debate regarding what provisions should be included in an immigration bill has pitted immigration hawks against more moderate members, of both parties — the same division that doomed the Gang of Eight compromise in 2013.\n\nIn addition to Graham, Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Bob Menendez, D-N.J., are former Gang of Eight members of the bipartisan group that claims to have the framework of a deal. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who is also moderate on immigration has also been involved, rounding the group to six.\n\nDurbin, the Senate's second most powerful Democrat, is one of the most vocal proponents of a deal to protect DACA recipients. He's also a member of a separate bipartisan group which includes Texas Sen. John Cornyn (the second ranking Republican in the Senate), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart, Steny Hoyer, of Maryland.\n\nOn Wednesday a group of conservative House Republicans released an immigration bill, known as Securing America's Future Act, that included DACA protections on a renewable three-year basis. In exchange, the bill included a lengthy list of both internal and external immigration enforcement provisions and reduced overall immigration levels by 25%.\n\nA statement from the White House said the legislation would accomplish the President's core priorities for the American people.\n\nBut House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., would not commit to bringing that bill to the House floor for a vote. Instead, he said it's a constructive effort.\n\nIt's important that we start putting ideas on the table, Ryan added.\n\nRep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, one of the bill's co-sponsors and a hard-line conservative, told USA TODAY that the Securing America's Future Act would be the only way legislation that included DACA protections would be able to pass the House of Representatives.\n\nUnlike the Senate, which requires bipartisan compromise to pass legislation with 60 votes, the House can pass all-Republican legislation if most members stick together.\n\nLabrador dismissed the bipartisan talks with the former Gang of Eight members as doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results.\n\nYou do know what the definition of insanity is right? Labrador said. We have a Republican president in the White House who made his entire campaign about border security so to use the same process that they used under a Democratic president … that would be just completely futile in the House.\n\nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen
By Aimee Picchi\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nFewer than four in 10 Americans could handle an unexpected $1,000 expense such as a medical bill or car repair, according to Bankrate.com. That comes after the federal government has seeded the economy with trillions in stimulus funding, ranging from stimulus payments to extra unemployment aid.\n\nWithout that help, it's likely that U.S. households would be in worse shape. The share of Americans who could handle an unexpected $1,000 expense is slightly down from the year before – 39% in the most recent survey compared with 41% a year earlier, the survey of more than 1,000 people in mid-December found.\n\nAmericans in the spring and summer of 2020 were able to set aside money in their savings accounts and pay down debt thanks to the financial boost from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (or the CARES Act). But by the end of 2020, personal disposable income had fallen sharply from the boost given by the CARES Act, according to a new analysis of financial data from the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project.\n\nParler shutdown:Apple suspends Parler from its App Store while Amazon will shut off web hosting service over violence threats\n\nJob losses:Economy loses 140,000 jobs in December as unemployment holds at 6.7% amid COVID-19 spikes\n\nThat means millions of households entered the winter months with less financial flexibility, even as the pandemic rages across the U.S. and employers cut jobs in December.\n\nDespite prospects for a much brighter end to 2021 than the beginning because of vaccinations, we have to get from here to there first, said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. There will be a lot of economic weakness and financial hardship before then.\n\nAlready, there are signs of rising hardship among some households. About 90 million adults, or almost 4 in 10, reported it was somewhat or very difficult for their households to pay their usual expenses in the past seven days, according to a new Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of Census data from mid-December. That represents a rise of 13 million adults since late August, the think tank said.\n\nIt's clear households were beginning to run on fumes by the end of the fall, said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project. That's one of the reasons why economists like me were screaming and yelling for Congress to do more.\n\nTo be sure, the Bankrate.com and Census data took the temperature of financial health before the latest stimulus was passed, a $900 billion relief bill that is now distributing $600 stimulus payments to eligible adults and children, as well as providing an extra $300 in weekly unemployment aid. But those benefits provide half of the CARES Act's $1,200 in stimulus checks and $600 in weekly extra jobless aid.\n\nThe economic crisis isn't hitting all households equally; Edelberg noted that people of color, women, families with young children and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of the downturn.\n\nMillennials were less likely than older generations to say they could handle a $1,000 emergency expense, Bankrate.com found. Fewer than 1 in 3 millennials, those 24 to 39 years old, said they could pay for an unexpected bill of that size, compared with almost half of baby boomers and Generation Xers, its survey found.\n\nDespite the hardship many households are experiencing, it's important to sock away some emergency savings if possible, Bankrate.com's McBride said. About 4 in 10 people who couldn't cover a $1,000 emergency bill would need to borrow the money, with many saying they would turn to credit cards, the study found. But that could saddle those households with high-interest debt, McBride said.\n\nSetting up an automatic deposit that puts part of your paycheck into a savings account can help seed an emergency fund, McBride noted. He also recommends putting aside a portion of your stimulus check or 2020 tax refund into a savings account.\n\nMore stimulus help may be needed to ensure households can regain their footing, especially as the $300 in extra jobless aid expires in mid-March and vaccines aren't likely to be widely distributed until summer, analysts said.\n\nWhat I'm really worried about is not just the current crisis, which is so acute, but what households' financial situation looks like when we are on the other side of the pandemic, said Edelberg of the Hamilton Project. For millions of households, finances are going to be a lot weaker.
Just days before the NCAA is scheduled to consider landmark legislation to allow college athletes to monetize their name, image and likeness, there have been conversations among college presidents, conference officials and athletic administrators about delaying the vote until there's more clarity about federal government action.\n\nThough the NCAA's Board of Governors created a mandate on Oct. 29, 2019 to put new name, image and likeness rules in place no later than January 2021, there are three primary reasons why the NCAA might now punt on the issue until later this year according to nine people with knowledge of the discussions. Six of those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly.\n\nThe first reason would be the Supreme Court's decision last month to hear the NCAA's appeal of a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the NCAA cannot limit benefits related to education that college athletes can receive.\n\nThe second involves uncertainty about what kind of bill Congress might vote on to regulate name, image and likeness issues, the scope of which could change given the results of the runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will flip the Senate from Republican to Democratic control this session.\n\nAnd the third factor driving a potential delay is simply a lack of detail given to NCAA membership about how a third-party clearinghouse would function to vet name, image and likeness deals signed by athletes to ensure they are not de facto recruiting inducements.\n\nSeveral conferences are pushing back, one person with knowledge of the discussions said. Not even sure presidents know if it will actually be voted on.\n\nDelaying the vote at next week's annual NCAA convention could create significant public backlash for the association and president Mark Emmert, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing in July that work is underway in each of our divisions to ensure a new NIL (name, image and likeness) policy will be adopted in January 2021 and take effect for the 2021-22 academic year.\n\nOFFSEASON AHEAD:Coronavirus, vaccine, revenue remain college football concerns as rocky season comes to end\n\nThe NCAA unveiled details of the proposed NIL rules in November. While those changes would give athletes new and significant abilities to make money from their name, image and likeness and other activities, the proposals include restrictions that would conflict with versions of NIL laws that have been passed by states including California and Florida, which have created the most pressure for the NCAA.\n\nCalifornia's law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September 2019, was the first and would cover dozens of schools across multiple conference. Florida's law is set to take effect July 1, which adds urgency to the situation.\n\nBut there's growing conviction among the NCAA membership that it might not make sense to ratify these changes before knowing how the Supreme Court will rule and seeing which of the four bills introduced during the last six months of the just-concluded session of Congress will be reintroduced and which will gain traction with legislators and the incoming Biden administration.\n\nIf we do pass legislation and now say, 'These kids can, you know, make money outside of their amateurism, is that going to affect what the Supreme Court does? Kansas State athletics director Gene Taylor said. So I don't know if they're going to pass anything. If they do, I think it's going to be much more narrow even than what they have on the table potentially, or they may just come out with a resolution. There's just real concern that there's too many moving parts right now.\n\nTom McMillen — a former Congressman who now serves as president and CEO of the LEAD1 Association, a group representing Football Bowl Subdivision athletics directors — said he did not know whether a vote on new NIL proposals would be delayed, but he added: I would not be surprised if the NCAA delayed action.\n\nI've raised the question with them: How can they pass legislation given the state, federal uncertainties? McMillen said, referring to three other states that have passed NIL laws and others, including Texas, where legislators have filed or plan to file bills this year. You know, the only choice is to pass it and put the effective date way out there, but ... there may be some litigation risk there. It's a tricky issue. I just think they're kind of between a rock and a hard place because Congress is not getting to this any time soon. I mean, the ramp-up of COVID is just taking all the air out of the Congress. ... I personally don't see it till later this year.\n\nIt is likely that the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the appeal in March or April and then rule by sometime in June.\n\nThe proposed changes to the NCAA's name, image and likeness rules are scheduled to be on the agenda for Monday's meeting of the Division I Council and Thursday's meeting of the Division I Board of Directors. The Council is a 40-member panel comprised mainly of athletics administrators, including conference commissioners and athletics directors. The Board has 24 members, nearly all of whom are university presidents or chancellors.\n\nAny action taken by the Council is not considered final until it also has been approved by the Board.\n\nBut a decision by the Council to delay action could essentially be overridden by the Board.\n\nThe package of NIL proposals includes one that would require athletes to disclose their NIL activities to what is described as an independent third-party administrator. Last September, the NCAA issued request for proposals from firms interested in serving in this capacity and initially said the contract would be awarded Nov. 20. That award has not yet made.\n\nHow are you going to do this, so it doesn't become a recruiting inducement – that was the one thing that I haven't really gotten clarification on and I think is an important clarification, Arkansas State AD Terry Mohajir said. Who's the third party? What's the third party doing? How are they running it? What's their involvement? Is it going to be housed in the NCAA? Is it just going to be a third party? How are they going to decide whether it's a recruiting inducement or not?
The Trump administration slapped a 30% tax on imported solar panels Monday in a move that critics say could slow down a fast-growing industry and kill tens of thousands of domestic manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe administration's decision followed a trade case brought by two U.S. solar manufacturers. They contended that cheap solar equipment from China and other countries hurt their businesses. Trump had long promised to boost manufacturing jobs by cracking down on Chinese imports.\n\nThe President's action makes clear again that the Trump Administration will always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses, the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, said in a statement announcing Trump's decision.\n\nBut the vast majority of the U.S. solar industry opposed an import tax, saying it would raise the price of solar power and undercut an industry that employs more than 260,000 people, according to the nonprofit Solar Foundation — more people than work in coal or natural gas, two energy sources favored by Trump. About half of U.S. solar jobs are in installation, with others in manufacturing, sales, product development and other sectors.\n\nThe Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said Monday that Trump's decision will kill American manufacturing jobs, not create them. The trade group said that of the 38,000 solar manufacturing jobs in the U.S., only 2,000 involve making cells and panels, which are covered by Trump's import tax. The other 36,000 manufacturing jobs involve other equipment used on large solar farms and rooftop solar installations.\n\nThe trade group estimated the import tariff would eliminate 23,000 jobs this year.\n\nThere's no doubt this decision will hurt U.S. manufacturing, not help it, Bill Vietas, president of RBI Solar in Cincinnati, said in a statement released by the trade group. Government tariffs will increase the cost of solar and depress demand, which will reduce the orders we're getting and cost manufacturing workers their jobs.\n\nThe solar industry has been growing rapidly, fueled by dramatically falling costs and state and local policies to support clean energy. The U.S. installed nearly 15 gigawatts of solar power in 2016, according to the clean-tech consulting firm GTM Research, up from 2 gigawatts five years before and a tenth of a gigawatt a decade earlier. Huge solar farms have spread across the open desert in states like Arizona, California and Nevada, and rooftop solar systems have become increasingly popular for homes and businesses.\n\nThat growth was made possible by cheap imported solar panels, particularly from China.\n\nThe role that imports have played...has been absolutely massive, said Ethan Zindler, head of U.S. policy analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm. It has allowed solar to be cost competitive on an unsubsidized basis in many parts of the world, and it has allowed zero-carbon generation to come online and supplant higher-carbon sources of energy in literally thousands of places around the world.\n\nZindler said Trump's import tax is less extreme than the companies that brought the trade case asked for, and less extreme than some members of the U.S. International Trade Commission had recommended. Imported solar cells and modules will be taxed at 30% at first, with the tariff dropping to 15% over the next few years. The initial 30% tariff will add about 10% to the costs of building a large solar farm, Zindler said —- big enough hit to kill some projects, he predicted, but not others.\n\nThe Trump administration also exempted the first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cell imports each year from the tax. On top of that, the Arizona-based company First Solar makes a type of panel that's not covered by the tariff. Between the exemption, the First Solar panels and projects already in the works, it's possible that in calendar year 2018, virtually none of the market would actually be affected by these tariffs, Zindler said.\n\nGTM Research expects the tariffs to reduce solar installations by 10% to 15% through 2022, according to the firm's head of Americas research, M.J. Shiao. Experts don't expect the rooftop solar market to take much of a hit, since rooftop installations are more expensive than large solar farms and panel prices make up a smaller portion of the cost.\n\nWhile Trump's solar decision is better than the worst-case scenario, it is directionally terrible, said Adam Browning, executive director of the advocacy group Vote Solar.\n\nIn the fight against climate change, solar's increasingly low cost is the one glimmer of hope that we have, that we might actually continue to live in the climate that our species evolved in, Browning said. We should be jamming the accelerator, not the breaks.\n\nSolarWorld Americas, one of the two U.S. manufacturers who asked the Trump administration for tariffs, was cautiously optimistic about Monday's announcement.\n\nWe are still reviewing these remedies, and are hopeful they will be enough to address the import surge and to rebuild solar manufacturing in the United States, Juergen Stein, president of SolarWorld Americas, said in a statement. We will work with the U.S. government to implement these remedies, including future negotiations, in the strongest way possible to benefit solar manufacturing and its thousands of American workers to ensure that U.S. solar manufacturing is world-class competitive for the long term.\n\nTrump's action to tax solar imports follows a push by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize coal-fired power plants, which are having trouble competing in an electricity marketplace dominated by cheap solar, wind and natural gas. Perry's plan was rejected by federal energy regulators, but the Trump administration has taken other steps to support fossil fuels, which climate scientists overwhelmingly agree are responsible for the warming of the planet's climate.\n\nThe Interior Department is working to open vast swaths of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling, and the Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back Obama-era regulations designed to speed the replacement of fossil fuels with climate-friendly energy sources like solar and wind.
Trump, Pence meet for first time following public split, violence\n\nPresident Donald Trump met with Vice President Mike Pence Monday for the first time since last week's violence at the U.S. Capitol and since a split opened between the two men after Pence defied Trump by fulfilling his constitutional role in counting electoral votes.\n\nThey reiterated that those who broke the law and stormed the Capitol last week do not represent the America First movement backed by 75 million Americans, and pledged to continue the work on behalf of the country for the remainder of their term, the White House said in a statement.\n\nPence faces criticism from some Trump supporters – and praise from others – for defying the president's demand that he somehow reject the results of the election as Congress met last week to count Electoral College votes. Despite Trump's protestations, Pence noted he had no power to reject the votes.\n\nSpeaking at a rally on Wednesday to supporters, some of whom would later break into the Capitol building, Trump demanded Pence block votes for President-elect Joe Biden during the session. Pence refused Trump's request, saying he lacked the legal authority to discard electoral votes. Some of the rioters who broke into the Capitol made threats toward Pence, who was whisked to an undisclosed location for his safety.\n\nCongressional Democrats then called on Pence to seek a Cabinet vote for Trump's removal under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Pence refused that request, too. Some Republicans have called on Trump to resign and Democrats are queuing up another impeachment against Trump this week.\n\nThe White House specifically referred to the administration continuing for the remainder of the term, which is Jan. 20.\n\nTrump and Pence met Monday evening.\n\n— David Jackson and John Fritze\n\nTrump declares preemptive emergency for inauguration security\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday declared a preemptive emergency in Washington, D.C., for the inauguration of his successor, a move that will allow local officials to more quickly draw on federal resources if they are needed to keep the peace.\n\nThe emergency declaration begins Monday and continues through Jan. 24. President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Biden and city officials have encouraged people not to come to the event, law enforcement officials are preparing for the possibility of protests.\n\nThe emergency declaration will allow the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate disaster relief and to provide assistance for emergency measures to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the District of Columbia, the White House said.\n\nTrump made the declaration days after a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol and disrupted the counting of electoral votes that formalized Biden's win. The riot took place shortly after the president whipped up a crowd outside the White House with false claims about election fraud.\n\n—John Fritze\n\nRep. Tim Ryan: 2 officers suspended in Capitol riots\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, said Monday two police officers were suspended related to the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhen asked if he's heard evidence there was an inside job on Jan. 6, Ryan said, I don't have any direct evidence, as yet, of any kind of inside job, but said two members of the Capitol Police were suspended.\n\nI know that there were two people suspended, one was the selfie officer, and another was an officer who put a MAGA hat on and started directing people around, Ryan said.\n\nThe interim chief determind that to be qualifying for immediate suspension, he said.\n\nCapitol Police did not immediately return a request for comment. USCP union chief Gus Papathanasiou said Monday that he had not been briefed on the matter.\n\n— Sean Rossman\n\nActing Homeland Security chief Wolf resigns\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf is stepping down from his post, days after criticizing President Donald Trump over the riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWolf said in a message to staff that he would step down at 11:59 p.m. Monday, even though he had earlier said he planned to remain in his job. He said Pete Gaynor, who runs the Federal Emergency Management Agency, would become the acting homeland security secretary.\n\nThe resignation comes a day before Trump is set to visit the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nMore:Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf resigns as inauguration security looms\n\nLast week, Wolf asked Trump and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place at the Capitol. Five people died, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer.\n\nWolf said he has condemned violence on both sides of the political aisle, specifically directed at law enforcement. He tweeted we now see some supporters of the President using violence as a means to achieve political ends and called that unacceptable.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nHallmark asks Hawley, Marshall to return political donations\n\nHallmark, the American greeting card company, has asked GOP Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return campaign contributions the firm made in the 2020 election, in the wake of their role in objecting to President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College count last week.\n\nHawley led the charge to object to finalizing Biden's win in the Nov. 3 presidential election, and Marshall supported that move along with several other Republican senators. They did so even after a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to overturn the election and a direct attack on the democratic process. The attack left five people dead.\n\nHallmark believes the peaceful transition of power is part of the bedrock of our democratic system, Hallmark said in an emailed statement. The recent actions of Senators Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall do not reflect our company's values. As a result, HALLPAC (the company's political action committee) requested Sens. Hawley and Marshall to return all HALLPAC campaign contributions.\n\nCampaign donations:Businesses rethink political donations after Capitol siege\n\nThe firm's political action committee donated $12,000 to Hawley and $5,000 to Marshall in the 2020 election, according to campaign finance records. Hallmark is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, and the company is a key political force in Missouri politics.\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen and William Cummings\n\nPompeo mum on Capitol assault as he touts America as 'greatest nation that civilization has ever known'\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo made no mention of last week's deadly riots at the U.S. Capitol – aimed at upending a peace transition of power – during a speech Monday in which he repeatedly touted American exceptionalism.\n\nPompeo made the remarks at the Voice of America, part of the U.S. government media agency that also operates Radio Liberty and other outlets dedicated to promoting American-style democracy around the world.\n\nIn his remarks, Pompeo denounced political correctness and suggested VOA's mission had been compromised – until the Trump administration vetted its journalists and made other changes.\n\nCritics have said the Trump administration politicized the agency and its journalism, seeking to turn it into a mouthpiece for the president.\n\nBut Pompeo claimed VOA's news reports became less about telling the truth about America and too often about demeaning America.\n\n... It is not fake news for you to broadcast that this is the greatest nation in the history of the world and the greatest nation that civilization has ever known, Pompeo argued.\n\nIt was a remarkable assertion given last week's events, in which a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and tried to stop the Electoral College count certifying President-elect Joe Biden's election win. The attack left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nPompeo made no mention of that assault on the seat of American government, and he was not asked about it in a short question-and-answer session afterward.\n\nPompeo did reference the fact that some VOA employees had privately objected to his planned remarks – blasting the dissension as part of a new woke culture.\n\nIt all points in one direction – authoritarianism cloaked as moral righteousness, Pompeo said. It's time that we simply put woke-ism to sleep.\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBiden: Trump 'should not be in office' over Capitol riot\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden said Monday investigators should focus on holding accountable those who engaged in sedition in last Wednesday's violent assault on the Capitol.\n\nWhen asked if Trump is among those who engaged in sedition, Biden said: I think President Trump should not be in office. Period.\n\nHis comments came an hour after House Democrats introduced a new impeachment article against Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection as part of a broader effort to remove the president for his role in last week's attack before his term ends on Jan. 20.\n\nSome Democrats have suggested delaying sending the impeachment article to the Senate in order to give the upper chamber time to first consider Biden's nominations and policy priorities before holding an impeachment trial.\n\nBiden told reporters it's his hope and expectation that if the House moves forward, the Senate would split up the workday by spending the mornings confirming the president-elect's nominees and approving his coronavirus relief package, and the afternoons on a Trump impeachment trial.\n\nThe Senate is required to end any legislative or executive business at 1 p.m. each day during an impeachment trial.\n\nDespite fears that pro-Trump rioters would return to Washington, D.C., on Inauguration Day, Biden insisted he would proceed with his swearing-in ceremony as planned.\n\nI am not afraid to take the oath outside, he said.\n\nBiden spoke to reporters in Newark, Delaware, after receiving his second and final dose of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.\n\nPfizer's vaccine, which was the first to receive emergency authorization use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is administered in two doses, three weeks apart. Biden and his wife Jill Biden received their first dose on Dec. 21.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump's job approval plummets after mob attack\n\nPresident Donald Trump's job approval rating has plummeted following last week's mob attack on the U.S. Capitol, tying the lowest point of his presidency.\n\nIn a new Quinnipiac University poll, 33% of American voters said they approve how Trump is handling his job, a dramatic drop of 11 percentage points since December, when 44% said they approved of his job performance. It's the lowest mark for Trump since Aug. 2, 2017, when it was also at 33%.\n\nAmong Democrats, 94% disapprove of Trump's job performance and 4% approve. Seventy-one percent of Republican voters approve of Trump's job performance, while 20% disapprove. Independent voters, by a margin of 65% to 28%, disapprove of his job performance.\n\nRead the full story:Trump's job approval rating plummets after mob attack at Capitol\n\nThe poll found 56% of voters hold Trump responsible for storming the Capitol, while 42% said they do not hold him responsible.\n\nA slight majority of voters, 52%, said Trump should be removed from office, while 45% of respondents said he should not. A slightly higher percentage, 53% to 43%, said he should resign from the White House.\n\nA majority of Americans hold President Trump responsible for the chaos at the Capitol, and a slight majority believe that he should be removed from office, said Tim Malloy, a Quinnipiac University polling analyst.\n\nThe poll of 1,239 self-identified registered voters nationwide was taken Jan. 7-10. It has a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.\n\nAfter his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden, Trump is set to exit the White House on Jan. 20. But he first faces an impeachment effort from Democrats, who want Trump removed from office for inspiring a group of pro-Trump rioters to storm the Capitol while electoral votes were being counted.\n\nThe poll found 74% of voters believe democracy in American is under threat while just 21% said it is alive and well.\n\nSixty percent of the poll's respondents said Trump is undermining democracy, while 34% said he's protecting democracy. Among Republican voters, 73% said Trump is protecting democracy and only 20% said he is undermining democracy.\n\nWhen it comes to whether American democracy is under threat, Malloy said, both Republicans and Democrats see a raging five-alarm fire, but clearly disagree on who started it.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nSenate Dem calls on Ethics Committee to consider expulsion, censure of Hawley, Cruz\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on the Ethics Committee to consider expulsion or other punishments for Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley in connection to last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nCruz and Hawley led the charge in the Senate to object to the count of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory, feeding false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to stop the count and overturn the election.\n\nThe Senate Ethics Committee also must consider the expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others, said Whitehouse, who represents Rhode Island.\n\nCruz and Hawley's spokespeople did not immediate respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhitehouse also said Cruz, Hawley and Sen. Ron Johnson, the top Republican on the Senate's homeland security committee, should be removed from key committees while the Senate probes the Capitol attack.\n\nThe Senate will need to conduct security review of what happened and what went wrong, likely through its Judiciary, Homeland Security and Rules Committees, Whitehouse said.\n\nBecause of massive potential conflict of interest, Senators Cruz, Hawley, and Johnson (at least) need to be off all relevant committees reviewing this matter until the investigation of their role is complete, he said.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, also suggested Cruz and Hawley should face consequences for objecting to Biden's legitimate win.\n\nEven a member of Congress that commits a crime, you know, they expel from the body, Thompson said in an interview Monday on SiriusXM's The Joe Madison Show. There are ethics charges that can be brought against those individuals.\n\n…What Hawley did and what Cruz did was horrible, he added.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, a Republican who led the House GOP's objection to Biden's win, is also under fire from his Democratic colleagues.\n\nOn Monday, Reps. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, both Democrats, introduced a resolution to censure Brooks for inciting violence against his fellow members of Congress as part of last week's assault on the United States Capitol.\n\nThey note that on the day of the assault, Brooks addressed the pro-Trump crowd that later tried to seize the Capitol. In his remarks, denounced other lawmakers who were planning to recognize Biden's Electoral College win.\n\nToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass, Brooks told the crowd.\n\nBrooks has refused to apologize for his remarks in the days since the mob attacked the Capitol, which left five people dead.\n\nRep. Brooks knew perfectly well what he was doing — and whom he was inciting —when he encouraged the mob set on storming the Capitol to commit violence on Wednesday, Malinowski said. His actions endangered the lives of his fellow members of Congress, the vice president, and the police officers who bravely tried to defend the Capitol, and he deserves at the very least the formal condemnation of the House.\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nImpeachment article introduced\n\nHouse Democrats on Monday introduced an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump, accusing him of inciting an insurrection in the violent Capitol riots last week.\n\nThere may well be a vote on impeachment on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters.\n\nIf passed by the Democrat-controlled House, Hoyer said the article should immediately be sent to the Senate.\n\nSome Democrats have suggested the article should be delayed to give the Senate time to first consider President-elect Joe Biden's nominations and top policy priorities for holding an impeachment trial.\n\nWhile the article has no Republican cosponsors, Rep. David Cicilline, one of the authors of the article, said he's hopeful some will vote for it.\n\nHe incited insurrection against the government of the United States that resulted in the death of five individuals, dozens of people injured in violence here at the Capitol, the Rhode Island Democrat told reporters Monday.\n\nCicilline said he and other Democrats would prefer that Pence trigger the 25th Amendment or that Trump resign on his own.\n\nDays have passed, and it is clear that neither of those possibilities will be realized, Cicilline wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times published Monday. So it is Congress's responsibility to act.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump admin. blacklists 7 Ukrainian operatives as part of Russia-backed influence campaign targeting Biden\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday slapped sanctions on seven Ukrainian officials for their role in a malign Russian-backed campaign to undermine President-elect Joe Biden's candidacy in the 2020 election.\n\nIn its announcement, the State Department did not name Biden. But it said several of the Ukrainian individuals sanctioned in Monday's action worked with Andrii Derkach, a member of Ukraine's parliament and an active Russian intelligence agent, in the coordinated dissemination and promotion of fraudulent or unsubstantiated allegations involving a U.S. political candidate.\n\nDerkach was a key player in Russia's efforts to tarnish Biden with unsubstantiated allegations that while vice president, Biden sought to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired so that he would not investigate his son, Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, when his father was vice president. There is no evidence that Biden did anything wrong.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Derkach in September, calling him a longtime Russian agent and saying the step was part of a broader effort to expose Russian malign influence campaigns and protecting our upcoming elections from foreign interference.\n\nThe new announcement says seven individuals and four entities were part of a Russia-linked foreign influence network associated with Derkach. They include former Ukrainian officials Konstantin Kulyk, Oleksandr Onyshchenko, and Andriy Telizhenko, as well as a current member of the Ukrainian parliament, Oleksandr Dubinsky.\n\nThey have made repeated public statements advancing malicious narratives that U.S. Government officials have engaged in corrupt dealings in Ukraine, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday.\n\nPompeo also said the entities sanctioned on Monday are all media front companies operating in Ukraine – NabuLeaks, Era-Media, Only News, and Skeptik TOV. The State Department said these outlets disseminate false narratives at the behest of Derkach's and his associates.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nNew York bar association considers revoking Rudy Giuliani's membership\n\nThe New York State Bar Association is considering removing Rudy Giuliani from its membership after the attorney for President Donald Trump urged supporters to have trial by combat before a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol Wednesday.\n\nScott Karson, the organization's president, has launched an inquiry to determine whether Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, should be revoked, the association announced Monday.\n\nThis decision is historic for NYSBA, and we have not made it lightly, the group said. We cannot stand idly by and allow those intent on rending the fabric of our democracy to go unchecked.\n\nThe association said it has received hundreds of complaints in recent weeks about Giuliani and his unfounded efforts to cast doubt on the veracity of the 2020 presidential election. Seeking to overturn the election, Giuliani led Trump lawsuits in several states – each rejected -- that alleged voter fraud without evidence.\n\nMore:YouTube removes Rudy Giuliani podcast video and Steve Bannon's channel as it cracks down on misinformation\n\nAt a Trump rally before Congress counted the Electoral College votes last week, Giuliani reiterated the baseless claims of voter fraud in the presidential election and the Georgia U.S. Senate runoffs.\n\nIf we're wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we're right a lot of them will go to jail, Giuliani told the crowd. Let's have trial by combat.\n\nThe bar association's bylaws state no person who advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States, or of any state, territory or possession thereof, or of any political subdivision therein, by force or other illegal means, shall be a member of the Association.\n\nMr. Giuliani's words quite clearly were intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election's outcome to take matters into their own hands, the bar association said in a statement. Their subsequent attack on the Capitol was nothing short of an attempted coup, intended to prevent the peaceful transition of power.\n\nGiuliani will be provided due process and have an opportunity to explain and defend his words and actions, according to the bar association. Bar leaders did not provide a timeline on a decision.\n\nGiuliani has practiced law in New York for decades. He served as a federal prosecutor in the 1980s including as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before becoming mayor in 1994.\n\nIf his bar membership is revoked, Giuliani could still practice law in New York. Disbarring a lawyer for misconduct in the state must come from a Grievance Committee appointed by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nMajor US companies to pause donations to GOP lawmakers who objected to finalizing Biden's win\n\nSeveral major U.S. corporations plan to suspend donations to the Republican lawmakers who voted against finalizing President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory last week.\n\nWe have taken the destructive events at the Capitol to undermine a legitimate and fair election into consideration and will be pausing political giving from our political action committee to those who voted against certification of the election, Marriott International Inc, one of the world's largest hotel companies, said in an emailed statement.\n\nOther companies that said they will halt donations include Commerce Bank, headquartered in Missouri, and Blue Cross Blue Shield, the health insurance giant. The news was first reported by Popular Information, a political news website that said it surveyed 144 companies about their political donations to GOP lawmakers after last week's riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe deadly assault on Congress – which left five people dead – was carried about by extremists supporting President Donald Trump, who repeatedly encouraged his followers to try to overturn the election.\n\nIn light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, (Blue Cross Blue Shield Association) will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy, the health insurance company said in a statement posted on its website.\n\nA spokesperson for Commerce Bank did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. But in a statement to CNN, the bank said it would end donations to those GOP officials who impeded the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nCommerce Bank condemns violence in any form and believes the actions witnessed this week are abhorrent, anti-democratic and entirely contrary to supporting goodwill for Americans and businesses, the statement said.\n\nMarriott's political action committee donated nearly $200,000 to federal candidates in the 2020 election cycle, with 45% of that money, about $90,000, going to Republican candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield's PAC shelled out more than $370,000 in campaign contributions in the last election, with 66% – about $240,000 – going to Republicans, the center's data shows.\n\nCitigroup, the global investment banking firm, sent an internal memo to employees on Friday stating its intention to pause contributions entirely for the first quarter of the year.\n\nWe want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law, says the memo, shared with USA TODAY. We intend to pause our contributions during the quarter as the country goes through the Presidential transition and hopefully emerges from these events stronger and more united.\n\nThe note, from Citi's government affairs chief Candida Wolff, said of the candidates who led the charge against counting Biden's Electoral College win, the company's PAC donated $1,000 to Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nObama, Bush, Clinton to join Biden for wreath-laying ceremony after inauguration\n\nFormer Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will join President-elect Joe Biden at Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier following Biden's swearing-in ceremony next week.\n\nBiden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will lay the wreath following their swearing-in and a Pass in Review inspection of the troops at the Capitol on Jan. 20, Biden's inaugural committee announced Monday. The ceremony will be one of Biden's first official acts as the new commander in chief.\n\nThe committee said the theme of Biden's inauguration will be America United.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday he will not attend Biden's inaugural, making him the first outgoing president in 152 years to refuse to attend his successor's inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence will attend the ceremony.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nDemocrats to introduce resolution calling for 25th Amendment\n\nHouse Democrats will introduce a resolution Monday calling for President Donald Trump's removal via the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president incapable of performing his duties.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi laid out the steps they plan to take in a letter to colleagues on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., will request unanimous consent for the Raskin Resolution, which calls on Pence to convene the Cabinet and activate the 25th Amendment. If they don't receive consent – which is almost guaranteed since only a single Republican would have to object – Democrats will vote on the measure on Tuesday.\n\nWe are calling on the Vice President to respond within 24 hours after the resolution is passed, Pelosi said. If Pence does not act before that deadline, House Democrats will introduce articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nIn protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both, Pelosi wrote. As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.\n\nPelosi told CBS News' 60 Minutes on Sunday that she prefers the 25th Amendment to impeachment.\n\nWell, I like the 25th Amendment because it gets rid of him. He's out of office, she said. But there's strong support in the Congress for impeaching the president a second time.\n\nUnder the 25th Amendment, if the vice president and the majority of the Cabinet declare the president unfit for office, the vice president immediately becomes the acting president.\n\nImpeachment is a lengthier process. First, a simple majority in the House must vote in favor of charges. Then, the Senate must hold a trial to consider the charges. For the president to be removed, two-thirds of its members must vote to convict.\n\n– Camille Caldera\n\nMore:Momentum for Trump impeachment soars as some in GOP say it's warranted after Capitol riot\n\nReports: FBI, NYPD warned Capitol Police about threat of extremist violence\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation and New York City Police Department both informed the U.S. Capitol Police about the threat of violence ahead of last Wednesday's planned protest of the counting of the Electoral College vote, according to reports by Fox News and NBC News.\n\nIn several instances, the FBI visited extremists who were planning to travel to the rally and urged them to not attend, according to Fox News. Capitol Police did not plan to increase staffing ahead of the events and did not expect that the attendees would begin an armed insurrection and violently storm the Capitol, sources also told Fox.\n\nSocial media was a critical part of organizing the protests. Conservative activists and President Donald Trump had advertised the rally for weeks. Far-right extremist groups had intimated they would engage in violence on message boards in the days before the attack, leading some senior officials to question why federal law enforcement was not better prepared, according to NBC News.\n\nLawmakers at all levels of government and across the aisle have called for investigations into the failure of law enforcement to defend the Capitol.\n\nObviously it was a failure or you would not have had people enter the Capitol by breaking windows and terrorizing the members of Congress who were doing a very sacred requirement of their jobs, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said a day after the attacks.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nBiden selects career diplomat William Burns to head CIA\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has selected career diplomat William J. Burns as his pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, the transition committee said in a press release Monday.\n\nBurns, who has served in the Middle East and Russia, will inherit the country's premier intelligence agency as cybersecurity and espionage from rival nations like China, Iran and Russia will be of chief concern to the incoming Biden administration.\n\nThe Biden transition contended Burns was well prepared the challenge, noting he has the experience and skill to marshal efforts across government and around the world to ensure the CIA is positioned to protect the American people.\n\nBurns shares my profound belief that intelligence must be apolitical and that the dedicated intelligence professionals serving our nation deserve our gratitude and respect, Biden said in a statement. Ambassador Burns will bring the knowledge, judgment, and perspective we need to prevent and confront threats before they can reach our shores.\n\nBurns left the U.S. Foreign Service in 2014 after 33-years. Most recently, Burns was president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank with a focus on foreign policy and international affairs.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nDemocrats to introduce resolution calling for 25th Amendment\n\nHouse Democrats will introduce a resolution Monday calling for President Donald Trump's removal via the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president incapable of performing his duties.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi laid out the steps they plan to take in a letter to colleagues on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., will request unanimous consent for the Raskin Resolution, which calls on Pence to convene the Cabinet and activate the 25th Amendment.

Associated Press\n\nHOUSTON (AP) — While his Atlanta Falcons teammates are enjoying a little down time, Ben Garland is hard at work.\n\nHe's watching plays on his iPad and jotting down a few tips in a spiral notebook.\n\nNo time to relax.\n\nHe'll have a lot to remember come Sunday.\n\nGarland could be one of the rare players to play both sides in the Super Bowl, since he's a backup on Atlanta's offensive and defensive lines, in addition to his special-team duties.\n\nIt's a lot of studying, a lot of homework, a lot of film work, Garland said. But it's totally worth it.\n\nThe 28-year-old Garland played defensive tackle during his college career at the Air Force and early in his NFL career, but he wound up being moved to the offensive line.\n\nThen, during training camp before this season, Falcons coach Dan Quinn approached Garland about working with both units.\n\nThe lineman jumped at the chance. After all, he's been released three times and spent a lot of time on the practice squad, so he was willing to do anything that might improve his chances of staying in the league.\n\nI have multiple iPads, Garland said. I've got to watch offense, defense, everything. But I'm glad the coach gave me the opportunity to do it.\n\nThis week in Houston, Garland has been getting extra work at center while Pro Bowler Alex Mack nurses an injured fibula.\n\nMack is expected to start on Sunday, but Garland is the insurance policy. If not needed there, he could play some defense. Already in the playoffs, he was credited with a safety when Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson tripped in the end zone and Garland landed on top of him, perhaps the biggest play in a career that has gone largely unnoticed.\n\nThat was awesome, he said. Any time you get a sack or a safety, it's a great day, let alone in a game like that.\n\nQuinn certainly appreciates what Garland means to the Falcons.\n\nHe's been a real factor for us, the coach said. One of the terms that we use is guys that don't show up on the stat sheet but own their role, and Ben exemplifies that on our team as well as anybody.\n\nGarland has to work around a schedule that doesn't always allow him to be in every meeting.\n\nI've got to go back and talk to coaches and other players to get the information I missed, he said. But's that's the only drawback.\n\nAnd for those who think it's no big deal to play offensive and defensive line, they are actually quite different.\n\nOn the offensive line, you're so balanced. A lot of the offensive positions are not natural. It's very compact, arched back, everything's trying to be balanced, Garland explained. Whereas on D-line, you can be a little bit more aggressive. You can be a little more athletic. ... So getting that relationship of being aggressive on defense yet being extremely balanced when you come back to offense is probably the hardest part.\n\nGarland doesn't have a favorite.\n\nI love them both, for different reasons, he said. On defense, you can just let it loose and fly around and get after somebody. But on offense, when you get all 11 guys working simultaneously and a play breaks, that's a cool feeling to have.\n\nGarland's work ethic is unquestioned, but that's to be expected from a player who had to delay his pro career while serving a two-year military commitment. He's now a captain in the Colorado Air National Guard, serving out the rest of his stint between seasons.\n\nHe's a man of great character, Quinn said. He's somebody that's going to be there early and he's going to stay late. Often times he's the first guy onto the practice field working stuff at center. He wants to stay after, work extra things.\n\nThe only other drawback about being a two-way player?\n\nWhen he catches grief from opponents about turning up on the other side of the line.\n\nThey're like, 'What are you doing here?' Garland said with a smile.\n\nA small price to pay, that's for sure.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

Associated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS - A man who was fatally shot by Las Vegas police while holding a cellphone that was mistaken for a gun had recently been convicted of multiple crimes in Arizona, his attorney said Saturday.\n\nBrad Reinhart last had contact with his client, Keith Childress Jr., 23, last month when a jury was set to issue a verdict in his trial for stealing marijuana and guns from a Phoenix home in 2013. Reinhart said he texted Childress to be at the courthouse, but he never showed up.\n\nHe didn't show up for the final hearing. They had a warrant out for him, Reinhart said.\n\nLas Vegas police said they were assisting U.S. marshals in arresting Childress because he was accused of multiple violent felonies in Arizona including attempted murder. Reinhart said while Childress' crimes were serious, they never included a charge of attempted murder.\n\nAccording to Maricopa County Superior Court records, a jury convicted Childress on Dec. 17 of burglary, armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated assault and theft.\n\nThe Clark County Office of the Coroner identified Childress on Saturday and said he died from multiple gunshot wounds. His death was ruled a homicide.\n\nThe shooting occurred Thursday after Childress had been under surveillance and fled from federal authorities, Las Vegas police said in a statement.\n\nChildress was found outside a home west of downtown. Police said his right hand held what they believed to be a firearm.\n\nOfficers told him to drop the gun and ordered him to stop when he began to move toward them. Police said two officers opened fire when Childress didn't obey their commands. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nPolice later said Childress was actually holding a cellphone.\n\nNo officers, agents or bystanders were injured, Police spokesman Officer Larry Hadfield said.\n\nPolice Capt. Matt McCarthy of the department's office of Internal Oversight and Constitutional Policing said the officers shot at the man because the confrontation was in a residential area and involved a man wanted for attempted murder who they thought was holding a gun.\n\nThe suspect did not listen, quickly began to advance on the officers, concealing his right hand, which the officers believed was holding a firearm, McCarthy said in a video message that accompanied the police statement.\n\nThe two officers who shot Childress have not been identified, but they are expected to be named soon in line with department policy.\n\nReinhart said Childress' family wants answers and he plans to inquire into the shooting. He said the description from police makes it appear as though Childress wanted officers to shoot him.\n\nThat did not strike me as the type of guy he was. He had two kids and a kid on the way, Reinhart said.\n\nIt was the 16th shooting in which an officer opened fire or was shot at in 2015 in the Las Vegas area.\n\nChildress and three other men, including his half brother, were charged with forcibly entering a Phoenix home in March 2013 and stealing marijuana and weapons. But Childress was not the ring leader, Reinhart said.\n\nHe definitely got caught up in a bad situation, Reinhart said. But, he wasn't a violent kind of guy.
Iranian state TV reported Tuesday that at least 56 people were killed and 213 injured in a stampede at a funeral procession for the nation's slain Gen. Qasem Soleimani in his hometown of Kerman in southeastern Iran.\n\nSoleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump.\n\nA procession in Tehran on Monday drew more than 1 million people in Iran's capital, crowding main thoroughfares and side streets. Emergency services in Kerman blamed high levels of congestion and overcrowding for the deaths.\n\nClick 'play' above to hear USA TODAY's Kim Hjelmgaard put Soleimani's funeral crowds in context.\n\nLatest:What you need to know about the death of Gen. Qasem Soleimani\n\nIran's semi-official ISNA news agency said authorities later delayed Soleimani's burial because of concerns about the massive crowd.\n\nIt did not say when the burial would take place.\n\nSoleimani's killing has reignited fears Tehran and Washington could be on the brink of a military confrontation. Both sides say they want to avoid war. Iran has pledged revenge for the death of one its most revered commanders, and it has indicated it could take the form of a military strike against U.S. forces. And speaking in a cable news interview Tuesday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, We are not looking to start a war with Iran, but we are prepared to finish one.\n\nQasem Soleimani killing:Iran OKs bill calling U.S. military terrorists\n\nSoleimani headed the Quds Force, an elite wing of the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Quds orchestrates Iran's deep ties to non-state armed militants groups in the Middle East, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq, with whom Soleimani was holding meetings when he was killed in the U.S. strike near Baghdad's airport Friday.\n\nAmong other Iran-related developments:
WASHINGTON – The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear Tuesday from William Barr, President Donald Trump's nominee to become attorney general. Here are seven things to watch for at the hearing:\n\n1. Mueller investigation\n\nBarr wrote a memo in June about Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller pursuing a possible obstruction of justice charge against Trump, arguing the probe was fatally misconceived.\n\nSenate Democrats plan to press Barr on whether he will support the Mueller probe.\n\nI want to make sure that (Barr) is not going to take the position that he should just protect Trump at all costs, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, told USA TODAY. I want to hear from him that the attorney general's office is an independent entity.\n\nBarr said in a copy of his testimony released Monday that Mueller should be allowed to complete his work. Barr said the memo was written about a narrow obstruction-of-justice statute rather than about the special counsel's authority more broadly.\n\nI can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision, Barr said.\n\nMore:President Trump to nominate former Attorney General William Barr to replace Jeff Sessions\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\n2. Trump and Russia\n\nThe FBI began not just a criminal investigation before Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, but a counterintelligence probe, according to a report in The New York Times.\n\nSen. Christopher Coons, D-Del., said the report suggests there may have been more concerns that sparked the Mueller investigation than were publicly known at the time. Coons told reporters Monday he will focus during on whether Barr will stand up for the rule of law and the appropriate independence of the Department of Justice.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe as a witch hunt and denied colluding with Russia to win the election.\n\nI never worked for Russia, Trump said Monday. Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big, fat hoax.\n\n3. Executive power\n\nBarr, who was attorney general from November 1991 to January 1993 and earlier served as deputy attorney general and headed the Office of Legal Counsel, holds an expansive view of the president's executive power.\n\nIn the legal counsel job, Barr wrote opinions that justified the FBI arresting fugitives overseas and the invasion of Panama and arrest of dictator Manuel Noriega. As deputy attorney general, Barr told former President George H.W. Bush he had the authority to attack Iraq without congressional approval.\n\nBarr could face an early test of executive authority if he is confirmed because Trump has threatened to proclaim a national emergency to shift funding from other departments to build the wall along the southern border.\n\nI think it's important to know what kind of judgment the attorney general nominee might provide for the president on the scope of his power, Coons said.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he was sure Barr would be asked about his opinion about the relationship between Justice and the other parts of the executive branch, including but not limited to the office of the presidency.\n\n4. Partisan clashes\n\nThe hearing comes amid significant turnover in Trump's Cabinet, with acting secretaries at the Justice, Defense, Interior departments, along with White House chief of staff and head of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe Justice Department has a role in developing administration policy over a variety of hot-button issues, including immigration and voting rights.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said several Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are running for president and have demonstrated that they will treat almost anything like a political circus. Cruz himself is a former 2016 presidential candidate.\n\nCoons said tensions linger from the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which he called one of the most divisive and charged hearings during his eight years in the Senate. But Barr helped himself by releasing a statement that answered questions and addressed concerns, Coons said.\n\nIt is my hope that everyone will conduct themselves in appropriate, professional ways, Coons said.\n\n5. Criminal justice policy\n\nLawmakers are expected to press Barr on a criminal-justice overhaul, which in part would give judges more discretion in sentencing. His predecessor, Jeff Sessions, had been an advocate of harsh punishment, directing prosecutors to seek the toughest charges possible.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said she wants to ask about department initiatives such as criminal-justice overhaul, immigration, human trafficking and opioids.\n\nIn his prepared testimony, Barr said the crime rate has fallen substantially since he last last served as attorney general in 1992, when his priority was to target violent offenders and gangs. Barr said the First Step Act, the name for the overhaul legislation, recognizes the progress made and he said he would diligently implement it.\n\nI believe we must keep up the pressure on chronic, violent criminals, Barr said. We cannot allow the progress we have made to be reversed.\n\n6. Immigration\n\nBarr will testify during a partial shutdown of the federal government – at more than three weeks, the longest in history. Trump and congressional Democrats are at a stalemate over immigration policy, with the president insisting on $5.7 billion for construction of a wall along the southern border.\n\nBarr said in his prepared testimony that immigration has been a huge benefit, but that the country couldn't accommodate many millions of people who would come from poorer countries if there were no restrictions.\n\nIn short, in order to ensure that our immigration system works properly, we must secure our nation's borders, and we must ensure that our laws allow us to process, hold and remove those who unlawfully enter, Barr said.\n\n7. Justice Dept. morale problems\n\nBarr could face questions about sagging morale at the Department of Justice, which has been a target of Trump's criticism for the past two years.\n\nTrump fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, the day after the midterm election in November after sharply criticizing him for recusing himself from the Mueller investigation. Trump has also blasted FBI repeatedly for corrupt and incompetent leadership and investigators.\n\nBarr said in his prepared remarks that he would protect the department's integrity.\n\nAbove all else, if confirmed, I will work diligently to protect the professionalism and integrity of the department as an institution, and I will strive to leave it, and the nation, a stronger and better place, Barr said.\n\nMore:Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein expected to leave Justice Department after Senate confirms William Barr
Jessica Durando\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFree Jack Worth?\n\nOne student at Emerson College decided to list his dorm room on Airbnb in January so folks could explore Boston and perhaps take in sights like Fenway Park or the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nNow, he could face disciplinary action from the school, according to the Boston Globe.\n\nWorth told the Globe that Emerson saw the listing last week and told him to remove it. After the page was deleted, Worth told the news organization that he was fined $150 by Airbnb.\n\nSo, why did he list his dorm? There's a high level of interest of travel in this neighborhood because it's so centrally located. I saw this as a way to make some money, but also help some people out, Worth told the news organization.\n\nA change.org petition now has 278 supporters of Worth as of Tuesday. The petition said that the school is levying several charges of misconduct against him, which could result in disciplinary action as extreme as his dismissal.\n\nAlthough Emerson would not comment directly on Worth's case, the College said in a statement to Boston.com that the residence hall policy and the housing contract that undergraduate residents sign prohibit students from subleasing or renting College housing units or beds to protect residents and the community from exposure to safety and security risks.\n\nOne student, Ari Howorth, wrote on the change.org petition page that there is nothing criminal with providing cheap housing to travelers. Jack Worth gave travelers from far and wide a taste of Boston life and the Emerson experience simply because he wanted to help those who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to stay in the downtown area.\n\nAvi Korbman, a commenter on the page, said, Wherever I am, I stand with Jack Worth. #FreeJack Worth.\n\nOthers have taken to social media in reaction to the situation.
On the heels of her first loss, UFC strawweight Cynthia Calvillo has been dealt another blow.\n\nCalvillo (6-1 MMA, 3-1 UFC) has been informed of a potential violation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency stemming from a positive drug test for marijuana, the UFC announced late Wednesday night.\n\nThe positive test stems from an in-competition sample collected in conjunction with UFC 219, which took place Dec. 30 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Calvillo that night lost via unanimous decision to former champion Carla Esparza.\n\nThe 30-year-old Calvillo, who's only fought professionally since 2016, was named MMAjunkie's Newcomer of the Year for 2017. She fought her first four fights in the UFC last year, going 3-1.\n\nBelow is the full statement from the UFC:\n\nThe UFC organization was notified today that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) informed Cynthia Calvillo of a potential Anti-Doping Policy violation involving Carboxy-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Carboxy-THC) which is a metabolite of marijuana and/or hashish, above the decision limit of 180 ng/mL, stemming from an in-competition sample collected in conjunction with her recent bout in Las Vegas, Nevada on December 30, 2017, UFC 219: Cyborg vs. Holm. USADA, the independent administrator of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, will handle the results management and appropriate adjudication of this case involving Calvillo, as it relates to the UFC Anti-Doping Policy and future UFC participation. Because the Nevada Athletic Commission was the regulatory body overseeing the fight in Las Vegas and has licensing jurisdiction over Calvillo, USADA will work to ensure that the Nevada Athletic Commission has the necessary information to determine its proper judgment of Calvillo's potential anti-doping violation. Additional information will be provided at the appropriate time as the process moves forward.\n\nFor more on UFC 219, visit the UFC events section of the site.
AP\n\nImagine this: Kevin Durant is out of bounds by an enormous margin, all three referees somehow miss the obvious infraction and Golden State winds up getting a basket that it didn't deserve to take the lead with a few seconds remaining.\n\nIt seemed implausible.\n\nThat is, until it happened.\n\nWhen such a scene played out last week in the Houston-Golden State overtime thriller, James Harden kept a ton of egg from landing on the NBA's face when he connected on a 3-pointer to give the Rockets a win in a game they would have screamed bloody murder about otherwise. But what if he missed? Or worse, if a call that big got missed in Game 7 of the NBA Finals?\n\nHow do you miss that? TNT analyst Reggie Miller mused while watching the Durant replay.\n\nAn obvious question, with an obvious answer: It's time for a change.\n\nEveryone in the NBA replay center in Secaucus, New Jersey that night surely saw Durant standing out of bounds. But there is no mechanism for the replay crews to trigger a review of such a play — since, under NBA rules as they're written now, they can only get involved if a call is made on the floor.\n\nThe league doesn't want a system where every call is challenged or reviewed because games would take forever. There are bang-bang plays in every game, and someone will always be mad when a block-charge call doesn't go their way. But the NBA has been thinking about changes, such as adding a coaches' challenge option that they've tinkered with in the G League and at summer league.\n\nFor now, here's a solution:\n\nGive the referees sitting in Secaucus that night the option of triggering a review late in games based on what they see. It would just make sense, because the NBA insists the top priority in these situations is getting calls right. True, a call made in the first 2 minutes might have just as much effect on an outcome as one in the last 2 minutes, but people just seem more fixated upon the stuff at the end.\n\nWe're dealing with human beings, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last year. And people lose their cool under pressure at times.\n\nCameras aren't affected by pressure. So use them.\n\nBATTLING WIZARDS\n\nTo say that Washington's Bradley Beal had high hopes entering this season is an understatement.\n\nIf you look at us on paper, we look absolutely amazing, Beal said back at media day.\n\nThey look much different now. But they're still fighting.\n\nJohn Wall's season is over. Dwight Howard's season hasn't really gotten started. Markieff Morris' season won't resume for a few more weeks, at least. The Wizards are 11th in the Eastern Conference, yet insist their resolve is still intact — as was evident in their win over Oklahoma City on Sunday night.\n\nWe're banged up and I haven't heard one player, nor coach, feel sorry for ourselves that we've got guys missing, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. It's just what we have to do. Sure, we would love to have everybody here all season long, but that hasn't been the case and now we know guys are going to be out for the rest of the season and we've just got to tie the laces up and compete for one another.\n\nThe Wizards started 2-9, then went 9-5 in their next 14 games and looked as though they were righting the ship.\n\nIt's been one bad break after another since, but they're still fighting to get back into the playoff hunt.\n\nThat's what we have to do, Beal said. We have to step in for John, for Keif, for Dwight — those are key guys and we need everybody to be able to step up and fill in those roles in whatever way possible. Whatever it looks like, as long as we get a win. That's something we continue to preach every day.\n\nHALFTIME\n\nFor the first time in five years, Golden State will not have the best record in the NBA at the midway mark — after 41 games.\n\nThis year, that distinction will go to Milwaukee, Toronto or Denver.\n\nFew would have picked that to be the case three months ago.\n\nThe Bucks, at 27-11 with three games left in the first half of their schedule, are in position for their best 41-game start since opening 30-11 during the 1980-81 season.\n\nToronto matched a franchise best by opening 29-12 — tying what it did last year, even while dealing with the coaching change from Dwane Casey to Nick Nurse, the addition of Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, the departure of DeMar DeRozan and injuries to Jonas Valanciunias and Kyle Lowry.\n\nThe Nuggets, 26-11 so far, might end up with their best 41-game start ever. They were 29-12 in 1976-77.\n\nMILESTONE WATCH\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry loves the 3, and San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich has said he hates the 3.\n\nFitting, then, that they're both approaching No. 3 on some NBA all-time lists this week.\n\nPopovich enters the week with 1,220 regular-season wins, one shy of matching Jerry Sloan for third-most in NBA history. When Popovich passes Sloan, only Don Nelson (1,335) and Lenny Wilkens (1,332) will be ahead of him on the list.\n\nCurry made 10 3-pointers on Saturday night, moving him past Utah's Kyle Korver for fourth on the NBA career list from beyond the arc; Curry has 2,277, while Korver has 2,274 entering Monday. Both are about to pass Jason Terry, whose 2,282 career 3-pointers rank No. 3 in NBA history — for a few more days.\n\nRay Allen leads the all-time list with 2,973, and Reggie Miller is second with 2,560. At his current pace, Curry will catch Miller in about a year and Allen in about two years.\n\nYOUTH MOVEMENT\n\nMinnesota fired Tom Thibodeau on Sunday and replaced him with Ryan Saunders, the son of former Minnesota coach Flip Saunders.\n\nRyan Saunders is 32. There are 43 players older than him who have logged NBA minutes this season, including three members of the Timberwolves: Luol Deng, Anthony Tolliver and Taj Gibson.\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\nA game to watch every day this week:\n\n— Denver at Houston, Monday: MVP James Harden is playing out of his mind right now, and the Nuggets have a chance at a statement win.\n\n— New York at Golden State, Tuesday: The Knicks led the Warriors by 10 late in the third quarter in October, and got outscored 57-19 from there.\n\n— Indiana at Boston, Wednesday: Fourth game on a five-game trip for the Pacers, and the Celtics enter the week 14-6 in their last 20 games.\n\n— Oklahoma City at San Antonio, Thursday: The start of a home-and-home that concludes Saturday for these clubs hitting their stride.\n\n— L.A. Lakers at Utah, Friday: Could this be the game when LeBron James returns from the groin injury? The Lakers are leaking oil without him.\n\n— Memphis at Miami, Saturday: This will be Dwyane Wade's final time facing the Grizzlies, who have gone 3-10 in Miami against his Heat.\n\n— Milwaukee at Atlanta, Sunday: Former Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer returns to Atlanta, days after his Bucks rolled the Hawks 144-112.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
WASHINGTON – As lawmakers call for his immediate removal – and plan a second impeachment – President Donald Trump is likely to defend himself Tuesday with a speech in Alamo, Texas.\n\nNo, not that Alamo.\n\nThis Alamo is a small town on the Texas-Mexico border where the outgoing president plans to promote his immigration policy and defend his presidential legacy – a legacy tarnished by last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol by enraged Trump supporters who the president had urged to fight like hell earlier in the day.\n\nThe White House has billed Trump's visit as a chance to mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall – a promise made, promise kept – and his Administration's efforts to reform our broken immigration system.\n\nTrump is leaving behind a Washington, D.C., still gripped with fear over last week's insurrection, while the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic ramifications continue to batter the country. And there are concerns about even more violence, with the FBI on Monday warning of events planned at statehouses in all 50 states.\n\nJennifer Mercieca, an associate professor of communication at Texas A&M University, said the event serves as a chance for Trump to try to shape the narrative around his final days in office.\n\nTrump has lost his agenda-setting power, and he's trying to force positive news stories about his presidency by doing a 'highlights reel' of events and photo-ops, said Mercieca, who wrote the book Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump.\n\nDeprived of his account by Twitter, faced with defections from his staff and seeing his political ratings slide, Trump has been largely silent for several days as Democratic lawmakers prepare articles of impeachment.\n\nMore:Democrats officially introduce impeachment article, Republican forces vote on 25th Amendment resolution\n\nPolitics updates: Trump 'should not be in office,' Biden says; Trump job approval plummets\n\nSome lawmakers, including Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., as well as the Democratic leaders of both chambers of Congress, have called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office immediately, saying he is incapable of office after inciting last week's rioters. The Trump Cabinet is not likely to act on the suggestion.\n\nThe House impeached Trump in 2019 over a phone call in which he pressured the government of Ukraine to investigate Biden and members of his family. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump last year.\n\nDespite the calls for his ouster, Trump is likely to stay in office until the legal termination of his presidency at noon Jan. 20, a week from Wednesday. He is preparing a series of farewell gestures, including pardons, executive orders and perhaps more public comments like the ones planned in Texas on Tuesday.\n\nThis is Trump's first in-person speech since last Wednesday, when he addressed a rally near the White House to protest the election of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. The remarks inspired members of the crowd to march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol, where they broke in and threatened members of Congress counting Biden's electoral votes. Five people, including a police officer, were killed.\n\nYou'll never take back our country with weakness, Trump told his angry backers. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\n\nAs Pence and lawmakers fled to safe places and tear gas fogged the Capitol Rotunda, Trump took to social media to ask supporters to go home, though he expressed sympathy for the rioters' cause.\n\nTwitter banned Trump's account, arguing his lies and promotion of misinformation about the election could trigger more violence.\n\nPolitics updates: Pelosi plans to give Pence 24 hours to remove Trump by 25th Amendment before impeachment\n\n'It could have been much, much worse': Video, witness accounts reveal darker intent of some Capitol rioters\n\nAs a backdrop to Trump's trip to Alamo, Texas, the House Democratic majority plans an impeachment vote as soon as Wednesday.\n\nAbout 250 miles south of San Antonio, the town of Alamo is named for the 19th-century mission and fortress where a Texas army was defeated by Mexican troops in 1836. Texans used the defeat at the Alamo as a rallying cry during their fight for independence from Mexico.\n\nLocated in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, this portion of the U.S.-Mexico border continues to be the busiest corridor for human smuggling among the agency's nine sectors located along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Rio Grande Valley also remains a major focus of border wall construction, especially in areas that previously did not have any barriers.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection has not publicly disclosed how many miles of new wall have been built in areas of the border that previously did not have any barriers. However, at least the 17 miles that CBP said have been completed in the Rio Grande Valley sector are in areas without any barriers in the past.\n\nSome political analysts said they would prefer to see Trump give a resignation speech at this Alamo, but they expect more defiance from the soon-to-be-ex-president.\n\nTim Miller, a former Republican strategist who worked for 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush, said Trump is fundamentally incapable of speaking without making our precarious situation worse and potentially inciting more violence.\n\nHow much last week's violence undercuts Trump's political standing remains to be seen, said Janine Parry, professor of political science at the University of Arkansas. Pollsters for both parties are probably in field now trying to answer that question, she said.\n\nEarly returns are not great for Trump, according to a Quinnipiac Poll released Monday.\n\nA majority of Americans hold President Trump responsible for the chaos at the Capitol, and a slight majority believe that he should be removed from office, said Tim Malloy, polling analyst at Quinnipiac University.\n\nTrump's approval rating, Quinnipiac reported, dipped to 33%, down 11 percentage points from his mark last month.\n\nIn Texas, Trump is likely to appeal to his remaining base of supporters, many of whom hail from rural areas such as Alamo. It's no accident he selected this part of the country for remarks in this particular environment, Parry said.\n\nThat could include his selection of a town named Alamo. Even though the town is not the hallowed location of battle, the very word – Remember the Alamo! – remains a potent symbol for many Texans and Americans.\n\nInstead of walking back the incendiary effect of his most recent public rally, he appears – with this choice – to be upping the ante, Parry said. If Americans know anything about the Alamo, it's that it was a place to make a 'last stand' or even to go out in a 'blaze of glory.'
Johnny C. Taylor, Jr.\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr., a human-resources expert, is tackling your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.\n\nThe questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers below have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHave a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you'd like me to answer? Submit it here.\n\nQuestion: I want to date my boss, but she told me I'd have to quit my job because she's not quitting. Do I have to quit? If I do and it doesn't work out, isn't this discrimination? — Anonymous\n\nJohnny C. Taylor, Jr.: Think about whether entering into this romantic relationship is worth it before making a decision that could significantly affect your career and future. Clearly, your boss has thought about this.\n\nThere are alternatives to quitting, which I'll cover later. But first, I'll address your questions.\n\nWorkplace romances are incredibly common – and why wouldn't they be? We spend one-third of our day at work. It's a natural and easy way to meet people, and work offers a common interest.\n\nBut office dating also can cause distractions, conflicts, preferential treatment and other issues. In some cases, a failed relationship can lead to a sexual-harassment lawsuit.\n\nThese adverse effects are why employers want to be aware of workplace romances and, in some cases, manage them. Many employers have dating policies that set boundaries for romantic relationships in the workplace.\n\nMore:9 New Year's resolutions you should consider setting for your career in 2019: Ask HR\n\nMore:Can your employer require you to come into work in inclement weather? Ask HR\n\nMore:Ask HR: How do today's workplaces need to change to meet the future?\n\nIn most states, private companies have a right to impose policies that restrict employee dating. These policies commonly prohibit relationships between a supervisor and a direct report and between employees of a significant rank difference. This is partly to ensure that an employee isn't pressured into a relationship or doesn't stay in one to keep his or her job.\n\nPeer-to-peer relationships, in which the couple have different supervisors, are usually less of a concern to employers.\n\nSo, in your situation, do you need to quit? It depends on your employer's policy. Check with your HR department to see what rules apply in your situation.\n\nIn supervisor-subordinate relationships like the one you are considering, one person might have to leave the organization. But who leaves is a decision made between the people in the relationship.\n\nHowever, there are alternatives to quitting. Some companies will help an employee transfer to another department or location or will assign an employee to a different supervisor.\n\nBut if you're in a position in which one of you must leave but neither of you wants to, then you may have to quit your relationship – not your job.\n\nAs for your question about discrimination, having a romance policy that requires one partner to leave the company is not a discriminatory practice on your employer's part. However, unfair and inconsistent application of a policy could be.\n\nIf you decide to resign on your own to pursue a relationship with your boss and it doesn't work out, it's unlikely to be perceived as a form of workplace discrimination. But if your boss fires you or pressures you to quit because she wants to have a relationship with you, that could be harassment.\n\nQuestion: My boss is a transgender woman, but I knew her when she was a he. I'm not referring to him as her. Can I be fired for this? — Anonymous\n\nJohnny C. Taylor, Jr.: The short answer is yes, you can be fired.\n\nMany state and local laws prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or expression. But even if you are in a location where no such law exists, employees are at-will in most states and, therefore, can generally be fired for any reason that is not specifically illegal (based on their race, gender or age, for example), including for disrespectful conduct.\n\nAs a matter of professionalism, I recommend you make every attempt to call your supervisor by the pronoun she prefers.\n\nBut if you just can't get yourself to use a pronoun that conforms to your boss' identity, consider a practical approach – use her first name when addressing or referring to her.\n\nRespect is a two-way street. Just as you deserve and expect it, so does your boss. Show her respect, and you won't be putting your job at risk.
Associated Press\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The New York Jets' season began sputtering in Week 3 at Kansas City.\n\nThat's when Ryan Fitzpatrick threw six interceptions in an ugly loss, and Brandon Marshall and Sheldon Richardson began feuding in what was the first sign of locker room strife.\n\nThrow in injuries to key players in subsequent weeks, stars underachieving, tardiness issues and blowout defeats and it all snowballed into a 5-11 record.\n\nWe made a lot of mistakes: coaches, players, plays, all of the above, coach Todd Bowles said. We fought hard, but we didn't fight smart. We have to do a better job coaching it better, and they have to do a better job playing — accountability for everyone.\n\nBowles will be back for a third season , as will general manager Mike Maccagnan, as they try to fix the problems. And there sure are plenty.\n\nThis could be an offseason of wholesale changes on the roster, as well as the coaching staff. Offensive coordinator Chan Gailey retired two days after the season ended, and the team announced that quarterbacks coach Kevin Patullo, running backs coach Marcel Shipp, defensive line coach Pepper Johnson, outside linebackers coach Mark Collins and defensive backs coach Joe Danna will not be back.\n\nBowles, 15-17 in his two seasons in New York, also knows he needs to improve in a hurry.\n\nI have a whole laundry list that I need to get better at, he acknowledged.\n\nBowles dismissed the notion locker room chemistry was the major problem for the Jets, calling it a bad excuse. But several players pointed to the negative vibes felt from early in the season, with cornerback Darrelle Revis saying a dark cloud hovered over the team.\n\nMarshall tried to step up as a vocal leader, but his delivery rubbed some the wrong way, and created some tension. Wide receiver Quincy Enunwa, who had a breakout season with 58 catches, said the locker room issues really hindered our play.\n\nI think it can be fixed, he added. We know what we need to do. It's going to be a lot of changes, and I think it's going to be for the better.\n\nHere are some of the issues Bowles and the Jets face as they enter an offseason of uncertainty:\n\nQB OR NO QB?: It all starts at quarterback, and New York has no clear answer on who'll be under center.\n\nFitzpatrick and Geno Smith are scheduled to be free agents and likely won't be back. Bryce Petty is facing surgery on his non-throwing shoulder. Christian Hackenberg was a second-round pick , but never played a snap and he's unlikely to be the starter in 2017.\n\nI haven't even started looking for a franchise quarterback yet, Bowles said.\n\nWell, he might want to have Maccagnan get on that, via free agency or trade — or with the No. 6 overall pick in the draft. Otherwise, they both could be looking for new jobs at this time next year.\n\nREVIS ISLAND RELOCATED: The Jets face an interesting dilemma with Revis, who was a shell of his shutdown self at cornerback.\n\nHe blamed injuries and age for the decline , but the fact it happened so quickly was alarming. Revis, 31, is willing to move to safety; he and Bowles have had preliminary discussions about it.\n\nThis offseason, there will be a lot of thinking what my future is and what I can do to best help the team win games, Revis said. If that means changing my position to help the team win games, that's fine.\n\nBut Revis is due to make $15 million next season, and could be a salary-cap casualty if the team asks him to take a pay cut and he doesn't accept.\n\nBIG-NAME VETS: Revis isn't the only one facing an uncertain future with the Jets.\n\nMarshall is due $7.5 million next season, a total New York would save in its entirety by cutting him. The 32-year-old wide receiver said he plans to play until he's 38 or 39 , and indicated he'd be willing to take a pay cut.\n\nOther big names who could be shown the door: center Nick Mangold (he has a $9.075 million cap hit), left tackle Ryan Clady ($10.5 million), linebacker David Harris ($6.5 million), right tackle Breno Giacomini ($5.125 million) and cornerback Buster Skrine ($8.5 million cap hit).\n\nRichardson, entering the final year of his rookie deal, could also be trade bait, but could be tough to move because of his off-field issues. He has been suspended twice — four games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy, and one for a high-speed car incident in Missouri in 2015 — and was benched for a quarter this season along with Muhammad Wilkerson for being late to a team meeting. His beef with Marshall also won't help.\n\nO-LINE SHUFFLE: New York needs to find stability on the offensive line, with only left guard James Carpenter starting every game .\n\nWesley Johnson was solid as a fill-in for Mangold, and could be brought back as a restricted free agent. Right guard Brian Winters is an unrestricted free agent, as is Ben Ijalana, who started at both right and left tackle. Rookie right tackle Brandon Shell, a fifth-rounder, was impressive while starting the final three games.\n\nPASS RUSH: The Jets finished with just 27 sacks, ranking them 29th in the league.\n\nWilkerson dropped from a career-high 12 to 4 ½ while playing most of the season on a sore ankle. Leonard Williams was a big bright spot , though, leading New York with seven sacks and establishing himself as a playmaker in his second season.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
NEW YORK – The holiday performances always gave it away.\n\nEvery December, as students at Public School 9 in Brooklyn stood to sing holiday songs while their parents looked on, one class would be made up of a lot of white students, followed by another class of almost all black students.\n\nFrom the outside, the racial divide might seem curious as PS 9 is one of the most diverse elementary schools in Brooklyn: Out of about 940 students, 40% are black, 31% are white, 17% are Hispanic and 9% are Asian. But inside, many students spend their days learning in separate groups. The gifted and talented classes are attended by mostly white and Asian kids; the general education classes, mostly black students.\n\nIt wasn't obvious until you sat in the audience and watched everyone, said Afiya Lahens, a black parent whose daughter is in the general education track.\n\nThen something remarkable happened. After years of discussion and community meetings, a mixed-race committee of parents and teachers voted to phase out the gifted and talented track for future students at PS 9, specifically to decrease racial and economic segregation.\n\nNew York City's education department agreed to follow the decision: Starting this fall, there will be no gifted track for the school's incoming kindergartners. Instead, PS 9 will offer enrichment opportunities to more students based on their individual strengths and interests.\n\nThe move put PS 9 at the forefront of controversy surrounding racial integration in the nation's largest school system – and one of its most segregated. It's raised questions about whether school systems can have both excellence and equity and whether integration efforts should come from parents or official intervention.\n\nThe controversies have been particularly acute in Brooklyn, where white and affluent families populate neighborhoods historically inhabited by black and Latino residents. Gentrification has displaced people of color by driving up rents and intensified racial stratification in classrooms.\n\nSegregation:It's getting worse in schools, GAO says\n\nPhasing out gifted and talented programs at PS 9 will test a controversial recommendation from a school diversity panel appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio to end such programs at all elementary schools in the city. The panel's rationale: Gifted programs are biased and serve to segregate children along lines of race and class, in large part because admission to most programs is based on a screening exam parents can register their children to take, starting at age 4.\n\nWealthy New York families often spend thousands of dollars on test prep for their preschoolers because the number of gifted and talented seats is limited. In a system of about 1.1 million children, about 16,000 seats are available in city-run elementary schools. As a result, gifted programs tend to isolate affluent children, and the power and resources that follow them can result in fewer resources for the general population.\n\nAcross the country, schools are locked in intense debates about what to do about gifted and talented programs, largely because of racial disparities. Some districts have stopped tracking gifted students. Others move to diversify gifted programs by ensuring more disadvantaged students have a chance to be tested.\n\nIn New York City, radically overhauling gifted and talented programs has long been a political third rail, largely because the programs are popular with affluent parents whose children are enrolled. That's the demographic New York sought to court in the 1970s and '80s with gifted programs in the first place, lest those families, often with more involved parents and higher incomes for tax purposes, move to the suburbs in search of better schools, education researchers said.\n\nWe got a lot of pushback on the overhaul, said PS 9 parent Kirsten Cole, who is white. I feel naive in saying this: It was more than I expected.\n\nNew York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza has championed school integration since de Blasio appointed him in 2018. That energized advocates for diversity, but many grow impatient that neither leader has adopted the most radical recommendations to help all schools to reflect the diversity of the city. The chancellor and the mayor declined to phase out all gifted and talented programs or to prohibit schools from using achievement measures to screen children for admission.\n\nDepartment of Education officials indicate they're more interested in supporting efforts that bubble up from individual communities. A spokeswoman told USA TODAY integration initiatives are not a one-size-fits-all model.\n\nThe city has been under pressure to do something since a major report in 2014 spelled out how New York schools had become the most racially segregated in the country.\n\nDe Blasio floated scrapping admissions tests to the most elite high schools – often seen as the destination for gifted and talented students – where black and Hispanic students are underrepresented. That idea faced major opposition, especially from some Asian lawmakers and certain alumni. It's unlikely to go forward because it would require action from the state Legislature.\n\nThen there's the troubling fact that the move to eliminate gifted programs is opposed by some black and Latino parents, whose kids it's supposed to help. Some of those parents see elementary school gifted programs, as well as elite high schools, as the only way for their children to work hard and get ahead.\n\nThe whole thing is a red herring, said Ayanna Behin, a Brooklyn parent and president of the parent advisory group in the district that includes PS 9. Behin is black, and her children attend a different Brooklyn school that pursued another path to maintain integration: It changed its admissions policies to set aside more seats for low-income students.\n\nStudents in the gifted and talented program make up a tiny percentage of the system, and yet talk about eliminating that program generates a huge amount of controversy, Behin said. What we really need to be focusing on is fixing the system for everybody.\n\nGifted programs: Roots in segregation, debatable benefits\n\nSome say fixing the system for everyone must start with how children are classified and expected to learn, which goes to the heart of the debate around gifted education.\n\nIn New York City, children who score in the top tier of the gifted and talented exam can compete for slots at citywide gifted schools and programs at traditional elementary schools.\n\nIn 2019, more than 32,000 students in kindergarten through third grade took the exam, and almost 8,000 scored high enough to qualify for a gifted program. That doesn't guarantee them a seat. Schools offer the limited number of seats in order of students' scores on the exam.\n\nThe odds are low for black and Latino students. They make up close to 70% of the district's enrollment, but far fewer of them take the gifted test. Of all kindergartners in 2017-18 who passed the test and received an offer for gifted and talented, just 10% were Latino and 8% were black.\n\nIn contrast, 17% of New York kindergartners are white, but they made up 39% of kindergartners who received 2017-18 offers for gifted and talented seats. Eighteen percent of kindergartners are Asian, but they made up 42% of the gifted seats.\n\nThose divides are not due to cognitive differences between races, but a function of access, resources and systemic bias against blacks and Latinos, education experts said.\n\nStudies show nonblack teachers are less likely to recommend black students for gifted and talented programs. Another study showed that when parents and teachers nominated children, they missed many qualified students. When the large urban district in that study, Broward County Public Schools in Florida, switched to screening all children in second grade, more low-income and minority students were placed in gifted programs.\n\nBecause there's no federal standard for identifying giftedness, states and districts come up with their own definitions – which is one reason researchers don't have a clear answer on the benefits of gifted education.\n\nSome say highly talented children can reach their full potential only if they're educated alongside other high-achieving students. Some studies show pulling gifted kids out of regular classes to work together for part of the day increased the children's achievement, critical thinking and creativity.\n\nIt's good for kids to be with their intellectual peers, said David Lubinski, a psychology professor at Vanderbilt University and longtime expert on gifted education.\n\nOther academics say the stratification caused by ambiguously defined talent produces damaging levels of segregation. When students of varying abilities work together, lower-performing students do better, research shows, without slowing the progress of average and high-achieving students.\n\nIf you think that public schools should be leveling the playing field for all kids, then identifying children and ranking their potential based on who signed them up to take a test tends to reinforce the inequalities we see in society, said Allison Roda, an assistant professor of education at Molloy College in New York, who wrote a book about gifted education and segregation in New York City.\n\nThe first major studies of gifted kids in America started in the 1920s and '30s when urban centers experienced an influx of immigrants, Roda said. Schools intentionally created different tracks to separate students by race, class and linguistic ability, she said.\n\nIn 1957, after the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite, the United States ramped up math and science programs for talented students who could help the country compete in the space race. When schools navigated the civil rights movement in the '60s and '70s, gifted education remained a path where mostly white and wealthy students could be educated separately from their peers of color, Roda said.\n\nFor her book, Roda interviewed New York parents whose children tested into gifted programs.\n\nThey admit that the admissions system is flawed, but they still kind of work it to their advantage, she said.\n\n'The same things white people want for their children'\n\nOn a Saturday morning in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a historically black but rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in central Brooklyn, children climbed to the third floor of a Baptist church. They took their seats, snack bags in hand, winter coats still on, waiting for studies in English and mathematics that would last for the next four hours.\n\nThe students, all of whom were black, attend CAS Prep, a tutoring and test-prep business run by educator Sam Adewumi. He started the program expecting that black students could better compete on the high-stakes exam for elite high school admissions – which is separate from the gifted and talented exam for elementary schools – if they had access to the same tutoring wealthy families pursue.\n\nHe charges parents about $250 for a six-week session of Saturday classes. By comparison, the test-prep company Kaplan charges at least $1,000 for eight tutoring sessions for the Specialized High School Admissions Test.\n\nCAS Prep tutors about 150 students in first to eighth grades. Adewumi said many students are so far behind, they don't have a realistic shot at passing the exam. After the first year or two of the business, Adewumi said, three students passed and got into elite high schools. These days, about 10 to 12 CAS Prep students each year qualify for top schools.\n\nIt's well-documented that few black students have a shot at those seats. New York City made headlines last spring after reports showed only seven slots at the highly competitive Stuyvesant High School went to black students. That was out of 895 seats in the freshman class.\n\nAdewumi – and many of his clients – are in favor of the high school admissions test, along with gifted programs at the elementary level, because they offer black students a shot at the elite education that can propel them into successful careers, he said.\n\nDesiree Griffith, a black mother whose 13-year-old daughter attends CAS Prep, agreed. Her daughter took the high school exam in October but won't find out her score until March.\n\nThe minority children who are smart need something to challenge them, Griffith said as her daughter worked through algebra problems with a cluster of four students.\n\nGriffith said her daughter took the gifted and talented test in elementary school but didn't qualify. She attends a charter school in Bedford-Stuyvesant, but she's not challenged enough, Griffith said. Griffith said the best way to integrate schools is to make sure students have the same opportunities in all buildings. She'd like to see a well-funded gifted and talented program in every school.\n\nThe same things white parents want for their children is what we want for our children as well, she said.\n\nAround the country:63 years after landmark Brown v. Board case, segregated classrooms persist\n\nMore New York City schools used to have gifted and talented tracks, but over the years, they were underfunded and/or were eliminated because of low enrollment, said Brooklyn Councilman Robert Cornegy, who represents historically black neighborhoods in Brooklyn. He said he'd rather see the Department of Education expand gifted tracks at all schools, rather than eliminate them.\n\nI had one tool within that broken system to try to level the playing field, Cornegy said. And now you're trying to remove it.\n\nIn Brooklyn, steps toward integration spark pushback\n\nA number of grassroots efforts in New York attracted attention for tackling integration. One of the most high-profile last year: a Brooklyn district where all the middle schools agreed to eliminate selective admissions criteria for incoming students. Students rank their schools, and an algorithm matches them to buildings while offering preference for children who are low-income, learning English or homeless. The move helped to better integrate eight of the district's 11 middle schools. A similar admissions policy experiment took place in a Manhattan district.\n\nThe department said about 100 schools across the city – there are about 1,800 in all – individually try to diversify their admissions. Five districtsreceived $200,000 grantsto develop community-driven diversity processes.\n\nParents who push for major change often find themselves in bruising battles.\n\nSuch as the one at PS 9 in Brooklyn.\n\nThe elementary school hosted at least four different tracks for children: gifted and talented, general education, a dual-language Spanish-English track and a track for traditionally developing students to learn alongside students with special needs. Over the years, it became clear the gifted and talented track had become the whitest, said Cole, the parent who co-chaired the school's Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee.\n\nWe could see pretty clearly that the existence of the G&T track was producing segregation in our school, Cole said.\n\nTeachers at PS 9, Cole said, told the committee gifted classes covered most of the same content as the general education classes, just a little faster. Teachers talked about the unequal distribution of resources to classrooms that seemed to result from the tracking.\n\nThere was a small number of vocal critics, including white and Asian parents. After multiple public roundtable sessions, a competing proposal emerged to keep and diversify gifted and talented at PS 9.\n\nThe diversity committee ultimately decided to phase out the track, though that action had to pass through several levels of approval.\n\nSupporters of gifted and talented programs said there are ways to keep them and make them more inclusive. The co-founders of TestingMom.com, an online preschool test-prep company, said many black and Latino families don't know the gifted and talented test is an option for them. They said the city should administer the gifted exam to all children in its pre-kindergarten programs, unless parents opt out.\n\nWhy would you get rid of the best educational program the city could offer? said Karen Quinn, who founded the company with Michael McCurdy, who runs a blog about gifted and talented programs in New York.\n\nI wish more than 1% of kids could get in, Quinn said. I wish 5% of kids could get in.\n\nA shift toward enrichment for all, without labels\n\nPS 9 students in gifted classes will continue through graduation. Subsequent classes will experience schoolwide enrichment, in which teachers will offer individual students challenging material based on their interests or talents.\n\nSchools in Washington, D.C., have taken a similar approach. The district no longer labels students gifted and talented. Instead, parents can choose from among 13 elementary and middle schools that host in-school enrichment for students who show strengths in specific areas, from science to photography to social action. The schools are not magnets or test-in programs, but it's easier for children to get seats if they live within a school's boundary. A full-time teacher or committee at the schools coordinate the extra activities.\n\nStudies show the model can encourage more independent investigations, more self-selected work and more creative presentations from students. Some studies showed it could also lead to higher scores in reading fluency and comprehension.\n\nWith schoolwide enrichment, Ayani Wallace, 9, a student in the general education track at PS 9, might have been given more opportunities in school to develop her love of fashion and design. To nurture it, her mother took her to a class on how to write a business plan. Then they both entered a business-pitching competition for their idea: an online athleisure clothing company for adolescent girls.\n\nAyani and her mom won $1,000 in seed money, and they're developing relationships with manufacturers and raising money to produce a first round of clothes.\n\nRecently, Ayani started noticing differences between classes at her school – just like her mother, Afiya Lahens, had during those annual holiday performances. She asked why she couldn't be in gifted and talented classes.\n\nLahens had taken her daughter to the exam. Her most vivid memory was 4-year-old Ayani returning distraught because she wasn't allowed to play with toys during the test.\n\nLahens decided the truth was the best response.\n\nWell, she told her daughter, you have to pass a test.\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

USA TODAY\n\nPresident Donald Trump will take his case for a border wall directly to the American people in a presidential address Tuesday night, as the government shutdown continues.\n\nShould you even watch Trump's address?\n\nBy Bill Goodykoontz\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants to address the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday night to talk about immigration — specifically his desire to build a wall — and, presumably, the shutdown of the federal government.\n\nBroadcast networks are giving the president a slot in prime time to make his case. Cable news outlets will, too. Pundits, armchair and otherwise, have taken to social media to debate whether the networks should have granted Trump the time.\n\nJust what we need, division concerning division.\n\nShould they have? I think, probably, yes.\n\nAlthough that comes with a major caveat: It is essential that all the networks fact-check Trump in real time, as he's speaking. They have the technology, and they need to use it.\n\nTalker:'Dreamers' might be the key to ending the government shutdown\n\nSign-up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nThere's no requirement that networks air this or any other presidential address. And prime time is expensive real estate. But, typically, if it's something of national importance, they will air a presidential address.\n\nThough not always. They didn't broadcast President Barack Obama's immigration speech in 2014, so there's precedent for not doing so.\n\nThe argument for not airing the speech runs something like this: Trump has repeatedly lied about immigration, about the shutdown, about the causes and effects. Plus, he has a history of trashing the news media. So why give him free air time to keep it up, particularly when you can't challenge misstatements and lies in real time? Why let him mislead even more people on a bigger stage?\n\nThe argument for airing it seems simpler: He's the president. But it's really more complex than that. Again, there's no guarantee of free air time — the government doesn't run the networks. But this president has been different from the start. The regular rules don't apply, no matter what the issue.\n\nBut even if you believe Trump won't be truthful or forthcoming, you can argue that it's important to get him on the record, in front of the nation, taking about immigration. Then you have the facts of what he said (although for his supporters, that hasn't mattered so far).\n\nPlus, there's a news hook to this address that others have lacked: the shutdown. There are no signs of an agreement any time soon, and it's affecting hundreds of thousands of federal employees. People want answers, and they want responsibility. An address aired on broadcast networks could — could — help provide that.\n\nOf course, there are no guarantees. But if Trump does lie, the networks must point it out AS IT HAPPENS. At this point, it's hard to imagine a win-win situation with any of this, but that might be the best option, at least.\n\nBill Goodykoontz is a film critic and media columnist at The Arizona Republic, where this column first appeared. You can follow him on Twitter: @goodyk.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nJonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: Going public — the strategy of trying to win support from the people at large, in the hopes that they'll pressure their representatives to follow the president — mostly didn't work for Ronald Reagan, didn't work for Bill Clinton, and didn't work for Barack Obama. It's even less likely to work for President Donald Trump, who is less popular now than those presidents were for most of their time in office, and who is trying to sell a policy that consistently polls badly. ... Overall, speeches of this kind — addresses intended to sway public opinion about an already announced policy — just aren't very important, even though the context here, the government shutdown and immigration policy, certainly is.\n\nDavid Leonhardt, The New York Times: I'll confess to being torn about the major television networks' decision to air President Trump's speech Tuesday night on the border wall. On the one hand, the networks said no to President Obama when he asked for air time to give a speech on immigration in 2014. They said it was too political to deserve a free prime-time spot — and Trump's speech is clearly political, as well. But if they had said no to Trump, the decision would have dominated the political conversation for at least a couple of days. ... I do hope the networks fact-check Trump as soon as the speech is over. It's likely to be filled with his usual array of false claims.\n\nSally Kohn, USA TODAY: Trump will speak to the American people about his demands for a southern border wall, which have led him to shut down the government. He will, undoubtedly, gin up fear about a 'crisis' mounting at the U.S.-Mexico border. ... Americans don't support Trump's wall because they know the truth — that we have a tough immigration and border enforcement system already working, and way bigger problems to focus on fixing in our nation.\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nUnfortunately, President Donald Trump will be preaching to the choir with his address. The Trump haters will still hate Trump after the speech. Immediately following the speech, MSNBC and CNN will quickly take to the air and refute everything that Trump said, and who do you think the liberals will believe?\n\n— Robert Johnson\n\nDemocrats have voted for border security in the past. They're just opposed to Trump and his wall. Once again, Democrats prioritize liberal politics over the safety of American citizens. To Democrats, U.S. citizens are acceptable collateral damage now.\n\n— Mira Dean\n\nFake news are desperate to stop anything that counters their globalist agenda. Trump doesn't attack the free press; he attacks fake news.\n\n— Cara Claudel\n\nStop the call to censor our president! Let people watch his address and decide what to believe.\n\n— Angela Harrell Montgomery\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.
Kristen Jordan Shamus\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike are stressed out when they think about the future of America and the political climate, according to a new poll released Wednesday.\n\nIt's the first time since the American Psychological Association started the annual Stress in America: Coping with Change survey 10 years ago that this level of anxiety about the political climate and the country's future has been reported, said Lynn Bufka, associate executive director for practice, research and policy at the APA.\n\nPeople are saying they're more stressed now than they have been in quite some time, said Bufka. We don't necessarily know all the whys, but we do know what some of the sources of stress are.\n\nIn addition to the economy, work and money stress, which annually are in the top three stressors, 57% of Americans polled in January said that the political climate is a very significant or somewhat significant source of stress, according to the online Harris Poll survey in early January. Nearly half of Americans polled — 49% — said the same about the outcome of the election.\n\nU.S. labeled a 'flawed democracy,' but don't blame Trump\n\nDemocrats were more likely than Republicans — 72% vs. 26% — to say the outcome of the election is a significant source of stress; 59% Republicans polled said the future of the nation was a significant source of stress for them, compared with 76% of Democrats.\n\nNone of that comes as a surprise to Dr. Ron Samarian, who is the chief of the department of psychiatry at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. At least once a day, a patient comes to him with anxiety related to politics.\n\nSome of the things we're seeing are really unprecedented, he said. The fear of uncertainly is a constant, whether it's political or otherwise. We seem to have an unprecedented level of political uncertainty, which can feed into the fear of disunity of the country, fragmentation of relationships. For example, neighbors that don't agree with us, friends, family, and even of course the safety of our loved ones and the security of our finances.\n\nCertainly in our lifetimes, it's never been this distorted. ... It hits a lot of different areas all going to the same place, which is the uncertainty and the lack of control or the feeling that we don't have as much control.\n\nFranklin Dohanyos, a 58-year-old conservative from Royal Oak, said he voted for President Trump and had high hopes for his presidency. But three weeks into the Trump administration, Dohanyos is feeling unsettled, especially with the resignation this week of Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, amid allegations he lied about interacting with a Russian ambassador.\n\nHis White House staff is like a revolving door, said Dohanyos, who owns his own public relations firm. His business practices are questionable. He seems to close a big deal and then this falls through or that falls through. Some of his businesses do well, and others completely fail. Look at his golf course in Scotland, or Trump University.\n\nI'm not regretting my vote, but I am starting to question it. ... I am concerned about our country's future. But I would have been just as concerned as if Hillary (Clinton) had gotten in. This is an unexpected feeling. All we can do is hope and pray. I'm a praying guy.\n\nWendy Day, a 44-year-old political consultant from Howell who was the state director for the Ted Cruz campaign for president, said she's trying to take a break from the 24-hour news cycle, and doesn't feel as much of the anxiety that many others have expressed since the presidential election.\n\nTop 5 least stressed cities in America\n\nPeople are very worried because they don't know what to believe, said Day, who helped found the Tea Party in Michigan. They're trying to comprehend complex issues that they haven't had to watch on a play-by-play basis before, like this whole situation with Russia. We haven't had to try to guess on a play-by-play basis before and feeling like we're purposely being manipulated throughout the process it's very stressful.\n\nThere used to be a thing called objective truth, and now it's very hard to figure out what that is.\n\nFor many who are plugged in, Bufka said, the saturation of the news — on television, on social media, and in our day-to-day conversations — can be overwhelming.\n\nAmong those who use social media, the group that uses it regularly as opposed to those who don't use it at all, were even more likely to report these sources of stress, Bufka said. We do think that there's the exposure to not only what's being debated in terms of our government and the political direction, but potentially how it's being debated and some of the conflict and debate and dissension that plays out more in social media than in say face-to-face or one-on-one conversations. We have to wonder how that's playing into stress, too.\n\nWere Americans more stressed in 2016?\n\nThere's a lot of uncertainty about things that once were taken for granted, Bufka said.\n\nThere's a lot going on, she said. There's a level of work involved in trying to sift through all the content, but also, it's very complex. … For all of us, to some extent, we've just accepted that government happens. It continues. It goes on. We trust that it will. We might not always like the decisions, but there will be trash pickup, we will have schools, and there will be a federal budget and VA hospitals will operate. Well, now that is less true.\n\nNow, things seem to be less sure. What will really happen? What decisions are being made? Who's making those decisions? Will things that have been happening for a long time, are those things about to change? It seems like there's a lot more that's up in the air. It's a lot more for people to digest unless they think about it.\n\nAnxiety and stress, Bufka said, can manifest in a host of physical symptoms.\n\nThe symptoms people are telling us they're feeling now are headaches, stomach aches, feeling nervous, feeling anxious, sleep difficulties, potentially some irritability, she said. These are ways people physically and emotionally manifest stress. These are exactly what people are telling us. While any of these could be relatively minor, if you're experiencing them over time, they're going to lead to some negative effects on daily life. … These things can add up over time and have a long-term impact on someone's health.\n\nRegain control over the stress in your life\n\nTo relieve that stress, people can set limits on social media and news consumption so they can stay informed without getting totally overwhelmed, Bufka said. She also recommends carving time out of your schedule to do things you enjoy, like a hobby, exercise, or time with friends and family.\n\nAs a euchre player, cards are always something we talk about in my household as a way to relax, Bufka said.\n\nThe idea that two-thirds of the nation are worried about the future of the country seems off-base to Linda Thielfoldt, 56, of Troy. She's a self-described fiscal conservative, and says even among her more liberal friends, there doesn't seem to be a lot of angst.\n\nI would say the study is not well-founded, she said. I don't know who they asked. I have a lot of friends, and I'm not sensing it. Do I see stress in them at this point, three weeks into his presidency? Absolutely not.\n\nI think we've got bigger problems. You want to know something that stresses me about where the country is? $20 trillion dollars in debt. Now that stresses me out.\n\nThiefoldt said she has great hope for the country, and more confidence in the direction the nation is headed than she's had in 12 years.\n\nI think the vast majority of Americans — and that was never made more clear than on election night — sent a resounding a message not to Trump, but to politicians in general, that you work for us, and you have forgotten that.\n\nFollow Kristen Jordan Shamus on Twitter: @kristenshamus.

Associated Press\n\nNEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — An Army veteran who says someone left a scalpel inside him after surgery is suing a veterans affairs hospital.\n\nBridgeport resident Glenford Turner says the scalpel was discovered years later after he suffered from long-term abdominal pain. He sued the VA in U.S. District Court last week, seeking unspecified compensatory damages.\n\nMore:Illegal VA policy allows hiring since 2002 of medical workers with revoked licenses\n\nCourt papers say Turner had surgery at the VA hospital in West Haven in 2013. Nearly four years later, he went back to the VA with dizziness and severe abdominal pain. An X-Ray showed there was a scalpel inside his body.\n\nTurner had to undergo surgery to remove the scalpel. His lawyer, Joel Faxon, said doctors confirmed it was the same one. Faxon called it an incomprehensible level of incompetence.\n\nThe VA said Monday it doesn't typically comment on pending litigation.\n\nU.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said he was appalled and stunned by the egregious medical malpractice case.\n\nI have asked for a detailed explanation from VA of this deeply troubling report, he said in a statement. I am demanding also full accountability so this kind of horrific negligence never happens again.
WASHINGTON – IRS tax examiner Lori McLaurin is used to hearing from people in a financial bind who are looking for help.\n\nBut the single mother now finds herself among their ranks thanks to the partial government shutdown that's left her furloughed and without a paycheck.\n\nI hear a lot of stories, McLaurin said, at one point choking back tears. I don't know how they got into their situation. But this one right here, it wasn't my doing.\n\nFor McLaurin and thousands of other federal employees across the country, Friday is the day when the partial federal government shutdown officially hits their pocketbooks.\n\nIt was supposed to be payday. But paychecks are on hold for some 800,000 federal employees forced to go on unpaid leave or work without pay since Dec. 22 because of the government shutdown.\n\nIt's the first time during the 21-day shutdown – which on Saturday will become the longest in U.S. history – that workers will have missed a paycheck. Though the standoff is nearing its fourth week, most federal employees were paid on Dec. 28 for the final two-week pay period of 2018.\n\nNow, with no paycheck coming in the foreseeable future, many are wondering how they will make ends meet.\n\nWhen they say, 'one paycheck away from homeless,' I'm not there, but I'm real close. And it's disturbing, said McLaurin, a 28-year IRS veteran who works out of the agency's Philadelphia office.\n\nThe uncertainty caused by the shutdown has left many workers anxious, confused and frustrated, said Ryan Baugh, a furloughed statistician in the Office of Immigration Statistics in the Department of Homeland Security and a steward for the American Federation of Government Employees union.\n\nWe just don't know when it will be over, so we don't know how to plan, Baugh said. Should we cut back? Should we start looking for other jobs? Should we apply for unemployment?\n\nSteve Reaves, a furloughed fire safety official for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said his wife works as a sales manager in the private sector and started taking on extra hours in early December so they could pay their mortgage in the event of a shutdown.\n\nShe didn't get to spend as much time with the family during the holidays, said Reaves, who lives in Arlington, Texas, and is president of AFGE Local 4060.\n\nBecause FEMA is part of the Department of Homeland Security, furloughed employees can't get moonlighting jobs without approval from their supervisors, Reaves said.\n\nThe problem is the managers have been furloughed, he said. It's like a catch-22. You can't go out and get a new job to make ends meet.\n\nMcLaurin, too, is worried about making the next mortgage payment on the house she shares with her college-aged daughter.\n\nOn Thursday, she boarded a bus with nearly 100 employees out of the Philadelphia IRS office and traveled to Washington to rally near the White House with other displaced federal workers represented by the National Treasury Employees Union.\n\nOn the same bus was Horatio Fenton, a contact representative for the IRS who lives in Lumberton, N.J. After decades of paying his bills on time, Fenton is worried about making his utility and mortgage payments as well. Soon he'll be filing for unemployment for the first time since he joined the federal government 25 years ago.\n\nWe've had furloughs before, but I've never had to file for unemployment because it was always assumed it would be short term and you'd be back to work, Fenton said. But this one's a little different. Both sides are dug in, and we're paying the cost for that. I'm not sure if there's an end to this.\n\nIn Washington, Democrats and Republicans profess empathy with the impacted workers.\n\nThese families, many of them veterans, are not able to meet their mortgage payment, their rent payment, their car payment, harming their own credit ratings, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., placing the blame on Trump for triggering the shutdown with his demand for funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump's insistence on $5.7 billion in border wall funding has been the main sticking point in a budget standoff that led to the government shutdown.\n\nThe president doesn't appreciate the role of public policy in the lives of the American people, Pelosi said.\n\nFor his part, Trump said earlier this week that he can relate to the pain of federal workers who can't pay their bills. But, I'm sure that people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments, he said. They always do.\n\nThe billionaire president's words ring hollow to McLaurin and other federal employees.\n\nHe says a lot of things, but he doesn't have real accountability for what he says, she said. How can you relate when you've been born with so much?\n\nFBI agents added their voices to the thousands of federal employees Thursday calling for an end to the government shutdown, asserting that the bureau's diminished resources put national security and investigative operations at risk.\n\nAn estimated 5,000 of the bureau's 35,000 agents, analysts, lawyers and other personnel have been furloughed, limiting support for some surveillance and laboratory operations, said Thomas O'Connor, president of the FBI Agents Association.\n\nWith the agency and the rest of the federal government facing the prospect of missing a paycheck Friday, O'Connor said the burden could weigh most heavily on agents who are required to meet their financial obligations to maintain security clearances necessary for their work.\n\nFinancial security is national security, O'Connor told reporters, adding that the ongoing shutdown was entering uncharted territory as the longest suspension of government operations in history.\n\nIn a petition to lawmakers and other government leaders, the agents' group said the personal financial disruption could even disqualify agents from continuing to serve in some cases because of the potential damage to their clearance status.\n\nFEMA workers also are freaked out that their security clearances could be in jeopardy, Reaves said.\n\nThey are afraid that because they are not able to pay their bills in a timely manner, it will affect their (security) clearance investigation, he said. And if it affects their clearance investigation and they can't get a clearance, they lose their jobs. I can't appeal that. I can't take that to court.\n\nOther employees who continue to work without pay include thousands of air-traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration and tens of thousands of checkpoint screeners at the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nEven before the shutdown, the number of air-controllers had dropped from a peak of 11,753 in 2012 to 10,483 in September 2018, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a union representing the workers.\n\nOvertime in the form of six-day weeks and 10-hour days is common at many of the nation's busiest and most short-staffed facilities, including radar facilities in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas, said Paul Rinaldi, an air-traffic controller who is president of the union.\n\nAnd none of the controllers forced to work during this shutdown will see pay for their hard work to keep travelers safe until the shutdown ends, Rinaldi said. This shutdown must end now.\n\nTwo unions representing federal workers – AFGE and the National Treasury Employees Union – have filed suit, arguing that the government is violating federal law by forcing some employees to work without pay during the shutdown.\n\nThe affected workers could eventually get back pay once the shutdown is over, but that's not guaranteed since it would require an act of Congress.\n\nPeople feel like they are caught between a rock and a hard place, Baugh said, adding that many believe they are being used as leverage in a political battle that has nothing to do with their jobs.\n\nThere's a real sense of disbelief, he said. People never thought this would go on this long.\n\nMore:Exclusive: Pentagon preparing options to build border wall as Trump weighs emergency declaration\n\nMore:Government shutdown: Pelosi says Trump prefers 'soap opera' over serious negotiations\n\nMore:'I live paycheck to paycheck': Federal workers rally for their jobs at White House
Bill McGee\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nThose who've experienced the nightmare of a nut allergy attack onboard an aircraft claim there's no worse setting; ample background on this topic is at NoNutTraveler.com. For the record, on behalf of Consumers Union I've supported the DOT's proposed ban on peanuts in U.S. airline cabins.\n\nOn most flights, there are few certainties. Some domestic airlines — such as American and United — don't offer packaged nuts but still may serve warmed nuts or include nuts and/or peanut oils in meals, so risks remain. Delta says it will refrain from serving nuts if notified in advance and will allow pre-boarding to clean the seating area; still, no guarantees. And other passengers, of course, may bring nuts onboard.\n\nAs for Southwest, the carrier built its brand on serving peanuts and acknowledges it is nearly impossible to avoid triggering a reaction. Southwest suggests booking early morning flights since aircraft cabins are scheduled for thorough cleaning at night; however, this sounds like a dangerous strategy.\n\nBestselling author Lisa Pulitzer has had harrowing experiences with her daughter Francesca's airborne peanut allergy, noting, It's nearly impossible to determine an airline's policy via its website and even with a live agent. In one case, she booked a flight with no peanut British Airways but they were treated terribly after realizing it was a codeshare flight operated by another carrier. Pulitzer says they've encountered unhelpful crewmembers and rude and unaccommodating fellow passengers, so she tries to book seats near the front, allowing Francesca access to the lavatory without passing through the cabin. She adds, What should be an exciting time is always filled with worry and anxiety for us.
Steven Petrow\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Steven Petrow offers advice about living in the Digital Age.\n\nWe Post Nothing About Our Daughter Online, screams a Slate headline that has gone viral numerous times. Its author, Amy Webb, claims that a zero-posting policy for her child is the only way to defend her against facial recognition, Facebook profiling, and corporate data mining. Webb writes in near panic mode that myriad applications, websites, even our smart watches are relying on facial recognition and bio-identification.\n\nWith the new year at hand, it's time to make some resolutions about protecting our kids' digital privacy and legacies, especially when three-quarters of teens said they are very or somewhat concerned about their online privacy, according to a study by the Family Online Safety Institute.\n\nAlong with many others, Meagan Fouty, the mother of two, shared Webb's essay on her Facebook page last week. Her post caught my eye.\n\nThere are very few photos of our little ones online (and even fewer over time). Not because our kids aren't as cute or as clever as yours, but because we don't want to be the reason they can't walk into a conference room without people being able to look up pics of their naked tushes...we'll let them do that on their own (we're watching you, future teenagers!)\n\nBut there's a big difference between no photos and very few (as well as a distinction between cute kids and naked ones). I asked Linda Murray, BabyCenter's global editor-in-chief, and mother of a teenage daughter, for her advice. Murray clearly disagreed with Webb's zero tolerance when it comes to pictures. The best way to approach posting photos of little ones online is to choose the best photo from your day, or party, or outing, she said. There's no need to post the 25 pictures you took just to get it right.\n\nAs for those naked tushes, Murray offers this simple guideline: Before you post anything, remember that someday your child may grow up to be a judge or a CEO (or President!), and the last thing he or she will want living on the Internet are bathtub photos.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY:\n\nMake no mistake, you can protect your children from embarrassment or exploitation without banishing them from social media altogether. Here's how:\n\n— Use common sense when deciding which photos to post and share. Don't post bathtub or potty pictures, no matter how cute.\n\n— Check your privacy settings on all your social media counts regularly — including now, at the beginning of a new year. Log out to see what is visible to the public.\n\n— Set up family only accounts on Facebook and Instagram and have other family members commit to not sharing your photos.\n\n— Once your child is a pre-teen or teen, ask permission before you post. That's a good way to model smart, sage behavior when it comes to their own photo posts.\n\n— Never post photos of other people's kids without getting permission first. If you do and you're asked to take them down, just do it without complaint.\n\nFinally, Fouty reminded me of this perhaps forgotten truth: It wasn't that long ago when people got a chance to be 'surprised at how much you've grown' after an absence. Right? Right, indeed. And it was always a lovely surprise.\n\nAgree or disagree with my advice? Let me know in the comments section.\n\nSubmit your question to Steven at stevenpetrow@earthlink.net.

COLLINS, Miss. — A man walked into a nursing home for military veterans two days before Christmas, picked up Jerry Holliman's legs and left.\n\nHolliman, 69, had hopes of moving back to his home in Hattiesburg and returning to an independent lifestyle with his new prosthetic legs.\n\nThen they were repossessed.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs wouldn't pay for his prosthetic legs, Holliman said, and Medicare wanted him on the hook for co-pays. As Holliman tried to navigate what felt like a maze of paperwork, it felt like his country was forgetting him.\n\nMedicare did not send me to Vietnam, Holliman said. I was sent there by my country... with the understanding that if something bad happened to me, that it would be covered by the VA.\n\nHolliman served active duty in the U.S. Army twice — as an 18-year-old specialist who volunteered to fight in Vietnam and as a 53-year-old master sergeant in Iraq. He earned Bronze Stars in both wars, according to his discharge papers. Between active duty and the U.S Army National Guard, Holliman said he served 40 years in the military.\n\nWhile in Vietnam, Holliman said he was exposed to Agent Orange, a chemical the American military used to kill vegetation. The chemical also caused diseases to Vietnamese and U.S. Service members, including cancers and diabetes.\n\nHolliman said he's survived three forms of cancer, but in recent years, diabetes began affecting his legs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs paid for a motorized wheelchair for Holliman a few years ago, he said. It helped get him into the kitchen of his Hattiesburg home using a ramp in his garage, but the rest of his house is not wheelchair accessible.\n\nAt the time, Holliman could still walk a bit, and he never expected he would lose his legs entirely.\n\nThen they got worse. Gangrene set in, which meant emergency surgery.\n\nDoctors amputated his right leg in November 2018, and the left leg in April. Holliman came to the Veterans Home in Collins for what he thought would be a temporary stay — just until he got his mobility back.\n\nWho should pay?\n\nHolliman said he got a pair of prosthetic legs in August from a company called Hanger, which has offices in Hattiesburg.\n\nHe held onto paperwork, including handwritten notes on how to use and clean his prosthetic legs. He started going through rehab at the nursing home.\n\nAfter a few sessions with the Hanger staff, Holliman said he was told the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs would not pay for his prosthetic legs.\n\nHe tried to raise the alarm with staff at the Veterans Home in Collins, a state-run facility, but Holliman said he knows the ultimate decision to pay for his prosthetic legs lies with the VA — an entity he compared to Goliath.\n\nSusan Varcie, a spokeswoman at the VA Medical Center in Jackson, said she could not comment on Holliman's case due to privacy laws.\n\nHanger declined to say how much a typical prosthetic leg costs, but a 2013 report from ABC News said the cost for a single leg can range from $5,000 to $50,000 for adults.\n\nHolliman said he was encouraged to use Medicare to pay for the prosthetic legs, but he was never shown a total cost, and the forms indicated he would have to pay a co-pay.\n\nSo he refused, never expecting what would come next.\n\nOn Dec. 23, an employee from Hanger came to the Veterans Home to see Holliman. Holliman said the man was adjusting his prosthetic legs, then asked himto sign some paperwork for Medicare.\n\nHolliman said he declined because the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs should pay for the legs in full.\n\nThis is their responsibility, Holliman said.\n\nThe man responded by taking the legs and leaving.\n\nThe only evidence that remained were the papers Holliman held onto and a pair of new black gym shoes sitting underneath a table in his room he had to buy for the prosthetic legs.\n\nTheir only purpose now seemed to be a reminder of what he had lost.\n\nHolliman's son, Jerald, said he was shocked to learn his father's legs had been taken.\n\nHe was always under the impression, 'These were my legs,' Jerald said. ...What he's done for his community, his country ... for them to have taken these legs is an insult.\n\nWith his legs gone, Holliman felt like he was falling through the cracks of the American health care system. He called the Clarion Ledger, part of the USA TODAY Network, which in turn reached out to Hanger prosthetics about the case.\n\nA reporter and photographer from the Clarion Ledger went to the Veterans Home in Collins to meet with Holliman on Jan 2. Hours after they left, a man came to Holliman's room.\n\nHolliman said it was the same employee from Hanger who took his legs. This time, he was bringing them back. He asked Holliman about his Bronze Star awards.\n\nHe didn't know that I received those things, Holliman said.\n\nThere was a problem with the legs, though. No adjustments had been made to them, Holliman said, and he can't walk without one leg folding in on him.\n\n'You can have 'em,' Holliman recalled the man saying, but they're not going to do anything to them until the VA pays them.\n\nThe prosthetics company responds\n\nWhen the Clarion Ledger initially reached out to Hanger, spokeswoman Meghan Williams did not deny Holliman's account of having his prosthetic legs taken. She said she could not confirm or deny it because federal privacy laws prevented Hanger from speaking about individual clients.\n\nShe said Hanger could comment on the case if Holliman had signed a waiver of his privacy rights, but Holliman said he received no communication from Hanger asking for him to waive those rights.\n\nHanger Clinic does not take back prosthetic devices after final delivery to a patient has been made, Williams said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Williams said final delivery is only complete when a patient has signed a verification of receipt that allows a claim for payment to be submitted to the applicable insurance payer.\n\nBecause Holliman didn't sign the Medicare paperwork, it appears that Holliman had possession of the prosthetic legs, while Hanger simultaneously considered those legs undelivered.\n\nNow, Holliman has the legs back, but it's unclear why. Holliman thinks it's because he contacted the media.\n\nWhen the Clarion Ledger reached out to Hanger about the return of the legs, Williams reiterated that federal privacy law prevents Hanger from talking about Holliman's case.\n\nWe understand how critical the devices we build are for our patients' rehabilitation, she said in a statement. It is our policy, in accordance with regulatory guidelines, to follow up with every patient we see and make necessary device adjustments through delivery and for at least 90 days afterwards. We are committed to empowering human potential, and want to see our patients regain their mobility and independence.\n\nThat's not what Holliman said he was told.\n\nThe legs are basically useless if Hanger won't make any more adjustments, Holliman said, and without those adjustments, he's stuck at the Veterans Home. Depression and anxiety are setting in, he said.\n\nAt 69, Holliman said he's one of the youngest residents at the home. He said his roommate died last month.\n\nI was here for one thing — to get my prosthetic legs, learn how to walk in 'em, and go home, Holliman said. ...I've been here over a year. I wanna go home. This place is not for me. It's a dignified place for these guys to die, that's what it is... It's probably every other month somebody dies here. And you know what they do? Put a flag over them, and play 'Taps' and take them outta here.\n\nWhen asked about his future, Holliman said he wants to live another 20 or 30 years, enjoy his retirement and go fishing.\n\nI'm like a cat. I got nine lives. I think I'm on the last one, though, Holliman said. After a pause, he added: It's not my time. You know, we go through a lot. Some of us can go out there and slip on a piece of bubble gum, and we die. But it's not meant for me to go yet.\n\nFollow Giacomo Jack Bologna on Twitter: @gbolognaCL.
AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Latest on Thursday at the Australian Open (all times local):\n\n11:30 p.m.\n\nDefending champion Roger Federer is through to the Australian Open's third round after beating Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (4) in a night match at Rod Laver Arena.\n\nFederer maintained his record of always reaching the third round at Melbourne Park, and this is his 19th appearance. Five of his 19 Grand Slam singles titles have been in Australia.\n\nDespite his straight-sets win, Federer was only able to convert three of his 11 break-point chances, and only one of six in the third set.\n\nThe 36-year-old Federer will next play French veteran Richard Gasquet. Federer has beaten Gasquet 16 of the 18 times they've played.\n\n_____\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nFormer champion Stan Wawrinka wasn't sure if he was ready to play the Australian Open after left knee surgery last year left his behind in his preparations. It showed on Thursday.\n\nWawrinka never looked capable of winning his third-round match, losing 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 to American Tennys Sandgren. The Swiss star is seeded ninth, Sandgren is ranked 97th.\n\nThe 2014 Australian Open champion spent eight weeks on crutches following his surgery, and pulled out of an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi two weeks before the Australian Open.\n\nHe admitted that he waited until the last possible moment before deciding to play in Melbourne after not having played a competitive match since Wimbledon.\n\nThe 32-year-old Wawrinka was attempting to make the third round for the 10th consecutive year.\n\n_____\n\n9:20 p.m.\n\nFourth-seeded Alexander Zverev overcame a mid-match lull to advance to the third round of the Australian Open with a 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 win over fellow German Peter Gojowczyk.\n\nIt's the second year in a row that Zverev has reached the third round. Last year, the 20-year-old who is predicted to be a future Grand Slam winner lost to eventual runner-up Rafael Nadal in five sets.\n\nZverev won five titles last year, including Masters 1000 titles at Rome and Montreal.\n\n_____\n\n8:25 p.m.\n\nTop-seeded Simona Halep cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 win over Eugenie Bouchard to advance to the third round of the Australian Open.\n\nWith temperatures down a few degrees from the torrid 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) earlier in the day, Halep helped gain some revenge from the last — and only — time the pair met in a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nAt Wimbledon in 2014, the Canadian beat Halep in the semifinals before advancing to the final, where she lost to Petra Kvitova.\n\nHer strong run early that year — semifinals at the Australian and French Opens before Wimbledon — helped propel Bouchard to No. 5 in the rankings. She has since had a major slide and is now ranked 112th.\n\n_____\n\n6:50 p.m.\n\nWild-card entry Julien Benneteau has had an upset 1-6, 7-6 (5), 6-1, 7-6 (4) victory over seventh-seeded David Goffin, winning the last five points in the tiebreaker in a third-round match.\n\nIt was only the second time in the now 59th-ranked Benneteau's career — in 19 attempts — that he's managed to beat a player in the top 10 in a Grand Slam singles match.\n\n_____\n\n6 p.m.\n\nSix-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic overcame a poor start — dropping his first two service games — to continue his career-long domination of Gael Monfils.\n\nDjokovic beat the Frenchman for the 15th consecutive time — 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 in temperatures that reached 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n\nMonfils needed to be checked by a tournament doctor on Rod Laver Arena in the second set when the torrid conditions left him appearing woozy at times.\n\nDjokovic needed four match points in the final game which stretched over eight minutes.\n\n_____\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nMadison Keys won the first 11 games and beat Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-0, 6-1 in a 41-minute third-round match at the Australian Open.\n\nThe 17th-seeded Keys was dominant serving in the first set. She served five aces in six attempts to open the match — four in the first game and another on the second point of her next service game.\n\nShe won every point on her serve in the first set, holding at love in three games.\n\n_____\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nFormer champion Angelique Kerber celebrated her 30th birthday with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Donna Vekic to advance to the third round of the Australian Open and a match against Maria Sharapova.\n\nIt was Kerber's 11th win in a row to start the season.\n\nKerber, the 2016 champion at Melbourne Park, won four singles matches at the Hopman Cup and five more while winning last week's Sydney International. She beat fellow German Anna-Lena Friedsam in the first round here.\n\n_____\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nDominic Thiem has survived his first career five-set match at the Australian Open, rallying from two sets down to defeat 190th-ranked American qualifier Denis Kudla 6-7 (6), 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round.\n\nThe fifth-seeded Austrian player improved his five-set record at Grand Slams to 3-3 with the win. He lost both five-setters he played last year at the majors to Tomas Berdych at Wimbledon and to Juan Martin del Potro at the U.S. Open.\n\nThiem counted 21 aces among his 57 winners in the match. He was broken three times in the opening set and once in the second set, then didn't face another break point for the rest of the match.\n\n_____\n\n2:55 p.m.\n\nWimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza is out of the Australian Open after being beaten 7-6 (1), 6-4 by Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan in the second round.\n\nMuguruza never looked comfortable in the match, double-faulting on break point in the second set and had 43 unforced errors.\n\nShe saved one match point in the ninth game on her serve before Hsieh served out the match in the next, clinching it with a winning backhand to the corner.\n\nThe Spaniard had a troubled preparation for the tournament, retiring with cramps in the second round at the Brisbane International and withdrew before her quarterfinal at Sydney because of a right thigh injury.\n\n_____\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nAmerican Sam Querrey is out of the Australian Open after losing his second-round match 6-4, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-2 to 80th-ranked Marton Fucsovics of Hungary.\n\nThe 13th-seeded Querrey was one of 10 American players — men and women — to reach the second round from the 32 who started the main draws, the lowest number of Americans through to the second round in Melbourne since seven in 2011.\n\n____\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nFormer Australian Open semifinalist Johanna Konta has been knocked out of the tournament in the second round by American lucky loser Bernarda Pera 6-4, 7-5.\n\nPera, ranked No. 123, lost in the final round of qualifying and didn't get into the main draw until Monday, when Russia's Margarita Gasparyan withdrew with an injury. The 23-year-old Pera is making her Grand Slam debut.\n\nKonta saved three match points in the ninth game of the second set, then broke Pera to level the set at 5-all. The American finally closed out the match on her fifth match point.\n\nPera was born in Croatia and moved to the U.S. when she was 16, deciding to represent the U.S. She is one of only four American women to reach the second round — the fewest number since 2011.\n\nKonta ended last season on a four-match losing streak, including a first-round loss at the U.S. Open, while dealing with a foot injury. She then retired from a match at the season-opening Brisbane International with a hip injury.\n\n_____\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nMaria Sharapova has advanced to the third round, beating Anastasija Sevastova 6-1, 7-6 (4) as the temperatures began to rise at Melbourne Park.\n\nWith a forecast high of 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit), Sharapova appeared to be in a hurry to get off the Rod Laver Arena court, winning the first set in 23 minutes.\n\nIn the second set, Sharapova was broken while serving for the match, sending it to the tiebreaker which she dominated.\n\nSharapova is playing here for the first time since serving a 15-month doping ban for testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open. She lost to Sevastova at the U.S. Open last September in her return to Grand Slam tennis.\n\n_____\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nMaria Sharapova was set to take on Anastasija Sevastova at the start of play Thursday on an expected day of scorching temperatures at the Australian Open.\n\nThe forecast was for temperatures approaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), and delays were likely on side courts if the tournament invokes its Extreme Heat Policy. Officials also have the option of closing the roofs on the three show courts, including Rod Laver Arena.\n\nSharapova is playing here for the first time since serving a 15-month doping ban after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.\n\nWimbledon winner Garbine Muguruza, defending champion Roger Federer and six-time Australian winner Novak Djokovic were also scheduled to play their second-round matches Thursday.\n\n_____\n\nMore AP coverage: www.apnews.com/tag/AustralianOpen
Aaron David Miller\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIran now presents Donald Trump with the first real-time crisis of his presidency, illustrated in stark terms Tuesday when Iran launched ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases hosting U.S. and Iraqi troops. And not surprisingly, he is handling it in a way that embodies all the worst elements of his management of national security issues. Unfortunately, Trump also seems to have abandoned one of the more positive aspects of his approach to foreign policy: a reluctance to get into new and unwinnable conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nA major war with Iran is by no means inevitable. But the killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani is a roll of the dice that just might take us there.\n\nThe external signs of crisis mismanagement are already apparent. The president's threats against Iran have inflamed an Iranian public already at fever pitch against the United States. His promise — twice — to attack Iran's cultural sites should it respond violently against the United States was not only a provocation, it was also a potential war crime. Trump belatedly recognized that, but no statement did as much to undermine the American narrative that it's at war with the Iranian regime, not the Iranian people.\n\nTrump has fared no better with the Iraqi government by threatening sanctions if it moves to force U.S. troops out of Iraq. U.S.-Iraqi relations are at an all-time low, with additional confusion over the leak of a Defense Department letter that appears to set the stage for repositioning American forces in anticipation of withdrawal. That's even though many Iraqis, primarily among Sunnis and Kurdish constituencies, want them to stay.\n\nTrump has also alienated America's most important ally on Iraq — Britain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unhappy that the United States did not coordinate with him before targeting Soleimani.\n\nSoleimani killing weakens US influence\n\nBut behind these headlines, the dysfunction in U.S. policy reflects trend lines that have been clear since Trump took office. First, the killing of Soleimani is emblematic of Trump's tendency to come up with solutions to problems America didn't necessarily have. He did this by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord; recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria; and exiting a flawed but still highly functional Iran nuclear accord — arguably the reason we are now in this crisis with Iran.\n\nTaking Soleimani off the battlefield may have been morally justified and a tactical success. But it has created any number of second-order consequences that have weakened rather than strengthened U.S. influence in region. Americans are less secure, not more; Iran's regional influence, especially in Iraq, has been boosted, not weakened; and U.S. influence is at its lowest ebb in a decade and a half.\n\nNor is there real certainty that we can control events in the wake of an Iranian retaliation. Killing Soleimani may have been a tactical success, but so far it appears to be a strategic failure.\n\nKilling Soleimani also highlights yet another Trump tendency — taking actions that are untethered from any broader strategic goal. One example is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, with no apparent correlation to promoting serious negotiations or selling the administration's own Middle East peace plan.\n\nAnd this sort of haphazard approach driven by Trump's moods, ego or domestic politics doubly pertains to the way his Iran policy has played out. His maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran has been effective in squeezing Iran's economy. But it has never been clear what the goal is: To fracture the regime, weaken it and lay the basis for regime change? Or to pressure Iran into returning to the negotiating table to reach a new deal more favorable to Washington?\n\nWhen you don't know where you're going, the old saw opines, then any road will get you there. And right now it looks as if the administration really has no idea where it's going or what it wants to achieve with Iran.\n\nDecisions tied to moods and cable TV\n\nThen there's the matter of Trump's decision-making — a style that seems free of any methodical or consistent process of weighing options in a deliberative manner and thinking through the implications and consequences before actions are undertaken. Instead, the decisions seem tied to Trump's likes, dislikes, moods, personal views and what he watches on cable news.\n\nThe decision to target Soleimani was reportedly taken after Trump had decided on a more moderate response. But after watching the images of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad under attack, Trump changed his mind and stunned his advisers with the decision to kill Soleimani.\n\nEditorial Board:Iran crisis demands Donald Trump spell out endgame after killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani\n\nOther reports suggest that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been pushing to hit Soleimani for months and took advantage of Trump's moment of risk-readiness to argue for the more extreme option.\n\nThere's no way of knowing what motivated the president. The administration has still not released the intelligence that purported to show the imminent nature of the attacks Soleimani was planning.\n\nEither way, we are seeing an administration taking a dramatic course of action that was not well thought through either on the front end (why Soleimani was killed) or on the back end (how would this impact U.S. interests in a volatile region). And a president driven by any number of motives that are still opaque — from anger over pictures on cable news, to frustration with impeachment, to a desire to appear tough and bold in the wake of Iran's rocket attacks that killed an American contractor and wounded U.S. servicemen.\n\nUS interests devastated:Attack on US Embassy in Iraq shows Trump is failing. He walked into Iran's trap.\n\nFinally, above all it suggests drift in U.S. policy and an administration that doesn't know its own mind or the region. Like some modern day Gulliver, Trump is wandering around in the Middle East tied up by small and larger powers whose interests are not his own, and by his own illusions sliding toward a confrontation with Iran. His is an administration inhabited by regime changers, sanctions imposers, chicken hawks and real ones who are looking for a fight with Iran.\n\nWhat the president lacks, however, is what he could most use — a realistic and sustainable approach to avoid a war with Iran that America neither wants nor needs.\n\nAaron David Miller, a senior fellow for American Diplomacy and U.S. Foreign Policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department adviser and Middle East negotiator, is the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President.

Policy changes have undocumented people on edge\n\nAround the country, President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the U.S. have spread fear and anxiety and brought about major changes in how people go about their daily lives. (Feb. 22)
Daniel B. Kline\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWalmart (NYSE: WMT) has decided to raise the minimum wage it pays workers to $11 an hour, following in the footsteps of Target (NYSE: TGT), which made the same move in September 2017.\n\nBoth companies deserve credit for proactively raising wages. Yes, their hands were largely forced by a tightening labor market, but neither retailer had to institute a companywide policy. Both could have chosen to pay more where necessary and less where possible.\n\nMaking $11 an hour is certainly better than earning the $7.25-per-hour federal minimum wage. It's also an improvement over every state's minimum except for those of California ($11), Massachusetts ($11), Washington ($11.50), and the District of Columbia ($12.50).\n\nBut can someone actually live on $11 an hour? In some markets, the answer is yes, but in many parts of the country, $11 is simply not enough to provide basic needs such as housing, food, clothing, and healthcare.\n\nMore: Less than meets eye: Bonuses, not raises, from U.S. tax cut windfall\n\nMore: List of companies that paid bonuses or boosted pay since tax bill passed\n\nMore: Walmart boosts minimum wage to $11, hands out bonuses up to $1,000 for hourly workers\n\nHow far does $11 an hour go?\n\nWhile it's difficult to pick a region that represents the average cost of living in America, Minnesota comes pretty close. The state ranked right in the middle of GoBankingRates' cost-of-living survey covering all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. Minnesota has five different metropolitan areas, and St. Cloud sits near the midpoint in terms of living wage -- the amount required to support an individual and any dependents -- according to data provided by MIT.\n\nThat means St. Cloud provides a reasonable example of how far $11 an hour will go for an American with a typical cost of living. All calculations assume a person works 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. At $11 an hour, that comes out to $22,880 a year.\n\nHourly wages 1 Adult 1 Adult 1 Child 1 Adult 2 Children 2 Adults (1 Working) 1 Child 2 Adults 1 Child 2 Adults 2 Children Living wage in the St. Cloud area $10.64 $23.00 $29.16 $21.95 $13.09 $15.91 Required annual income before taxes $22,136 $47,841 $60,663 $45,646 $54,467 $66,172\n\nData source: MIT.\n\nAs you can see from the data above, an $11-per-hour minimum wage does count as a living wage for a single adult in the St. Cloud area. Add in even a single child, however, and $11 is less than half of what is needed to get by. And even with two working adults who have only one child, you can see that $11 an hour leaves the family short by about $8,700 a year.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThis is just one example that falls roughly in the middle. If you live in a cheaper market, $11 an hour goes further, and it may be enough to qualify as a living wage. Of course, in pricier locales, a person earning $11 an hour will be even further behind.\n\nWhat this shows is that even though companies like Wal-Mart and Target have taken a step in the right direction, they still don't pay workers at the bottom enough to get by in many markets. Perhaps more notable is that the federal minimum wage is woefully inadequate, and even states that have set a higher bar have not pushed numbers high enough for many people to make ends meet.\n\nDaniel B.

Jeff Kosseff\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nAs presidential hopefuls lay the groundwork for their 2020 campaigns, there's plenty of speculation about their messages, their strategies and who they will snag to be their campaign managers, pollsters and state directors.\n\nOne campaign position has received little attention, but it is the most important hire that a candidate can make: chief information security officer. This official is responsible for securing the campaign's email accounts, confidential files and computer systems from hacking.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Russia hacked the headquarters of both major political parties and the chairman of a presidential campaign. Russia's intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including targets associated with both major U.S. political parties, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence wrote in a 2017 report.\n\nSome campaigns and political parties were woefully unprepared for the digital onslaught from Russian hackers. Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, fell victim to a relatively unsophisticated phishing scam. Podesta clicked on a link in an email, providing hackers with access to his poorly secured personal Gmail account from which he conducted campaign business.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nRussia isn't out to decide our elections, they want to divide us and damage our country\n\nThe 2020 election is vulnerable. Congress needs to guard against attacks starting now.\n\nDNC official: We all need to get serious about election security. You too, Republicans.\n\nRussia used rudimentary hacking techniques to access some of the most sensitive political information in the United States. Perhaps the campaigns were so off-guard because hacks of that magnitude had not caused such disruption during previous election cycles.\n\nHeading in to the 2020 election, campaigns no longer have that excuse. Every presidential candidate is on notice that they are targets of sophisticated state-sponsored hackers who are looking to expose their confidential information and cause chaos before, during and after the 2020 election.\n\n2016 was a warning, there's no excuse for 2020\n\nHack our election once, shame on you. Hack our election twice, shame on us.\n\nThe first step in preventing a repeat of the 2016 hacking is for every candidate — regardless of party — to prioritize cybersecurity on the same tier as fundraising, advertising and debate preparation. This begins with hiring a chief information security officer, a high-level official who can set and implement strategy to secure every bit of confidential information, and ensure that the systems are not disrupted by attacks. This official should have deep experience and be of the same tier that you would expect from a top security executive at a Fortune 500 company.\n\nHiring a single executive, however, will not be sufficient. That official must have the budget to hire a team of experienced cybersecurity staffers to develop and implement policies and install technical safeguards, such as multifactor authentication, end-to-end encryption, regular vulnerability testing, and monitoring for insider threats. The cybersecurity staff should ensure that users only have access to the data that they need to perform their job.\n\nCampaigns cannot rely exclusively on their cybersecurity teams to prevent hacking. Every member of the campaign — from the part-time volunteer to the campaign manager to the candidate — must adhere to the campaign's security policy and use the protection that the cybersecurity team provides. Easier said than done, particularly in the frenzy of campaign season. But every person with an email account is a potential vulnerability. Before it provides account credentials to a new staffer or volunteer, the campaign must require the person to undergo cybersecurity training.\n\nDon't redirect cybersecurity money to TV ads\n\nThe campaign must develop its cybersecurity team and strategy from the very start. If it holds off on cybersecurity in favor of other priorities, it likely will be too late. Staffers will have account credentials and devices scattered across the country. By that point, any changes in policies, procedures or technology would be difficult, if not impossible, to enact.\n\nBuilding a cybersecurity program will not be a cheap or easy task, as the United States faces a dire shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals. It may be tempting for a campaign to conserve money on cybersecurity, in favor of more traditional expenses such as television advertising time.\n\nCampaigns are free to decide whether cybersecurity is a top priority. But if they decide to underinvest, they must be aware that it is only a matter of time before hackers expose their confidential data. And that will not only harm their efforts to win, but it will also undermine the integrity of the process that undergirds our democratic system.\n\nJeff Kosseff is an assistant professor of cybersecurity law at the U.S. Naval Academy.

Iran warned Friday a harsh retaliation is waiting for the United States after top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani was killed by the Pentagon in an airstrike.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed vengeance.\n\nKhamenei said in a statement published by Iranian state media that the cruelest people on earth assassinated the honorable commander who courageously fought for years against the evils and bandits of the world.\n\nKhamenei called for three days of mourning.\n\nHis departure to God does not end his path or his mission, the statement said, published by Fars News Agency. But a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands.\n\nSoleimani was killed at Baghdad airport early Friday alongside members of Iran-backed militias operating in Iraq. The airstrike was ordered by President Donald Trump. Soleimani was killed while a convoy he was traveling in was leaving the airport. Iran funds and supports proxy militias across the Middle East.\n\nNew escalation:U.S. launched airstrike that killed Iran's Qasem Soleimani\n\nThe 62-year-old military commander played a key role in expanding Iran's influence and military reach in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His death marks a new, major escalation between Tehran and Washington following Trump's withdrawal from a nuclear accord between Iran and world powers. Soleimani had a hand in virtually every significant Iranian military and intelligence operation stretching back two decades, including a recent two-day siege against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that ended Wednesday. The assault led to the Pentagon rushing reinforcements to the diplomatic compound in Iraq.\n\nPro-Iran protesters want U.S. troops to leave the country.\n\nSoleimani was widely viewed as one of Iran's most powerful men and, at home, a heroic national figure who was standing up to Trump's maximum pressure Iran strategy that includes stinging economic sanctions and confrontational rhetoric and military deployments. Soleimani headed Iran's U.S.-sanctioned, elite Quds Force, part of the nation's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani called Soleimani's killing a heinous crime and said Iran will take revenge, while Ali Rabiei, a spokesman for Iran's cabinet, said that Iran's response would be severe, swift and decisive.\n\nThe Pentagon defended the targeting of Soleimani as a defensive action, saying that Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months - including the attack on December 27th - culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel.\n\nThe Trump administration considered him a terrorist and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Soleimani was killed because he was planning an imminent attack.\n\nHe said the operation saved American lives.\n\nKey figure: What we know about the strike that killed Iran's Gen. Qasem Soleimani\n\nSina Toossi, a researcher at the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-D.C.-based group that seeks to promote links between Americans and Iranians, noted on Twitter that Khamenei's chairing Friday of an emergency meeting of the National Security Council for the first time was a sign of how serious & authoritative #Iran's response to Soleimani's assassination will be.\n\nAfter the meeting, the National Security Council said it reached a decision on how to respond to the U.S. killing of Soleimani, but it didn't specify what the decision was.\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader, appeared to threaten U.S. troops in the region. This is the time to clear the region from these insidious beasts, he said while leading Friday prayers in Tehran, according to state media. The cleric added: I am telling Americans, especially Trump, we will take a revenge that will change their daylight into a nighttime darkness.\n\nKhamenei appointed Soleimani's deputy, Maj. Gen. Esmail Ghaani as the new commander of the Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force.\n\nNew Qusa Force chief Esmail Qaani: We say to everyone be patient, you'll see the American corpses all over the Middle East.\n\nIt is unclear what Iran's response will be, but the State Department urged U.S. citizens to leave Iraq immediately, citing heightened tensions.\n\nU.S. defense officials said 3,000 additional Amersoldiers would be sent to the Middle East following Soleimani's killing, according to reports.\n\nOpinion:Attack on U.S. Embassy in Iraq shows Trump is failing\n\nMeanwhile, officials from China to Russia criticized the Pentagon's actions.\n\nKonstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee in Russia's parliament, called the U.S. airstrike a mistake. He wrote in a social media post that Iran may accelerate making a nuclear weapon now, even if it didn't plan on doing it before, a reference to Tehran's insistence it is interested in nuclear activities for civilian purposes only, something Washington does not believe and is also one of the reasons Trump withdrew from the landmark 2015 nuclear accord negotiated by former President Barack Obama. The agreement saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions on its lucrative oil industry.\n\nGeng Shuang, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said Beijing was highly concerned about Soleimani's killing and called for calm and restraint.\n\nBritain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said conflict is in none of our interests.\n\nThe European Union said further escalation must be avoided at all costs.\n\nIsrael, Iran's archenemy, said it was raising its military preparedness levels.\n\nGermany ordered all its soldiers in Iraq not to leave their bases.\n\nA United Nations official said Soleimani's killing was illegal.\n\nLawful justifications for such killings are very narrowly defined, said Agnes Callamard, the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial executions, in a tweet.\n\nIn the U.S., there was approval and condemnation for Trump's move.\n\nKayleigh McEnany, press secretary for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, claimed in an interview on Fox News that Soleimani's killing represented the greatest foreign policy accomplishment of the decade, if not our lifetime.\n\nPompeo:Qasem Soleimani killing was in response to 'imminent attack'\n\nAnd Trump's former hawkish national security adviser John Bolton tweeted his congratulations to all involved in eliminating Iran's top general. Bolton said that he hoped this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, said, Trump's decision to kill Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad is a provocative act taken without congressional consultation or authorization, the potential consequences of which are unknown.\n\nTrump himself has said very little about the U.S. action, only tweeting Friday that Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation! and that Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!\n\nAnimosity between Iran and the U.S. stretches back more than half a century to at least 1953, when the CIA helped oust Iran's democratically elected leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh, who wanted to retain control over Iran's oil reserves, and installed as his replacement the pro-western Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\n\nPahlavi proved to be a reliable U.S. ally who helped counter the influence of the Soviet Union but he was toppled in 1979 as part of Iran's Islamic Revolution, a period that led to a hostage crisis at the U.S.'s then Embassy in Tehran.\n\nRelations never recovered and the Middle East region has, at various points, seen the slow build-up of U.S. military troops and bases from Bahrain to Syria as part of American wars and anti-terrorism operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond.\n\nIran, which can't match Washington's military might, has sought to counter the U.S. presence by developing a secretive ballistic missile program operated by the Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force and by backing regional militant allies or proxies to launch attacks on U.S. interests and allies. These allies include Iraqi militiamen, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels.\n\nIn the latest attacks that the Trump administration blames on Iran or its proxies, oil facilities in Saudi Arabia were hit by a missile-and-drone strike in September, temporarily halving the kingdom's oil production. Iran also shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz, a key passageway for oil, and laid mines targeting oil tankers. At the time, Trump pulled back from retaliating for the attacks. Oil prices surged more than 4% Friday on concerns Iran may respond to Soleimani's killing by disrupting global supplies.

Associated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS – Sheldon Adelson – the billionaire founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands and one of President Donald Trump's largest donors – has died at the age of 87 of complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, the casino company announced Tuesday.\n\nAt one point the third-richest man in the world, Adelson brought singing gondoliers to the Las Vegas Strip and went all-in betting Asia would be a bigger jackpot than Sin City. In his later years, he became widely known for his political activism, including his donations to Trump and other Republicans as well as his support for Israel.\n\nIn March 2019, Adelson announced he was getting treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He recently resumed those treatments.\n\nLas Vegas Sands announced last week that Adelson had taken a leave of absence as his cancer worsened.\n\nWith an estimated net worth of $41.4 billion, Adelson was the wealthiest person in Nevada and one of the 20 wealthiest people in America.\n\nHis Las Vegas Sands is one of the largest casino and resort companies in the world, with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Strip and lucrative casinos in Macau.\n\nAdelson and his wife, Miriam, had been the Republican Party's most prominent financial backers. They contributed more than $123 million to conservative politicians in the 2018 election cycle – more than any other U.S. citizen.\n\nOver a two-day period in September 2018, the Adelsons pumped $55 million into three conservative political action committees. Two months later, President Donald J. Trump awarded Miriam Adelson a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nIn August, the couple donated $75 million into a super PAC launched to help Trump's re-election efforts.\n\nSheldon Adelson's life story\n\nSheldon Adelson was the son of Jewish immigrants, raised with two siblings in a Boston tenement, who over the second half of his life became one of the world's richest men. The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. brought singing gondoliers to the Las Vegas Strip and foresaw correctly that Asia would be an even bigger market. In 2018, Forbes ranked him No. 15 in the U.S., worth an estimated $35.5 billion.\n\nIf you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow, he said during a 2014 talk to the gambling industry in Las Vegas.\n\nBlunt yet secretive, Adelson resembled an old-fashioned political boss and stood apart from most American Jews, who for decades have supported Democrats by wide margins. Adelson was considered the nation's most influential GOP donor over the final years of his life, at times setting records for individual contributions during a given election cycle.\n\nIn 2012, Politico called him the dominant pioneer of the super PAC era.\n\nAdelson regularly hosted the party's top strategists and most ambitious candidates at his modest office, wedged among the casinos on the Strip. Throughout, he helped ensure that uncritical support of Israel became a pillar of the GOP platform, never more visibly demonstrated than when the Trump administration relocated the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018.\n\nThe inflammatory move had been adamantly opposed by Palestinians and was long a priority for Adelson, who had even offered to help pay for it, and for the Republican Jewish Coalition, of which he was the primary benefactor. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, were front and center at the ceremony in Jerusalem.\n\nWhen asked at a gambling conference what he hoped his legacy would be, Adelson said it wasn't his glitzy casinos or hotels, it was his impact in Israel. He donated $25 million, a record sum for a private citizen, to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. He established a think tank in Jerusalem. He was closely aligned with the conservative Likud Party and funded a widely read free daily newspaper called Israel Hayom, or Israel Today, so supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that some Israelis nicknamed it Bibi-ton.\n\nIn the U.S., Adelson helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel, helped build a new headquarters for the lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and later was a top supporter of the Israeli-American Council, whose conferences have attracted top Republicans (Vice President Mike Pence) and Democrats (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi). He sponsored Birthright trips to Israel for young Jewish adults that were criticized by some participants as intolerant of opposing views.\n\nHis attachment to Israel was lifelong and so deep that he once said he wished his military service had been in an Israeli uniform instead of an American one.\n\nAdelson was a late bloomer in business and in politics. He didn't become a casino owner, or a Republican, until well into middle age. Through the 1990s and after, his wealth soared and his engagement in politics intensified. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and backed Republican Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 presidential race, before turning to the eventual candidate, Sen. John McCain, who lost to Barack Obama.\n\nHis leverage grew considerably in 2010 after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision lifted many restrictions on individual campaign contributions. He and his wife spent more than $90 million on the 2012 election, funding presidential candidate Newt Gingrich and later Mitt Romney, who also lost to Obama.\n\nI'm against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections, he told Forbes magazine in 2012. But as long as it's doable, I'm going to do it.\n\nAdelson came around slowly to Trump, who during the campaign had said he would be neutral in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump even ridiculed his initial liking for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, tweeting in 2015, Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree! Adelson eventually endorsed Trump, but remained hesitant through much of 2016. He gave more than $20 million in the final weeks of the campaign after reports that he would contribute $100 million, and was more generous with congressional races.\n\nBut after Trump's surprise victory, the new president spoke often with Adelson and embraced his hardline views on the Middle East. He cut funding for Palestinian refugees and withdrew from the Obama administration's nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran. He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem even though earlier administrations – Democratic and Republican – avoided doing do because it directly challenged the Palestinian view that the ancient city should be part of any peace agreement.\n\nAdelson, in turn, aided Trump financially, including $5 million for his inauguration, and supported him through his media holdings. Late in 2015, Adelson secretly purchased the Las Vegas Review-Journal – the paper's own reporters revealed he was the new owner – and soon raised concerns he was imposing his own views. Some longtime staffers left in protest.\n\nIn what was widely seen as a mark of the Adelsons' influence with Trump, Miriam Adelson was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018.\n\nAdelson, who contributed more than $100 million to the 2018 off-year elections, held extraordinary power among Republicans even though he didn't always agree with them. In a 2012 interview with the Wall Street Journal, he called himself basically a social liberal, pro-choice on abortion and supportive of immigrant rights. He cited taxes and differences over Israel as major reasons for leaving the Democratic party.\n\nIn Nevada, his influence was such that even the state's most prominent Democrat, Sen. Harry Reid, hesitated to take him on. In a 2014 interview with MSNBC, the then-Senate majority leader differentiated between Adelson and fellow GOP billionaire donors Charles and David Koch. Reid had sharply criticized the Koch brothers as callous and greedy, while saying that he respected Adelson because he was not in it to make money, a widely challenged opinion.\n\nHe had previously told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that he remained friends with Adelson despite their political differences.\n\nSheldon Adelson and I still meet and have conversations. He has a problem, I try to help him, Reid said.\n\nAdelson was married twice. He and his first wife, Sandra, were divorced in 1988. Three years later, he married Miriam Farbstein-Ochshorn, an Israeli-born doctor he met on a blind date and whom many believe helped deepen his involvement with Israel. Their honeymoon trip to Venice inspired Adelson to raze the historic Sands hotel-casino, once a favorite hangout for Frank Sinatra among others, and replace them with a pair of massive complexes: The Venetian and The Palazzo, one of the city's tallest buildings.\n\nSheldon Adelson adopted his first wife's three children and had two children with his second wife. Among numerous philanthropic projects, he and Miriam Adelson were especially committed to the research and treatment of substance abuse, a personal cause for Sheldon Adelson. His son Mitchell, from his first marriage, died of an overdose in 2005. (Sheldon Adelson would spend millions opposing state efforts to legalize marijuana).\n\nSheldon Garry Adelson was born in 1933, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. His father was a taxi driver, his mother the manager of a knitting store. A natural entrepreneur, he was selling newspapers by age 12 and running a vending machine business at 16. After dropping out of City College of New York and serving in the Army, he attempted to start dozens of businesses, from toiletries to de-icing windshields.\n\nAdelson, who said he disdained email, began to amass his fortune with a technology trade show, starting computer convention COMDEX in 1979 with partners before selling his stake in 1995 for more than $800 million.\n\nWhen he bought the Sands Hotel in 1989, he was thinking convention space, not just gambling, would make money. It did. He built a convention hall to keep his hotel rooms full on weekdays and others soon followed the business model. Meanwhile, his effort to replicate the Strip in Macau, the only Chinese province to allow gambling, made his wealth grow exponentially.\n\nWhen faced with water and marsh land, Adelson directed his company to build land where there wasn't any, piling sand up to create the Cotai Peninsula. Soon his Macau revenue outstripped that of his Las Vegas holdings. He later expanded his business to Singapore, where his Marina Bay Sands hotel and its infinity pool were featured in the hit film Crazy Rich Asians, and had been pressing to open a casino in Japan.\n\nHis Macau business also spawned a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former chief of Sands China Ltd. who accused Adelson and the company of firing him for exposing a host of misdeeds. Adelson often clashed with attorneys while appearing on a Clark County courtroom's witness stand.\n\nThe Sands China lawsuit was among dozens involving Adelson, whose cases included his suing a Wall Street Journal reporter for calling him foul-mouthed (the parties settled, the words remained) to being sued by his sons from his first marriage for cheating them out of money (he won).\n\nA long-running feud with fellow casino tycoon Steve Wynn turned to friendship when Wynn joined Adelson's effort to end online gambling. Critics said Adelson was trying to stifle competition. Adelson countered that there was no way to ensure children and teenagers wouldn't gamble and said he was not in favor of it exploiting the world's most vulnerable people.\n\nTrump's election would again prove useful to Adelson. During the Obama administration, the Justice Department said online gambling that does not involve sporting events would not violate the Wire Act, a 1961 federal statute. In a legal opinion that became public early in 2019, the department reversed itself and decided the statute applies to any form of gambling.\n\nThe company has named Robert G. Goldstein – Las Vegas Sands' president and chief operating officer – as acting chairman while Adelson is on medical leave.\n\nThe Book of Trump\n\nTrump has delivered – both in policy and at the podium – on an issue very important to the Adelsons: Israel.\n\nThey like a place called Israel very much, Trump said of the couple at a Las Vegas event in February. Would you say that's correct? Maybe I have to use the word 'love' a place called Israel, right?\n\nIn a column last year published in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, a newspaper the Adelsons own, Miriam made a case to expand the Bible with a book named after the 45th president of the United States:\n\nWould it be too much to pray for a day when the Bible gets a 'Book of Trump,' much like it has a 'Book of Esther' celebrating the deliverance of the Jews from ancient Persia?
WASHINGTON – House lawyers told a federal appeals court Friday that President Donald Trump faces the prospect of new articles of impeachment as they asked judges to give them access to secret testimony gathered during the Russia investigation and to force former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify before Congress.\n\nThe Justice Department, which appealed rulings by two district courts, vehemently argued against both efforts. But their challenges were met with deep skepticism from some members of the two judicial panels.\n\nHas there ever been an instance of such a broad scale of defiance of Congress? Judge Thomas Griffith asked Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan, referring to the Trump administration's refusal to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. Has that ever happened?\n\nMooppan acknowledged there may be no precedent, yet he pressed to block McGahn's testimony by arguing the courts have no authority to intervene in a largely political dispute.\n\nThe blunt exchange was part of a morning-long clash in back-to-back hearings in which House lawyers said the impeachment inquiry against Trump remains open. New charges could be brought, they said, if McGahn testifies and if the House reviews grand jury testimony behind the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nLast month, the House approved two articles of impeachment against the president. One article accuses Trump of abusing his power by withholding military aid in order to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into a political rival. The other accuses him of obstructing Congress by stonewalling most of its subpoenas for documents and testimony.\n\nMegan Barbero, House associate general counsel, told the panel in the McGahn case that his testimony could bolster the obstruction charge, which deals with Trump's alleged efforts to have Ukraine interfere in the 2020 election. And it could lead to additional articles of impeachment regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election, she said.\n\nIt is the pattern of misconduct that would be relevant, Barbero said.\n\nAsked later whether the grand jury information gathered during the Russia inquiry could prompt new impeachment charges, House general counsel Douglas Letter said, That is on the table; there is no doubt.\n\nMueller's report describedmultiple instances in which Trump sought to thwart the investigation, which included ordering McGahn to remove Mueller. The special counsel did not make a decision on bringing criminal charges against Trump, largely because Justice Department policy says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed McGahn in April, but he refused to appear.\n\nThe battle over his testimony could redefine relations between the executive and legislative branches of government, with the Trump administration arguing Congress cannot force any Trump aide to testify.\n\nJudges spent most of the 80-minute hearing in the McGahn case questioning whether they should decide the matter at all.\n\nMooppan, the deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, argued the court should avoid the political food fight between the other two branches and let them resolve the dispute over McGahn's testimony.\n\nBut Barbero said the judges must enforce the House's subpoena in order to guard against the Trump administration's unprecedented defiance of Congress' oversight.\n\nJudge Karen Henderson pointedly asked the Justice Department lawyer whether the administration believes the House could never ask the courts to enforce a subpoena against the executive branch.\n\nThat is our position, your honor, Mooppan said.\n\nJudge Judith Rogers said judges were wrestling with whether and how to mediate in a period of noncooperation between the branches of government, when either they have to duke it out or nothing happens.\n\nThat's what we're struggling with here, Rogers said.\n\nOther potential witnesses in the impeachment inquiry, such as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, have said they wanted clarification from the courts about whether they could be forced to testify.\n\nSince the beginning of the impeachment inquiry, however, McGahn has been a central figure because of his proximity to the president.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson sided with the Judiciary Committee when it sued to enforce the McGahn subpoena. She rejected the White House's claims of absolute immunity, writing that the president does not have the power to prevent his aides from responding to congressional subpoenas.\n\nStated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings, Jackson wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed her ruling, urging the appeals court to dismiss the lawsuit for having no standing in federal court. The department argued there was no urgency to making a decision because a quick decision could influence the pending Senate trial.\n\nBarbero argued that the Trump administration has directed aides and executive branch agencies to defy House subpoenas for documents and testimony. If the court doesn't step in, she said, that could hurt the legislative branch's ability to provide a check on the administration's power.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that top officials such as McGahn enjoy absolute immunity from being compelled to testify, which is necessary for them to offer confidential advice to the president.\n\nBarbero said absolute immunity was unfounded in the law.\n\nIf the court were to force McGahn to testify, he could still refuse to answer specific questions by claiming executive privilege, which also aims to protect confidential advice to the president. But that could lead to more lawsuits.\n\nThis court should not be refereeing who is right or wrong about whether the president is acting totally unusually or Congress is acting totally unusually, Mooppan said. That is exactly why this court should stay out of that.\n\nBut Barbero said defiance of subpoenas could thwart all congressional investigations, including those that could lead to legislation to prevent foreign contributions from influencing elections.\n\nThere is also a diminution of power of our branch of government, she said.\n\nMooppan argued that the House has no authority to enforce its subpoena and should have relied on the Justice Department for that. He said the court shouldn't decide the case because Congress has other remedies when facing a defiant administration, such as withholding spending for presidential priorities, refusing to confirm nominees or pursuing impeachment.\n\nIt's not that there aren't any remedies – it's that they are political, Mooppan said.
Hard Rock Stadium in metro Miami has become a strange scene to behold this week during a state surge of COVID-19.\n\nOn Friday, long lines of cars waited at the stadium for vaccinations for residents who are 65 and older — a reminder that a deadly virus is on the loose and reached record levels Thursday in Florida.\n\nOn Monday, the same stadium is scheduled to host a limited crowd of about 14,000 people for the college football national championship game between Alabama and Ohio State — a sign of normality and revelry after 10 months of the pandemic.\n\nSo which is it — a time for tourism or an atmosphere of increased emergency?\n\nIn Florida, it's both apparently. And that's not good, according to public health experts.\n\nWe're seeing a pretty substantial increase in the number of cases in Miami-Dade County, Florida International University epidemiologist Mary Jo Trepka told USA TODAY Sports on Friday. The last three days we've had over 3,000 cases a day, and we're over 10% positivity. There is a lot of COVID-19 in the community, not just Miami-Dade but Florida in general. So if anyone is making a decision to come and travel, they need to know about that and they really need to think carefully about that, because there's just an awful lot of COVID-19 right now.\n\n'INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING':Emotional toll on college football amid pandemic\n\nBUCKEYES:Can Ohio State coach Ryan Day rise to the moment vs. Alabama?\n\nOn Thursday, the state reported a single-day record of 19,816 cases of COVID-19. The epicenter is Miami-Dade County, which leads the state with 4,365 deaths as of Saturday, according to the Florida Department of Health.\n\nBut tourists don't seem to mind. Last Sunday, Miami International Airport said it welcomed nearly 90,000 travelers, marking the busiest travel day at the airport since the pandemic began. More were expected over the weekend in part because of the game Monday.\n\nWe should see a significant increase in passenger traffic this weekend, airport spokesman Jack Varela told USA TODAY Sports on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, photos recently circulated online show partiers crowding the scene like it's still 2019. Miami and Fort Lauderdale beaches and bars overflow with maskless revelers, said a headline Jan. 4 in the Daily Mail.\n\nAdd that to the arrival of fans from Alabama and Ohio State, whose football team might be missing some players because of COVID-19 issues in Ohio.\n\nThis entire college football season has been a balancing act and the championship game will be one too, College Football Playoff executive director Bill Hancock said in an e-mail Friday to USA TODAY Sports. Fans, administrators and students have lived for almost a full year balancing how much of their normal routines they can carry out while protecting themselves and others against COVID.\n\nAlabama arrived in the area Saturday morning and Ohio State's flight landed Saturday evening. The teams are following the coronavirus protocols they have all year, per their individual conference rules.\n\nThe stadium had been a COVID-19 testing site for months and was announced as a vaccination site Wednesday by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Demand for the vaccine soon outpaced supply, forcing the county vaccination hotline to tell callers to call back later to schedule an appointment.\n\nIt's not clear how the game will affect vaccination appointments at the stadium site.\n\nI don't think it means you need to shut it down, DeSantis said Wednesday. Maybe it'll close a little early, but I think you can still do it, even on that day.\n\nDeSantis has employed a policy of keeping the state open for business despite the pandemic, in contrast to other states such as California, which has not allowed fans at stadiums for months.\n\nFamilies of the teams understandably don't want to miss an event like this in person.\n\nWith precautions, we're going to try to be in Miami on Monday, said New Hampshire resident Stan Spirou, father-in-law of Ohio State head coach Ryan Day.\n\nHancock said the game will be conducted in a manner that protects health and safety to the greatest degree possible.\n\nWe are confident that Hard Rock Stadium will be able to carry out its responsibilities to its community, consistent with how they have handled Dolphins and Miami Hurricanes games, as well as the Orange Bowl, where alternative testing sites were available during game day, he said.\n\nEven if attendance is limited and fans wear masks in an outdoor stadium, such events still tend to promote tourism and attract gatherings at restaurants, hotels and homes. Trepka, the professor at FIU, recommends avoiding social gatherings.\n\nIn a large arena, there's still an element of risk with a large number of people, Trepka said. I don't think anybody has been able to fully investigate the transmission (possibilities) for many things because the whole system has been so overwhelmed since March that we don't really know a lot about all the different possibilities for transmission. I think we can feel comfortable that being outdoors is safer than being indoors, but I can't tell you to what extent.\n\nShe also cautioned that the arrival of a vaccine does not mean the pandemic is even close to being over. Only a small percentage of the population has received the first of two necessary injections.\n\nI keep telling people we are in the midst of a surge and we have very high levels, Trepka said. We are actually kind of similar in terms of our case numbers compared to what we had in the summer, which was a very difficult time period. … So I tell people they should not be going to large gatherings. I know some people will make that decision, but they need to understand that they are potentially putting themselves at risk and potentially putting other people at risk including their family members when they return.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

AP\n\nHOUSTON (AP) — The Houston Astros have agreed to terms with seven of their arbitration-eligible players, but star shortstop Carlos Correa and right-hander Gerrit Cole are not among them.\n\nCorrea, the top overall pick in the 2012 draft, made just $1 million last season. He asked for $5 million when swapping figures with the team, and the Astros offered $4.25 million. Cole, who made $6.75 million last year, asked for $13.5 million, and the team offered $11,425,000.\n\nHouston did agree to one-year deals with outfielder Jake Marisnick ($2,212,500) and right-handed pitchers Will Harris ($4,225,000), Lance McCullers Jr. ($4.1 million), Collin McHugh ($5.8 million), Roberto Osuna ($6.5 million), Brad Peacock ($3.11 million) and Ryan Pressly ($2.9 million).\n\nReliever Chris Devenski remains eligible for arbitration. He asked for $1.65 million and the team offered $1.4 million.\n\nCole made his second All-Star game last season. He went 15-5 with a 2.88 ERA in his first year in Houston after five seasons with the Pirates. Correa hit .239 with 15 home runs in 2018. He dealt with back issues and played in only 110 games.\n\nMarisnick batted .211 with 10 homers and 28 RBIs in 103 games last season. Harris went 5-3 with a 3.49 ERA in 61 appearances in his fourth year in Houston.\n\nMcCullers was arbitration eligible for the first time. He will miss the entire 2019 season after having Tommy John surgery on his pitching elbow in November. The 25-year-old McCullers, who was a first-round pick in 2012, was 10-6 with a 3.86 ERA in 25 games with 22 starts last season. He struck out a career-high 142.\n\nMcHugh was moved into the bullpen last season, and he was great as a reliever, posting a career-best 1.99 ERA with a 6-2 record in 58 appearances.\n\nOsuna was traded to Houston from Toronto on July 30 and was 2-2 with a 1.99 ERA in 23 games after the deal. He served a 75-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy before the trade to Houston. Osuna had 12 saves for the Astros in the regular season and one in the playoffs.\n\nPeacock pitched out of the bullpen for Houston last season after starting 21 games for the Astros in 2017. He was 3-5 with a 3.46 ERA in 61 games with one start in 2018. Pressly, a reliever, was traded to Houston from the Twins in July. He was great after the trade, going 1-0 with a 0.77 ERA and two saves in 26 games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
AP\n\nGENEVA (AP) — A FIFA investigation linked a referee accused of match-fixing a World Cup qualifier in 2016 to numerous publicly documented scandals in the previous six years.\n\nFIFA investigators said Joseph Lamptey of Ghana had a history of being suspended for poor performances before being banned for life and typically awarded more penalties than other African referees of his grade.\n\nA common match-fixing tactic is for referees to award penalty kicks after non-existent fouls or handball incidents to help betting syndicates cash in bets on the number of goals scored.\n\nThis conduct — and its repeated occurrence — establishes a clear and consistent pattern behavior for matches refereed by Mr. Lamptey, investigators wrote in a document published by FIFA on Monday.\n\nStill, Lamptey remained eligible for World Cup qualifying duty on FIFA's international list requiring annual approval, and also by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and Ghana's soccer federation.\n\nFIFA did not immediately respond to questions about how Lamptey came to be selected for the South Africa-Senegal qualifier in November 2016.\n\nPortugal's 2-2 draw in Gabon in a 2012 friendly, which included three penalties scored, was among six games identified as suspicious that Lamptey handled before the game that ended his career.\n\nHis decisions in South Africa's 2-1 win — helping the home team score twice late in the first half — led FIFA to ban him for life and order a replay.\n\nLamptey's history is detailed in evidence to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, whose detailed verdict to explain why it dismissed his appeal last August has now been published by FIFA.\n\nThis CAS decision underlines FIFA's commitment to protecting the integrity of football and its zero-tolerance policy on match manipulation, FIFA said in a statement.\n\nHowever, suspicions about Lamptey's conduct dated back to African club matches organized by CAF in 2010, Portugal's visit to Libreville without Cristiano Ronaldo in 2012, and a September 2016 qualifier for the African Cup of Nations, in which Cameroon beat Gambia 2-0, the FIFA investigation concluded.\n\nFootage of the Portugal game shows that, at 1-1 close to halftime, Lamptey initially awarded a goal to Gabon despite the ball never even touching the goal-line before it was grabbed by the goalkeeper. Portugal captain Pepe urged the referee to consult his assistant before the goal was disallowed.\n\nMr. Lamptey displayed specific conduct and actions on the pitch which were anticipated on the international betting markets by bettors which seemed to hold prior knowledge of goal given by Mr. Lamptey, the FIFA investigative report said.\n\nIn his final international game, Lamptey helped South Africa's goals from a penalty awarded for a non-existent handball, and after the Senegal defense was unbalanced by him allowing a free kick to be taken quickly and far from where the foul was committed.\n\nThe referee's lawyers argued at CAS that he made innocent mistakes, however betting monitoring experts detailed how the pattern of wagers was suspicious.\n\nFrom the 12th minute until South Africa scored in the 43rd, the odds for at least three goals to be scored failed to increase as logically expected.\n\nSenegal won the replayed game 2-0 in November, and eventually qualified to play at the World Cup in Russia.
AP\n\nHOUSTON (AP) — The Rams are moving back to Los Angeles, maybe with company.\n\nThe San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders might end up staying put, although the leadership of both teams didn't come close to making that commitment Tuesday night. Or one of them could be headed to L.A., too.\n\nA long day of votes and re-votes ended with 30 of 32 NFL owners approving Rams owner Stan Kroenke's ambitious plan to move his team from St. Louis to the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack in Inglewood, California, about 10 miles from downtown LA. The Chargers have a yearlong option to join the Rams, followed by the Raiders if the San Diego franchise declines.\n\nThe Raiders and Chargers had a competing proposal to share a new stadium in nearby Carson, but neither option got the 24 votes needed for approval. After another negotiating session in the afternoon, Kroenke's $1.8 billion project prevailed.\n\nThe decision ends the NFL's 21-year absence from the nation's second-largest media market.\n\nI often said over those 21 years what we need is a great facility, Commissioner Roger Goodell said at a news conference about 11 hours after the meetings began. I think what happened over the last years is we had two outstanding opportunities, both of these stadium projects were outstanding.\n\nChargers chairman Dean Spanos was asked if he intended to play in Los Angeles in 2016.\n\nI'm going to take a day off tomorrow I think, Spanos said. This has really been excruciating for everyone. It's very difficult to say right now I'm going to do this or do that.\n\nOakland is still in debt from a renovation 20 years ago when the Raiders moved back from Los Angeles. City officials have said they won't seek help from taxpayers with a new stadium, and asked the NFL for more time to develop a project in a response to the Raiders' relocation plan. The NFL gave it to them.\n\nWe'll see where the Raider nation ends up here, said owner Mark Davis, who was equally noncommittal in comments to reporters outside the news conference. We'll be working really hard to find us a home. So for our fans and everything else, don't feel bad. We'll get it right.\n\nRay Perez, a 28-year-old Raiders fan from Sacramento who goes by the moniker Dr. Death, traveled to the Houston meeting in his usual Black Hole garb and was cautiously optimistic after hearing the news.\n\nI will not be completely, fully thrilled until the ink dries on paper and we know we're staying in Oakland in a new stadium, Perez said. I'm very happy, very happy. But I'm not going to be overjoyed until we sign a stadium deal to keep the Raiders in Oakland with our own stadium.\n\nThe Chargers play 120 miles south of Inglewood in aging Qualcomm Stadium. The Raiders played in Los Angeles from 1982-94 and currently split a facility with baseball's Athletics, the last remaining combination stadium.\n\nThe Rams — based in the LA area from 1946-94 — will likely have a temporary home at the Los Angeles Coliseum until the new stadium is ready in 2019. It's unclear where the Chargers would play if they move.\n\nSan Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer says the city and county will negotiate with the Chargers, but are not interested in a charade by the Chargers if they continue to pursue Los Angeles.\n\nSt. Louis had a plan for an open-air, $1.1 billion stadium along the Mississippi River north of the Gateway Arch to replace the Edward Jones Dome. But Kroenke mostly ignored the city's overtures, and Goodell said the requirement of at least $200 million from the NFL was double what league policy allowed.\n\nKroenke also has said St. Louis' economy makes it difficult for an NFL franchise to thrive there.\n\nWe understand the emotions involved of our fans, he said. We made a decision and worked long and hard at the various alternatives. When they didn't succeed, we worked this one to this point.\n\nThe last NFL franchise to move was the Houston Oilers — led by current Rams coach and California native Jeff Fisher — to Tennessee in 1997. The Raiders and Rams both left Los Angeles after the 1994 season.\n\nIt is troubling that the league would allow for the relocation of a team when a home market has worked in good faith and presented a strong and viable proposal, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said. We will review the NFL's decision thoroughly before determining what next steps to take.\n\nGoodell offered the first signal the NFL might be intent on making a decision it delayed six weeks earlier in the Dallas area. Days before the Houston meeting, he issued a report to all 32 teams that deemed the venues in all three existing cities inadequate and questioned the stadium proposals.\n\nThe relocation agreement gives the Chargers and Raiders $100 million each if they build new stadiums in their current markets, but a stadium plan is required within a year.\n\nThe Rams also have to wait at least a year to negotiate naming rights on the new stadium unless they reach a deal with a second team before then.\n\nIt's been going on for like two years that we've been working on this, said Houston owner Bob McNair, who beat out Los Angeles in a bid for an expansion franchise that debuted in 2002. We're quite pleased with the outcome and look forward to the development of a real NFL campus out in Los Angeles.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Josh Dubow in Oakland, California, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL
New York Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán was suspended 81 games for violating Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy, the league announced Thursday.\n\nMy office has completed its investigation into the allegations that Domingo Germán violated Major League Baseball's Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy, commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. Having reviewed all of the available evidence, I have concluded that Mr. Germán violated our Policy and that discipline is appropriate.\n\nMLB said Germán is not appealing the suspension and he will make a contribution to Sanctuary for Families, a New York-based non-profit that helps victims of domestic violence.\n\nGermán will miss the first 63 games of the 2020 season, retroactive to nine regular season and nine postseason games he missed at the end of the 2019 season.\n\nThe 27-year-old was 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 143 innings in 2019 before being placed on administrative leave by the league in September.
Sudhin Thanawala\n\nAssociated Press\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. – A U.S. judge in California on Sunday blocked Trump administration rules, which would allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control, from taking effect in 13 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nJudge Haywood Gilliam granted a request for a preliminary injunction by California, 12 other states and Washington, D.C. The plaintiffs sought to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled on Monday while a lawsuit against them moved forward.\n\nBut Gilliam limited the scope of the ruling to the plaintiffs, rejecting their request that he block the rules nationwide.\n\nThe changes would allow more employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost contraceptive coverage to women by claiming religious objections. Some private employers could also object on moral grounds.\n\nCalifornia and the other states argue that women would be forced to turn to state-funded programs for birth control and experience unintended pregnancies.\n\nOpinion:Trump's new Title X plan requires ineffective birth control most women don't want\n\nOpinion:New contraception rule is balanced\n\nThe law couldn't be more clear – employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Sunday. Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said in court documents the rules protect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.\n\nAt issue is a requirement under President Barack Obama's health care law that birth control services be covered at no additional cost. Obama officials included exemptions for religious organizations. The Trump administration expanded those exemptions and added moral convictions as a basis to opt out of providing birth control services.\n\nAt a hearing on Friday, Gilliam said the changes would result in a substantial number of women losing birth control coverage, which would be a massive policy shift.\n\nThe judge previously blocked an interim version of the rules – a decision that was upheld in December by an appeals court.
Thomas Maresca\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nMANILA — Sammer Torculas had just returned home from playing with his children outside in Pandacan, a lower-middle-class district in the Philippine capital, when he heard a knock at the door.\n\nSeveral men with guns drawn stormed into the house.\n\nThe target of the incident Dec. 7 was Torculas' mother — an admitted dealer of shabu, the local name for crystal meth. Torculas' girlfriend, Chilotte Flaviano, took their five kids into the bedroom. She heard loud voices, then gunfire.\n\nTorculas, 27, died, struck by eight bullets on the street. Police said he fired first, but Flaviano insisted Torculas didn't own a gun. His mother was arrested.\n\nLike many cases in the Philippines' war on drugs, details are murky, and no official police report has been produced. All that is left behind is fear over how Flaviano will raise the young children.\n\nWhat are my options right now? she asked. I'm the only one left.\n\nDuterte backs off claim he tossed man from helicopter — sort of\n\nSimilar scenes have played out here and in other cities under President Rodrigo Duterte's controversial drug war. The total body count of suspected drug dealers or users tops 6,000. More than 2,000 were killed in police operations, and the other 4,000 died in vigilante or extrajudicial killings.\n\nDuterte has made the drug war his signature issue. After taking office June 30, he vowed to clean up the problem in six months. He recently told a local news station that he had miscalculated and that the problem was larger than he realized. He vowed to continue the drug war until the last pusher is out in the streets, until the last drug lord is killed.\n\nThe spate of killings has drawn condemnation from human rights groups that contend many of the deaths amount to illegal executions.\n\nDuterte — who boasted to the BBC in December that he personally killed three suspects while mayor of the southern city of Davao — has remained defiant. He called the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein an idiot for suggesting the president be investigated for murder after that admission.\n\nAs nightly images on television show bodies lying in the streets, public support for Duterte's approach is strong. A poll in December by Philippine research group Social Weather Stations found 85% of Filipinos were satisfied with the anti-drug operations.\n\nBut 78% of respondents said they feared that they or someone they know would be killed in the wave of extrajudicial killings. There have been numerous news accounts of bystanders killed in shootouts or unrelated killings taking place under the cover of Duterte's drug war.\n\nOne widely publicized example was the killing of Mark Anthony Culata, 27, in October in the town of Tanza in Cavite. Culata's body was found mutilated, taped up and bearing a sign that read, I am a pusher.\n\nCulata had no record of drug use and was scheduled to head back to Saudi Arabia, where he worked. A surveillance video showed him being picked up by police, and many in his family are convinced his death was connected to a jealous policeman who was dating Culata's ex-girlfriend.\n\nEva Culata, the slain man's mother, said the family didn't want his name to be forgotten. We want to seek justice for Mark, she said. He does not deserve to die like this.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation, the Philippine's FBI, is looking into the incident, and four policemen from the town were suspended in September.\n\nPolice and criminal violence predates Duterte's presidency, according to Philippine Sen. Richard Gordon, who led a judicial committee that cleared Duterte of culpability for the extrajudicial killings in December. Gordon said the president's rhetoric inflames the violence, but its roots run deeper.\n\nI think people have missed the point that our system is rotten, Gordon said. The whole prosecution system is rotten. The whole investigation system is rotten. There's not enough money for more investigators. There's not enough money for crime laboratories. There's too many passes being issued to people who do crime, and that's what gives them impunity.\n\nThe public's distrust and frustration with the system allows Duterte's message to resonate, said John Gershman, a professor of public service at New York University and an expert on the Philippines.\n\nI think he's effectively tapped into this dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system, Gershman said.\n\nPerhaps the biggest question looming over Duterte's drug war is whether he will win it. Duterte claims the country of 102 million has 4 million drug users and is in danger of turning into a narco-state. Many drug policy experts say that without a public health approach to addiction, drugs and crime will not go away.\n\nYou can't kill your way out of this problem or jail your way out of this problem, said Sanho Tree, director of the drug policy program at the Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank in Washington. You can temporarily drive down the market or suppress it, but the moment you let up the pressure — because you haven't treated these people — it's going to cause a huge backlash.\n\nA comparison can be drawn to nearby Thailand, which launched a crackdown on drugs in 2003, killing 2,800 people during the first three months of a campaign by then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The campaign initially reduced drug consumption, but the prison population soared, and methamphetamine use rose again.\n\nThai Justice Minister Paiboon Koomchaya recently proposed that meth be taken off the list of dangerous narcotics, saying measures to suppress drug use have failed.\n\nOnce Duterte has driven away or killed a lot of these gang members, he's creating turf wars that eventually will come back to haunt him and haunt Philippine society in my opinion, Tree said.\n\nMany living in drug-ravaged neighborhoods in Manila said they feel safer. Others who have seen the violence up close were fearful.\n\nI'm afraid now, Flaviano said. Anyone could be a victim. ... All of a sudden, you could be next.
Baby boomers should be hanging it up and kicking back.\n\nInstead, they're still driving U.S. job growth.\n\nAmericans 55 and over made up about half of all employment gains in 2018, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by The Liscio Report, a research publication for investors. That's an eye-popping share considering that demographic made up only a quarter of last year's labor force -- which includes people working and looking for jobs.\n\nOf the 2.9 million new jobs recorded by Labor's survey of households last year, 1.4 million were taken by people 55 and over. And in December, 39.2 percent of Americans in that age group were working, the largest portion since 1961, according to the monthly employment report Labor released on Friday.\n\nAmong the factors behind the numbers: Older people want to work longer. The low, 3.9 percent unemployment rate provides them more opportunities as businesses struggle to find qualified job candidates. And lots of workers are simply aging into the 55-and-older bracket while many prime age-Americans remain sidelined.\n\nYou have an aging workforce, says economist Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics.\n\nIt's not that baby boomers aren't also retiring in droves. An estimated 10,000 a day are calling it quits. It's just that the group is so large that enough are staying in, or returning to, the workforce to provide a welcome labor supply in a tight market.\n\nAfter being on Social Security disability for five years, Janene Evans, 55, of Bozeman, Montana, decided to get a part-time job as a Walmart cashier in 2018 to earn some extra money. Although her disability paycheck rose 2.9 percent last year, she also faced a higher health insurance premium.\n\nBozeman area employers are having difficulty finding employees, Evans says, adding that Walmart managers were disappointed that she couldn't work full-time. Help-wanted signs are up everywhere.\n\nAfter putting in four weeks last spring, she quit the $11.50-an-hour job because it was too physically taxing, she says.\n\nMore Money:Sears liquidation threat looms: Retailer's fate hangs in balance at bankruptcy hearing\n\nMore Money:Starbucks releases a new winter drink, the Cinnamon Shortbread Latte\n\nMore Money:Once nation's top retailer, Sears may soon be shutdown. A timeline of its rise and fall\n\nOverall, older workers are changing the dynamics of the American workplace. While their knowledge and skills make many more productive, others may be less adaptable and savvy about new technology, Koropeckyj says.\n\nAARP Vice President Susan Weinstock says older workers bring soft skills gained over a lifetime of work, like calm under the pressure, ability to solve complex problems, ability to listen and be empathetic. These are uniquely human skills that a computer or a robot can't replace.\n\nWhy older Americans are accounting for so many job gains:\n\nChoosing to work longer\n\nAbout a third of middle-aged Americans plan to work part-time and another 4 percent intend to work full-time after age 65, according to an Ipsos/USA Today survey in 2017.\n\nMany baby boomers can do so because they're healthier and better-educated than their predecessors, allowing them to continue working in white-collar jobs that don't take a big physical toll, Koropeckyj says.\n\nAnd since they're living longer, they'll need a bigger nest egg to fund their retirements, especially since the number of employers providing pensions has been steadily shrinking, says Jennifer Schramm, senior strategic policy advisor for AARP Public Policy Institute. The Great Recession compounded the problem by hammering the retirement savings of many older workers, Schramm says.\n\nThe 2007-09 downturn also left many boomers unemployed. When they finally did get jobs, many had to accept lower-level positions for less pay.\n\nMany seniors are having a hard time making ends meet and find they have to work when they had not planned to, says Dean Baker, cofounder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nThat wasn't the issue for Gregory Siegelman, 61, who was laid off from his job as a marketing vice president in 2014. Although he couldn't land another marketing position, he realized he had lost his passion for the field and could afford to retire. But he was bored.\n\nHow much golf can you play? Siegelman asks. How many trips can you take?\n\nI knew I had more juice left in me, he says, and so he sought a job teaching marketing at area colleges. He was repeatedly turned down until he finally snared a full-time job teaching marketing at Western Kentucky University that began in fall 2017.\n\nWhile the position pays about a third of his former salary, it allows him to avoid tapping his retirement savings and delay going on Social Security, a strategy that will increase his monthly Social Security payments.\n\nI love helping the kids, he says. I enjoy being up on stage. I enjoy sharing my knowledge.\n\nEmployers are struggling to find workers\n\nWith unemployment at 3.9 percent, it has gotten harder for employers to find qualified workers. In October, there were a near-record 7.1 million job openings but just 6 million unemployed workers, Labor figures show. As a result, more employers are willing to hire and accommodate older Americans by letting them work from home, for example.\n\nThat has drawn in more older workers. The share of 55-to-64 year-olds in the workforce increased to 65.5 percent in December from 64.5 percent a year earlier, Koropeckyj notes. And the portion of 65-and-older Americans in the labor force averaged 19.6 percent last year, the highest in decades, according to AARP and Labor.\n\nLots of baby boomers\n\nThe increasing presence of older Americans in the job market can at least partly be explained by the sheer size of the boomer generation. There are about 73 million boomers and many of the youngest ones recently entered the 55-plus bracket. That age group accounted for about half of the total 2.6 million increase in the U.S. labor force last year, according Moody's and Labor.\n\nMeanwhile, many Americans in their prime working years, age 25 to 54, were laid off during the Great Recession and went on disability or succumbed to the opioid crisis, Koropeckyj says. The share of prime-age Americans in the labor force has edged higher in recent years but remains below prerecession levels.\n\nHoliday hiring\n\nAt least part of the surge in older workers last year seems to be related to strong seasonal hiring for temporary jobs in November and December. Employment for those 55 and over increased by 342,000 in that period, the largest two-month total since last spring.\n\nMore Money:December jobs report: 312,000 added, easing recession fears amid stock turmoil\n\nMore Money:From California to New York, states are raising minimum wages in 2019 for 17 million workers\n\nMore Money:Financial planning: How to meet your money goals in 2019
Kaila White\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX — It was hard enough when he was diagnosed with leukemia in June 2014 and went through radiation, chemotherapy, a bone-marrow transplant and eight months of isolation.\n\nStephen Dwyer said his first sense of relief came when he was healthy enough to go back to school for his senior year. The second, a month later, came when he began swimming again.\n\nBut then there was another blow. Dwyer was the student-body president for the Class of 2016 at Dobson High School in Mesa, Ariz., when school officials refused to let him participate in graduation in May because he was 2.5 credits short of graduation requirements.\n\nNow, six months later after finishing an extra semester, he's finally graduated and closing the door on the most challenging 2 ½ years of his life.\n\nLast semester was very difficult, Dwyer said Tuesday morning before an appointment at Phoenix Children's Hospital. It's been nice to feel like that chapter's over.\n\nStudent leader with leukemia views graduation from afar\n\nIsolated once, then again\n\nWhen Dwyer returned to school in August 2015, he was on the varsity swim team, a member of the National Honor Society, and earning a 4.2 GPA his first semester back. He added an A-hour class before first period to help catch up, but it wasn't enough.\n\nIn May, district officials allowed Dwyer only to usher his classmates onto the football field and then watch from the stands. The incident drew national outrage and debate on his behalf.\n\nDwyer said being left out of graduation felt like medical isolation all over again, leaving him alone to watch the fun through social media.\n\nI still have a lot of anger, said his mother, Trish Dwyer. I've watched just these awful things happen to him and how he fought and fought and fought, and to have some adults make a decision to isolate him again, it's pretty hard, as a mom, to take.\n\nMaking up for lost experiences\n\nTo replace the graduation ceremony he lost, family and friends gathered for a small celebration Friday. Arizona Diamondbacks player Paul Goldschmidt spoke at the ceremony.\n\nDwyer's bone-marrow donor, James Doyle, flew in from Wisconsin to meet him for the first time.\n\nIt was really cool ... it felt like we all knew him, Dwyer said.\n\nNow, he and his family are waiting to hear on a district committee's report at the end of the month that could change school policy to allow students like him to participate in graduation.\n\nAdvocating for others\n\nThe district set up a commencement ceremony task force that has been meeting regularly during the fall semester. Membership included principals, advisers, parents and students. Its recommendation/report to the board should be ready by the end of January, said Mesa Public Schools spokeswoman Helen Hollands on Monday.\n\nTrish Dwyer said, We can't change what happened, but I don't want it to happen to anyone else.\n\nStudent leader with leukemia barred from graduation walk\n\nHer husband, Rick, was on the committee, and she said she hopes the district will change its policy to reviewing students' situations case by case and make exceptions when necessary.\n\nI just know a lot of other teens that are not in school right now and some of them aren't student-body presidents, some of them don't have a social-media presence like Stephen did and so I think, 'What's going to happen to those kids?' \n\nLooking forward to college\n\nStephen Dwyer's road to normalcy has gotten smoother along the way. In August, he was well enough to travel to Hawaii with his family to learn how to surf with the pros, courtesy of Make-A-Wish Arizona.\n\nIt was the first time the five of us did something together where we really didn't have a care in the world, Trish Dwyer said. For Rick and I as parents, we saw a lot of healing take place for our three kids.\n\nIn October he celebrated, cancer-free, his second rebirthday, the day he received his transplant. In November, he swam in the state swimming and diving championships.\n\nAnd in December, just before graduating, he was admitted and earned a scholarship to Lake Forest College, a private liberal-arts college 30 miles north of Chicago.\n\nThere he hopes to swim competitively and major in business. One day, he wants to start an organization to help athletes return to competitive health, both physically and emotionally, after setbacks such as cancer.\n\nI'm more just looking forward to starting a new chapter, and I think part of that is going to college out of state because I don't have to be the cancer survivor, he said. I can just be who I am, so I'm excited for that.\n\nFollow Kaila White on Twitter: @kailawhite
Chris Truax\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden filled out he last of his big four Cabinet positions by choosing Judge Merrick Garland as his attorney general. Judge Garland has spent the last 25 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the most important appellate court in the country, where he established a reputation for careful, thoughtful and centrist jurisprudence. Before that, Garland spent a few years at the Justice Department, where he helped supervise several high-profile domestic terrorism investigations and prosecutions, including the cases of the reclusive, terrifying Unabomber and the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people in 1995. All this gives him a solid background for an attorney general.\n\nMost federal appellate judges aren't well-known by the general public. But Garland's name is familiar because in 2016, President Barack Obama named him to fill Justice Antonin Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court — only to have his nomination languish for 293 days and eventually expire. Obama viewed Garland as distinguished enough and centrist enough to satisfy Republican senators who controlled the Senate and were still mourning the loss of Scalia, an intellectual powerhouse of judicial conservatism.\n\nOne of Biden team's toughest jobs\n\nThat didn't work out as planned, but Obama was right about Garland being no wild-eyed radical. He's a moderate and more inclined to fix things than to break them. And there's a lot to fix. In one sense he's been handed one of the toughest jobs in the Biden administration. No department suffered more norm-bending and institutional stress than the Justice Department under President Donald Trump.\n\nIn another sense, Garland's job is easy. To be successful, he need only surpass a very low Barr. He could spend his entire tenure in his office playing Words with Friends and still be counted as a wise and visionary leader by comparison with former Attorney General William Barr. As Biden said Thursday at a press conference with Garland, You won't work for me. You are not the president or the vice-president's lawyer.\n\nBut restoring and safeguarding Justice Department independence does require creating new mechanisms to ensure that independence, and this will require a great deal of thoughtful, detailed effort. Traditionally, we've relied on appropriate restraint by the president and the integrity of Justice Department lawyers to shield our justice system from political interference. That combination is no longer reliable.\n\nStraight talk:Trump is an enemy of democracy and his Capitol enablers are co-conspirators\n\nWhile Justice Department lawyers were usually able to hold the line, the constant assaults by a president determined to turn the Justice Department into a tool for his personal political interests has taken a real toll. It will fall to the new attorney general to come up with new mechanisms and procedures that protect the Justice Department from improper interference while complying with the Constitution. It's a complicated balance and not as easy as you might think.\n\nClearing away the Trump rubble\n\nIt is also a task at which Judge Garland should excel. His writings show him to be careful and thoughtful. His 25 years on the D.C. Court of Appeals, which handles cases involving Congress and many government agencies, have given him deep experience with the constitutional nuts and bolts of our system of government. And there is no question that he understands both the problem and the stakes.\n\nGarland, calling his return to the Department of Justice a kind of homecoming, read off a to-do list of basic hygiene — guaranteeing the independence of the department from partisan influence in law enforcement investigations, regulating communications with the White House, establishing guidelines for FBI investigations, ensuring respect for the professionalism of DOJ's lawyers and agents and setting out principles to guide the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nAssault on democracy:Donald Trump and his supporters are trying to burn down America. But they won't win.\n\nOf course, Biden will want his new attorney general to have a hand in criminal justice reform, climate change, immigration and a whole host of other important issues. But it's clear that the Biden administration has a lot of pick and shovel work ahead of it clearing away the rubble left behind by Trump and rebuilding the foundations of our democracy before we can spend a lot of effort on building policy castles in the air.\n\nThis seemed to be on Biden's mind when he announced Garland's nomination and named committing ourselves to the rule of law and invigorating our domestic and democratic institutions as two of his administration's top priorities. Biden also reminded everyone that the Justice Department was originally founded to fight domestic terrorism after the Civil War. After a pro-Trump mob's attack Wednesday on the Capitol, it looks like Judge Garland's experience prosecuting domestic terrorism will come in handy.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego, is a legal adviser for Republicans for the Rule of Law and The Guardrails of Democracy Project, CEO of CertifiedVoter.com and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
Christopher Elliott\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nLike many travelers, Rob Voss didn't want to overpay when he booked a room in Kansas City recently. But like many travelers, Voss was foiled by the fine print.\n\nHotels.com displayed a rate at the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Kansas City $8 lower than Marriott.com. But Marriott's best-rate guarantee was too tempting to pass up. Look no further, it urged him. If he found a rate advertised elsewhere for less, they'd refund the difference plus 25%.\n\nYou probably don't need me to tell you that the travel industry is always looking for creative ways to persuade you to pay extra for your flights, hotels and rental cars. But you, like Voss, probably thought the best rate guarantee was a reliable safeguard. It turns out there are few ways to ensure you've paid the lowest price, and the best-rate guarantee isn't one one of them.\n\nAfter he submitted a claim, a Marriott representative turned down Voss' request for a refund. He'd dotted every i, and crossed every t, even taking screen shots of the Hotels.com site to prove it was offering a lower rate.\n\nThey said they couldn't verify the Hotels.com price, says Voss, a retired air traffic controller from Chicago. Of course they couldn't.\n\nA Marriott representative said its rate guarantee is legit, but comes with a few restrictions. Special rates don't qualify and it must be able to independently verify the price. In his case, Voss booked a special AAA rate on the Marriott site, and the hotel couldn't confirm the Hotels.com price.\n\nBest-rate and best-fare guarantees are notoriously hard to invoke, say industry-watchers. It is definitely frustrating when companies promote a seemingly consumer-friendly policy, because they know that in practice they'll make it so difficult that nobody will actually be able to take advantage of it, says Dan Miller, a loyalty program blogger based in Cincinnati.\n\nMiller knows what he's talking about: It took him five tries before Best Western finally fulfilled his request to honor a rate through its guarantee.\n\nDealNews' Jared Blank agrees that best-rate guarantees can be an effective tool — when they work.\n\nIf you believe you've found a fare or rate that qualifies for a match from a best-rate guarantee, you can save yourself a ton of time and trouble by reading exactly what the provider wants from you to prove you qualify for the price match, he says.\n\nBesides asking a company to honor a guarantee that's undermined by fine print, there are two proven strategies for dealing with worst-price problems.\n\nOne is to throw technology at the problem. Remember, the other side is already using sophisticated computer systems designed to predict how much you're willing to pay. These yield management systems give travel companies an edge. So why not use similar technology to give you the edge?\n\nWell, you can. For example, Hopper.com just unveiled an improved when to fly calendar that helps you instantly identify the cheapest months and days to travel from your home airport to your destination. Think of it as yield management in reverse. It also has a price predictor that tries to forecast future fares based on historical pricing data. Hopper claims that in 95% of cases, following the price predictor's advice will land you a cheaper flight.\n\nAnother site that can help is Yapta.com (accessible via Kayak at my.yapta.com/airline-refunds). The service tracks your flight or hotel rate after you've booked, and lets you know if there's a lower price. For example, Alaska Airlines will offer a refund if any of its prices drop after you've booked, and JetBlue and Virgin America will offer a refund if there's a price drop of $75 or more.\n\nBut can you actually automate the search for the lowest prices, in the same way travel companies harness entire server farms to do their bidding? Kind of. InvisibleHand (getinvisiblehand.com) is an app that runs on your desktop and searches for the lowest prices on hotels, flights, rental cars and other products, such as electronics. True to its name, InvisibleHand doesn't pop up until it finds something, and even then, it displays the results discreetly at the top of your browser.\n\nUse the technology at your disposal to make sure you never have to file a best rate guarantee claim (see below). Shop hard before you push the buy button — and then stop fretting. After all, you got a pretty good deal.\n\nBest rate 'gotchas' you need to know\n\nYou probably knew that best-fare and best-rate guarantees are filled with exceptions. But did you know? …\n\n• The clock's ticking. Not only do you have 24 hours to file a claim, but the claim must also be made a full day before you travel, in some cases. So don't wait.\n\n• It has to match exactly. If you're booking a hotel and want to invoke an online travel agency's best-price guarantee, you have to match the room type, rate and cancellation policy. For airlines, it must be the same cabin class, booking code and cancellation policy. Good luck.\n\n• Don't forget taxes and fees. Airfare claims can be tricky because some travel agency websites display fares that don't include all taxes and fees. When you think you've got a better fare, you might want to check the extras -- they need to be included or you can't file a valid claim.\n\nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate and editor at large for National Geographic Traveler.

Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland — Actor Matt Damon appeared to give President-elect Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt Wednesday over whether he will help break the cycle of global poverty that arises from lack of safe water and sanitation.\n\nWe can work with anybody. It remains to be seen what (Trump's) relationship to foreign aid is, what his feelings about that are, Damon said in an interview with USA TODAY on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.\n\nDamon, 46, star of the Bourne movie series, was attending the week-long event to raise awareness about the 663 million people worldwide who lack access to safe water and the 2.4 billion people who don't have access to a bathroom. In 2009 he founded the non-profit Water.org with civil and environmental engineer Gary White.\n\nThe organization raises funds to micro-finance loans for people in impoverished communities around the world to establish hygienic connections to water and toilets. Water.org says that a child dies from a water-related disease every 90 seconds and that diarrhea is the third-leading cause of childhood death.\n\nWe tried to get with the best people we could find, on a solvable problem said Ricardo Tadeu, a senior executive for Anheuser-Busch InBev in Africa, who has been appearing at the forum this year with White and Damon.\n\nWe don't see our role here (at the World Economic Forum) as being part of a global elite. We see it as trying to help get the poorest of the poor a seat at the table, Damon said.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday, the American actor said he has never met Trump and wasn't sure what his relationship with the developing world would be. His interest has been in high-end golf courses and hotels. ... At a certain point our work isn't dependent on the political winds and we just have to keep doing the work that we're doing, Damon said.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has a $23 billion budget for 2017. While Water.org has largely had bipartisan support, its work does not rely on foreign aid. Trump has consistently expressed an America-first preference for global problems. On Wednesday, Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, faces his Senate confirmation hearing. He has called for eliminating the EPA.\n\nUSAID said it was providing information and briefings to Trump's transition team. We are ensuring that the president-elect's transition team has the tools and resources necessary for a smooth and efficient transition, the organization said in a statement.\n\nThe poor that we are trying to bring these services to are so disenfranchised and they face so many struggles that the last thing that's really going to have a direct impact on their lives is who is in our White House, White said. I am hopeful that our foreign policy can be shaped in a way that can eventually have some trickle-down effect on these lives, but right now they are living in crisis. There's a million of them dying every year because of lack of access to water and sanitation, he added.\n\nThat number didn't change much whether it was George W. Bush or President Obama, and it might not change much with Trump, he said.\n\nMORE DAVOS COVERAGE:\n\nBiden at Davos: Russia is greatest threat to democracy\n\nIn Davos, Anthony Scaramucci volunteers for 'Trump translation' duty\n\nDavos: China's Xi invokes Gettysburg Address in defense of free trade
LONDON — Slavery is thriving in the United Kingdom, as authorities try to battle a growing problem.\n\nBritain's National Crime Agency said cases of forced labor affect every large town and city in the country.\n\nA government estimate of 13,000 victims in the U.K. is the tip of the iceberg, according to Britain's anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland. He called for tighter regulation of nail salons in the country — some of which are sites of forced labor.\n\nThis is a really complicated crime, said Rachel Harper, manager of the national Modern Slavery Helpline, a free 24/7 service for victims and those who want to help them report crimes. It's incredibly intense and traumatic.\n\nThree people who forced Vietnamese women and girls to work at nail bars in different parts of the county were jailed this week under human trafficking and modern slavery legislation.\n\nMore:Report: There are 40 million slaves worldwide, most are women and girls\n\nThu Huong Nguyen, 49, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, Viet Hoang Nguyen, 30, got four years, and Giang Huong Tran, 23, was given a two-year suspended sentence.\n\nThe victims worked for no money and were trafficked between nail bars according to demand, state prosecutor Eran Cutliffe said. They were hidden from the authorities in order to avoid detection while being exploited in plain sight within our society.\n\nPolice said it was the first successful prosecution for child labor exploitation and child trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act of 2015. The victims include girls under 18 who were smuggled into the country, beaten and verbally abused.\n\nMore:How trucking companies that cheat drivers dodge penalties\n\nMore:Forced into debt.Worked past exhaustion.Left with nothing.\n\nIn one well-publicized case that shocked many Britons last year, 11 members of one family were found guilty of forcing vulnerable men with learning disabilities and homeless men to work and live in squalid conditions for up to 16 years.\n\nThe National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said child slaves from countries including Vietnam, Romania, Nigeria and Afghanistan are being forced to work at cannabis farms and commit street crimes in Britain.\n\nMost slaves are trafficked to the U.K. from other countries and forced to work in agriculture, construction, hospitality, manufacturing and car washes. Many women and girls are trafficked for sexual exploitation.\n\nThe national Modern Slavery Helpline was set up by Unseen, a British charity that works toward ending slavery globally.\n\nIt began taking calls in October 2016. Since then, it has dealt with more than 1,000 cases of modern slavery, said Harper.\n\nHarper said the abuses may have been going on for years but only now have come to light because of better reporting.\n\nWas all of that happening two years ago and we didn't know, or is it actually happening more often? she said. I think it's been more prevalent than we realized and awareness is growing.\n\nWorldwide, there were more than 40 million victims of slavery in 2016, with women and girls making up 71%, the United Nation's International Labor Organization's (ILO) Global Estimates of Modern Slavery 2017 report said.\n\nIn the United States, Polaris, an organization that helps human-trafficking victims, said many workers at restaurants, food trucks and bars lured to the country from other nations are forced into a form of slavery, working long hours, living in cramped arrangements and forced into debt.\n\nA USA TODAY network investigation last year found that hundreds, if not thousands, of truckers are working as indentured servants.\n\nA video that emerged late last year showing west African men apparently being sold into slavery in Libya caused global outrage.\n\nILO figures show that forced labor in the global economy generates $150 billion in illegal profits a year.\n\nPope Francis has rallied against such abuses.\n\nEvery year, thousands of men, women and children are innocent victims of labor and sexual exploitation and organ trafficking, he said. It seems that we are so accustomed to it that we consider it a normal thing. This is ugly, cruel, criminal! I would like to call on everyone to counter this aberrant plague, a form of modern slavery.\n\nHarper stressed the importance of collaboration between the Home Office, immigration policy officials, police, service providers, businesses and others. I do not think that we can prosecute our way out of it, she said.\n\nDetective Inspector Charlotte Tucker, who helped prosecute the nail salon gang, described the case as desperately sad.\n\nAs a community, we need to look out for the warning signs and do our part to stop this archaic practice once and for all, she said.
Stephanie Ramirez\n\nWUSA-TV, Washington\n\nWASHINGTON — In the wake of a media investigation that revealed a culture of grade changing to increase graduation rates at a Washington, D.C., high school, the city's own independent investigation, released Tuesday, essentially backed those claims.\n\nIn November, NPR and WAMU-FM reported that more than half of 2017 graduates at Frank W. Ballou Senior High School were passed despite extensive absences.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered the city's investigation in December.\n\nThe report by D.C. consulting firm Alvarez and Marsal found that of the 188 students who graduated from Ballou last year, 113 of them, or 63.8% had graduated with the assistance of these policy violations. The students benefited from a total of 222 policy violations.\n\nMore:School board gets death threats after teacher handcuffed after questioning pay raise\n\nThe report described policy violations as actions like giving a student a grade of 50% on assignments they may have missed or did not complete.\n\nAnother violation, according to the report as reported by the Washington Post, was that Ballou students were enrolled in credit-recovery classes while they were still taking the original course. The Post said credit recovery allowed students to retake a class they previously failed. The students could enroll only if they had already failed the class.\n\nThe report also indicated the involvement of the principal and assistant principals.\n\nBallou administrators communicated high passing percentage expectations to teachers. These expectations were communicated directly to teachers from the Principal to the Assistant Principals in person, via staff meetings, and via email, and were formalized in the Ballou IMPACT rubric, the report said.\n\nMore:White teacher who told black student he would be 'lynched' will not be suspended or fired\n\nDuring a news conference Tuesday, Bowser, D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Antwan Wilson and Hanseul Kang, the D.C. state superintendent of Education, were asked why it took nearly six months after whistleblowers came forward and the NPR-WAMU investigation to get a response from the schools chancellor.\n\nLet's be clear about what I said, said Bowser, it didn't work. It didn't get to the decision maker and that's what we had to fix, and that's what we have to focus on fixing…\n\nAt another point Tuesday, Bowser said, We rolled out a policy in the 2015-2016 school year intended to raise the bar in our school district (academically) and ensure students were set-up for success. However, we've never really put in place the training controls or accountability to support it.\n\nCity Councilman Trayon White, a Ballou graduate who represents Ward 8 in southeast D.C. where the school is located, is concerned for the school's students.\n\nMore:School's homework asked for 3 'good,' 3 bad reasons for slavery\n\nI think if people are talking about your school across the nation through media, sometimes it's a negative perception. So if you're trying to go to college, or you're trying to get a job and that's on your transcript, uh, you think that, 'Maybe I won't get in because of negative stereotypes related my school.' So we must continue to show that there are great students coming out of Ballou Senior High School, said White.\n\nBallou's principal, Yetunde Reeves, was removed from her position after the independent audit was ordered. According to the Washington Post, Reeves will not return to the school. Administrators did say the assistant principal will remain in place.\n\nFollow Stephanie Ramirez on Twitter: @RamirezReports
Associated Press\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska — The death of a man whose plane clipped one building before smashing into another in the heart of downtown Anchorage was a suicide, a spokeswoman for his family said.\n\nThere's no reason to think that Doug Demarest was trying to harm anyone but himself, Jahna Lindemuth said on Friday.\n\nLindemuth is a managing partner at the law firm where Demarest's wife, Katherine Demarest, works. Lindemuth declined to say how the family knew it was a suicide and asked that the family's privacy be respected.\n\nClint Johnson, the Alaska region chief for the National Transportation Safety Board, did not immediately return a New Year's Day call Friday.\n\nDemarest, 42, was flying a plane owned by the Civil Air Patrol Tuesday when he clipped the building that houses the law firm, Dorsey & Whitney, and crashed into an unoccupied commercial building. He died at the scene. No one else was hurt. The crash occurred in the morning, before most businesses opened for the day, in a part of the city surrounded by offices, hotels and restaurants.\n\nAuthorities have said that Demarest, who joined the Civil Air Patrol five years ago, was not authorized to fly the aircraft but they've released few other details.\n\nThe FBI released a statement Wednesday noting that agency policy prevents it from commenting on an active investigation, including confirming or denying reports surrounding this case other than to reiterate there is no indication this was a terrorist act.
BOSTON – On a sunny summer's day at historic Christopher Columbus Park on Boston's waterfront, it's hard to picture the dormant fury of the Atlantic Ocean as it laps softly at the creaking docks.\n\nBut one day, according to the city's climate projections,a massive storm driven by unusually high winds and high tides will pour water over the park's grassy rise and inundate the arbors where grape vines trail and newlyweds pose for photos. The waters will rush across the brick pavers onto Atlantic Avenue and flow toward historic Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, where generations of tourists have learned about the Boston Tea Party. The floodwaters will threaten nearby Old North Church, where Paul Revere's ride kicked off, and lap at the edges of Bunker Hill.\n\nHigh tides and strong storms already regularly inundate the area, but this storm would be different. It's a vision that keeps Boston Mayor Marty Walsh up at night.\n\nThat's why Walsh is preparing to have the city spend billions of dollars over the next decade to try to blunt the effects of climate change on the city, including armoring Columbus Park and gently raising it to provide a buffer against the worst of what the Atlantic can throw.\n\nThe plans to harden Columbus Park and large portions of the city's 47 miles of shoreline are part of a massive but generally uncoordinated local-level effort across the country to fight the changes that will accompany the Earth as it continues warming.\n\nFrustrated by what they see as the Trump administration's decision to de-emphasize the danger posed by climate change, local government officials, nonprofit leaders and university researchers are busily forging ahead with limited resources in a piecemeal approach they say is better than nothing. They're hardening buildings, digging bigger storm drains and changing zoning laws to keep homes from being built in low-lying areas prone to flooding.\n\nWhile many cities and states are also trying to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to slow global warming, these more concrete efforts are aimed at mitigating the actual impacts of climate change, which many elected officials say is politically easier to tackle.\n\nClimate change is real and it's impacting our city right now, said Walsh. We just can't back down from the threat regardless of what's happening in Washington, D.C. I would love to have a strong federal partner. We don't have that right now. But that doesn't mean we stop.\n\nAn exhaustive federal report issued last month warned that climate change could, under a worst-case scenario, deliver a 10 percent hit to the nation's GDP by the end of the century. The 1,600-page National Climate Assessment details the climate and economic impacts U.S. residents will see if drastic action is not taken to address climate change.\n\nPresident Donald Trump downplayed the report's findings, complaining that the United States is already very clean and that other countries aren't addressing climate change.\n\nI've seen it. I've read some of it. It's fine, Trump told reporters at the time. Speaking about the potential economic impacts, Trump said, I don't believe it.\n\nBroad scientific consensus says the Earth's climate is warming, and that humans are accelerating that process though the burning of fossil fuels. Climate change threatens the health and well-being of the American people by causing increasing extreme weather, changes to air quality, the spread of new diseases by insects and pests, and changes to the availability of food and water, the NCA researchers said.\n\nThe report says the changing climate poses a cascading series of linked risks, like storms destroying aging bridges and roads, which will then make it harder to move food and fuel around the country, and droughts making it harder for power plants across the West to safely generate electricity due to a lack of required cooling water. Meanwhile, larger insect populations in northern areas could bring more Lyme, West Nile and Zika infections to areas that were once free of them.\n\nEarth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities, the report concluded.\n\nExperts say the devastating and unusually powerful hurricanes that have struck the East Coast over the past decade have done more than any politician could to raise awareness of just how much risk the nation faces. Heavy flooding in Texas, warming ocean waters in the Pacific Northwest and New England, and eroding islands in Alaska are adding even more weight. Scientists for years have been warning that ocean levels are rising, and that storms will become more violent.\n\nThe number of people having that conversation is larger today than it ever has been in the past, said Mark Misczak, who a longtime emergency manager who spent the bulk of his career as a Federal Emergency Management Agency leader under multiple presidents. The disasters, as terrible as it sounds, provide an opportunity to re-envision how things function and to consider that resiliency.\n\nAcross the country, communities large and small are drawing on university experts and nonprofit scientists to help chart their course, which they say must be laid down to prepare for future climate-related disasters.\n\nSome of the efforts are small, like Denver's decision to create a list of air-conditioned facilities where residents can take refuge during heat waves. Others are more ambitious: In Alaska, officials are preparing to relocate several native villages in danger of being washed away by seas that no longer freeze solid for months at a time. Many more fall into the middle, like the decision by Florida Keys officials to raise up portions of their low-lying roads to serve as flood barriers, or efforts by Austin, Texas, to reduce water consumption in anticipation of droughts in.\n\nIt's really simple: This isn't a political issue. The changes we are seeing firsthand are affecting our communities, our economies, affecting ways of life that have existed for millennia, said Michael LeVine of the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, which has worked on climate change issues in Alaska. We simply don't have a choice. It is incumbent on us as Alaskans to work together. We are past the point of fighting about who did what, who caused what, or what the political consequences might be. Our way of life depends on adapting to the changes that are happening.\n\nFor many, dealing with climate change is inherently a political issue. A December report issued by the state of Texas about the need to future-proof the state from worsening natural disasters never directly mentions climate change, or the role that humans have played in emitting heat-trapping carbon dioxide by burning the oil and gas Texas has long been known for.\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott, in releasing the report, said it was impossible for him to say whether climate change is causing the worsening disasters hitting Texas.\n\nWe need to stop making the old mistakes in local development that expose homes and businesses to risks that only become apparent when disaster strikes, according to the report. To paraphrase the old saying, an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure.\n\nWhile climate change has largely broken down along partisan lines at the state and federal level, the nation's mayors have overwhelmingly put aside political parties to address the issue. A survey of mayors this year found that 57 percent of cities are planning to take climate-related actions in 2019. And dozens of the country's largest cities have committed to meeting the terms of the 2025 Paris Agreement on climate change, which Trump is withdrawing from on a national level.\n\nI think every mayor in the country would say it's their responsibility to do something, said James Brainard, the longtime mayor of Carmel, Indiana. Our mayors are not sitting back. The mayors are the closest elected officials to the people and the mayors can make this happen regardless of what the federal government does.\n\nBrainard, a Republican, said he doesn't consider climate change a political issue, but he acknowledged he sometimes has to tailor his message for different audiences. Liberal groups, for instance, love that the city replaced it's streetlights with LEDs, reducing electricity consumption and therefore the emission of greenhouse gasses. Conservative groups, he said, are usually more interested in the fact that the switch saves the city 20 percent on its electricity bill annually.\n\nNow, Carmel is installing solar panels to generate its own electricity, which will save taxpayers money and ensure the lights are more likely to stay on if a disaster knocks out major power lines outside city boundaries.\n\nEverybody sees local government as the pothole in front of their house, the zoning down the street. They don't think about these global issues, Brainard said. And I think it's the job of local leaders to explain why it's important and to lead on it.\n\nMany local officials say the federal government should play a stronger role in increasing a cohesive strategy to combat the effects of climate change, but find themselves frustrated by Trump's apparent willingness to dismiss scientific concerns. In absence of that leadership, they're forging ahead.\n\nThere's a sense from cities and states across the country that we want to be part of the solution, and that just because the federal government isn't doing it doesn't mean the United States isn't, said Sally Jewell, a former interior secretary in the Obama administration. We're not going to stop and wait for that (Trump administration) priority to change.\n\nJewell is now working at the University of Washington as a distinguished fellow with the College of the Environment and as chair of the advisory council for EarthLab, the university's new institute dedicated to connecting researchers with people on the front lines of climate change and environmental challenges.\n\nEarthLab offers solutions both large and small, including helping Washington state's oyster farmers deal with more acidic oceans by showing them how to adjust the PH level of the water surrounding young oysters, known as spats.\n\nMisczak said local governments often find success when they tie climate-resiliency efforts to impacts on local businesses. And he said that while the federal government can provide leadership, it's usually a series of seemingly small decisions made at the local level that can truly make a difference: Can homes be built in floodplains? How tough is the building code? Are local emergency services designed to operate in an actual emergency? Are emergency generators sitting in basements that could get flooded, or installed atop parking garages, where they'll be better protected?\n\nWe're getting better. But we're not doing enough yet. We're making progress. And the more we can showcase the solutions that have been effective, the more communities will consider building things that way from the start, said Misczak, who is now senior managing director at Witt O'Brien's, an international crisis and emergency response consulting company.\n\nBack in Boston, Walsh is trying to figure out how to get funding for the city's climate resiliency plan. Taxpayers will contribute 10 percent of all new capital funding in the city toward resilience, but the mayor knows he needs more help from businesses, and the state and federal government.\n\nThe city has already installed an approximately $100,000, 7-foot-high barrier in order to block floodwaters from the homes of 4,300 residents and at least 70 businesses in the East Boston neighborhood. The barrier across the East Boston Greenway normally lays flat across the path but can be raised during storms. Boston used to be more protected from storms and high tides by the tidal flats that surrounded the city, but those areas have either been developed on or dredged away to deepen the harbor.\n\nBigger solutions come with bigger price tags: Just fully protecting East Boston, home to Boston Logan International Airport, could cost the city up to $200 million. But city officials say that would ultimately prevent more than $443 million in estimated damage from a large storm. Researchers expect sea levels to rise 36 inches by 2070, leaving Boston with the likelihood of being flooded every month during the highest tide.\n\nThe city's overall climate resiliency plan has no official price tag, but Boston officials say it would pale in comparison to the damage done by a major hurricane: 2012's Superstorm Sandy did at least $32 billion in damage to New York City's streets, subway tunnels, homes and businesses, and killed at least 43 people. And that was just a single storm.\n\nWe're not just planning for the next storm we'll face, we're planning for the storms the next generation will face, Walsh said. Whatever the federal policy is, it's still going to be incumbent on local leaders to carry out these plans. There's no question that our environment is in trouble, and humans are responsible.
WASHINGTON – As the federal government shutdown barrels toward the longest in history Saturday, a handful of Republicans have crossed party lines to vote with Democrats to reopen shuttered agencies.\n\nThe question becomes, how many more might join them?\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to crow about the unwavering support he says he has from Republicans to keep parts of the government closed until Democrats agree to fund a border wall.\n\nThere is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise, the president tweeted Thursday.\n\nBut hours later a few more Republicans defected.\n\nEight House Republicans voted Wednesday to fund the Treasury Department where the IRS is gearing up for tax season. Ten voted Thursday to reopen the agencies that dispense food stamps, run agriculture assistance programs and inspect food and drugs. A dozen Republicans backed continuing funding for the departments of housing and transportation.\n\nGOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., dismissed Thursday's defections as no surprises and said that he wasn't worried about losing support from his caucus.\n\nOur members want to secure the border. Obviously there are a few that aren't there, Scalise said during a briefing with reporters. The vast majority of our conference strongly supports securing the border and strongly supports what the president is doing.\n\nDemocrats, who control the House, will continue to bring up legislation Friday to try to complete funding for the nine departments and several smaller agencies whose budgets ran out Dec. 22.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he will not even consider the bills in his chamber because Trump won't sign them.\n\nThe group of eight House Republicans who voted for all the bills so far includes:\n\nOne who represents more of the southern border than any other member of Congress: Texas Rep. Will Hurd.\n\nTwo who publicly refused to vote for Trump: New York Rep. John Katko and Washington Rep. Jaime Herrera Buetler.\n\nThree who represent the only House districts won by Hillary Clinton that Republicans still hold: Hurd, Katko and Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick.\n\nMost have been willing to buck their party in the past, including on high-profile issues such as opposing GOP efforts to get rid of Obamacare.\n\nBut the group also includes lawmakers like New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has been a rising star in the GOP; Oregon Rep. Greg Walden who represents a district that Trump won by 19 percentage points; and Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, one of the most senior members of the House who has consistently voted with his party on national security issues.\n\nFour other House Republicans – Rodney Davis of Illinois, Peter King of New York, Christopher Smith of New Jersey and Steve Stivers of Ohio – voted for some of the outstanding spending bills.\n\nHere's a look at the eight who joined Democrats on all three bills:\n\n'Costly and unnecessary'\n\nFitzpatrick, a former FBI special agent and federal prosecutor representing a swing district in the southeast corner of Pennsylvania, was first elected in 2016 on a promise of bipartisanship.\n\nIn his first term, he sided with Democrats on about one-quarter of the votes that split the two parties, including opposing Republicans' Obamacare alternative. Fitzpatrick's re-election bid, which he won with 51 percent of the vote, was endorsed by the AFL-CIO and former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who advocates for gun control.\n\nShutdowns are costly and unnecessary, and I will work with both sides to find a solution, Fitzpatrick said last week.\n\nShutdowns are 'ludicrous'\n\nHerrera Beutler's 52.7 percent victorylast fall was the fifth-term representative'sclosest race in her southwest Washington state district.\n\nShe's called the shutdown showdown ludicrous.\n\nThere's a solution at hand, if politicians grow up, stop worrying about which side is 'winning' the political fight (spoiler alert: they're both losing), and deliver results, she recently wrote.\n\nHerrera Beutler, the daughter of a Mexican-American and the great-granddaughter of immigrants, was one of a few Republicans in 2016 to back a Democratic effort to encourage the Defense Department to welcome the service of some illegal immigrants who were brought into the country as children.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Herrera Beutler voted for Paul Ryan instead of Trump. She announced her decision after the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood videotape in which Trump bragged about groping women by their genitals.\n\nExpensive and ineffective\n\nHurd has squeaked by in his three elections in a district dominated by Mexican-Americans. After opposing the border wall, Hurd won re-election in November by fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nHurd, whose Texas district encompasses nearly half of the border with Mexico, has called a wall the most expensive, least effective way to do border security.\n\nThe thing that I've been hearing is they need technology, they need additional manpower, Hurd, a former undercover CIA agent, told NPR Thursday.\n\nFulfilling a promise\n\nKatko was re-elected to a third term with 53 percent, his closest race yet in a predominately rural, swing district in New York that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nKatko crosses party lines more often than most members of the House and is unafraid to do so on big issues. In addition to opposing the GOP health care bill in 2017, he took the rare step last week of voting for Democrats' rules for governing the House. Katko did so because Democrats included changes to make it easier to advance bills with broad bipartisan support.\n\nKatko said his votes to fund the shuttered government agencies are consistent with a promise he made when he first ran for office that I would never vote to shut down the government or to continue a government shutdown.\n\nI am in favor of securing our borders, Katko tweeted, but shutting down the government is never the answer.\n\nShutdowns are 'stupid'\n\nKinzinger was first elected to Congress from Illinois in the tea party-fueled election wave of 2010 that helped Republicans win the House. But he's accused tea party Republicans of making it harder for others to win competitive districts.\n\nKinzinger belongs to groups aimed at bringing together lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to forge bipartisan compromises. In 2015, he joined with Democrats to fund the Department of Homeland Security without including a GOP amendment to undo President Barack Obama's protections for young undocumented immigrants. The amendment would have kept the funding bill from passing the Senate.\n\nI think shutdowns are stupid, Kinzinger recently told CNN. I think it's the dumbest way to do government in the world.\n\nWilling to take party to task\n\nStefanik quickly became a rising star in the Republican Party when, at age 30, she became the then-youngest woman ever elected to Congress.\n\nIn November, Stefanik was re-elected to a third term in her upstate New York district with 56 percent of the vote, after including a shot of Trump campaigning with her in one of her campaign ads. She was also in charge ofrecruiting candidates for House Republicans for last year's midterms. But after the election, Stefanik took her party to task for not doing enough to help elect women and minorities.\n\nStefanik said she's backed bills to fund shuttered government agencies because I oppose government shutdowns and in Congress have consistently voted to keep the government open.\n\nTaking the 'poison out of politics'\n\nUpton's re-election bid for a 17th term was his closest ever, winning with just about half the votes in his southwestern corner of Michigan.\n\nAlthough Upton helped organize a Tuesday Lunch Bunch for Republicans to discuss a centrist agenda, his voting record has been mostly conservative, according to Congressional Quarterly.\n\nBut after his close re-election, Upton called for looking beyond the labels of Democrat and Republican to take this poison out of politics.\n\nOn the government shutdown, Upton said he will continue to work with others to both fully fund the government and secure the border.\n\nMuch work remains, he tweeted.\n\nEmpathy for federal workers\n\nWalden is the only Republican in Congress from Oregon, representing a district that Trump won by 19 percentage points. Although his bid for a 12th term wasn't close, his 57 percent win was his smallest general election victory.\n\nWalden led the campaign arm of House Republicans in the 2014 and 2016 elections and votes with Republicans more than 90 percent of the time. But as the new Congress convened last week, Walden said he looked forward to reaching across the aisle to find bipartisan solutions.\n\nOf his votes to reopen parts of the government, Walden said he has empathy for federal workers and their families caught up in the impasse.\n\nWe know not many people can afford to miss a paycheck, Walden said.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins.
AP\n\nIRVINE, Calif. — A Southern California college student has been found dead in a home near campus and his fraternity has been suspended, authorities said Monday.\n\nNoah Domingo, 18, of La Crescenta, California, was found Saturday near University of California, Irvine. Irvine police received a call around 9:40 a.m. that Domingo was unresponsive and found him dead in a bed at the home, said Kim Mohr, a police spokeswoman.\n\nOrange County coroner's officials said Domingo died six hours earlier. The cause of his death is under investigation.\n\nDomingo was a first-year biological sciences major at the campus in the heart of Orange County, said Tom Vasich, a university spokesman.\n\nDomingo was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, according to the organization.\n\nUC Irvine has placed the fraternity on interim suspension pending the investigation.\n\nThe school declined to release further details but Edgar J. Dormitorio, interim vice chancellor for student affairs, wrote in an email to students that it would closely examine the larger context in which this tragedy occurred and will be working with the Greek community to help ensure that they are engaging in behaviors and practices that are in alignment with university policies and their own values.\n\nThe fraternity said in a statement that the group is heartbroken by Domingo's death.\n\nMore:A fraternity hazing ritual killed our son.

AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — French player Alize Cornet has called for the extreme heat policy at the Australian Open to be re-evaluated after she said she nearly fainted in the broiling temperatures during her third-round match Friday at Melbourne Park.\n\nOther players echoed her concerns, with Rafael Nadal saying playing in such extreme heat can be a little bit dangerous for the health.\n\nHave been very, very tough conditions yesterday and today, said the top-ranked Nadal, who played at night on Friday after the temperatures had dropped. It's not nice to see players suffering that much on court.\n\nThe tournament's extreme heat policy calls for the roofs to be closed on the main show courts and play to be suspended on outer courts when the temperature reaches 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which takes into account humidity and wind speed, reaches 32.5 Celsius (90.5 Fahrenheit).\n\nThe high temperature Friday marginally topped 40 Celsius, but the WBGT remained below the threshold, so play was not halted.\n\nCornet said she began feeling dizzy at the beginning of the second set against Belgium's Elise Mertens and, at one point, fell to her back on the court in obvious distress. She received a medical timeout so a trainer could check her pulse and blood pressure and wrap her in an ice vest before she returned to the court.\n\nCornet was able to finish the match, losing 7-5, 6-4. But she later said it was dangerous to play in that kind of heat.\n\nThe (official) limit of not playing the match is really high. I think this limit should be a little bit lower because playing in this condition is not nice for anyone, she said. I would never give up because of (the heat), that's for sure. But you push your body so hard, you almost feel like you're on the edge.\n\nTournament director Craig Tiley defended the response of officials to the extreme heat on both Thursday and Friday, saying we start the event with this set of rules and policies in place, and in the interest of fairness, can't change them halfway through.\n\nProtecting our players and the fairness of the competition is paramount in these conditions, which we acknowledge can be challenging, he said, adding the extreme heat policy would be reviewed after the tournament to see if adjustments need to be made.\n\nPetra Martic, who won a two-hour, third-round match against Luksika Kumkhum during the hottest part of the day on Friday, said she got blisters on her feet from the sizzling court and had to take painkillers after the second set.\n\nIt's really tough on your feet to play in these conditions, she said. I was hoping they would close (the roof), but the temperature was not high enough. ... So unfortunately it stayed this way.\n\nFrench player Gael Monfils staggered through part of his second-round loss to Novak Djokovic on Thursday, saying he had a small heat stroke for 40 minutes, and likewise described the conditions as a risk to players.\n\nRoger Federer, who requested to play at night to avoid the blistering heat on Thursday, said he believed the officials were doing the best they could under the circumstances.\n\nWhat do you do ... stop all matches? The lucky guys on the big courts, they get to play under the roof. The other guys get postponed till the next day? Is that great? he said. Is everybody going to finish at 3 in the morning, like a rainy day in New York. I've had that, too. Is that better? I'm not sure, honestly.
Dan Caplinger\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nMost U.S. investors don't think much about currency exposure. But foreign exchange plays a major role in global commerce, and as shareholders in multinationals based in the U.S. can attest, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar can have a huge impact on stock prices.\n\nTo help people hedge foreign exchange risk, currency ETFs offer investors direct exposure to changes in currency values. 2017 was a generally weak year for the U.S. dollar, and the performance of some key currency ETFs shows the crosscurrents around the world for the greenback.\n\nCurrency ETFs in 2017\n\nETF 2017 return Guggenheim CurrencyShares Euro Trust (NYSEMKT: FXE) 13% Guggenheim CurrencyShares British Pound Trust (NYSEMKT: FXB) 9.1% Guggenheim CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust (NYSEMKT: FXA) 8.1% WisdomTree Brazilian Real (NYSEMKT: BZF) 6.8% Guggenheim CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (NYSEMKT: FXC) 6.7% Guggenheim CurrencyShares Chinese Renminbi Trust (NYSEMKT: FXCH) 5.1% Guggenheim CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust (NYSEMKT: FXF) 3.3% Guggenheim CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSEMKT: FXY) 3.2%\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nHow these currency ETFs gave investors foreign exchange exposure\n\nThe way currency ETFs generally work is fairly simple. The underlying fund opens positions in the underlying foreign currency, either through direct short-term investments or by using futures contracts. The value of the positions moves up or down in line with the appreciation or depreciation of the specified foreign currency, less any expenses that the fund bears. For the CurrencyShares funds above, one share of a currency ETF is equivalent to a fixed amount of currency, although that amount has fallen over time because of the need for the funds to pay expenses from their own resources. Low interest rates have meant that the income that these funds produce internally is insufficient to cover expenses in some cases.\n\nWhy the dollar sank in 2017\n\nA look at returns for these ETFs shows the prevailing trends across the global economy. The euro surged in 2017, largely due to stronger economic growth for the eurozone than most analysts had anticipated coming into the year. Brexit-related concerns that elections in key countries like France and Germany would potentially bring in anti-euro leaders proved unwarranted, and geopolitical pressures combined with less accommodative interest rate policy in the U.S. has made the European currency more attractive by comparison.\n\nMany of the same factors helped lift the British pound as well. Manufacturing activity in the U.K. has been relatively strong, and the fact that the Brexit decision hasn't led to widespread economic disruptions as initially feared has lent greater stability to the market.\n\nMeanwhile, recoveries in commodity prices have helped strengthen economies that rely heavily on natural resources. Currency prices in Brazil, Australia, and Canada had all suffered when prices of oil and various precious and industrial metals had fallen in past years, but the recovery in crude and the boom in many base metals have helped lead to a recovery for the three currencies.\n\nOn the Pacific Rim, initial projections had expected dollar weakening against currencies in Japan and China as well, but the damage was not nearly as substantial as some had feared. Gains in economic strength haven't been as substantial in Asia as they have been in Europe, and so cross-currency trading between the euro and the major Asian currencies has helped keep exchange rate gains in U.S. dollar terms somewhat in check. The same impact helped hold the Swiss franc down, with efforts to prevent its appreciation against the euro in past years finally leading to a shift back down toward the relative levels that had prevailed before 2015.\n\nKeep your eyes on currency in 2018\n\nRelatively few investors buy shares of currency ETFs, and the risks involved aren't so strong as to make hedging investments required for ordinary investors. Knowing what's happening in foreign exchange markets is nevertheless helpful to understand the impacts on many key players in the global economy.\n\nDan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

© Copyright 2020, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa – Sen. Bernie Sanders leads the Democratic field three weeks ahead of Caucus Day in Iowa – narrowly overtaking his closest competitors, who remain locked in a tight contest just behind him.\n\nA new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows 20% of likely Democratic caucusgoers name Sanders as their first choice for president.\n\nAfter a surge of enthusiasm that pushed Pete Buttigieg to the top of the field in November, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor has faded, falling 9 percentage points to land behind both Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Warren is at 17%; Buttigieg, 16%; and former Vice President Joe Biden, 15%.\n\nThere's no denying that this is a good poll for Bernie Sanders. He leads, but it's not an uncontested lead, said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. He's got a firmer grip on his supporters than the rest of his compatriots.\n\n2020 candidates on the issues:Here's where they stand on gun violence, immigration, health care and more\n\nThe poll of 701 likely Democratic caucusgoers was done Jan. 2-8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\nBiden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren have remained clustered atop the Register's Iowa Poll throughout the 2020 campaign cycle, though no one has definitively pulled away from the pack. Instead, each of the top four has now led the Iowa Poll at some point this cycle as the field continues to shift.\n\nThe percentage of those who say their mind is made up about which candidate to support on caucus night has risen to 40% – up 10 percentage points from November. Forty-five percent say they have a favorite candidate but could be persuaded to support someone else and an additional 13% have not picked a favorite candidate.\n\n► More:'I am one of the undecided': With a month to go, many likely caucusgoers still unsure about their choice\n\nThe caucus process is an invitation to keep an open mind, Selzer said, noting that the Iowa Poll produced similar numbers of undecided caucusgoers at the same point during 2016's crowded Republican primary.\n\nOther Democratic candidates – including those banking on a late burst of momentum – failed to gain much ground in the January poll. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey held steady, Klobuchar at 6% and Booker at 3%. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang grew his support from 3% in November to 5% today.\n\nLinda Ireland, a 65-year-old poll respondent from Waterloo, said Booker is her first choice, and Klobuchar is her second. But she also likes Buttigieg and Yang.\n\nI am going to caucus for Booker, and I might move over to Amy or even Pete, said Ireland, a retired writer and copy editor.\n\nThe caucus process makes those second choices crucial. After a first vote on caucus night, candidates who don't receive at least 15% in a precinct get dropped from contention there. The people who initially backed a candidate who failed to earn 15% then get to vote again for a final time. So Ireland is considering all her choices.\n\nIf Pete's doing really well, and there's no one else viable in my precinct, I would go over to him. I would probably go down the line: Klobuchar, Yang and then Pete, she said.\n\nIn the new poll, a slew of other contenders fell well below the 15% viability mark.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is focusing her attention on New Hampshire, and entrepreneur Tom Steyer are at 2%. Steyer is holding steady in Iowa but has gained enough ground in other early states to earn a place on Tuesday's debate stage.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is skipping the four early-voting states and compensating for his late entry into the race by purchasing tens of millions of dollars' worth of TV ads elsewhere, barely registers here. His support fell a percentage point from 2% to 1%.\n\nSupport for former Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado and former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland rounded to 0%. Though Bennet has largely foregone competing in Iowa in the race's closing weeks, Delaney – who was the first candidate to begin campaigning here in 2017 – has committed to a massive 40-stop RV tour of the state this month.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and author Marianne Williamson, who ended her campaign after the poll was completed, were not named as a first choice for president by a single poll respondent.\n\n'There's just the Bernie factor'\n\nCould Sanders gain the Iowa caucuses win that eluded him in 2016? Selzer said the data suggest it's entirely plausible.\n\nThere's just the Bernie factor, Selzer said. Which is (even) stronger than we saw in the last cycle.\n\nAlthough this is the first time in his back-to-back races for president that the Vermont senator has led the Iowa Poll, his support this cycle has remained remarkably firm, a fact his campaign has worked to exploit.\n\nSanders' supporters are more likely than those who support the other leading candidates to say their minds are made up (59%), and they are extremely enthusiastic about their candidate (49%). Just 32% of Warren's supporters describe themselves as extremely enthusiastic, and 26% each for Biden and Buttigieg.\n\nThere was a thought that his support was a holdover from when he ran before and that that would evaporate, Selzer said. It certainly has not evaporated.\n\nSanders on the issues:The 2020 candidate shares his views on student debt, Medicare for all, and the Green New Deal\n\nShe said Sanders is holding on to many of those who caucused for him in 2016 while also growing support among young and first-time caucusgoers. Those are notoriously difficult groups to turn out on caucus night, she said, but Sanders has done it before and appears to be on track to do so again.\n\nHe has retained support from 44% of those who say they caucused for him in 2016. Warren earns 20% of his former supporters.\n\nAnd he leads the field with those younger than 35, earning 36% of their support; Warren follows him at 20%.\n\nHe's someone I followed in the last primary and really liked, said Matthew Quick, 25, a P.E. teacher from Essex. As a teacher, Quick said Sanders' focus on education and improving teacher quality and pay stands out.\n\nWhen he put his name in the hat in 2020, I knew I was going to be in all the way, he said.\n\nButtigieg fades, but many still considering him\n\nButtigieg held a commanding lead in the Register's last Iowa Poll, in November, at 25% – 9 percentage points ahead of Warren, his closest competitor. But in the weeks since, he has faced more criticism over his record, his moderate policy positions and his inability to win over voters of color nationally.\n\nButtigieg fares worst among the leading candidates in the share of supporters whose minds are made up: 40%. That's compared with the 59% of Sanders' supporters, 48% of Warren's and 44% of Biden's.\n\nButtigieg's favorability ratings also have gone in the downward direction. The share of those who say they view Buttigieg favorably has fallen 4 percentage points from November to 68% today. The share of those viewing him unfavorably has risen from 16% to 24%.\n\nPete Buttigieg on the issues:Here's where Buttigieg stands on gun violence, immigration, health care and more\n\nThat used to be his great claim to fame: He was very likable, and there were very few who didn't like him, Selzer said. Some of that luster is lost in this poll.\n\nStill, he retains a wide footprint of support in Iowa. As he did in November, Buttigieg tallied the largest universe of potential supporters, with 60% saying they are considering him in some capacity. That includes the 16% who name him as their first choice for president, the 15% who say he is their second choice, and 29% who are actively considering him.\n\nThat narrowly bests Warren, who is still the first or second choice or is being actively considered by 59% of likely Democratic caucusgoers – falling from 66% in November and a high of 71% in September.\n\nBiden fell 3 percentage points in this footprint measure, to 55%, and Sanders ticked up 1 point to tie him. Klobuchar and Yang follow with 41% and 40%, respectively.\n\nSelzer said the numbers seem to indicate a little less room for Klobuchar and Yang to grow.\n\nThey seem to be settled on the number they're going to get, she said. With this big of a field and with four strong top contenders, what sort of showing in the caucus would be good enough for Andrew Yang or for Amy Klobuchar to move forward?\n\nSeventy-eight percent of men under age 45 say they view Yang favorably, as do 73% of white men with a college degree.\n\nKlobuchar gets more favorable ratings from older likely Democratic caucusgoers, including 69% of women age 55 and older. Conversely, just 32% of caucusgoers younger than 35 say they view Klobuchar favorably.\n\nData show progressive, moderate 'lanes'\n\nSelzer said she typically eschews the idea of political lanes, arguing that caucusgoers don't approach their decisions that way.\n\nBut you look at these data and you kind of go, 'Well, these look like lanes,'  she said.\n\nSanders and Warren are battling for progressive caucusgoers, and Biden and Buttigieg are attracting a more moderate crowd.\n\nHigher proportions of Biden and Buttigieg supporters – 75% and 72%, respectively – say choosing a candidate with the superior chance of defeating President Donald Trump is extremely important to them, personally. It's 54% among Sanders supporters and 53% among Warren supporters.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of Biden's supporters and 84% of Buttigieg's supporters say that a candidate's ability to unite the country is extremely important in their choice. That factor is extremely important for 65% of Sanders' supporters and 58% of Warren's.\n\nAnd 64% of Biden supporters and 61% of Buttigieg supporters say having a candidate who can bring Republicans and independents on board is extremely important. Just 38% of Sanders' supporters and 46% of Warren's supporters feel that way.\n\nFurther, a plurality of Biden's supporters, 29%, say Buttigieg is their second choice; a plurality of Sanders' supporters, 44%, say Warren is theirs; and a plurality of Warren's supporters, 31%, say Sanders is their second choice. Buttigieg's supporters are split on their second choices, with 20% saying Warren and 18% saying Biden.\n\nThis poll really displays the Sanders-Warren connection and the Biden-Buttigieg connection, Selzer said.\n\nWhat are candidates' strengths, weaknesses?\n\nAs the United States faces heightened tensions in the Middle East and with Iran, supporters of Biden and Buttigieg express more confidence in their ability to lead the military than the supporters of Sanders or Warren place in their candidates.\n\nAmong his own supporters, 86% say Biden's ability to lead the U.S. military is more of a strength than a weakness. Just 1% say it's more of a weakness for the former vice president. On the campaign trail, Biden regularly touts his foreign policy acumen, arguing he's ready to take over the role of commander in chief on Day One.\n\nButtigieg, who is the only candidate polling in the top four to have served active duty in the military, also fares well: 87% of his backers say his ability to lead the military is a strength, and just 7% call it a weakness.\n\nForeign policy:Here's where the 2020 candidates stand on tensions with Iran and North Korea\n\nI think it's good to have somebody who at least has the context of that mindset, said poll respondent Christina Powers, a 36-year-old stay-at-home mom from Dexter who names Buttigieg as her first choice for president. You definitely have to be able to build bridges and understand the way the military thinks. … And I think, also, because we've been at war for half of his life, he probably understands it's something that is not something to crave – that it's not a good thing.\n\nEven among their own supporters, Sanders and Warren struggle on this measure: 61% of Sanders' supporters say his ability to lead the military is a strength, and 23% call it a weakness; for Warren, 58% of supporters say her ability to lead the military is a strength, and 29% call it a weakness.\n\nSanders' supporters are also concerned about his health.\n\nThe 78-year-old senator had a heart attack earlier this year, and although he hasn't slowed his campaign schedule, 49% of his supporters say his physical health is a weakness, while 37% call it a strength.\n\nQuick, the poll respondent and Sanders supporter, said he believes Sanders' age comes with experience. But he said he worries Trump could weaponize Sanders' age and physical health.\n\nI feel like it's something the Republicans could try to use against him, Quick said.\n\nAlthough Biden is nearly as old, at 77, far fewer of his supporters – just 28% – say his health is a weakness. A majority, 55%, say it's a strength.\n\nWarren is the other septuagenarian among the top-tier candidates. The 70-year-old is often seen running onto stages and through events, and 86% of her supporters say her physical health is a strength.\n\nButtigieg, who would be the youngest president ever elected, leads on this measure: 95% of his supporters say his physical health is an asset, not a weakness.\n\n► MORE ON THIS POLL: Read our methodology\n\nAbout this poll\n\nThe Iowa Poll, conducted Jan. 2-8, 2020, for the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 3,131 registered voters in Iowa, including 701 who say they will definitely or probably attend the 2020 Democratic caucuses.\n\nInterviewers with Quantel Research contacted randomly selected active voters from the Iowa secretary of state's voter registration list by telephone. The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all registered voters were adjusted by age and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 701 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Questions based on the sample of 3,131 registered voters have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.7 or 1.8 percentage points, respectively. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to the Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom is prohibited.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Oregon tribe: Armed militia group is not welcome\n\nA leader of the Oregon Indian tribe whose ancestral property is being occupied by an armed group opposed to federal land policy said Wednesday that the group is not welcome and needs to leave. (Jan. 6)
COLUMBUS, Ohio – Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed six executive orders shortly after midnight Monday, protecting pregnant state employees from discrimination and creating positions to tackle Ohio's opioid crisis.\n\nDeWine didn't roll back former Gov. John Kasich's move to extend discrimination protection to state employees based on gender identity. Instead, he added three new categories for protection against employment discrimination: pregnant women, people with young children and foster parents.\n\nThis is a victory for all of Ohio, said TransOhio Executive Director James Knapp, before urging Ohio lawmakers to extend protections to private employees, too. We hope that the Ohio legislature will also see the great significance of protecting transgender employees in private empowerment through passage of the Ohio Fairness Act.\n\nThe six executive orders fulfill a number of promises Republican DeWine made on the campaign trail against Democrat Rich Cordray.\n\nJan. 14:Why Mike DeWine used 9 Bibles to take the Ohio governor's oath\n\nThey include:\n\nCreating RecoveryOhio, an initiative to tackle Ohio's devastating drug problem. DeWine appointed Alisha Nelson, who oversaw substance use policy at the attorney general's office, to lead the effort. Nelson's task: to work every day with a single-minded focus of fighting the drug epidemic, according to the executive order.\n\nCreating the governor's Children's Initiative to address infant mortality and educational gaps among children in lower-income homes. DeWine's first hire was LeeAnne Cornyn to lead this effort.\n\nOrdering Ohio officials to appoint a state American with Disabilities Act coordinator to ensure state departments, agencies and commissions don't violate the rights of people with disabilities. Each state agency will review its policies annually to make sure it is not creating barriers to employment for people with disabilities.\n\nElevating the leader of Ohio's Office of Families and Children, who oversees foster care programs, to report directly to the head of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. About 15,000 children were placed in foster care at some point in 2018, a 25 percent increase since 2013.\n\nAdding pregnancy, parents of young children and foster parents as protected classes under state employee anti-discrimination policy. That means those situations cannot be considered in hiring, firing or promotion of state employees. DeWine retained language protecting individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nCreating a position within the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services to focus on educating children in kindergarten through 12th grade about drug abuse prevention.\n\nDeWine signed the orders after taking the oath of office in his Cedarville home at midnight. He plans to take the oath again Monday afternoon in a ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse and cap off several days of inaugural events with a gala there Monday night.\n\nFollow Jessie Balmert on Twitter: @jbalmert
Tom Nichols\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nLet us sit back, just for a moment, and absorb the reality of the revelations of the past few days.\n\nFor apparently the first time in history, the president of the United States himself was the subject of a counterintelligence investigation. This means that his ties to a hostile power were significant enough to overcome the high bar the FBI would have to clear to investigate any American for possibly being influenced or compromised by another country — much less its own chief executive.\n\nWe have also learned that the president has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal his discussions with an enemy foreign leader not only from intelligence and foreign policy figures in his own administration, but even from the senior officials of his own Oval Office. It should go without saying that he has tried, in this area as in so many others, to wall himself off from congressional oversight.\n\nThe president himself is always a reliable barometer of the importance of such revelations, and his panicky tweeting and a subsequent bizarre interview on Fox News (where else?) suggest that these reports are indeed bombshells.\n\nThe president's enablers are dismissing all of this as just more of a Deep State conspiracy set in motion by an FBI aggrieved by the firing of James Comey. The enraged Trump opponents who call themselves the Resistance are convinced that this is evidence not only of Russian influence, but of a Manchurian Candidate who is now the Red President.\n\nTrump clearly has something to hide\n\nThe Deep State story is nonsense. The Mole in the Oval image, meanwhile, is too extreme — but not as crazy a theory as it was a year or two ago. The president clearly has something to hide. As I have written many times over the past two years, it is highly unlikely that there is any innocent explanation for the remarkable frequency and depth of the Trump coterie's interactions with Russia for some 30 years, and especially during the campaign.\n\nWhile Trump is not an agent of the Russian Federation (too many people use this kind of language without knowing what it means to counterintelligence officials), it seems at this point beyond argument that the president personally fears Russian President Vladimir Putin for reasons that can only suggest the existence of compromising information.\n\nDespite the lurid fantasies of the president's opponents, however, this information is most likely regarding the possible entanglement of Trump's finances in New York with the Russian mob, Russian intelligence and the Russian government — which are, functionally, the same group — over the past decades.\n\nAmericans who are trying to think through the implications of these new developments more calmly should bear in mind three disturbing realities.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nWatergate lawyer: Michael Cohen is no John Dean but he still might bring down Trump\n\nMueller close to answering Russia collusion question that could end Trump presidency\n\nMichael Flynn is making amends. That's good for America and the Mueller investigation.\n\nFirst, the existence of the counterintelligence investigation is not a scandal. Indeed, it would be scandal if we had found out today that the FBI had not launched an investigation.\n\nTrump's behavior regarding Russia has always presented a serious security concern. But when Trump fires the director of the FBI, and then brags about it to actual Russians, only the most stupid or craven law enforcement agency would decline to investigate what to any counterintelligence officer would be the brightest of dozens of flashing red lights. The White House communications shop can throw invective at James Comey and other Justice Department officials, but the FBI had no choice. It was doing the job Americans count on it to do.\n\nSecond, the president's attempts to hide the content of his conversations with Putin are not only abnormal but also deeply suspect. The intelligence community, members of Congress and the public should always be anxious whenever any American official talks to a top Russian leader and then tries to seize the notes. This kind of behavior violates practices of sensible diplomacy and intelligence analysis, and no one acts this way for innocent reasons.\n\nNor are conversations between the president and Putin merely some personal matter. Such discussions might in fact need to be confidential; sensitive diplomacy often requires a close hold on the informal back-and-forth between top leaders. But their content should be known at the very least to the administration's own top intelligence and foreign policy advisers.\n\nIt's one thing to hold back information for strategic reasons from the public or even the opposition party. All presidents have done that. It's another to withhold information from your own advisers.\n\nRepublican hypocrisy on Trump is titanic\n\nThis is not normal, in any way. As things stand, more people in the Kremlin than in Washington know what Trump said to Putin. It is almost certain that there are readouts and analyses of Trump's discussions with Putin — but that for now, they are in Russian.\n\nFinally, it is exhausting but nonetheless necessary to point out again the titanic hypocrisy of the Republican Party and of Trump's apologists in the conservative media. If President Barack Obama had shredded his notes of a meeting with the Iranian president, or if Hillary Clinton's campaign manager were sitting in jail for lying about meeting a Chinese business associate — and alleged intelligence officer — to share polling data, that alone would have been enough for the GOP to impeach everyone from the president to the White House chef.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump team ties to Russia might be coming to an end, if his willingness to let former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen speak to Congress next month is any indication. Mueller's report could make these recent revelations seem like the sound of distant fires compared with the bombshells about to explode. But even had Mueller never been appointed, we are already in the midst of the most astonishing scandal in American history.\n\nWhat happens next is unknowable. But for the president's supporters to double down in the face of mounting evidence that the president himself is, in some way, compromised by our most dedicated enemy, while making excuses for his secretive behavior by attacking the men and women of the FBI, is a road so dark that perhaps even Joseph McCarthy would not have dared walk it.\n\nTom Nichols, a national security professor at the Naval War College and the Harvard Extension School, is a Russia expert and author of The Death of Expertise.

Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nWhy do politicians get so excited over things like streetcars and light rail? What's wrong with buses?\n\nThe answer isn't that politicos are train aficionados, but rather the standard answer for why politicians don't like some things as much as they like others: Insufficient opportunities for graft.\n\nYou see, the problem with buses is that you can change a bus route by printing up some new maps. Routes for things that run on rails, on the other hand, are harder to change.\n\nThat would seem to be a mark in favor of buses, right? They're much more flexible. But when you think about opportunities for graft, buses come up short.\n\nTrains offer two advantages: First, all those tracks have to be laid, which means more construction contracts. (If it's a subway, even better — digging tunnels is worth years, even decades sometimes, of construction work).\n\nBut more importantly, property along the rail lines, and especially near the stations, becomes more valuable in most cases. Developers are thus encouraged to cough up big consideration (sometimes actual bribes, sometimes bribes disguised as political support) to politicians to get the stations put where they want. And one reason they're willing to pay big is that, once the rails are laid and the stations are built, the politicians can't go back on their word. A development along a bus line isn't worth as much because you have only a politician's unsupported promise not to move it, and nobody much trusts a politician's unsupported promises. As Bloomberg View's Megan McArdle observes: So, ironically, the very fact that it is a big, risky investment may help everyone agree to rapidly develop a streetcar route, generating tax revenue for a city, cash for developers, and votes and campaign contributions for the politicians who install the thing. It's hideously inefficient, of course ... but that's politics for you.\n\nWant to know why voters are so mad? Mia Love has the answer: Glenn Reynolds\n\nThis analysis goes far beyond buses. The explanation for why politicians don't do all sorts of reasonable-sounding things usually boils down to insufficient opportunities for graft. And, conversely, the reason why politicians choose to do many of the things that they do is ... you guessed it, sufficient opportunities for graft.\n\nThat graft may come in the form of bags of cash, or shady real-estate deals, or consulting gigs for a brother-in-law or child, but it may also come in broader terms of political support and even in opportunities for politicians to feel superior or to humiliate their enemies. What all these things have in common, though, is that they're not about making life better for voters. They're about making life better for politicians.\n\nThis doesn't sound much like the traditional view of politics, as embodied in, say, the Schoolhouse Rock I'm Just A Bill video. But it's a view of politics that explains an awful lot.\n\nAnd there's a whole field of economics based on this view, called Public Choice Economics. Nobel prize winning economist James Buchanan referred to public choice economics as politics without romance. Instead of being selfless civil servants motivated solely by the public good, public choice economics assumes that politicians are, like other human beings, heavily influenced by self-interest.\n\nPresidential power grabs distort democracy: Goodlatte\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nPublic choice economists say that groups don't make decisions, individuals do. And individuals mostly do what they think will be best for them, not for the public. Public choices, thus, are like private choices. You pick a car because it's the best car for you that you can afford. Politicians pick policies because they're the best policies — for them — that they can achieve.\n\nHow do they get away with this? First, most voters are rationally ignorant. That is, they realize that their vote isn't likely to make much of a difference, so it's not rational to learn all the ins and outs of policy or of what political leaders are doing. Second, the entire system is designed — by politicians, naturally — to make it harder for voters to keep track of what politicians are doing. The people who have a bigger stake in things — the real estate developers or construction unions — have an incentive to keep track of things, and to influence them, that ordinary voters don't.\n\nCan we eliminate this problem? Nope. But we can make it worse, or better. The more the government does and the more decisions that are relegated to bureaucrats, guidance and other forms of decisionmaking that are far from the public eye, the more freedom politicians have to pursue their own interest at the expense of the public — all while, of course, claiming to do just the opposite. Meanwhile, if we do the opposite — give the government less power and demand more accountability — politicians can get away with less. But they'll always get away with as much as they can.\n\nSome of you may find this analysis of politicians' behavior too harsh. To which I respond: You probably wouldn't trust most politicians to babysit your kids. So why do you trust them with bigger issues?\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, is the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.To read more columns like this, go to the Opinion front page.
Richard Wolf and Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – A powerful federal appeals court in the nation's capital sided with the Trump administration Friday on its military transgender ban, but other courts' blockades of the policy remain in effect.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the partial ban announced by the Pentagon, but never implemented, should not have been blocked by a district court while it was being challenged.\n\nThe three judges on the panel were appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nIn reversing one of four federal courts to have blocked the policy, the panel reasoned that it was not a blanket ban and had been fine-tuned by Pentagon officials over a period of months. Considerable deference is owed the executive branch on military decisions, it said.\n\nThe government took substantial steps to cure the procedural deficiencies the court identified in the enjoined 2017 presidential memorandum, the panel said.\n\nThe partial ban plausibly relies upon the 'considered professional judgment' of 'appropriate military officials,' and appears to permit some transgender individuals to serve in the military, it said.\n\nThe policy, which reversed one allowing transgender service under the Obama administration, was announced by Trump in a tweet July 2017. He said transgender troops were no longer welcome in the military, and the military would no longer pay for their surgeries.\n\nPentagon leaders under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis responded by reassuring transgender troops that they would not be kicked out and that their medical care would not be interrupted until a new policy was created. The formal plan was announced last spring and included exceptions for those already serving and others who are not transitioning to the opposite sex.\n\nFour federal district courts blocked the policy from going into effect, and even though appeals courts have been considering it, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to weigh in. The justices will consider that request at their private conference next Friday.\n\nDozens of transgender recruits have signed up since becoming eligible Jan. 1, 2018. There could be several thousand transgender troops among the active-duty force of more than 1 million troops, according to a Rand Corp. study commissioned by the Pentagon in 2016.\n\nThe two groups that filed the original case against the ban criticized the circuit court's ruling.\n\nToday's ruling is a devastating slap in the face to transgender service members who have proved their fitness to serve and their dedication to this country, said Shannon Minter, legal director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nToday's decision is based on the absurd idea that forcing transgender people to suppress who they are in order to serve is not a ban, said Jennifer Levi, transgender rights project director at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD).

Associated Press\n\nTEHRAN, Iran - Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a wily political survivor and multimillionaire mogul who remained among the ruling elite despite moderate views, died Sunday, state TV reported. He was 82.\n\nIranian media reported earlier Sunday that he was taken to a hospital north of Tehran because of a heart condition. State television broke into programming to announce his death, the female newscaster's voice quivering as she read the news.\n\nShe said Rafsanjani, after a life full of restless efforts in the path of Islam and revolution, had departed for lofty heaven.\n\nRafsanjani's mix of sly wit and reputation for cunning moves — both in politics and business — earned him a host of nicknames such as Akbar Shah, or Great King, during a life that touched every major event in Iranian affairs since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nHis presence — whether directly or through back channels — was felt in many forms. He was a steady leader in the turbulent years following the overthrow of the U.S.-backed shah, a veteran warrior in the country's internal political battles and a covert go-between in intrigue such as the Iran-Contra arms deals in the 1980s.\n\nHe also was handed an unexpected political resurgence in his later years.\n\nThe surprise presidential election in 2013 of Rafsanjani's political soul mate, Hassan Rouhani, gave the former president an insider role in reform-minded efforts that included Rouhani's push for direct nuclear talks with Washington.\n\nRouhani's victory was also another example of Rafsanjani's remarkable political luck. Rafsanjani was blocked from the ballot by Iran's election overseers — presumably worried about boosting his already wide-ranging influence. But, in the end, many moderates turned to Rouhani as an indirect vote for Rafsanjani.\n\nIt came after years of dwindling influence. Another presidential comeback bid was snuffed out by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's surprise victory in 2005 elections.\n\nRafsanjani was a close aide of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and went on to serve as president from 1989 to 1997 during a period of significant changes in Iran. At the time, the country was struggling to rebuild its economy after a devastating 1980-88 war with Iraq, while also cautiously allowing some wider freedoms, as seen in Iran's highly regarded film and media industry.\n\nHe also oversaw key developments in Iran's nuclear program by negotiating deals with Russia to build an energy-producing reactor in Bushehr, which finally went into service in 2011 after long delays. Behind the scenes, he directed the secret purchase of technology and equipment from Pakistan and elsewhere.\n\nRafsanjani managed to remain within the ruling theocracy after leaving office, but any dreams of taking on a higher-profile elder statesman role collapsed with Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election in 2009 and the intense crackdown that followed. Rafsanjani's harsh criticism of Ahmadinejad branded him as a dissenter in the eyes of many conservatives.\n\nIn a sign of his waning powers, Rafsanjani's stance cost him his position as one of the Friday prayer leaders at Tehran University, a highly influential position that often is the forum for significant policy statements.\n\nBut some analysts believe that Rafsanjani was kept within the ruling fold as a potential mediator with America and its allies in the standoff over Iran's nuclear program. His past stature as a trusted Khomeini ally also offered him political protection. Rafsanjani was a top commander in the war with Iraq and played a key role in convincing Khomeini to accept a cease-fire as it became clear that extending the stalemate could pose a crippling drain on Iran's economy.\n\nNearly 25 years later, Rafsanjani tried to revive his credentials among a new generation of reformers by recounting proposals he made to Khomeini in the late 1980s to consider outreach to the United States, still seen by hard-liners as the Great Satan.\n\nHis image, however, also had darker undertones. He was named by prosecutors in Argentina among Iranian officials suspected of links to a 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires that left 85 people dead. Some Iranian reformers accused him of involvement in the slaying of liberals and dissidents during his presidency — charges that were never pursued by Iranian authorities.\n\nThe title of Islamic Republic is not just a formality, he said in 2009 in the chaos after Ahmadinejad's re-election.\n\nRest assured, if one of those two aspects is damaged we will lose our revolution. If it loses its Islamic aspect, we will go astray. If it loses its republican aspect, (the Islamic Republic) will not be realized. Based on the reasons that I have offered, without people and their vote there would be no Islamic system.
Travelers boarding flights to Washington, D.C., ahead of the inauguration will not be allowed to check firearms on several airlines and face increased security measures on all carriers.\n\nDelta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said early Thursday that the airline will ban passengers traveling to Washington, D.C. and by the end of the day, American, United, Alaska, Southwest, Frontier and Spirit said they will also ban firearms.\n\nWe're all on high alert based on the events over the last couple of weeks up in Washington,'' Bastian said in an interview on CNBC.\n\nOnly law enforcement officials will be exempt from the ban.\n\nBastian said the airline will also add other security measures at the airports and on planes – seen and unseen – in the coming days as we look to the week ahead.''\n\nPlanning an international trip?:Get ready to show a negative coronavirus test to board your flight home\n\nAllegiant Air flight expansion:Allegiant Air aims for pandemic vacationers with flights to 3 new cities, including Jackson Hole and Portland\n\nAsked whether he was worried about passenger behavior in light of in-flight incidents this year, he said 99.99% of Delta's passengers are really great and doing a good job.''\n\nI don't want to overreact,'' he said. I think this is a moment hopefully in time with the outcry around the election results.''\n\nBastian said he was pleased'' to see President Donald Trump's call for calm and order late Wednesday.\n\nHopefully that will help,'' he said.\n\nTemporary firearm ban\n\nUnited Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest, Frontier, Spirit and Alaska Airlines – which last week banned 14 passengers from flying the carrier during the pandemic after they were rowdy and wouldn't wear masks on a flight from Washington, D.C. – joined Delta in temporarily banning firearms on flights to Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Dulles International Airport.\n\nUnited Airlines also included flights to Richmond International Airport and noted law enforcement officials and active duty military traveling on orders would be exempt.\n\nAll major airlines stepped up security precautions on flights leaving Washington last weekend after the attack on the U.S. Capitol Jan. 6 and incidents on Washington-bound flights leading up to it.\n\nYet there were still problems.\n\nNow airlines are assuming a similar posture ahead of the inauguration.\n\nIn addition to banning firearms, Seattle-based Alaska said it also plans to reduce the number of tickets sold on flights to and from the D.C. metro area to support law enforcement calls to avoid travel to the area. It will require all passengers on flights to and from metro D.C. to remain in their seats for an hour after takeoff and during landing.\n\nThe airline said it setting up a command center to monitor operations from check-in through arrival.\n\nUnited, which said it banned about 60 people the week of Jan. 4 for not complying with its mask policy, will relocate crewmembers to hotels outside of downtown D.C. and increase staffing at area airports.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is giving flight attendants stronger language to use for in-flight announcements to use as a last resort'' if passengers aren't complying with Southwest's mask policy or are otherwise misbehaving, according to a memo sent to flight attendants Wednesday and obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nSonya Lacore, Southwest's vice president of in-flight operations, attributed the change to a recent increase in customer misconduct events,'' especially in the past week.\n\nAs we near Inauguration Day, we realize that we could see an increase in these occurrences,'' Lacore said in the memo.\n\nThe announcement, which is optional, reads: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention. First, thank you to those fulfilling your promise to abide by our face covering policy. You promised compliance multiple times – when buying your ticket, checking in for your flight and completing your health declaration before traveling today. Wearing a mask is not only to protect the safety of yourself and everyone on this flight, but is also about the personal integrity it takes to fulfill a promise. For those who despite this have still chosen not to comply, please allow this announcement to serve as our final request. Future non-compliance for this or failure to follow any crewmember instructions will result in law enforcement or Southwest personnel meeting the aircraft to take further action. Thank you.\n\nIn addition to the announcement, Lacore said Southwest has multiple efforts'' underway to boost security, especially at airport gates and when a flight lands.\n\nAmerican Airlines said late Wednesday that it will increase security at the airport and on planes.\n\nThe airline also won't serve alcohol on flights to and from Washington-area airports from Jan. 16 through Jan. 21. Because of the pandemic, the airline is serving drinks only in first class section.\n\nThe airline is also moving flight crews from their usual downtown hotel locations to those closer to airports and will provide private transportation between the airports and hotels through Jan. 24 instead of having employees use hotel shuttles.\n\nAmerican spokesman Curtis Blessing said the airline also is revising preflight announcements to include reminders on the airline's face mask requirement and the importance of following crew member instructions.''\n\nFAA gets tough: No more warnings for unruly passengers
WASHINGTON — Vice President Pence repeatedly made headlines during a four-day trip to the Middle East taken weeks after the Trump administration recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel —– a move that sparked protests throughout the region after Trump's December announcement.\n\nHere are highlights from the trip, which ended Tuesday with a visit to the Yad Vashem holocaust memorial and to the Western Wall.\n\nFaster timeline for embassy move\n\nAddressing the Israeli parliament Monday, Pence announced the U.S. embassy will move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2019. That's a faster timetable than administration officials had projected after Trump announced in December that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. While the announcement was applauded by Christian conservatives in the Unites States — a strong base of support for the Trump administration with close ties to Pence — Christian leaders in the Middle East canceled meetings with Pence that had been on the original schedule before the trip got pushed into January. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also called off a planned meeting with Pence in Bethlehem after the December announcement.\n\nProtests continue\n\nArab lawmakers interrupted the start of Pence's speech with protest signs proclaiming that Jerusalem is the Capital of Palestine. They were pushed out of the chamber by Knesset security officers as other lawmakers loudly applauded. Continuing his opening remarks, Pence called it deeply humbling for me to stand before this vibrant democracy. Pence received a lengthy standing ovation after his speech. But the chief negotiator for the Palestinians tweeted that The messianic discourse of Pence is a gift to extremists & has proven that the US Administration is part of the problem rather than the solution.\n\nPence is a Mensch\n\nThe criticism Pence faced from Palestinians was offset by the love he got from Israelis. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin summed up his effusive praise of Pence, as someone who stands very firm behind your words, by saying there is only one word to describe him: a mensch. That's the highest of Jewish compliments,The Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Pence that the day I met you, I knew you were a true friend. Netanyahu also said he was touched to learn from Pence that he has a photo of their 2009 meeting in the Vice President's residence, in Washington.\n\nPence concluded his trip Tuesday by touring Yad Vashem with Netanyahu and visiting the Western Wall, an outer wall of the Second Temple left behind when Rome destroyed it in 70 A.D., and the holiest site where Jews can pray.\n\nNo progress on peace talks\n\nWhile Pence insisted that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel makes a peace agreement more possible, not less, an administration official told reporters there has been no contact with the Palestinian leadership since the announcement. Pence told Reuters the White House is working with partners in the region to develop a framework for a peace agreement. But, Pence said, it all just depends now on when the Palestinians are going to come back to the table.\n\nPence breaks silence on Trump\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press in Jerusalem, Pence offered his first response to reports that Trump referred to Haiti and African nations as shithole countries, and that Trump had an affair with an adult film actress in 2005, shortly after Melania Trump gave birth to his youngest son. Although the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's lawyer paid the actress to not talk to reporters before the 2016 election, Pence called the allegations baseless. Trump has also denied making the shithole countries comments, reportedly made during discussions about whether to include immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti and African countries in an immigration bill. Pence told the Associated Press that he knows the president's heart and Trump wants a merit-based system that doesn't consider an immigrant's race or creed.\n\nTraveling amid government shutdown\n\nWhile other parts of the federal government prepared for a shutdown, the White House said Pence's trip would proceed as scheduled because it was integral to America's national security & diplomatic objectives. But Pence took the unusual step of giving reporters Internet access during his departure flight Friday night so reporters traveling with him could send out a statement from Pence blaming Democrats for the showdown that has dangerous consequences for our national defense. Pence repeated his criticism of Democrats while visiting a military facility near the Syrian border. Bill Kristol, who was the top aide to Vice President Dan Quayle and is a critic of the Trump administration, tweeted that it was depressing for the vice president to use American troops as props for a partisan political message.\n\nPence intervenes for journalists\n\nPence had to intervene after Egyptian officials tried to bar the 12 reporters traveling with the vice president from attending his meeting with Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. While one cameraman was allowed into the start of the meeting, the rest were blocked from getting out of the press van during what a reporter called a prolonged and tense negotiation by the US delegation to get more press access. In the end, the group was allowed in the room for about nine minutes after the leaders had been meeting for about 90 minutes. The meeting itself may also have been tense, as suggested by this LA. Times headline: Vice President Mike Pence gets an earful in Cairo on his first official Middle East tour. For his part, Pence described the Egyptian leaders' dissatisfaction with the new U.S. policy on Jerusalem as a disagreement between friends.\n\nFemale reports complain about Pence Fence in Israel\n\nWhile male reporters covering Pence's visit to the Western Wall were given front-row spots, female journalists were relegated to the back where they had to stand on chairs to see. Outraged female journalists started tweeting about the #PenceFence. The Washington Post reported that the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Western Wall Heritage Foundation set up two platforms side by side, straddling the barrier that divides the section of the wall where men pray from the section women use. (The foundation said the arrangement was the same as when Trump visited in 2017.) One reporter tweeted that White House staff removed the white #PenceFence awning that prevented us women from seeing Veep, but the women were still stuck behind men..\n\nKaren Pence promotes art therapy\n\nSecond Lady Karen Pence, who often travels with her husband, found the one practicing art therapist in Egypt to promote her signature cause. In addition to her meetings with art therapists in all three countries visited, Pence toured ancient sites in Jordan, participated in diplomatic events and sat for an interview with an Israeli station during which she called Israel one of her favorite places in the world. For us as Christians, it's a very special place, Pence said. It's the place where Jesus walked.
Minnesota center Reggie Lynch has been suspended from playing for the school's basketball team because of an alleged violation of the university's sexual misconduct policy.\n\nAn investigation by the university's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Office was launched after an accusation came last fall from a woman who said the Gophers center assaulted her on April 28, 2016, in his dorm room.\n\nThe office determined Lynch should be suspended from campus until Aug. 1, 2020. Lynch reportedly had decided to appeal by requesting a hearing by the Student Sexual Misconduct Subcommittee, which would determine its own decision. Without an appeal, the ban stands.\n\nLynch will remain enrolled in school and practicing and training with the Gophers until the process is completed.\n\nAthletics director Mark Coyle defended his decision to allow Lynch to remain a member of the team.\n\nPeople should trust the procedures that we have in place, Coyle said Friday at a news conference at Williams Arena. We have procedures that have been reviewed by outside agencies. We have procedures that people have focused on and worked on to a fault. Those procedures include providing due process for everybody involved.\n\nThe investigation is the second that the EOAA office launched against Lynch during his time on campus. He was previously cleared by the university after an allegation of sexual assault against a 19-year-old in May 2016; Lynch was arrested for that allegation, but it was ultimately determined -- by the EOAA -- that it was more likely than not that Lynch reasonably believed sex with the woman was consensual.\n\nAfter the Hennepin County Attorney chose not to charge him and the EOAA investigation cleared him, he was reinstated in time for the 2016-17 season.\n\nLynch went on to set a single-season blocks record at Minnesota last season and was honored as the Big Ten defensive player of the year. The senior center is averaging 10 points, eight rebounds and four blocks a game for the Gophers this season. He transferred from Illinois State after playing two seasons with the Redbirds.\n\nWe do a lot of background, head coach Richard Pitino said, and we never saw any red flags.\n\nMessages made by USA TODAY Sports to Minnesota's athletics department and Lynch's attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nIMAGES FROM THE WEEK IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL
WASHINGTON – The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump will begin Jan. 21, after the House is scheduled to vote Wednesday to formally send the articles across the Capitol.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters that the Senate will likely take up housekeeping measures on the trial this week, possibly including swearing in senators and bringing over Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts to preside. The trial would then likely begin Tuesday, McConnell said.\n\nHis announcement came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would vote Wednesday to send the articles, which accuse Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, to the Senate. She asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., on Friday to prepare a resolution that would authorize and appoint the House lawmakers called managers, who will prosecute the case during the Senate trial, although she didn't name managers during the meeting.\n\nThe president and the senators will be held accountable, said Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the vote on the resolution would happen in the afternoon and take only 10 minutes. Each side will be given five minutes for debate. The precise timing hasn't been set, he said.\n\nThe formal procession across the Capitol from the House to the Senate to deliver the articles could happen after the vote or wait until Thursday morning, Hoyer said.\n\nPelosi delayed sending the articles after the House voted to impeach Trump on Dec. 18, so she could learn more about how the trial would be conducted, such as whether witnesses would be called.\n\nMembers of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees declined to say whether Pelosi offered them manager positions or whether they'd even spoken about it with her.\n\nAs the names remained secret, lawmakers leaving the meeting said they expect the managers to be deeply familiar with the details of the House case, to be knowledgeable about the law and to offer diversity in skills, background and race.\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., who as vice chairman of the Judiciary Committee is one of the lawmakers who could be tapped, called it the biggest guessing game on Capitol Hill, one that she and others wish they could take bets on.\n\nSenators of both parties voiced frustration with the delay. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he wouldn't haggle with the House over trial procedures in what he called Pelosi's one-woman blockade.\n\nPelosi and McConnell:Pelosi warns McConnell, Senate Republicans they will 'pay a price' if they engage in 'cover-up'\n\nThe president's opponents are afraid of having the Senate judge the case they actually are going to send us, McConnell said Monday from the Senate floor. They are afraid of having the Senate judge the case they themselves voted on. That alone speaks volumes.\n\nThe articles accuse Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The president said he expects to be exonerated in the Senate trial. A two-thirds majority would be required to convict Trump and remove him from office, which is unlikely in a Senate where Republicans outnumber Democrats 53 to 47.\n\nA major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats has been over whether witnesses will be allowed to testify during the Senate trial. Democrats argued the trial should include witnesses who didn't testify during the House inquiry. McConnell said he has the votes to begin the trial without deciding on whether to call witnesses until after both sides have presented opening statements.\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton, who declined an invitation to testify in the House inquiry, said Jan. 6 he is prepared to testify under subpoena in the Senate trial. Pelosi said Bolton's offer justified the delay in sending the articles to the Senate.\n\nLeader McConnell's tactics are a clear indication of the fear that he and President Trump have regarding the facts of the president's violations for which he was impeached, Pelosi said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., urged testimony from four witnesses, including Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Democrats need at least four Republicans to join them to reach a majority of 51 senators to approve subpoenas for witnesses and documents, and a handful of Republicans said they are open to hearing from witnesses after the opening statements.\n\nTrump said he might block Bolton's testimony under executive privilege to protect the confidentiality of advice presidents get from top aides.\n\nThe House accused Trump of abusing the power of his office by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, while Trump withheld a White House meeting and $391 million in military aid. The House also accused Trump of obstructing Congress by directing aides and agencies to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony, although some officials did testify.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans argued he had the authority to set foreign policy and was justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine.
CINCINNATI — As concern about his pending deportation poured in from across the country, Yancarlos Mendez received official notice Monday, extinguishing all hope: He must go.\n\nThe letter from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement went to the suburban Cincinnati resident's attorney, Nazly Mamedova.\n\nYour request for a stay of removal is denied, wrote ICE Deputy Field Office Director Robert Lynch.\n\nThe letter is dated Jan. 4, the same day The Cincinnati Enquirer first wrote about Mendez's situation. The auto mechanic, 27, was the sole financial provider and one of two trained medical caregivers of his fiancee's son. Ricky Solis, now 6, was paralyzed from the waist down in a February auto crash in suburban Fairfield. He is a U.S. citizen and son of Sandra Mendoza.\n\nSandra is very upset and crying, Mamedova said. She had called Mendoza and told her ICE's final decision.\n\nPreviously:Appeal denied: ICE to move forward with deportation of paraplegic boy's caregiver\n\nPreviously:Paraplegic 6-year-old's 'Daddy' faces deportation\n\nMendez remained in federal immigration custody Monday in Morrow County, Ohio, north of Columbus.\n\nThe fact he remained there over the weekend — since ICE told The Enquirer on Friday that it had rejected his appeal for a one-year stay of deportation — gave some of his supporters hope that the federal agency would reverse its decision.\n\nNot so.\n\nNo changes, ICE Detroit office spokesman Khaalid Walls wrote in an email to The Enquirer earlier Monday.\n\nMendez will be sent to the Dominican Republic, where he was born, his attorney was told. He also has citizenship in Spain, where he was raised.\n\nEven though the deportation order is signed, attorney Mamedova said the legal team would fight for his release until he is on the plane.\n\nShe said Sherrod Brown, Ohio's Democratic senator, is trying to help secure Mendez's release.\n\nThe story of ICE's decision to move forward with Mendez's deportation went viral over the weekend and attracted national attention.\n\nPublished on cincinnati.com and usatoday.com, the story generated several offers to pay Mendoza's rent and utility bills. Dozens of other readers requested information on how to contribute financially to Mendoza and where to express objections to ICE.\n\nMendoza's attorney, Nazly Mamedova, said checks made out to Sandra Mendoza Calmo may be sent to her law office, Wanglaw, 6924 Plainfield Road, Cincinnati OH 45236. Mamedova also can be reached at (513) 793-7776.\n\nThank you for your help in this very tragic situation, Mamedova wrote to readers wanting to help her client.\n\nA reader in Pittsburgh wrote an email Monday to The Enquirer that read, I placed a check in the mail this morning addressed to Ms. Mamedova's firm.\n\nA group called Indivisible Tampa Bay emailedThe Enquirer to ask where its members could express its unhappiness about the decision.\n\nMamedova said she was directing people to Rebecca Adducci, director of the ICE office in Detroit, which has jurisdiction in Ohio.\n\nSince we have filled up the voice mailbox on her phone, please share this info with your networks and ask them to email her today: Rebecca.j.adducci@dhs.gov, Mamedova wrote in an email to supporters.\n\nPeople who want Mendez released and reunited with his family circulated Adducci's phone number, (313) 568-6036, and the email address for Valentina Seeley, ICE's regional community relations officer, valentina.seeley@ice.dhs.gov.\n\nActor-activist Alyssa Milano was among those who tweeted the story, writing, Hard to believe this kind of cruelty is happening right here in the United States. She included the hashtag #YancarlosAndRicky.\n\nMendez had lived since 2014 with Mendoza and her paraplegic son. The boy suffered paralysis and dozens of other serious injuries in the crash. Mendoza, who sustained a broken arm and leg when her car was hit broadside, said she is struggling financially and can't pay her rent. She had to quit her job in a pizza restaurant to care for Ricky around the clock.\n\nShe and Mendez underwent training to learn how to care for Ricky's complicated medical needs at home.\n\nMendez was stopped for driving without a license — for the second time — in November and sentenced to 30 days in the Butler County Jail. The policy of the county's hardline anti-immigration leader, Sheriff Richard Jones, is to cooperate with ICE and honor its detainers. ICE ordered Mendez's deportation Dec. 15 because he overstayed the visa he obtained through the Visa Waiver Program.\n\nMamedova filed Dec. 27 for a one-year suspension of deportation based on the hardship Mendez's removal would cause the little boy in his care.\n\nFollow Mark Curnutte on Twitter: @MarkCurnutte
USA TODAY\n\nRelease Date: January 27, 2016\n\nFor release at 2:00 p.m. EST\n\nInformation received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.\n\nFed: Rates steady, no retreat from March hike � yet\n\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\n\nGiven the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.\n\nIn determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.\n\nThe Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\n\nVoting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Esther L. George; Loretta J. Mester; Jerome H. Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K. Tarullo.
Rajan Menon and William Ruger\n\nUkraine matters more to Russia than it does to the United States. This hard reality makes the Trump administration's recent decision to approve selling lethal weapons to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, counterproductive and dangerous.\n\nDefenders of the move contend that it will deter Russia and pressure Vladimir Putin to accept a just political settlement of the continuing war in Ukraine's Donbas region.\n\nIt won't. Putin is too deeply committed in eastern Ukraine to back down, especially with an election approaching. Russia believes it has vital interests there that it must defend, even if that prolongs economic sanctions.\n\nOUR VIEW: Russia the 'evil empire' again\n\nSoon after news of the arms sales broke, Russia's deputy foreign minister declared that his country won't be cowed. Russia has already demonstrated, notably in 2015, that it can parry U­krainian military advances by sending additional personnel and weaponry. And because Russia shares a 1,200 mile-long border with Ukraine, Moscow will always be able to do so much faster and more easily than Washington can. Thus, arming Ukraine will likely escalate the conflict.\n\nUnderstanding Ukraine's significance to Russia is not equivalent to condoning Putin's annexation of Crimea and support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine. It does mean there are limits to what the U.S. can achieve short of a more serious commitment.\n\nTrump's $41.5 million arms package will scarcely change battlefield outcomes in Ukraine. But it will certainly provoke Russia. What if Putin ups the ante and Ukraine's military is pushed back? Will Washington ship more arms? What if that doesn't work? Ask the arm Ukraine folks. You won't get an answer. Instead, they'll talk about international norms and self-determination. Sound statecraft demands greater realism about constraints, costs and risks. Ideals aren't enough.\n\nRajan Menon is professor of international relations at the City College of New York. William Ruger is vice president for research and policy at the Charles Koch Institute and a veteran of the Afghanistan War.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nDon't shoot the researchers.\n\nYes, a new study indicates that those saving for retirement will need to increase dramatically the percent they save for retirement if they want to fund their desired standard of living in retirement.\n\nConsider: Americans presently save on average 5.5% and 401(k) plan participants deferred, on average, 6.8% of their salaries into retirement plans in 2015. But those savings rates are far below what's needed to fund retirement given today's markets, according to the researchers, David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management, Michael Finke, dean and chief academic officer at The American College of Financial Services, and Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at The American College of Financial Services.\n\nIndeed, the researchers showed that a 35-year-old couple with household income of $50,000 would need to save pre-tax about 11.1% to 13.1% to maintain their standard of living while the same couple with household income of $100,000 would need to save 13.4% to 16.8%.\n\nWhat gives? Several factors are to blame.\n\nLow future investment returns\n\nValuations on risky assets (stocks) are high and yields on safe assets (bonds) are low. And that, the researchers say, portends an era of lower expected returns in the future. What's more, the researchers say high asset prices and expected lower returns affect the relative cost of funding financial goals.\n\nFor example, assume a household earns $50,000 at age 25, expects a 3% annual growth rate in income, and wants $1 million in purchasing power after age 65, the researchers wrote in their report, Required Retirement Savings Rates Today. If they expect a 5% real return on investments, they will save 10% of their income each year. If they expect 2%, they will need to save 18% of their income each year to reach their $1 million goal.\n\nRetirement income lower, too\n\nThe researchers also note that a persistently low-return environment not only increases the percentage of income a person needs to save to meet a retirement goal but it also reduces the income a person can expect to receive once that goal is reached.\n\nFor instance, a 35-year-old who earns $50,000 and who will experience real wage growth of 1% per year for a 30-year career, followed by a 30-year retirement could drawdown, assuming a real return of 0%, just $28,988 per year compared to $46,938 with a 6% expected rate of return.\n\nFor savers, lower returns mean less spending across the life cycle, said Finke, a co-author of the report They spend less during their working years because they need to save more. During retirement, their goal should be to spend about the same as they did during their working years. Even though they'll be spending less, they need an even higher nest egg when investment returns are low. There's really nothing good about low returns if you're a saver. If you're a borrower, it's great news.\n\nLongevity makes retirement more expensive, too\n\nThat life expectancies for older Americans has increased over the last 100 years and are projected to continue increasing isn't helping those saving for retirement either.\n\nToday's workers who expect to retire at the same age as retirees in previous generations will face an even greater cost of funding retirement because of increases in longevity after the age of 65, the researchers wrote. Retirement is significantly more expensive in a low-return environment, but it is even more expensive if a person lives longer.\n\nIn fact, the researchers calculated that the price of a dollar of safe income for a person retiring today is nearly 100% higher (or twice as high today) than it was for a person retiring in the year 2000 because of increases in longevity and declines in real bond interest rates.\n\nNot only are investors getting less return on their safe bond investments, notes Finke. They're also living longer, so they need to fund more years of spending. The bottom line is that retirement is just more expensive today than it was in the past.\n\nLegacy goals are expensive, too\n\nThe researchers also note that trying to create a sum of money to pass down, to bequest, to loved ones and others on top of funding a desired lifestyle in retirement is also quite expensive in a high asset price/low expected returns world.\n\nFor those who want to leave $500,000 to their heirs, they'll simply need to save more, says Finke. Low rates also increase the cost of buying a life insurance policy to fund a legacy.\n\nSo, what are savers to do in this low-return, long-longevity world?\n\nUse lower expected rates of return when calculating how much you need to save for retirement and how much income you'll be able to draw down once in retirement\n\nConsider increasing sharply the amount you save now (that means lowering your current standard of living) to fund your desired standard of living in retirement.\n\nConsider using an income annuity instead of using a bond ladder for your safe assets? Why so? The researchers suggest that annuitization becomes a relatively more attractive option when interest rates are low. This is because the increase in the cost of building a bond ladder is greater than the increase in the cost of buying an income annuity in a low-rate environment, the researchers wrote. With a bond ladder, retirees spend principal and interest. With an income annuity, retirees spend principal, interest, and mortality credits, which are the subsidies from the short-lived to the long-lived. With interest low in both situations, the mortality credits become more important.\n\nHigh earners need to save even more than low earners to fund their desired standard of living. For instance, a single 40-year-old person earning $50,000 would need to save 19.4% in a low-return world to fund a desired lifestyle in retirement while that same person earning $100,000 would need to save 25.6%.\n\nRetiring later, at age 70, lowers the percent you need to save. For instance, a single 35-year-old person with household income of $50,000 who wants to retire at 60 needs to save 19.1% per year to fund their desired lifestyle in retirement, or 15.8% if they want to retire at 65, or 10.6% if they want to retire at 70.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

Kelvin Chan\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nHONG KONG — China's economy gained steam in 2017, expanding at a 6.9% pace in 2017 in its first annual increase in seven years, according to data released Thursday that exceeded economists' forecasts and the government's target.\n\nBuoyant consumer spending and robust exports helped drive the faster expansion, as the economy defied expectations of weaker growth in the latter half of the year due to curbs on bank lending.\n\nThe data show China's communist leaders have some extra wiggle room as they strive to wean the economy away from reliance on wasteful and polluting industries and exports in favor of slower but more sustainable consumer spending. The rebalancing has been complicated by Beijing's repeated infusions of credit to prevent activity from slowing too much, which has pushed up debt that analysts say is the biggest threat to economic stability.\n\nThe government had set a target of 6.5 percent growth after the economy expanded at a 6.7 percent annual pace in 2016, its slowest in 26 years.\n\nGrowth in the fourth quarter held steady at 6.8 percent, though that was a tick slower than the 6.9 percent pace of growth in the first half of the year, the report said.\n\nRetail sales rose 10.2 percent in 2017 while exports jumped 10.8 percent from a year earlier despite heightened trade tensions during U.S. President Donald Trump's first year in office.\n\nThe national economy has maintained the momentum of stable and sound development and exceeded expectations, said the report released by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nContinued strong demand should help support China's exports, said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics.\n\nWhile domestic demand should cool on tighter financial policy, China's policymakers want the slowdown in credit and the economy to be gradual. We project GDP growth to slow to 6.4 percent this year, he said in a commentary.\n\nThe upbeat data underscored debate over the veracity of official figures, following a recent spate of reports about local Chinese governments reporting fake or inaccurate economic data.\n\nEarlier this week, Chen Qiufa, the governor of Liaoning province in China's rust-belt northeast region, admitted that economic figures were padded out from 2011 to 2014, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Similar cases have been reported recently by the port city of Tianjin and Inner Mongolia province.\n\nSuch practices have gone on for decades in China. But by understating the severity of the slowdown in the past five years, officials now may be understating the scale of the rebound, some economists say.\n\nWe have doubts about the accuracy of the official figures given how implausibly stable they have been in recent years, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report, adding that his group's unofficial measure of activity showed a slower pace of growth but a more pronounced recovery.\n\nAdmittedly, the monthly data for December, also published today, suggest that the economy had a relatively strong end to the year, he added.\n\nThe statistics bureau's commissioner, Ning Jizhe, vowed to fix the problem, though he said the recent cases of fake data were too small to affect the overall data.\n\nThe accuracy of China's statistical figures and statistical system would not be affected by the problems of some individual local (government), region, enterprise, or unit, he told reporters.\n\nEarlier Thursday, China's foreign exchange regulator said the country's cross-border capital flows hit a turning point in 2017 as foreign currency reserve levels stabilized after two years of declines, the country's foreign exchange regulator.\n\nWang Chungying, a spokeswoman for China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, told reporters in Beijing that the supply and demand of foreign exchange have shifted to a basic equilibrium.\n\nChina's foreign exchange reserves rose for 11 straight months from January-December, expanding by a total of $129.4 billion last year to $3.1 trillion dollars, Wang said at an annual briefing.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident Trump said Wednesday during a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he can live with a two-state or one-state solution for Mideast peace. I'm happy with the one they like the best, Trump said.\n\nThe comments depart from long-standing U.S. policy that has backed a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu waver on support for two-state solution in Middle East\n\nSo, what are the two-state and one-state solutions for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict that has persisted since the founding of the Israeli state in 1948?\n\nTwo-state solution\n\nThe two-state solution calls for the creation of an independent Palestinian state existing peacefully alongside Israel. That goal has been embraced by past Democratic and Republican administrations and the United Nations.\n\nSupporters say the two-state solution would end hostility between Israel and Palestinians as well as Arab neighbors, and produce stability in the chaos-prone Middle East.\n\nGetting there, however, has proven exceedingly difficult because of what appear to be several intractable disputes. Foremost is Israel's demand that the Palestinians and other Arab neighbors recognize the Jewish state's right to exist and end terror attacks.\n\nIn addition, the two sides are far apart on the borders of a new Palestinian state: Both claim Jerusalem as their capital, and Israel has expanded settlements on land that the Palestinians also say is theirs.\n\nAnother contentious dispute involves the right of return claimed by millions of Palestinians — or their descendants — who were evicted from their land when the Jewish state was created. The Palestinians say it is a basic right to reclaim their property, while Israel says the issue should be decided by political negotiations.\n\nOne-state solution\n\nThe one-state solution has gained support of late amid the failure of progress toward creation of an independent Palestinian nation.\n\nThis approach calls for Israel to annex the West Bank, which it captured from Jordan in their 1967 war, and grant some form of citizenship to Palestinians. The idea has appeal to small factions of both Israelis and Palestinians frustrated by the current standoff and perpetual hostility.\n\nAmong the many problems are the likely disapproval of that approach by most of the world community, and whether Palestinians would be afforded full citizen rights and eventually outnumber Jewish Israelis or be consigned to second-class status as occurred in South Africa during Apartheid.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nJust three weeks ago, President Donald Trump tweeted a video of himself declaring victory over the Islamic State and adding that the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria are all coming back, and they're coming back now.\n\nNow first meant 30 days, according to Pentagon officials. Then it meant 120 days. Today, it's anyone's guess.\n\nPreconditions for a U.S. withdrawal, unveiled Sunday by national security adviser John Bolton as he rushed to the Middle East to do damage control, suggest an indefinite timeline.\n\nBolton assured Israelis that U.S. troops will stay until the last of ISIS, which stubbornly holds a sliver of the Syrian-Iraq border area, is thoroughly defeated and Turkey disavows aggression against Kurdish Syrian forces. (In the U.S.-led drive to vanquish ISIS in Syria, Kurds did much of the fighting and dying. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, by contrast, sees them as terrorists and slammed Bolton on Tuesday.)\n\nIf this dizzying execution of U.S. policy has somehow ended up, at least for the moment, in a better place, it has not been without casualties. The United States lost a valuable Defense secretary in the resignation of James Mattis and a talented special presidential envoy to the U.S.-led coalition battling ISIS when Brett McGurk quit in protest over the announced abrupt withdrawal.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:Trump is right to bring our soldiers home\n\nThe primary U.S. goal in Syria remains the destruction of ISIS. But precipitously pulling out America's relatively modest commitment of forces would benefit U.S. adversaries and hurt its allies:\n\n►The U.S.-led coalition supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces, made up of Kurdish troops and some Arab fighters, controls a quarter of the nation. That land holds 95 percent of Syria's oil, much of its gas and the bountiful Euphrates River valley, a tangible loss for the brutal Damascus dictatorship of Bashar Assad. The local democratic governing councils were proving an effective alternative as peace negotiations continue.\n\n►Russian President Vladimir Putin exulted at news of Trump's initial decision. Moscow's growing influence in the Middle East, bolstered by an expanded Russian military in Syria to support Assad's crackdown on rebellion, was offset only by the U.S.-led coalition controlling northeastern Syria and airspace above it.\n\n►A quick pullout from Syria serves Iran's interests. Tehran built an army of Shiite foreign fighters in Syria to support Assad, assisted by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, an enemy of Israel that's on the U.S. foreign terror list. Syrian territory controlled by U.S.-led forces was a block to this aggression, and withdrawal would open a land bridge through northern Iraq for Iran to more easily and cheaply arm and multiply its forces.\n\nThrough the long turmoil of wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, Americans have come to abhor endless military engagements. But the U.S. military has also learned lessons and refined tactics. Its frugal footprint in Syria, working with major allies in the air and on the ground with tens of thousands of Kurdish and Arab fighters, helped turn the tables against Islamic extremism there.\n\nThis was accomplished with four American deaths since fighting ISIS began in 2015 in Syria. This year's projected cost, before the pullout was announced, was $1.35 billion, a fraction of the $45 billion spent annually in Afghanistan.\n\nFar too much is at stake in Syria to conduct foreign policy with impulsive pronouncements on Twitter.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Darla Mercado\n\nCNBC\n\nThis year, if you want to boost your tax savings beyond the new standard deduction, consider giving away some of your wealth.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect on Monday, bringing with it a slate of changes to the code. Those include an increase to the standard deduction (which nearly doubles to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples who file jointly), as well as the elimination of personal exemptions.\n\nAbout 49 million taxpayers, or 28%, currently itemize, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Due to the higher standard deduction, fewer filers are expected to do so in the future.\n\nMore than 36 million filers claimed the charitable-giving deduction on their 2015 taxes, according to the IRS.\n\nHowever, filers who plan their charitable gifts may be able to get themselves over the new standard deduction and itemize — if they use a strategy called bunching.\n\nYou would give the same amount of dollars that you would over a two-year period, but you bunch them into one year, said Charlie Douglas, partner and director of wealth planning at Cedar Rowe Partners in Atlanta.\n\nBunching in one year will help you itemize deductions where you couldn't, he said.\n\nHere's what you should know about bunching your charitable gifts.\n\nAccelerated giving\n\nThe tax overhaul took away many of the levers taxpayers could use to ramp up their deductions so that they could itemize on their taxes.\n\nFor instance, filers could previously take an unlimited deduction every year for property and state income taxes. Now, they are only allowed to claim up to $10,000 in these expenses each year.\n\nThe charitable giving deduction remains for taxpayers who itemize. Under the new law, this break is limited to 60% of adjusted gross income for cash gifts, but you can carry forward by up to five years any amount that exceeds that.\n\nSingle donors who fall short of the $12,000 threshold ($24,000 if married) can itemize on their taxes if they supercharge their giving in one year.\n\nEvery other year\n\nConsider that a married couple is claiming the maximum property and state income tax deduction of $10,000. This couple also paid $6,000 in mortgage interest in a year.\n\nThey will need at least $8,000 of charitable gifts in order to hit — and surpass — the $24,000 standard deduction threshold.\n\nIf this couple normally gives $4,000 to charity annually, they can accelerate the gift by cramming in two years of donations into one tax year. This way, they itemize on their taxes one year and take the standard deduction the next.\n\nYou could do three years of gifts, even two years of gifts to get over the standard deduction, said Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning for Baird's private wealth management group.\n\nBunching deductions sounds great, but it'll probably be talked about more than it's implemented because of the cash commitment it will take to get over the standard deduction, said Steffen.\n\nMore:Charity gets a jolt from tax law -- but due to drop next year\n\nMore:Are your donations to charities doing all the good they could?\n\nMore:Some homeowners see prepaying property taxes as way to save this year and next
U-Haul is taking a stand on smokers and nicotine users.\n\nThe moving and storage rental company announced that, effective Feb. 1 in 21 states, it will no longer hire nicotine users. Employees hired before that date will be unaffected by the new policy.\n\nWe are deeply invested in the well-being of our Team Members, Jessica Lopez, U-Haul chief of staff, said in a news release. Nicotine products are addictive and pose a variety of serious health risks. This policy is a responsible step in fostering a culture of wellness at U-Haul, with the goal of helping our Team Members on their health journey.\n\nAge limit increase:FDA officially raises federal minimum age to purchase all tobacco products from 18 to 21\n\nCigarette smoking:At an all-time low in the USA, but can it stay that way after vaping scare?\n\nU-Haul, headquartered in Phoenix, employs more than 30,000 staffers across the USA and Canada. There are 4,000 in Arizona.\n\nThe nicotine-free policy will be enacted in states that lawfully allow the decline of nicotine users. Along with Arizona, those states are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nIndividuals seeking U-Haul jobs in the aforementioned 21 states will see statements regarding the nicotine-free hiring policy on applications, and will be questioned about nicotine use, the company said. In states where testing is allowed, applicants must consent to submit to nicotine screening in the future to be considered.\n\nTwenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have smoker protection laws that prevent employers from discriminating against employees for using tobacco products, according to the American Lung Association.\n\nU-Haul has a wellness program that includes nicotine cessation assistance for members, along with nutrition and fitness features.\n\nThe legal age to purchase tobacco products increased from 18 to 21 after a bill was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law Dec. 20.\n\nCigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the USA, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths every year, or about 1 in 5 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. – The Louisville Metro Police Department has officially fired two detectives and sanctioned others for their actions surrounding the raid that left Breonna Taylor, 26, dead in her apartment.\n\nDetectives Myles Cosgrove and Joshua Jaynes, who were fired Tuesday, are the latest detectives the department has terminated in connection with the fatal police shooting of Taylor.\n\nA third detective, Brett Hankison, was fired in June for blindly firing 10 rounds into her apartment.\n\nCosgrove, who the FBI concluded fired the shot that killed Taylor, violated procedures for use of force and failing to use a body camera during the March 13 search warrant.\n\nJaynes, meanwhile, the officer who secured the search warrant for Taylor's apartment, was found in violation of department policy for truthfulness and search warrant preparation.\n\nIt was also announced Wednesday that Erika Shields, the former Atlanta police chief who stepped down after one of her officers fatally shot Rayshard Brooks, will take over as the leader of Louisville's embattled police force.\n\nShields will face an immediate challenge stepping into her new role following a record-breaking year of homicides in Louisville and months of turmoil and protests over the fatal police shooting of Taylor in March.\n\nIn Atlanta, Shields made reform a priority and was known nationwide as a progressive leader, yet she successfully won the loyalty of rank and file officers, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nShe stepped down as chief June 13, hours after an Atlanta police officer shot and killed Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, following an altercation at a Wendy's in which the officer was subsequently fired.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Cosgrove sent an email to fellow officers lambasting LMPD's leadership for succumbing to political pressures, writing that leaders aren't afraid to perform hatchet jobs on you either.\n\n'A sacrificial lamb':Officer facing firing in Breonna Taylor's death slams police leadership\n\nRead more on race and identity: Sign up for USA TODAY's This Is America newsletter\n\nThink about that next time you put on the uniform and badge, Cosgrove wrote. For those of you still doing real police work, it's just a matter of time till you (too) will be a sacrificial lamb. I plead with you, do nothing.\n\nCosgrove and Jaynes each received pre-termination letters last week outlining the findings against them from interim Chief Yvette Gentry, who ultimately upheld her decision after meeting with each officer and his respective attorney.\n\nThose pre-termination meetings were a chance for the officers and their legal defense to present additional information or mitigating factors in their favor.\n\nUnder Kentucky state law and their union contract, Cosgrove and Jaynes can appeal their firings within 10 days to the Police Merit Board.\n\nThe merit board could uphold the firing or set aside the chief's finding and create a new penalty.\n\nAn officer has the right to appeal the merit board's decision within 30 days to a circuit court judge.\n\nHankison appealed his termination to the Police Merit Board, which will hear his appeal when his criminal case is completed.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment after several rounds of gunfire went into an occupied apartment next to Taylor's unit.\n\nBreonna Taylor shooting:A nine-month timeline shows how her death changed Louisville\n\nGentry also found the following:
Tyler Crowe, Sean O'Reilly, and Reuben Gregg Brewer\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nInvesting should be a numbers game.\n\nYou evaluate the merits of an asset based on its financials, and then determine if the current price is worth paying. Unfortunately, the world of investing is rife with myths and urban legends that can detract investors from making the best decisions.\n\nOne asset class that possibly has the most myths surrounding it is gold. It has been around for thousands of years, but we still haven't quite figured out how it fits best in an investment portfolio.\n\nWe asked three Motley Fool investors to debunk an investing myth surrounding gold so you can make better decisions. Here's what they had to say.\n\nGold isn't the hedge against inflation that some think\n\nTyler Crowe: A common investing belief is that gold is a good hedge against inflation. That means anytime there's a period of rising interest rates, investors should allocate capital to gold.\n\nIf you dig into the data, though, that investment hasn't gone as well as one might expect. Authors Robert Johnson and Luis Garcia-Feijoo of the book Invest with the Fed went through the returns of stocks and gold in various interest rate environments from 1972, when the U.S. dollar was taken off the gold standard, to 2013. Here's what they found:\n\nIn periods of falling interest rates, stocks returned 14.67% versus 7.85% for gold.\n\nIn periods of flat interest rates, stocks returned 10.61% versus 8.61% for gold.\n\nIn periods of rising interest rates, stocks returned 8.47% versus 4.86% for gold.\n\nSure, the expected returns from stocks in a period of rising interest rates are considerably lower than times when rates are flat or falling, but that doesn't necessarily mean that gold is a more attractive investment than stocks when it happens. The only argument that this could still be the case is that this is only 40 years of data, and it could be too small of a sample size for this investment theory to show up.\n\nThere are reasons to invest in gold versus stocks or other assets, but the theory that investors should go to gold when interest rates are on the rise doesn't seem to hold water.\n\nMore: Pop quiz: Test your knowledge of the Dow Jones industrial average\n\nMore: Use optimal strategies when rebalancing your portfolios\n\nDon't expect reliable dividends from gold investments\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer: Most precious-metals miners don't have particularly enticing dividend histories. That's driven by the mining business model, which produce huge profits when gold and silver prices are high, but can lead to big losses when the prices of these often-volatile commodities plunge. The costs of mining simply can't adjust quickly enough to falling prices, leading to weak margins.\n\nBut that's not the case with streaming companies like Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD). Streamers provide cash upfront to miners for the right to buy gold and silver at reduced rates in the future. That locks in wide margins in both good times and bad. As an example, Royal Gold has a deal with mining giant Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) at the Pueblo Viejo Mine that allows it to buy gold and silver at 30% of the spot price until certain production targets are met, and 60% thereafter. Its costs will never go above the spot price.\n\nThat backdrop helps explain how Royal Gold has managed to increase its dividend every single year for 17 consecutive years. The average annual growth rate of the last decade was roughly 15% a year. That's an incredible record for any company, let alone one that operates in the precious-metals industry.\n\nTo be fair, Royal Gold's roughly 1.2% yield probably won't excite you. But if you're an income investor looking to hold some gold to help diversify your portfolio, you can, indeed, find reliable dividends in the precious-metals space.\n\nSome of the smartest investors in the world love gold -- if the time is right\n\nSean O'Reilly: If there's one myth that surrounds investing in gold, it's that only speculators dabble in trading and owning the precious metal. Like all myths, it's grounded in some truth.\n\nGold futures are a favorite staple of commodity traders on the futures markets. The world's most famous investor, Warren Buffett, famously eschews gold. But to other successful investors -- many of whom are billionaires in their own right -- gold can and should be owned in the right circumstances.\n\nTake Ray Dalio, founder of the world's biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Just a few months ago, Dalio went on record saying that markets are ignoring rising political risks. He cited potential conflict between the United States and North Korea as an example.\n\nWhat's a man who runs a $160 billion hedge fund to do should bombs start flying? Buy gold.\n\nIf things go badly with North Korea, or if the political situation in the U.S. continues to worsen, Dalio says an investor would want up to 5%-10% of a portfolio in gold. He's putting his money where his mouth is. According to the latest SEC filings, Dalio increased his holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEMKT: GLD) by a whopping 575% in Q3, to $473 million.\n\nDalio isn't alone. Hedge-fund veteran Stanley Druckenmiller, who served as the lead portfolio manager at George Soros' Quantum Fund throughout the 1990s, thinks of gold as a currency.\n\nOf course, investors don't want to hold any currency for long. But if stocks and bonds are unattractive, one should sit on their hands. Druckenmiller is happy to own gold as a parking spot. In an interview with Bloomberg in February 2017, Druckenmiller stated: I wanted to own some currency and no country wants its currency to strengthen... gold was down a lot, so I bought it.\n\nThe world's smartest investors use gold as an insurance policy. In addition, gold producers are often found in their portfolios. Druckenmiller's old boss, Soros, has recently held shares in Barrick Gold.\n\nWhile it may not be as profitable as owning dividend-paying stocks in the long run, gold isn't just for speculators. It's also another option that the world's top investors use to their advantage.\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

WILMINGTON, Del. — One of the country's most historic election wins of 2020 happened in a Delaware Senate District in North Wilmington, where a 30-year-old Cab Calloway graduate and LGBTQ activist became the highest-ranking openly transgender official in the United States.\n\nNow, Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride enters what could be one of the most demanding legislative sessions in the history of the state as the Democrat-controlled 62-person Delaware General Assembly grapples with an urgent need to address the COVID-19 pandemic, a backlog of postponed legislation from a truncated 2020 session — including controversial issues such as gun control — and a growing call across the First State for police reform.\n\nAll of it will come to the forefront as lawmakers return to floor and committee debates via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual meetings will be live-streamed and broadcast to state residents who were, until last year, used to having very little access to their state's legislative process unless they could carve out an afternoon to travel to the statehouse in Dover. For McBride, it will mean starting a new job remotely, and all the stresses that come with it.\n\nShe's joining a body of state lawmakers who will likely be under more scrutiny than ever before in their careers. After 10 months of virus-related restrictions, economic turmoil and increased urgency for a vaccine, people are perhaps now more invested in their state government than ever before in modern American history.\n\nLAW CHANGES TO EXPECT THIS YEAR:The Delaware General Assembly starts session Tuesday. What you need to know.\n\nEven without her growing reputation as an unstoppable public figure in the First State, it would be impossible for a lawmaker like McBride to shy away from the most pressing issues this year. The freshman Senator will chair the Senate Health and Social Services Committee and sit on the Senate Judiciary and Corrections and Public Safety committees.\n\nMcBride said she wants to use her power as a lawmaker to reform health care laws for the long term. While she supports science-based pandemic response strategy of Gov. John Carney's administration, she argues it's not enough for Delaware to simply face the pandemic and then return to normal.\n\nJOE BIDEN'S IMPACT ON DELAWARE BUSINESS:See what Delaware companies benefited from Biden presidential run\n\nYou can't separate the longer term issues from the COVID-19 crisis, she said. What we've seen is that far too many Delawareans had to give up their income in the face of illness. ... Whether that's COVID or cancer, whether that's an individual health crisis or a public health crisis, the same values and the same principles are at stake.\n\nPaid family and medical leave — something that she has campaigned on since she first announced her bid for the Senate seat in the summer of 2019 — is at the heart of that goal, she said.\n\nThere is no question that this pandemic has reinforced and highlighted the urgent need for that policy, regardless of the situation a person is finding themselves in, she said.\n\nMcBride, who has been spotted at Moms Demand Action rallies in recent years, supports progressive gun control measures similar to what lawmakers failed to pass in recent years. She also supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and a Medicaid buy-in option, which would allow people with disabilities to get Medicaid services that aren't available through other insurers even if they make a certain level of income.\n\nMcBride said she also plans to back the Black Caucus' eight-item list of proposals that Delaware's Legislative Black Caucus members introduced in June to reform police departments and fight systemic racism. That includes advancing bills from two recently formed task forces to come up with law changes around racial equity and police accountability.\n\nShe expressed support for law changes that would make it easier to access records related to officer misconduct. She said she also wants to reduce recidivism through job opportunities.\n\nCOVID-19 CASES RISING:Delaware reported more COVID-19 cases last week than ever before\n\nIt's likely that this is the start of a long political career for McBride, who is younger than most of her colleagues in the General Assembly. Before even stepping foot in Legislative Hall as an elected official, she has proven herself as a political force to be reckoned with. In her bid to replace retiring longtime Sen. Harris McDowell, she pulled in more than $170,000 in the first six months of her campaign — a war chest that competed with that of some statewide races and eclipsed those of other General Assembly candidates with far more competitive opponents.\n\nThe newly elected lawmaker is already a familiar face in Legislative Hall after working for former Gov. Jack Markell and the late Attorney General Beau Biden, as well as successfully advocating for passage of the Gender Identity Nondiscrimination Act in 2013.\n\nJOE BIDEN INAUGURATION:Joe Biden presidential inauguration plans: Latest news\n\nThe Wilmington native is entering with a slew of other freshman Democrats in both chambers, a handful of whom usurped powerful, longtime incumbents in the state primary and have formed a progressive faction that has pledged to challenge the General Assembly's compromise-driven, closed-door traditions known as the Delaware Way.\n\nWhile McBride identifies as a progressive, she has been less publicly critical of the Legislature's old guard compared with other progressive freshman. Instead, she says she wants to focus on unifying her colleagues, and points to former Senate Majority Leader Margaret Rose Henry, also Democrat from Wilmington, as someone she hopes to emulate.\n\nShe demonstrated that you can be bold, you can be brave, you can be progressive and you can bring people together, McBride said about Henry. That's the most effective way to bring about change. … The only way we can tackle the significant challenges we face is by combining the experience of the returning members and the new energy of the first-year members.\n\nLAG IN VACCINE DISTRIBUTION:Half of COVID-19 vaccines haven't been administered in Delaware. Here's why.\n\nWhen asked about what obstacles she expects during her first term, she said she has spent the last few months listening as much as possible to people in the state.\n\nI recognize that folks have a diversity of thought in this state and there will be people who disagree with positions I take or policies I put forward, she said. I'm no stranger to advocacy and I'm ready to do the work necessary to get those bills over the finish line and to do so in a way that results in meaningful change for the folks who elected me.\n\nHolding public office isn't the first first for McBride, who in 2016 gained national prominence when she became the first openly transgender person to speak at the Democratic National Convention. Four years before that, she was already making headlines as a college student when she came out publicly as transgender at the end of her term as American University student body president.\n\nMCBRIDE: She was sexually assaulted within months of coming out. She isn't alone\n\nBut it's no surprise that McBride's win in November earned headlines across the country, heralded as a triumph for the LGBTQ community and boosting her to an even more prominent, national celebrity status than what she already had before her 2020 campaign — something that is essentially unheard of for local politicians.\n\nThe lawmaker this month even made the cover of The Cut, a style and culture website that is part of New York Magazine, in a feature that included photos of her modeling designer clothes in the Old State House in Dover.\n\nWhile she's breaking national barriers, she's not the only incoming lawmaker who is making state history. Three other newly elected Democrats — Rep. Eric Morrison, Sen. Marie Pinkney and Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton — are respectively the first openly gay man, first openly lesbian Black woman and first practicing Muslim lawmakers elected to the Delaware General Assembly.\n\nBIDEN BLASTS TRUMP FOR INSURRECTION:Biden blasts Trump for unleashing 'all-out assault' on democracy\n\nMcBride said she felt privileged to be part of an incoming class that is committed to more fully representing the diversity of the state.\n\nAt the end of the day, diversity in government isn't just about symbolism and messages, McBride said. Because the Delaware Legislature more fully looks like Delaware … the bills we pass will more fully address the wide range of needs and experiences that Delawareans of all backgrounds are facing right now.\n\nSarah Gamard covers government and politics for Delaware Online/The News Journal.

AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Latest on Wednesday at the Australian Open (all times local):\n\n11:55 p.m.\n\nThird-seeded Grigor Dimitrov has scraped into the third round of the Australian Open — just — with a tough five-set win over 186th-ranked qualifier Mackenzie McDonald, a former U.S collegiate champion from Los Angeles.\n\nDimitrov beat the 22-year-old McDonald 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 0-6, 8-6 in a late-night match at Rod Laver Arena that went nearly 3 1-2 hours.\n\nMcDonald double-faulted to set up match point, then netted a forehand to give Dimitrov the win.\n\nMcDonald won the NCAA singles and doubles title for UCLA in 2016. He had never won an ATP or Grand Slam singles match in four attempts until his victory in the first round over a fellow qualifier on Monday.\n\n____\n\n9:25 p.m.\n\nNick Kyrgios overcame distractions from a faulty speaker system at Hisense Arena and a lot of noise to beat Viktor Troicki 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (2) in the second round of the Australian Open.\n\nThe 17th-seeded Kyrgios complained numerous times to chair umpire James Keothavong about noise coming from his microphone during points. Eventually, the umpire turned the microphone off and just shouted the score after each point.\n\nKeothavong's night was about to get worse. With Kyrgios serving in the tiebreaker, Troicki hit an errant backhand return that slammed directly into the chair umpire's head. The Serbian player walked smiling to the umpire's chair to apologize, while Keothavong joked, It's not my day, is it?\n\nTroicki fended off one match point in the ninth game of the third set and then broke in the next game to force the tiebreaker, but he couldn't challenge Kyrgios in the decider.\n\nKyrgios has advanced beyond the third round only once at his home slam when he reached the quarterfinals in 2015.\n\n___\n\n9 p.m.\n\nAlize Cornet has beaten No. 12-seeded Julia Goerges 6-4, 6-3 to reach the third round of the Australian Open.\n\nNo. 42-ranked Cornet had taken only one set in five previous losses to Goerges, who was on a 15-match winning streak after her opening win at Melbourne Park. Goerges won the title at a warmup tournament in Auckland, New Zealand earlier this month and finished last year with titles at Moscow and Zhuhai.\n\n___\n\n8:50 p.m.\n\nRafael Nadal wants to see the roofs closed on the main show courts at the Australian Open if temperatures hit the forecast highs in the next couple days.\n\nTemperatures are expected to reach 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday and Friday as a heat wave passes through Melbourne.\n\nNadal said he believes the roofs at Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena and Hisense Arena should be closed to protect the players' health in extreme conditions.\n\nEven I like sometimes play with hot (temperatures), he said. When is too much, it becomes dangerous for the health. I would not like to see here retirements.\n\nThe Australian Open has an extreme heat policy that goes into effect when temperatures reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The roofs can be closed in such situations prior to the start of play.\n\nNadal isn't scheduled to play again until Friday. He said he's still avoiding the heat on Thursday and practicing indoors.\n\n____\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nTop-ranked Rafael Nadal is into the third round at Melbourne Park after beating Leonardo Mayer 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4).\n\nNadal, who lost in the final here last year to Roger Federer, served for the match but was broken in the 10th game, with Mayer hitting a cross-court winner that clipped the line.\n\nIn the tiebreaker, Nadal won on his first match point with a service winner.\n\nNadal will next play 28th-seeded Damir Dzumhur, who beat John Millman in four sets.\n\n_____\n\n6:45 p.m.\n\nFrench Open champion Jelena Ostapenko is through to the third round at Melbourne Park, beating Duan Yingying 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 on Margaret Court Arena.\n\nIt is the second year in a row that the seventh-seeded Ostapenko has advanced to the third round here after losing in the first round in her first appearance in Australia in 2016.\n\nOstapenko is playing her first Grand Slam with her new coach, Australian David Taylor.\n\n_____\n\n4:40 p.m.\n\nJo-Wilfried Tsonga came from 5-2 down in the fifth set to beat Denis Shapovalov 3-6, 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 in a second-round match on Margaret Court Arena.\n\nTsonga broke the Canadian's serve for the second consecutive time to level the match at 5-5, including a full stretch sideways on break point on an attempted passing shot by Shapovalov.\n\nAnother of Tsonga's array of shots during the final set included one from between his legs for a winner.\n\nHe finally clinched it on his first match point, ending the 3 hour, 37-minute match.\n\n_____ 4:20 p.m.\n\nSecond-seeded Caroline Wozniacki has come from 5-1 down in the third set and saved two match points to beat Jana Fett 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the second round.\n\nFett is ranked 119th and was making her first appearance in the main singles draw of a Grand Slam tournament.\n\nWozniacki twice broke Fett's service while the Croatian player was serving for the match, including the two match points in the seventh game.\n\nWozniacki then broke Fett's service in the 11th game, helped by a Fett double-fault on break point and an unforced error by the Croatian which ended a 26-point rally.\n\nShe then held serve, clinching it on her first match point when Fett netted a backhand, giving her a six-game winning streak to end the match.\n\n_____\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nTwo days after beating Venus Williams in the first round, Belinda Bencic is out of the Australian Open.\n\nBencic, who defeated Williams 6-3, 7-5, started out flatly and never recovered in losing to qualifier Luksika Kumkhum 6-1, 6-3 in a match on Melbourne Park's third show court.\n\nBencic, who has reached a career high No. 7 ranking but entered the Australian Open at No. 78, had beat the 124th-ranked Kumkhum in straight sets in both previous matches they'd played.\n\n_____\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nFourth-seeded Elina Svitolina has rallied to reach the third round of the Australian Open with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 win over Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic.\n\nSvitolina was 0 for 6 on break-point chances in the first set, but recovered to break Siniakova six times over the rest of the match.\n\nThe Ukrainian has now matched her best showing at the Australian Open, having reached the third round in four of the past five years.

Rick Jervis\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSen. Ted Cruz has surged to the top of the field in the Republican presidential race on the strength of his appeal as an anti-establishment outsider.\n\nBut one of his first forays into politics was as an ultimate insider working on the legal team in the 2000 Florida recount battle that ultimately awarded the White House to George W. Bush.\n\nCruz was a 29-year-old lawyer crafting legal policy for the Bush campaign when the 2000 presidential election between Bush and Vice President Al Gore ended in uncertainty due to dubious results from Florida. Both sides assembled legal teams that faced off in a U.S. Supreme Court battle.\n\nFormer secretaries of State James Baker and Warren Christopher led efforts for the Republicans and Democrats, respectively. The dramatic events were later detailed in several books and an HBO movie.\n\nCruz, who had clerked at the Supreme Court and worked at a Washington law firm before joining the campaign, devotes 14 pages in his autobiography, Ted Cruz: A Time for Truth, detailing the recount battle and the role he played in it.\n\nIn retrospect, it was pure serendipity that I found myself in the middle of this extraordinary legal proceeding, he writes in the book. As it happened, I was the only practicing litigator who'd been on the full-time campaign staff.\n\nUSA TODAY GOP Power Rankings: Trump, Cruz break away from the pack\n\nOne of the first moves Cruz made was to recruit his former Washington boss, Michael Carvin, into the legal fight. The Republican headquarters in Tallahassee was a chaotic cauldron of lawyers working on both state litigation for the Florida Supreme Court and the federal case, that wound its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nCruz's legal skills found him in the unique position of both helping with legal arguments and representing the client, in this case the Bush campaign, Carvin said. Ted's a very smart lawyer, a skilled lawyer, he said. He was a valuable team player.\n\nIn his book, Cruz highlights his contributions to the effort, including recruiting Washington lawyer and friend John Roberts, who later became chief justice, suggesting arguments for the Supreme Court case and bypassing sleep to finish briefs on time.\n\nIt was a madhouse, he writes. Indeed, in the first six days I was in Florida, I slept a total of seven hours.\n\nNoel Francisco, then a young Washington lawyer recruited by Cruz for the recount fight, remembers Cruz working long hours and a key factor in assembling the legal teams. At one point, Cruz hatched the argument for one of the earlier U.S. Supreme Court cases, Bush vs. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, which the justices unanimously upheld.\n\nTed was the guy who was essentially coordinating the legal arguments and pulling together the team, Francisco said. He played a leading role in running the litigation side.\n\nBut some of the key leaders on the legal team couldn't recall Cruz's role in the recount fight. Theodore Olson, who led the federal litigation and argued the final case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, said he remembered Cruz being on flights between Washington and Tallahassee but couldn't recall what contributions, if any, he'd made.\n\nOlson said he was puzzled when he read a recent profile in The New Yorker on Cruz, where the Texas senator described his role in the recount effort.\n\nHe was saying he was involved in a way I had not realized, Olson said. He was not involved in recruiting lawyers for the legal team that I was responsible for.\n\nTed Cruz's come-from-behind 2012 win could influence his presidential bid\n\nTed Cruz's dad walks fine line in son's campaign\n\nBarry Richard, a Florida lawyer who was lead counsel for the state litigation on behalf of the Bush team, also said Cruz didn't stand out from the more than 20 lawyers helping in the effort. During the 36-day legal battle that included more than 40 state cases, Cruz wasn't involved in any, as far he could recall, Richard said. The first time Richard heard of Cruz was when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012.\n\nI don't recall ever seeing or meeting Cruz, said Richard, a Democrat. He had no involvement in anything related to that state litigation.\n\nA Cruz spokesman referred USA TODAY to people on the recount legal team close to Cruz but didn't comment directly on his involvement in the effort.\n\nBaker, in a statement, recalled having Cruz on the legal team but couldn't point to any specific contributions he made. I will add that I have always considered Ted Cruz to have a bright legal mind, exactly what was needed during our time in Florida, the statement said.\n\nNicolle Wallace, a political commentator who worked on Bush's communications team during the Florida recount, does remember Cruz. In an interview last month with RealClearPolitics, Wallace alluded to the fact that Cruz wasn't well-liked on the campaign and was known more for self-promotion than his legal prowess.\n\nThe recount was ground zero for the biggest egos in both parties, she said. [Cruz] rose to the top in terms of hubris and egomania.\n\nIn his book, Cruz concedes that he was too cocky for my own good and that his attitude may have cost him a high-level job later in the Bush administration. I burned a fair number of bridges on the Bush campaign, he writes.\n\nIn one of the more dramatic passages in the book, Cruz recounts how he read the final U.S. Supreme Court decision as it came in via fax and is the first to tell Baker, It's over. We've won. The former secretary of State then telephones Bush to tell him the news.\n\nFor the Record: Sign up for our politics newsletter
The Federal Aviation Administration has adopted a stricter unruly flyer policy the week after a riot by supporters of President Donald Trump on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol and incidents on multiple airlines on the way to and from Washington.\n\nThe FAA shared the news in a tweet Wednesday.\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson signed an order directing the agency to take strong action against any passenger who disrupts or threatens the safety of a flight, with penalties ranging from fines to jail time. No warnings! the FAA wrote, linking to the announcement.\n\nIn the statement, the FAA shared that it has seen a disturbing increase in incidents in which passengers have disrupted flights with violent behavior or threats of violent behavior. These incidents have stemmed both from passengers' refusals to wear masks and from recent violence at the U.S. Capitol, the FAA specified in the statement.\n\nFlying is the safest mode of transportation and I signed this order to keep it that way, Dickson said in the statement Wednesday.\n\nThe most notable part of the new order? No warnings.\n\nIn the past, the FAA has addressed incidents including unruly passengers with different methods including warnings and counseling, sometimes issuing civil penalties.\n\nEffective immediately, however, the FAA will not address these cases with warnings or counseling, the FAA said. The agency will pursue legal enforcement action against any passenger who assaults, threatens, intimidates, or interferes with airline crew members. This policy will be in effect through March 30, 2021.\n\nFederal law prohibits an individual from physically assaulting or threatening to physically assault the crew or anyone else on an aircraft, the FAA reminded its followers in a tweet over the weekend. Passengers could be subject to fines of up to $35,000 or imprisonment should they conduct themselves in that manner.\n\nWhat happened on flights post Capitol riot\n\nAlaska Airlines spokesman Ray Lane said a number of passengers on Thursday's nearly-full Flight 1085 from Washington Dulles International following the riot at the Capitol were non-mask-compliant, rowdy, argumentative and harassed our crew members'' on the five-hour flight to Seattle. As a result, 14 of them are banned from flying Alaska as long as its pandemic mask policy is in place.\n\nAlaska wasn't the only airline with issues on flights out of Washington after the riot. Delta Air Lines removed two unruly'' passengers flying from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Minneapolis on Friday afternoon, spokesman Morgan Durrant told USA TODAY.\n\nFriday, an American Airlines pilot flying from Washington to Phoenix went viral with his threat to put the plane down in the middle of Kansas and dump people off if passengers on board did not behave.\n\nAmanda Head, the woman who posted the video, tweeted that his warning came after several passengers chanted Fight for Trump and USA.\n\nUnreal, one passenger can be heard saying after the pilot's announcement, and someone asked: Isn't this American Airlines?\n\nPrior to departure from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the pilot on board flight 1242 made an announcement emphasizing the importance of following crew member instructions and complying with mandatory face-covering policies, American spokesperson Derek Walls said in a statement. No further in-flight issues were reported.\n\nCongressman: Put Capitol rioters on federal no-fly list\n\nIf Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., has his way, Capitol riot participants might face a bigger problem than being removed from a flight or banned by one particular airline.\n\nOne day after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee urged the Transportation Security Administration and the FBI to put participants of the Capitol riot on the federal no-fly list.\n\nGiven the heinous domestic terrorist attack on the U.S. Capitol yesterday, I am urging the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use their authorities to add the names of all identified individuals involved in the attack to the federal No Fly List and keep them off planes, he said. This should include all individuals identified as having entered the Capitol building – an intrusion which threatened the safety of Members of Congress and staff and served as an attack on our Nation.\n\nThompson continued, We already saw reports of 'unruly mobs' in air on the way to Washington, D.C. It does not take much imagination to envision how they might act out on their way out of D.C. if allowed to fly unfettered. This is an action that TSA and the FBI, by law, are able to take but, to my knowledge, have not yet taken. Alleged perpetrators of a domestic terrorist attack who have been identified by the FBI should be held accountable.\n\nThe FBI decides whom to place on the federal No Fly List, and the TSA enforces it by denying boarding passes to banned individuals. According to the Department of Homeland Security website, Individuals on the No Fly List are prevented from boarding an aircraft when flying within, to, from and over the United States.\n\nTSA is always on high alert, TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein told USA TODAY. We prepare for all contingencies.\n\nHowever, citing national security reasons, she declined to go into detail on TSA's plans for handling in-flight and airport incidents relating to the Capitol riots.\n\nThere are always multiple layers of security in place and that travelers may notice additional law enforcement and canine presence, especially when events justify an increased security posture, she said. As it relates to the No Fly List, we will accommodate FBI requests and congressional authorizations related to no-fly lists.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the FBI for comment on its plans for handling participants of the Capitol riots.\n\nLast year, Rep. Justin Amash, D-Mich., introduced a bill that would have actually made it harder to put Americans on the no-fly list by requiring that they be convicted of a federal terrorism crime first. However, he has since left Congress.\n\nIn a statement issued the day of the Capitol attack, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA called for revoking the flight privileges of those involved in the riot as well as in-flight incidents to and from Washington.\n\nActs against our democracy, our government and the freedom we claim as Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight, Sara Nelson said. We in aviation have a serious role to play in national security. Airlines, in coordination with TSA, DHS, FAA, DOT and law enforcement must take all steps to ensure the safety and security of passengers and crew by leaving all problems on the ground.\n\nSocial media reckoning after Capitol riots: Apple suspends Parler from its App Store while Amazon will shut off web hosting service over violence threats\n\nContributing: Dawn Gilbertson
Alysha Tsuji\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIn one of the most hilarious moments of the NFL season, Odell Beckham Jr. got down on one knee and proposed to the kicking net after scoring a game-winning 66-yard touchdown on Oct. 16. What may have been overlooked is that he did so while sporting cleats with the pink Nintendo character Kirby on them.\n\nArtist Troy Cole, who also goes by the name Kickasso and runs a business called Kickasso Kustoms, painted the pink cleats. He said Beckham was trying to think of a unique way to recognize National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and when Cole mentioned Kirby, the wide receiver loved the idea. Though, as Cole noted, he risked a fine for wearing them from the NFL for violating its uniform policy.\n\n(Photo: Michael Reaves/Getty Images, Kickasso Kustoms)\n\nWhile it may be funny to think of a superstar athlete on a multi-million dollar contract catching footballs with a cute pink videogame character on his shoes, distinctive cleat art is more popular in the NFL now than ever before.\n\nAlthough players sometimes get hefty fines for breaking the NFL's uniform policy, the custom cleats business is booming. To get around the uniform rules, some players only wear their stylish shoes during warmups.\n\nThe league took notice and created the My Cause My Cleats campaign for Week 13 this year, in which players were encouraged to wear cleats designed to represent a charity of their choice (as long as it was approved by the league first).\n\nBack in November, Super Bowl MVP Von Miller told For The Win that he really liked the idea of the charity cleats week and wished the NFL would have more weeks that allow players to express themselves. When asked what he likes about customized shoes, Miller said:\n\nIt creates a different feeling when you have the only pair of these cleats out. It's just a great feeling just to be different, even if it is for cleats.\n\nBehind the cleats exists a growing community of artists. Eric Dorsey II, of the custom sneaker business called illustrative Cre8ions, has noticed the boom since he started his business in August of 2015. Dorsey said that he saw it really start with the artist who made the all-gold cleats for Marshawn Lynch - the ones NFL refused to let Lynch wear in the playoffs - and since then, he estimates there are about 12 designers working now, spread across the U.S.\n\nOther artists who have been in the business for well over a year credit the boom to social media and word of mouth. If a player sees amazing cleats on Instagram, he might hit up a local artist and ask if he can get a unique pair for himself. It has even become an off-the-field competition as the business has gotten bigger.\n\nThey're in a league where they're wearing helmets and can't show their faces, so they need some sort of way to get their personality out there, said Dan Gamache of Mache Custom Kicks. You'll see guys with the pregame cleats with spikes or god knows what else. It's a really cool way for them to express themselves, and also be competitive with each other. I know I've gotten a request from a player and they're like, 'Make mine better than his.' That's the fun part of it for sure.\n\nWhile there's growth and word is spreading, obviously, not everyone is cut out to be a sneaker artist. The three artists who talked to For The Win made certain aspects sound easy when asked about their creative process and their art backgrounds (the process, they said, is fairly instantaneous with little planning involved, and none of them had any formal art training), but it takes more than that to turn it into a full-time gig.\n\nHere's a look into the pro cleats business, from these three artists:\n\nEric Dorsey II of illustrative Cre8ions\n\nStarted: August 2015\n\n32 NFL clients\n\nTroy Cole of Kickasso Kustoms\n\nStarted: 2011\n\nAbout 30 NFL clients\n\nL to R: Von Miller, Odell Beckham Jr., Troy Cole (Photo courtesy of Kickasso Kustoms)\n\nDan Gamache of Mache Custom Kicks\n\nStarted: Summer of 2004\n\nRegularly about 10 NFL clients\n\nWhat does it take to be a great cleat artist?\n\nDorsey: Creativity and originality. That's one of the things I always speak about. I try to differentiate from the different artists is that we're all artists, we're all unique, we all have our own thing, so just be yourself. Do you.\n\nAs far as cleats, I say the whole creativity part, that's where the illustrated creation comes in. We are creating a shoe. Everything that I do, I want to be able to make something that you won't see on the sneaker shelves. When you go to your local store or you want to look online, you won't find anything else like this, and I think I've done a really good job of just sticking to that, and being different and unique.\n\nCole: I would just say consistency and a good communication with your client is the main thing. Of course you have to be a good artist, but I think that goes without saying. But the other things are what gives you longevity in the business for sure.\n\nGamache: I think the best thing is really to be able to channel the person's themes or idea and easily translate it and also make it something that, my whole thing is to make it look like something that makes it look like it came on the shoe. I'm very big on trying to stick with the aesthetics of the shoe, so I'll use lines that are on the shoe.\n\nThe other part is just something being wearable. Everyone can paint on a shoe, but if you don't do the proper preparations to make the paint adhere, it can easily crack and peel when they wear them. When I started doing the cleats, it was a learning process to figure out what's the best way to make it happen and now it's like a science. It's like painting a car, pretty much. You can have the best paint job in the world, but if it's not prepped properly, then it's kind of a waste.\n\nWhat's your favorite part?\n\nDorsey: Wow, honestly, it's the reaction I receive from the athlete afterwards. They're like kids on Christmas. They know they're getting this - they know what's happening - and then when they actually get it, they open up that box, they pull the paper back, and they see, 'Oh wow, wooooow,' they pick up the shoe, they want to take pictures with it, they tag me in photos.\n\nI love the fact that I can bring joy to someone just by creating something, because you never know what they're going through or what's going on in their minds, whether it's a confidence booster, whether it's something they want to have as a commemorative item. I am excited that I'm able to do that for them and also be able to see that as well on a daily basis.\n\nCole: Just getting to meet all the new people that shoes have brought into my life is my favorite part, just meeting new people and really creating cool things that haven't been created before.\n\nGamache: It's still the art. At the end of the day I was always an art guy. I played baseball most of my life and I did art, so a mix of the two things that I always was into as a little kid is great. I can get up every day and do something that I love. It sounds so cliche because everyone always dreams of doing what they love, but it still doesn't feel like work. Very seldom do I dread going into the studio to go work.\n\nHow tough was it to get started?\n\nDorsey: It was kind of tough to get started because it's not like, say you go work at McDonald's or something like that, you wear the uniform - there is no uniform for this. No one tells you what to do. It's research, trial and error. So when I first started, my first couple pair of cleats that I had done just for fellas that I knew locally that played sports, they failed because I was using the wrong paint.\n\nThen, once I found out what the right paint was, I realized I need this particular airgun because I had just done everything by hand. But now, in terms of the amount of money that I put into it, yes, I'm sitting here in my workshop right now, and yeah, there's a lot of stuff in here that was not here when I initially started.\n\nCole: Finding out the correct process, I think, was the most difficult part where people would be happy with their shoes once they got them and were able to wear them. As far as the paint and everything and the equipment, it's not like crazy, there's a lot more involved in painting a car than there is in painting a shoe.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr.'s Craig Sager tribute cleats (Photo courtesy of Kickasso Kustoms)\n\nGamache: Oh yeah, when I started there was no YouTube on how to do this. I was just going to the local art store and getting regular acrylic paint which had no business being on a shoe. As time went on you learn, and I found out other people were doing what I was doing, so it was kind of like a network of what things work, what things don't work and we (artists in an online forum) would kind of trade secrets and tips and things like that and a lot of constructive criticism. That's how we grew. There wasn't a wealth of knowledge like there is now for these newer guys where they can just go on YouTube and learn how to paint cleats, so I just did a lot of shoes to figure out what did and what didn't work.\n\nHow did you build your client list?\n\nDorsey: Danny Lansanah, at the time, he was playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and he gave me my first opportunity to do cleats for him, and that was a great experience. Then, I just continued to reach out to different athletes that my players may have known (Dorsey is a former semipro and pro indoor football league coach) or that they're familiar with. They'd let me know, 'Hey, I got a guy,' or via social media, you may just post pictures, and if you put the right hashtags, players will see them. They're on there all the time, so they'll notice it.\n\nCole: He (Arian Foster, first NFL client) linked up with me through Instagram. That's pretty much how everything got started: just word of mouth and Instagram and things like that.\n\nGamache: It's been pretty organic. Any co-signs that I've had or any referrals have been really word of mouth. I've never placed an ad or anything like that. I ended up befriending a lot of these athletes. I think they feel comfortable with me getting their vision out through shoes.
College football is bringing its national championship game to New Orleans on Monday for the fifth time, cementing its status as America's preeminent venue for big sporting events. In the modern era, no city has hosted more Super Bowls, more BCS/College Football Playoff title games or more Final Fours.\n\nBut as we enter the 2020s, America's sports host of the future could be up for grabs because of Las Vegas, which suddenly has two major professional teams, more than $2 billion worth of new facilities and a strong desire to attract the same events that regularly come through New Orleans. The only question is, will the Final Four or the CFP championship game get there first?\n\nI'll be in shock if they don't come to Las Vegas, said Jim Livengood, the longtime former athletics director at Arizona and UNLV, who has spent significant time in his retirement lobbying for big college sports events to come to Las Vegas. It has to be the right event for the right site for the right time of year, and it doesn't fit for every sport. But for five or six it works really well.\n\nLast May, the NCAA finally rescinded its policy that banned championship events from being played in states that offered sports gambling, which previously only applied to Nevada but was suddenly going to eliminate more than 10 states that immediately legalized it in the wake of the Supreme Court's landmark 2018 decision.\n\nOf course, the NCAA rule never made sense in the first place. Beyond college programs coming to play at UNLV and Nevada for decades, Las Vegas has hosted a bowl game since 1992, the Mountain West basketball tournament since 2000 and the Pac-12 tournament since 2013. Moreover, with online and offshore sports gambling becoming prevalent over the last decade, the stigma of college games being played in close proximity to casinos and sports books is no longer tethered to reality.\n\nELITE LEVEL:Lawrence, Burrow playing best ball entering title matchup\n\nTOO RISKY:For Tua Tagovailoa, the only decision was to leave Alabama\n\nONE THAT GOT AWAY:Orgeron 'sick to my stomach' about Clemson's Etienne\n\nStill, it'll be a big moment for college sports when the NCAA or the CFP eventually bring their championship events to Las Vegas. But when's it going to happen, and once it does, will Sin City become as much a part of the regular rotation that hosts these things as New Orleans, Atlanta, Phoenix, Dallas and Indianapolis?\n\nWe know that Las Vegas is an attractive destination for championships and we fully believe we are becoming the epicenter of sports, UNLV athletics director Desiree Reed-Francois said. In conjunction with our community partners, we're being aggressive in trying to host championship events.\n\nThe biggest issue, at least in the near-term, is availability. Though the NCAA men's basketball committee met and toured venues in Las Vegas last summer and has a delegation visiting again in the coming weeks, Final Four sites are booked through 2026, though Las Vegas could bid on NCAA tournament regional sites as early as 2023.\n\nAs an independent organization, the CFP is not bound by whatever decision the NCAA makes with respect to Las Vegas and the basketball tournament but only has two unawarded championship games in 2025 and 2026, which marks the end of the Playoff's current 12-year contract with ESPN. The bidding process for those games is yet to begin, but Las Vegas has already indicated it will make a strong run at holding one of them in the new $1.8 billion Allegiant Stadium, which sits just across Interstate 15 from the South end of the Strip.\n\nBill Hancock, the CFP's executive director, wrote in an email that he expects a number of cities to be interested hosting for 2026 and 2026 and noted that it has been good for college football that they've awarded the game around to 10 different places for the first 10 years of the event.\n\nIt wouldn't be right for me to speculate about any potential host, Hancock said. I don't want to handicap the field, except to say it will be a fascinating race.\n\nLas Vegas should be a no-brainer for one of those two slots, though, and the CFP should be positioning itself to get there before the Super Bowl (2025 is the NFL's next open slot) and the Final Four, as there could be significant cachet that comes along with being first.\n\nBut there are a couple potential complications.\n\nThe CFP is going to Miami in 2021, Indianapolis in 2022, the new Los Angeles stadium in 2023 and Houston in 2024. Would going back out to the Pacific time zone in 2025 be too soon after L.A.? Also, the Consumer Electronics Show, which brings 170,000 people to Vegas annually, often takes place in a similar window to the CFP championship game around that weekend after New Year's. The CES has not posted dates for 2025 and 2026 yet, but that could be a potential complication to keep in mind.\n\nIf that hurdle could be worked out, though, Vegas could very well establish itself as the absolute best venue for the game period. As fans have discovered over the first six years of the CFP, it is not a bowl week type of event. Fans typically come in at some point the weekend before the Monday night game and leave the next day. Also, because the travel plans for the winning semifinal teams are made on somewhat short notice, availability of affordable flights and hotel rooms is paramount.\n\nFrom that standpoint, places like Dallas and Atlanta work exceedingly well. For entertainment options and good weather, cities like New Orleans and Miami come to the front of the pack. But it's hard to imagine anywhere combining ease of travel with logistics like Las Vegas.\n\nThere's so many similarities to New Orleans, Livengood said. Everything is so darn close. The stadium, there isn't anything you can't do just by walking to it. It checks every single box. And the big thing is Vegas wants it. Vegas has really stepped up in terms of realizing this can be a market for athletics.\n\nThis weekend in New Orleans, tens of thousands of LSU and Clemson fans will be taking over the French Quarter prior to the national championship on Monday night, a tradition that dates back decades for college sports fans. Hopefully, it will continue for decades more.\n\nBut the momentum is there now for Vegas to provide the same kind of platform for the biggest events in the coming years. Hopefully it won't take college athletics much longer to embrace it.
Maureen Groppe and Bill Theobald\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON – Having taken control of the House on Thursday, Democrats will move to immediately set a different direction through new rules.\n\nThe package of changes ranges from those encouraging diversity – such as allowing religious head scarves to be worn on the House floor – to tougher ethics rules and tweaked legislative procedures that will make it easier to raise taxes.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was elected speaker, helped secure the votes she needed by agreeing to changes sought by moderates aimed at easing the passage of bills with broad bipartisan support. That provision even earned the package the support of one Republican, Rep. Tom Reed of New York, who said Wednesday he will take the rare step of crossing party lines to vote for it.\n\nThe changes face opposition from some liberal members who argued new budget rules would make it harder to expand social programs.\n\nBecause most Republicans – who set their own rules when they were in charge – are likely to oppose the changes, Democrats probably can't lose more than 18 votes to enact the package.\n\nHere's a look at some of the proposed changes:\n\nMaking it easier to raise taxes but still hard to increase spending\n\nDemocrats want to end a GOP rule that required supermajority support from three-fifths of House members to raise taxes. They want to reinstate a pay as you go – or PAYGO – rule requiring tax cuts or new spending programs be offset with new taxes or spending cuts. (Republicans required that only new spending to be offset.) A few Democrats said they will vote against the entire package, arguing PAYGO would keep Democrats from expanding health care coverage and making other critical investments in education and infrastructure.\n\nPAYGO isn't only bad economics ... it's also a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg, tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that if Democrats want to pay for such programs by raising taxes on the rich or on corporations, as some have suggested, PAYGO would help them do that.\n\nGoldwein called the budget rule changes sensible but said they will matter only if lawmakers follow them. They can waive them at any point, he said.\n\nCombating climate change\n\nCombating climate change was a campaign issue for Democrats in 2018, and Pelosi responded by relaunching a special House panel to shine a light on the issue.\n\nThe 15-member bipartisan panel, to be headed by Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., will have at least six Republicans and have until March 31, 2020, to issue policy recommendations.\n\nThe panel has limitations. It won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. It could get caught up in a turf war with some of the standing congressional committees that oversee the environment. And it will have to submit its recommendations to those congressional committees, which will decide whether to act on them.\n\nToughening ethics\n\nThe Democratic House proposal would toughen some rules governing the conduct of members – and may lead to further tightening down the line.\n\nMajor provisions include a requirement that House members reimburse taxpayers for any settlements that are the result of discrimination by that member based on race, religion, sex, national origin or disability, among others. The change is in reaction to revelations in recent years that taxpayers paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle such claims.\n\nAll House members would be required to go through annual ethics training, under another provision. Previously, only new members were required to take the training.\n\nLawmakers would be banned from serving as an officer or director at a public company. Craig Holman, with the good government group Public Citizen, said this provision is the result of the indictment of Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., for alleged insider trading involving a pharmaceutical company on whose board he sat. No other members serve on the boards of public companies, Holman said, but about 190 House members hold other positions involving public or private firms.\n\nThe same provision calls for the House ethics committee to develop regulations by the end of 2019 to address other involvement by members in companies that could pose a conflict of interest. Holman said he would like to see a ban on members trading stock in companies that do business that falls under the oversight of their committees.\n\nDefending Obamacare\n\nThe changes allow Democrats to get involved in the pending challenge to the Affordable Care Act after a federal judge in Texas ruled the landmark health care law unconstitutional. The Trump administration is not defending parts of the law, including its popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions. A group of Democratic states and congressional Democrats plans to appeal the ruling, which will head to the 5th Circuit.\n\nFighting food stamp changes\n\nAfter House Republicans failed last year to enact an expansion of work requirements for food stamp recipients, the Trump administration announced in December plans to tighten rules on its own. Democrats' rule package directs the House to explore ways to respond to the administration's proposed changes.\n\nPromoting, protecting diversity\n\nThe rules ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. An Office of Diversity and Inclusion would be created to increase diversity in the congressional workforce. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit group that attempts to improve the socioeconomic status and civic engagement of African-Americans, issued a series of reports highlighting the lack of diversity among congressional staffs.\n\nOne issued last fall that looked at the staff makeup of the congressional delegations in six states found, for example, that none of the senators had a top black staffer. In December, the group launched an online tool to track newly hired top staff of new and returning members.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nDemocrats want to honor our commitment to workers by putting labor back in the Committee on Education and Labor. The Republicans called the panel the Committee on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThe word government would be dropped from the name of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The change is intended to emphasize that the investigative panel's jurisdiction covers both government and the private sector. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who will chair the committee, said he plans to examine the opioid crisis and the cost of prescription drugs and to investigate the Trump administration.\n\nContributing: Ledyard King
WASHINGTON – Turkey's president is fuming. Israeli leaders are nervous. Syrian Kurds are terrified.\n\nThat's the global state-of-play three weeks after President Donald Trump abruptly announced a decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump National Security Adviser John Bolton are now on separate swings through the Middle East, where they're both trying to calm jittery U.S. allies – and to walk back the president's statements.\n\nThere's been a lot of noise about this withdrawal from Syria, and we want to make sure they understand completely what that means, Pompeo told CNBC in an interview Monday before leaving for the diplomatic blitz.\n\nThat noise started on Dec. 19, when Trump abruptly announced a decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria, where they have been fighting ISIS. Trump declared three weeks ago the 2,000 American troops in Syria are all coming back, and they're coming back now and that that ISIS had been vanquished – an assertion experts say is inaccurate.\n\nBolton contradicted the president during a stop in Israel on Sunday – saying U.S. troops would only leave Syria once ISIS is completely eradicated and the U.S. had secured assurances from Turkey that it would not attack Kurdish fighters allied with the U.S. The Syrian Kurds have been America's most important ally in the fight against ISIS.\n\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton told reporters in Jerusalem.\n\nBolton then went to Ankara to ask Turkey not to slaughter the Kurds, as Pompeo put it last week. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded angrily to Bolton's entreaty, noting that Turkey views the Kurdish fighters as a terrorist group.\n\nIt is not possible to accept or swallow the message given by Bolton, Erdogan told lawmakers in Turkey's parliament on Tuesday.\n\nPompeo may get a similarly chilly reception on his eight-country tour of the Middle East, which started Tuesday in Jordan and will include stops in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Trump's chief diplomat said his main goal is to reassure America's Arab allies that the U.S. is not abandoning the Middle East – specifically its efforts to curb Iran's influence in the region.\n\nOur mission set in the region remains unchanged, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him on the trip. He declined to say what timetable, if any, the Trump administration has set for America's withdraw from Syria. And he insisted there was no difference between Trump's call for a speedy withdraw and Bolton's conditional timeline.\n\nBut Middle East experts say Bolton's conditions will be difficult to meet and could mean that U.S. troops remain in Syria indefinitely. But Trump has undermined Pompeo and Bolton, with allies unsure of who or what to believe, they argued.\n\nIn addition to the troop withdraw in Syria, Trump said last week that Iran can do whatever they want in Syria. That was particularly unsettling to Israeli leaders, who fear that Iran is trying to get a military foothold in Syria.\n\nNatan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank, said Trump showed his true colors when he announced the Syria withdrawal.\n\nHis instincts about the Middle East are quite consistent over time … which is to say he doesn't quite see the point, Sachs said. He would rather not have anything to do with the mess called the Middle East.\n\nSachs said Trump has built up considerable goodwill with U.S. allies in the Middle East because of other policy decisions. But it's not going to be easy for Pompeo to calm them over Trump's latest actions, he said.\n\nGerald Feierstein, a former ambassador to Yemen and now a senior vice president at the Middle East Institute, said Trump's statements can't be taken back, no matter how hard Pompeo and Bolton try to tweak the president's message.\n\nNone of these people can say that they speak authoritatively for where the Trump administration is, Feierstein said. He can upend anything that they say in one tweet.\n\nHe said Trump's moves will have far-reaching consequences beyond America's influence in the Middle East.\n\nThe real damage … is that it has once again reduced the sense that the United States is a reliable partner, Feierstein said. And what you're seeing is an increasing move on the part of our traditional friends and partners in the region to hedge their bets – to look at Moscow to look at Beijing for alliances.\n\nRelated:\n\nBob Corker relished public feuds with Trump.

Dexter Lawrence may have played his last game as a Clemson Tiger.\n\nLawrence's season ended abruptly on Dec. 20 after a failed drug test. Lawrence, formerly a starting tackle and central cog in Clemson's exceptional defensive front, Zach Giella, a backup offensive lineman, and Braden Galloway, a freshman tight end, were disqualified from the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 29.\n\nClemson athletic director Dan Radakovich announced Thursday afternoon that those three players will also miss the College Football Playoff national championship game.\n\nOn Dec. 20, the NCAA notified Radakovich that Lawrence, Giella and Galloway's tests revealed trace amounts of ostarine, a banned anabolic substance utilized primarily to generate lean muscle.\n\nA B sample also returned positive on Dec. 27. The players' suspensions were upheld for the Cotton Bowl semifinal. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney hoped the appeal Clemson immediately initiated would conclude and clear the players before the national title game Monday against Alabama.\n\nYet, in a university release, Radakovich intimated that mere preparation for the appeal will be conducted over the coming weeks. He said the NCAA has permitted the three players to travel with the team to Santa Clara, California, but that neither Clemson, Galloway, Giella nor Lawrence anticipate having further comment on this matter until after the appeals have concluded.\n\nThe NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports will hear the appeal via teleconference.\n\nAccording to NCAA policy, Clemson can challenge the validity of the test by disputing the integrity of the collection and testing processes or by contending that a player did not know or could not have known or reasonably suspected that he had been administered a substance by another person that later is found to have contained a banned ingredient.\n\nA school can also assert that the suspended athletes were misinformed by an athletics administrator after a reasonable inquiry on the substance. However, that argument could prompt institutional sanctions.\n\nIf the appeal is denied, the players would lose one season of eligibility and could not return to competition until a full calendar year after their tests were initially collected. They would need to pass a drug test to be reinstated.\n\nLawrence is projected as a first-round selection in the upcoming NFL draft. He was expected to forgo his senior season anyway, so any pending suspension is moot. However, he could pursue the appeal to clear his name.\n\nGalloway is a freshman and would not be able to return fully until 2020. Giella is a junior and would lose his senior season.\n\nSenior Albert Huggins is expected to start again in place of Lawrence against Alabama. He ensured that Clemson did not miss Lawrence's production against Notre Dame, forcing a fumble and getting a critical quarterback hurry early against the Irish.

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump blasted his former Defense secretary on Wednesday, claiming he essentially fired James Mattis.\n\nWhat's he done for me? Trump asked during a Cabinet meeting that reporters observed for about 90 minutes. Trump specifically criticized the former top military aide on Afghanistan, suggesting U.S. military policy was not too good under his command.\n\nI'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan, Trump said. As you know, President Obama fired him and essentially so did I.\n\nMattis, in fact, resigned last month, citing disagreements with Trump on Syria and global alliances in a lengthy resignation letter. Trump announced on Dec. 23 that Mattis would leave on Jan. 1 rather than the previously announced resignation date of Feb. 28.\n\nMore:Defense Secretary Jim Mattis leaving his job after clash with Trump over Syria\n\nAlso:President Trump orders Defense Secretary James Mattis to leave immediately\n\nTrump was set to meet with congressional leaders Wednesday to discuss the partial government shutdown, and most of his remarks focused on that issue. The president said he is sticking by a demand for $5 billion in funding for a proposed border wall.\n\nTrump also touched on several other topics:\n\nFlanked by acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, Trump touted progress with North Korea. He said he had received a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and said there would have been a big fat war in Asia if he had not met with Kim in June. We'll probably now have another meeting, Trump said. He'd like to meet, I'd like to meet.\n\nThe president pushed back on criticism from Utah Sen.-elect Mitt Romney, who recently wrote that Trump has not risen to the mantle of the office. Trump said he wished Romney could be more of a team player. Trump added that I endorsed him and he thanked me profusely.\n\nTrump discussed the wild swings in the stock market in recent days. He described the turbulence as a little glitch in the stock market last month and predicted markets would stabilize after he finishes negotiating new trade deals.\n\nThe president declined to be pinned down on a timeline for U.S. withdrawal from Syria, which he announced Dec. 19. Syria was lost long ago, the president said. We're talking about sand and death. We're not talking about vast wealth.\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook
Paul Davidson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers vigorously debated whether to launch its $600 billion bond buying stimulus in November 2010, with several officials doubting it would lift the sluggish economy, transcripts from a Fed meeting show.\n\nIn the end, only Kansas City Fed chief Thomas Hoenig opposed the program, commonly known as QE2, for the Fed's second round of quantitative easing. But other Fed hawks — those worried about the risk of inflation — voiced more concerns than were publicly aired at the time of the November 2-3 meeting.\n\nI'm far from convinced that more monetary accommodation can do much, if anything, to speed up the pace of this recovery at this point, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said at the meeting. The Fed releases transcripts of its meetings annually after a five-year lag.\n\nLatest on markets:\n\nStock Market and Investment News - USATODAY.com\n\nA similar $1.7 trillion dollar bond purchase program in 2009 was credited with preventing the economy from spiraling into a deeper recession or even depression after lending channels froze. But with long-term interest rates already low, Fed officials fretted that another move to push down rates further eventually would stoke excessive inflation without stimulating more borrowing by consumers and businesses.\n\nI remain opposed to 'shock and awe' approaches to monetary policy, St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard said. The Fed is capable of a lot of things, but is not capable, in my view, of moving the dial tremendously on economic growth from here.\n\nDallas Fed President Richard Fisher noted that by printing more money and lowering Treasury yields, the Fed would open itself to further criticism that it's encouraging more U.S. borrowing and a wider federal deficit. We would be waving a red flag in the face of those who are our most volatile critics, he said.\n\nBy the fall of 2010, job growth remained meager, the unemployment rate was about 9.5% and inflation was feeble. Supporters of another stimulus believed it at least would weaken the dollar, bolstering exports, and drive investments to higher-yielding stocks, making consumers feel wealthier so they'll spend more.\n\nPumping more money into the banking system and economy also could push up low inflation, which threatened a further downturn if consumers put off purchases on the expectation that prices would remain flat or could even fall.\n\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke expressed concerns about a deflationary trap, as well as the risk that the sluggish recovery could leave permanent effects on the economy. Bond purchases, he noted, could nudge up consumer prices by changing the public's inflation expectations.\n\nThe point here is only that, if the economy slows considerably more, the possibility that will get into a bad spiral of declining confidence, spending and income is something to be worried about, he said. And given the lack of tools that we do have, our ability to address that situation would be limited.\n\nAnticipation that the Fed would buy more bonds already had driven up stock prices and pushed down long-term interest rates in the months leading up to the meeting, perhaps spurring more borrowing, at least on the margins.\n\nIn the end, the Fed's then incoming vice chair and current chair, Janet Yellen, coalesced the views of most Fed policymakers.\n\nThe outlook for employment and inflation are dismal, she said. She added that bond purchases are not a panacea, but they can make a meaningful difference.\n\nAt the meeting, the Fed weighed whether to buy $1 trillion in Treasury bonds, as some economists and investors anticipated, $600 billion, or doing nothing.\n\nYellen argued for the middle ground of $600 billion, noting the Fed could expand the program if necessary, so we can see how economic conditions are evolving once the program gets underway. The Fed bought $75 billion a month in Treasury bonds, ending the program in June 2011.\n\nIt ultimately launched a third round of bond purchases in fall 2013 that it concluded about a year later. It raised its benchmark short-term interest rate last month for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nPaul Davidson on Twitter: @PDavidsonusat.
AP\n\nSURPRISE, Ariz. (AP) — The Texas Rangers acquired right-handed knuckleballer Eddie Gamboa from the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday, when they placed reliever Jake Diekman and first baseman Prince Fielder on the 60-day disabled list.\n\nThe moves by the AL West champions came on the same day pitchers and catchers reported to spring training.\n\nFielder was forced to quit playing last summer after his second neck surgery, but is under contract through 2020 for $24 million a season. He has to remain on the Rangers roster for them to recoup some of that money through an insurance policy.\n\nDiekman is expected to miss at least half of the season during treatment for the ulcerative colitis, a digestive condition he has dealt with much of his life. He had surgery Jan. 25, the first of a series of scheduled procedures to remove his colon. Even though he can't participate in any individual or team drills, Diekman was in camp Tuesday to be with his teammates\n\nGamboa goes to the Rangers for a player to be named later or cash considerations. He was 0-2 with a 1.35 ERA in seven relief appearances for the Rays last season, the first major league action for the 32-year-old pitcher.\n\nSince Fielder didn't formally retire, he had to remain on the Rangers' 40-man roster during the offseason. But he can be placed on the 60-day disabled list once camp opens and not count against their roster limit.\n\nFielder got a $214 million, nine-year contract in 2012 from Detroit, which traded the slugger to Texas after two seasons. The Tigers owe Texas $6 million apiece in 2017 and '18, and $7 million in each of the following two years as part of that November 2013 deal. The Rangers are responsible for the remainder, about half of which will be covered by disability insurance.
Former Attorney General William Barr was on Capitol Hill Tuesday for confirmation hearings after President Donald Trump nominated him to return to his role as head of the Justice Department.\n\nBecause the new attorney general will oversee special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election, Trump's nomination has received more scrutiny from the public and politicians than usual.\n\nTrump's critics have been anxious for him to replace acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who they say is unqualified and unfit to oversee Mueller's investigation. Many of those same critics have expressed concerns about Barr because of his previous statements and opinions on the extent of executive power.\n\nSo who is the man Trump picked to replace the ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions?\n\nFollow live blog:Barr tells senators he doesn't think Mueller would pursue 'witch hunt'\n\nWilliam Barr:7 things to watch at Senate confirmation hearing for Trump's AG pick\n\nEarly years\n\nBarr, 68, earned his undergraduate degree in government from Columbia University in 1971 and his master's degree in government and Chinese studies from the same university in 1973, according to his profile at his current law firm, Kirkland & Ellis. After receiving his graduate degree he spent fours years working for the CIA.\n\nBarr got his law degree from George Washington University in 1977, where he graduated with highest honors. After clerking for Judge Malcolm Wilkey of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Barr went to work in the Reagan administration.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1983, he served on the White House domestic policy staff. After leaving, he joined the law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge as a partner and worked there until 1989.\n\nAs attorney general\n\nBarr returned to government service in 1989, becoming assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel during the George H.W. Bush administration. He became deputy attorney general in 1990 before becoming attorney general in 1991. His appointment was unanimously approved.\n\nAs the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Barr oversaw high-profile investigations into the savings and loan scandal, Manuel Noriega – the corrupt former dictator of Panama convicted in 1992 of racketeering – and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.\n\nBarr advocated stronger federal sentencing to combat violent crime and he was opposed to criminal justice reform legislation like the bill Trump recently signed.\n\nDuring Barr's time as attorney general, Robert Mueller headed the Justice Department's Criminal Division and the two worked closely on those important cases.\n\nCriticism of Iran-Contra special counsel\n\nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Barr's tenure involved another special counsel investigation: Lawrence Walsh's probe into the Iran-Contra affair, where Reagan administration officials approved the sale of arms to Iran to help fund anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post's Bob Woodward, Barr said he long had an itchy finger to fire Walsh and that almost came to a head after the special counsel indicted President Ronald Reagan's defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, four days before the 1992 election.\n\nInstead Bush pardoned Weinberger and five other Reagan-era officials involved in the affair. Barr was a strong advocate of the pardons.\n\nIn 2001, Barr described Walsh as a headhunter who had completely lost perspective, and was out there flailing about on Iran-Contra with a lot of headhunters working for him. The whole tenor of the administration was affected by that.\n\nMore:Barr says Mueller report should be public, won't allow improper interference\n\nAs corporate lawyer\n\nAfter leaving the Justice Department, Barr worked for GTE Corporation until it joined with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon in 2000. Barr stayed on with Verizon for eight years before retiring in 2008. His work dealt with deregulation and major corporate mergers. He argued two cases before the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter leaving Verizon, Barr worked as of counsel for Kirkland & Ellis in 2009, meaning he did work for them but was not an official partner or associate, and returned to that role in 2017.\n\nControversial comments\n\nSome of Barr's opinions have raised flags for congressional Democrats concerned about the integrity of Mueller's investigation under a new attorney general.\n\nIn July 2017, Barr told the Post that he thought Mueller should have greater ideological balance on his team. Additionally, in a May 2017op-ed he said Trump made the right decision when he fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been charged with leading the Russia probe.\n\nHe also has said there is more reason to investigate Hillary Clinton's role in a 2010 Uranium One deal than the possibility of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, The New York Times reported in November 2017.\n\nSen. Warner:Barr's nomination should be withdrawn\n\nPersonal life\n\nBarr married Christine Moynihan in 1973 and the couple has three daughters, all of whom practice law, according to Fox News columnist Judith Miller. Daughter Mary Daly works at the Justice Department as director of opioid enforcement and prevention efforts, heading the Trump administration's legal effort to tackle the crisis.\n\nBarr is an avid player of the bagpipes. He played with a band in competitions, including the world championships, until his legal career ascended to the point where his competitive piping was put on hold, according to pipes|drums.

Nunes zealously defended the president amid both his impeachment and former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference. Trump said in 2018 that he thought Nunes deserved the award for his defense of him through the allegations that his campaign had colluded with the Kremlin – though he mistakenly first referred to it as the Medal of Honor.

Former UFC bantamweight Francisco Rivera is the second fighter since the UFC formed its relationship with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) to get a four-year suspension.\n\nUSADA today announced the news after Rivera's (11-7 MMA, 4-6 UFC) case and subsequent suspension were reviewed by an independent arbitrator. Rivera tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol during an out-of-competition urine sample collected on July 23, 2016.\n\nMore from USADA's statement on Rivera's situation:\n\nAfter a thorough investigation into the circumstances of Rivera's case, USADA concluded that the clenbuterol levels detected in his sample were inconsistent with what could be expected from meat contamination. Furthermore, Rivera was unable to provide independently verifiable evidence to support his claim that he had traveled to Northern Mexico and ingested meat in the days leading up to the relevant sample collection. Thereafter, Rivera opted to have his case submitted to a neutral arbitrator for resolution. In advance of the arbitration hearing, USADA's ongoing investigation revealed that several pieces of evidence presented by Rivera to USADA and the arbitrator had been falsified to support the athlete's claims that the substance had originated from contaminated meat in Mexico. Under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, deceitful or obstructive conduct intended to avoid the detection or adjudication of an anti-doping policy violation may be regarded as aggravating circumstances, which can lead to an increased period of ineligibility. In this case, the independent arbitrator concluded that Rivera's conduct warranted an increase from the standard two-year period of ineligibility for a first offense, to the maximum four-year period of ineligibility due to aggravating circumstances.\n\nAccording to USADA, Rivera's four-year ineligibility period began on Aug. 17, 2016. Cisco last competed at UFC 201 in July 2016 where he suffered a unanimous-decision loss to Erik Perez. He's currently on a three-fight losing skid and will be almost 40 when his suspension is complete.\n\nIn December 2017, Rivera announced he was a free agent. Whether he will choose to accept fights in a region which does not adhere to USADA's oversight remains to be seen.\n\nFor complete documentation on Rivera's case, provided by USADA, click here.\n\nAnd for more on the UFC schedule, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.
They love him in Israel and India. In the Philippines and Kenya. Oh, and in Nigeria.\n\nThe rest of the world? Not so much.\n\nConfidence in President Donald Trump to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs remains broadly negative, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Washington-based Pew study, released Wednesday, found that among people it polled in 32 countries, 29% express confidence in Trump. Sixty-four percent say they lack confidence in the White House occupant.\n\nThe figures stand in marked contrast to the final years of Barack Obama's presidency, when a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump's predecessor to direct America's role in the world in a positive manner.\n\nPew last conducted a survey of this kind in 2017.\n\nThe survey published Wednesday was conducted in the spring and summer of 2019, well before the Trump administration's slaying of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, an action that has brought fresh scrutiny to one of Trump's signature foreign policy moves: exiting the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. It has led to increased tensions between Tehran and Washington.\n\nIran's assault was the most aggressive in decades: What happens next?\n\nPew notes that observed shifts in foreign attitudes toward the U.S. and its leader are sometimes connected to U.S. policy or actions, as in the case of the Iraq War in 2003; sometimes they reflect domestic realities, such as the case of right-wing voters in Europe recently growing more favorable toward the U.S.\n\nAt home, Trump has an approval rating of roughly 45% and a disapproval rating of nearly 53%, while the remaining 2% aren't sure, according to an average of job approval polls published by RealClearPolitics, a website focused on political analysis.\n\nDistaste for Trump is led by Europe, where approximately three in four people – 75% – in Germany, Sweden, France, Spain and the Netherlands lack confidence in Trump. Mexico, too, does not like him: 89% do not have confidence in Trump.\n\nAnti-Trump sentiment around the world is driven by his foreign policy actions, including increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods from other countries; withdrawing from the international climate change accord; and proposing to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. A majority of those polled disapprove of Trump's policies to allow fewer immigrants into the USA and his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord.\n\nMiddle East:Stampede at Iran commander Qasem Soleimani's funeral kills at least 56\n\nTrump's attempt to directly negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over that country's nuclear weapons program garners the most support of his various foreign policy actions across the 33 countries surveyed – a median of 41% of people approve of this action, compared with 36% who disapprove.\n\nPew, which describes itself as a nonpartisan fact tank that does not take positions on policy decisions, tested the international popularity of four other world leaders in its survey: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nHermit kingdom:Trump downplays renewed nuclear threats from North Korea\n\nTrump is more negatively viewed than all the leaders asked about in the survey.\n\nIn 12 countries, men are more likely than women to rate Trump positively. For example, 28% of men in Sweden have confidence in the president; just 8% of women do.\n\nOverall global attitudes toward the United States remain largely favorable, although there are large differences across the 33 nations surveyed for that part of the study. Three Central and Eastern European nations – Poland (79 %), Lithuania (70%) and Hungary (66%) – had the most favorable opinion of the United States.\n\nOutside the European Union, Ukraine (73%) rates the United States highly, although views about Trump are less favorable (46%). Pew notes the survey in Ukraine was conducted before revelations last year about Trump's phone call with the country's new president in July. In Russia, 29% of those polled view America positively.\n\nIsraelis give the United States its highest rating on the survey (83% favorable). Elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, attitudes are more negative, especially in Turkey, where just one in five (20%) have a favorable opinion of the United States, the lowest percentage registered in the survey.\n\nThe survey says Trump is generally more popular among those on the political right in many of the nations that were polled. Trump's popularity in Israel (70%) partly reflects his decisions to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord.\n\nIsrael settlements:Donald Trump proves he's the 'King of Israel'
Barbara Marquand\n\nNerdWallet\n\nOnce the optimistic glow surrounding New Year's financial resolutions wears off — hello, February! — it's time to roll up your sleeves before losing momentum altogether.\n\nWhether you aim to save money or get stuff organized, many apps and websites are available to help. Here are some things you can do, along with a few caveats.\n\nShow proof of car insurance (and file claims)\n\nMany insurers offer apps that let you pay bills, access policy information and file claims. Your insurer may have an app to help you prove you have car insurance during a traffic stop, avoiding a frantic search through the glove compartment. Unless you're a driver in Connecticut, New Mexico or D.C. (or your state doesn't require insurance or ID cards), you can show insurance ID on your phone, according to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\n\nThe caveat: Keep the paper card in the glove compartment as a backup in case someone else drives the car or you leave your phone behind.\n\nComplete a home inventory\n\nIf a fire destroys your house, imagine listing from memory every item you lost in order to make an insurance claim. That would be tough on a good day. After a disaster, it's a nightmare, says Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nI think the brain tries to protect you from the sadness of things you lost, making it harder to remember, she says. Apps such as United Policyholders' UPHelp Home Inventory and the Insurance Information Institute's Know Your Stuff guide you through documenting all your belongings. Proper documentation is a key to getting reimbursed fully by the insurance company. Your homeowners insurance company might offer an inventory app, too.\n\nThe caveat: Remember to update the inventory when you get new stuff.\n\nArchive important documents\n\nCompanies such as Estate Map, Everplans and My Life & Wishes let you digitally store documents, life insurance policy information and instructions for loved ones to access after your death. It's vital to keep information securely stored and let those who need access know how to find it.\n\nThe caveat: Some similar companies have already come and gone. Keep a backup paper file, and let your loved ones know how to find it.\n\nCreate legal documents\n\nOnline legal sites such as LegalZoom, Nolo and Rocket Lawyer provide do-it-yourself tools to create end-of-life planning documents, including wills, powers of attorney and health directives. Pricing is cheap, starting at under $100 for a simple will.\n\nThe caveat: Walk very, very carefully with online legal solutions, says Lawrence Lehmann, an immediate past president of the National Association of Estate Planners & Councils. He advises talking to an estate attorney or, if you can't afford one, seeking help through a low-cost legal aid clinic. These are powerful documents, and there are plenty of opportunities for missteps, which could wreak havoc later. The devil is in the details, he says.\n\nFor example, Louisiana law says you must sign every page of your notarial (typewritten vs. handwritten) will in front of a notary and two witnesses, among other rules. If you don't, the will is unenforceable.\n\nTrack spending, save money\n\nA variety of free and low-cost apps helps you budget and save:\n\nIntuit's Mint lets you link bank accounts, credit cards and bills and then shows where money is going and how to save.\n\nGoodbudget lets you set aside money upfront in digital envelopes, or categories, and tracks spending.\n\nAcorns rounds up to the next dollar your credit and debit card purchases and invests the change in a diversified portfolio.\n\nMint and Goodbudget offer free versions; Acorns charges $1 a month or 0.25% per year for accounts of $5,000 or more, but is free for college students.\n\nThe caveat: Understand how the fees work or, if the app is free, how the company makes money. Some of these apps might be right for you, but evaluate them objectively.\n\nApps can help you meet personal finance goals, but they can't do everything. Make sure you address big priorities, such as setting money aside in tax-advantaged retirement accounts and getting the right insurance coverage.\n\nMORE: Best budgeting and saving tools\n\nMORE: How to save on car insurance\n\nMORE: The best life insurance companies\n\nBarbara Marquand is a staff writer atNerdWallet, a personal finance website.

College football's national title game gave us memorable football shrouded in unfettered commercialism. The students cheered their hearts out and wore scarfs adorned with Taco Bell branding. Sponsorships for the event — and there were many — were expected to run between $14 million and $16 million, while a 30-second commercial spot cost more than a million dollars according to Fox.\n\nAlabama's coaches walked off with an extra $1.1 million because of their win.\n\nIowa coach Kirk Ferentz, who was not in any way involved with the proceedings, earned an extra $250,000 (because of where Iowa finished in the polls.)\n\nThe players, they got some grub from one of the sponsors:\n\nAND ALABAMA GETS CHICK FIL A pic.twitter.com/tvWVmMwIv3 — Laken Litman (@LakenLitman) January 12, 2016\n\nThey probably got the nuggets instead of the strips, which are far superior.\n\nOf course all bowl participants get swag like headphones and gift cards. That's all very nice. Oh, and most of them are on scholarship.\n\nWhat they don't get, of course, is anything nearing their share. The money they generate is redistributed to others. The same thing will happen to male college basketball players this year.\n\nAlabama's football team brought in $97 million during the 2014-15 school year and spent $51 million. Its basketball team generated $12.8 million and spent $7.2 million.\n\nThe people who do the work to earn the money do not get to keep the money. How would that play as policy or campaign promise in the places where college football is most popular?\n\nCollege athletic departments, meanwhile, are engaged in an endless arms race because they expend so little on wages. The revenue-to-expense ratio for major teams at most Power Five schools are similar, and yet few athletic departments make money.\n\nThere's tremendous demand from the American public to watch the best college-aged athletes compete in football and men's basketball. Yes, we watch because of the coaches and the traditions to an extent. But be honest: if the best players went elsewhere, to a system like Canadian junior hockey, would you still follow Dear Old U as intently?\n\nWe pay to watch the best.\n\nThe reward for playing college athletics was set decades ago, and athletic directors and the NCAA have worked to keep it the same even as their budgets ballooned. And they still enforce amateurism rules that prevent players from making money from outside sources.\n\nLast night, more than 150 young men took to the field to give us one of the best national championship games we're going to see. A few of them will go on to play professional football. Fewer still will go on to a long, lucrative NFL career. Most will have to rely on a degree they earned while working at least 40 hours a week at the business of sustaining an elite football program.\n\nThe man overseeing that operation at Alabama, Nick Saban, has a base salary of $6.9 million per year.\n\nThe players get fast food and fond memories. Unless they eventually experience the effects of repeated blows to the head and forget.
Ko Bragg\n\nThe 19th\n\nThis story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\n\nMisogyny is the lifeblood of racist movements — or that's one takeaway from sociologist Kathleen Blee's research into the Women of the Ku Klux Klan (WKKK), a hate group that formed in the 1920s independent of the men's Klan.\n\nThe WKKK formed on the heels of the women's suffrage movement, itself rife with racism. Blee, a dean and sociology professor at the University of Pittsburgh who researches extremist right-wing and racist social movements, authored the book Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s — published in 1991 and again in 2009, with a new preface. In it, she argues that the very expansion of white women's access to the franchise laid the foundation for a hate group that was by women, for women and of women. Some high-ranking WKKK leaders had also chaired local campaigns for suffrage, and as women's political opportunities expanded, many felt their role in the Klan should too.\n\nThe early 1900s were dotted with white symbolism and supremacy. White suffragist suits were not only designed for starkness, but to emphasize femininity that many labeled suffragists as devoid of, undercutting them as mannish and ugly. The color white, unmistakably, is also a symbol of purity. As Blee points out, Klan propaganda has a throughline of protecting the purity of the race, but more explicitly, that of white women, who were baselessly depicted as at-risk of assault, as more Black men were freed from the binds of slavery.\n\nChartered officially in June 1923, the WKKK embraced ideas of racial and religious privilege but rejected the messages of white female vulnerability, Blee wrote. Where Klansmen saw women as homemakers, WKKK engaged around emphasizing the labor involved in raising children and maintaining a home and also how to best use their newly bestowed access to the franchise. According to Blee, 250,000 white women joined the WKKK in its first four months, by the organization's own claims.\n\nThe women's Klan of the 1920s was not only a way to promote racist, intolerant, and xenophobic policies but also a social setting in which to enjoy their own racial and religious privileges, Blee writes. These women recall their membership in one of U.S. history's most vicious campaigns of prejudice and hatred primarily as a time of friendship and solidarity among like-minded women.\n\nA lot has changed since Blee's book published, but she still makes the case that many aspects of the Klan's ideology, although distant in time, are frighteningly close in spirit to the pervasive strands of racism and unacknowledged privilege that exist among dominant groups in the United States today.\n\nIn the centennial year of the 19th Amendment, Blee's research connecting suffrage with white women's rise in the notorious hate group presents a nuanced understanding of the voting milestone that hardly expanded voting rights for non-white women. In interviews with Indiana Klanswomen nearing the end of their lives, Blee was surprised to learn that many did not feel remorseful for their role in the WKKK.\n\nBlee spoke to The 19th, which has been covering the centennial of the amendment, about how a voting rights movement facilitated an extremist one, the role gender plays in extremism today, and what she wishes she could ask Klanswomen now.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe 19th: This year marks 100 years since the 19th Amendment was passed. This is also roughly the centennial marker of when the WKKK was established. So can you talk a little bit about how that 19th Amendment milestone made the WKKK possible?\n\nKathleen Blee: The women's suffrage movement existed for decades before the passage of the 19th Amendment. So a lot of people, clearly the majority of women and some men who were involved in it, were interested in suffrage for women. They believed in equality and bringing more people into public life and having women's interests and the interests of children better represented in politics.\n\nBut, that wasn't everybody. There were women — primarily in the South, but not exclusively — who wanted to ensure votes for women, and really they're thinking of white women here, because they wanted white women's votes to counteract the votes that had earlier been given to Black men. There was always within the suffrage movement a pretty openly racist segment. The fact that, actually, very few Black men actually got to exercise their vote was not relevant to their topic.\n\nSo the other thing that is relevant here in terms of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, is that the women's suffrage movement was an opportunity for a very large number of women to develop political skills that they hadn't had before. In trying to pass the suffrage amendment and working at a local level, the state level or the national level, women essentially started to become political agents themselves. They developed their own political networks. They traveled. They made connections with other women. They understood the mechanisms of political power and elections and so forth. And that was true for women who were trying to push a progressive agenda, but it was also true for women who are trying to move a much more reactionary and racist agenda.\n\nRight after the 19th Amendment was passed, the male Klan started saying positive things about women's suffrage. They started encouraging women to come in, and women did. Some of the leaders of the Klan in the 1920s were women who had been women's suffrage leaders themselves. Eventually they pulled away from the men's Klan and became antagonistic toward the men's Klan, primarily because they didn't want to share dues money and there's conflicts and lawsuits and even physical brawls between the men's and women's Klans.\n\nThe women brought into their Klan horrible anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, terribly racist views and agendas, but they also brought in this idea of women's rights. But they only meant the rights of white native-born Protestant women, just women's rights for people like them. Within that, they argued in favor of an eight-hour day for mothers, pay for housewives, and all these kinds of agenda that are similar to what progressive women are arguing for in the 1920s, but in the case of the women's Klan, a very racially defined set of rights.\n\nIt's an interesting story, but it's also a terrible story. It shows the ability of extremist, racist groups to co-opt and build upon even progressive agendas like women's suffrage, and how easily and completely it could be harnessed to one of the worst and certainly one of the largest racist movements in the country's history. They had horrible success by demonizing people by their country of origin and imprinting anti-Semitism and racism really deeply into the body politic, ripping it out of just being a Southern phenomenon and making it a national phenomenon. Sadly, women had a really significant part in that.\n\nOne of the things you grapple with in the book is the tendency to frame extremist groups as fringe and on the margins, their members as brainwashed, even as lower-class and uneducated. Similarly, there becomes this very sexist rhetoric about women in the Klan only being there because of pressure from the men in their lives. Can you talk about what your research says about the importance of understanding recruitment tactics that brought in church leaders and politicians and women organizing for suffrage into the Klan?\n\nBlee: When we think about how women fit into these kinds of politics, it's often the case that people look at women in extremism through the blinders that we have about what those kinds of women are like. People looked at women in the 1920s Klan, and they'll say, Oh, she's married to or with some man who's also in the Klan or in the movement, therefore she must have followed him there. But in my research on the 1920s Klan, and in my research on current far-right extremism in the United States, it's often the case that the woman and the man independently went into those organizations and met each other there. A lot of what we assume about women and their motivations are based on really gender stereotypes, not the reality of women in those groups.\n\nAnother thing that people often think is that women have no role in those groups. But that actually isn't true. So let's take the 1920s Klan. Historians knew for many, many decades that there were women's Klans all over the country. But nobody ever studied them because the historians that looked at the Klan thought only the men were really political actors. If there were women's Klans, they just denoted them as auxiliaries. If you actually look at what was going on in the 1920s, and I did a deep case study of Indiana, where the Klan was extremely strong, is that in a lot of ways, the women were more effective at the horrible agenda of the Klan than the men.\n\nIn the 1920s, the men's Klan was different than Klans before and after because it was not very involved in physical violence; they were mostly interested in trying to get people to run for office and collecting dues. The women's Klan, however, was much more effective in carrying out the racist politics of the Klan because these women created networks among themselves and established what they called whispering campaigns that would target someone they suspected of being Catholic or Jewish and started spreading gossip about them. They were really effective at collapsing the stores of Jewish owners and getting Catholic school teachers run out of communities and targeting African Americans in white communities and getting them pushed out.\n\nObviously keeping in mind that Women of the Ku Klux Klan were perpetuating hate, you also write about the sexism they dealt with from Klansmen but also from outsiders. You write about a newspaper editor who was critical of the Klan and described the women as coarse-featured and having abandoned their husband and children. What can be gleaned from this sexism and misogyny at large?\n\nBlee: Misogynist society permeates into these racist groups, very clearly. Racist groups from the 1920s, when you have a lot of women, and then today when you have a certain number of women in racist groups, there is a double speak about women. On the one hand, women can be racial warriors — that would be language people use today — women are valued allies to men and racist movements. On the other hand, these are movements that are deeply based on inequality and discrimination and hierarchy and masculinity and misogyny. That is the lifeblood of racist movements; they're racist but they're also just deeply misogynistic despite any kind of rhetoric they have about enlisting our sisters in the struggle.\n\nSo women in the 1920s Klan, or women in racist groups now, face the same kind of situation. They come in with expectations about their value and the respect they'll have in the racist movement that white women don't get in the larger society. Then they confront groups whose men are deeply misogynist, and so these women tend to be quite disillusioned and angry. And interestingly enough from the 1920s Klan to today, conflicts around gender are one of the most splintering things that happens in right-wing extremist groups. Flash-points for groups to dissolve tend to be over either money and gender — those are explosive issues, in right-wing extremist groups. Interesting that it still continues to today.\n\nSo, women are involved in the '20s, then for a long time there's no women in racist groups to speak of. And David Duke, whom you may have heard of, is the person who opened the racist movement to women again. Duke brought in both women and Catholics into organized racism in the late '70s, and women have been there ever since. And you notice that those are both times in which there's a women's movement in the larger society. So women come into hate on the heels of the suffrage movement, then they're pushed out. Women return into hate on the heels of the second feminist movement in the '70s. But, you know, just like in the larger society, there's an opening to women, politically, in hate, but it's accompanied by a deep misogyny.\n\nYour book was originally published in 1991, and the version I have includes a preface from 2009. In that preface, you mention that in interviewing aging Klanswomen, there were questions you didn't get to ask or that you were too timid to pose. I'm wondering if you've reflected on that or have been able to work through it in some of your subsequent and continued research on extremism?\n\nBlee: I interviewed these people literally at the last possible moment to interview them. Many of them died very quickly after. I asked the questions that were on my mind then, and I knew very little. In fact, nobody knew very much about (them) then. And so I kind of asked the most obvious questions, and I was shocked by their answers in a way that wouldn't shock me now. People just had no regrets; I really expected them to be confessional, regretful or embarrassed, or any of those kinds of things. And they really weren't.\n\nOne of my regrets is how thin my foundation of knowledge was going into that. Women and those movements were really unexplored. If I could interview these women now, I think I could ask much more interesting questions. How did they get pulled into this? What did they tell their kids? Why did they hide this from their kids?\n\nI think there's some interesting things to think about when a whirlwind of extremism takes over an entire state or parts of the country, and how people think about what they're swept up in. Then they're just dumped out in the end when the whole thing turns out to be kind of a fraud — sex scandals, financial scandals and the whole thing blows up. I was too timid, I should have pushed them a lot more about that. What did you think when your whole world exploded? Everybody that seemed like a great leader was exposed as this big fraud. I do think about that now.
Cooper Allen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhat a difference eight years makes.\n\nAround this time in 2008, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were engaged in an epic and fierce primary battle with debates that were often marked by acrimonious exchanges. Now, there's no greater defender on a Democratic debate stage of Obama than Clinton.\n\nTaking on Wall Street is one of Bernie Sanders' trademark issues, and in Sunday night's Democratic debate he promised again to break up big banks. And in a not-too-subtle jab at Clinton, he also said: I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.\n\nClinton said she could take the attacks, but, seeing an opportunity, she said she wasn't about to let the Vermont senator sully Obama's name, who, she said, led the country out of the Great Recession.\n\nHe's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, Clinton said, while also accusing Sanders of seeking out a primary opponent to Obama in 2011.\n\nI'm going to defend Dodd-Frank, and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results, she said of the president and the financial overhaul law signed into law by Obama in 2010.\n\nSanders tried to minimize his differences with Obama.\n\nHe and I are friends, Sanders said, adding that they at times had differences of opinion.\n\nClinton wasn't buying it.\n\nYour profusion of comments about your feelings toward President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011, she said.\n\nClinton wasn't done, though, in embracing the Obama mantle. Later, in a discussion of Obama's policy toward Syria.\n\nShe was asked by NBC's Andrea Mitchell whether the president should've enforced his red line with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad when it came to Assad's use of chemical weapons.\n\nI think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome, she said.\n\nIt should be noted that the site of Sunday's debate was Charleston, S.C., the state where Obama beat Clinton by nearly 30 points in the 2008 primaries.\n\nFor the Record: Sign up for our politics newsletter
AP\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Nick Foligno scored twice, Sergei Bobrovsky returned from a team suspension and stopped 22 shots and the Columbus Blue Jackets held off a late surge and defeated the New York Rangers 7-5 Sunday night.\n\nCam Atkinson and Artemi Panarin each had a goal and an assist, Ryan Murray had two assists and nine other players picked up points in the offensive explosion for Columbus. But, two goals by the Rangers late in the third period turned it into a closer game.\n\nThe Blue Jackets have won four of the last five, despite being terrible on the power play. They managed the wild victory over the Rangers despite coming up empty on five power plays.\n\nMats Zuccarello had two goals, and Ryan Stome, Chris Kreider and Jimmy Vesey also scored for the Rangers. Alexandar Georgiev, spelling starter Henrik Lungqvist on the second night of a back-to-back, had 33 saves. New York has lost six of its last seven games.\n\nAnthony Duclair, Lukas Sedlak and David Savard also scored for the Blue Jackets, and Bobrovsky — who had been benched for Thursday's game for violating a team policy and didn't play in Saturday's overtime win over Washington — wasn't terrific, but held off the Rangers after they pulled the goalie for a sixth skater late in the game.\n\nISLANDERS 5, LIGHTNING 1\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Casey Cizikas and Cal Clutterbuck each had a goal and an assist, Thomas Greiss stopped 38 shots, and New York beat league-leading Tampa Bay.\n\nBrock Nelson, rookie Devon Toews and Josh Bailey also scored as New York had three goals in the opening five minutes and went on to get their 11th win in 14 games. Matt Martin had two assists to give each player on the Islanders' fourth line two points.\n\nRyan McDonagh had a goal and Andrei Vasilevskiy finished with 23 saves for Tampa Bay, which was 18-1-1 in its previous 20.

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump was a picture of calm as he strolled onto the red carpet for a New Year's Eve party at his Florida resort this week. After threatening Iran in a series of tweets hours earlier, Trump seemed eager to lower tensions.\n\nI want to have peace. I like peace, Trump, clad in a tuxedo, told reporters when asked if an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad would lead to war with Iran. I don't see that happening.\n\nBut the president's allies described a more tense picture behind the scenes as he shuttled between his Mar-a-Lago estate and meetings at his nearby golf course where he huddled with advisers to craft a response to the violent protests at the U.S. compound that reverberated around the globe.\n\nThat response, Americans would learn days later, would include a move widely seen as escalating aggression in the region rather than alleviating it: A U.S. drone strike targeting Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, the second most powerful leader in Iran and commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. His death near Baghdad International Airport triggered vows of reprisal from Iran and threatened to reshape a presidency that has rested on a promise to withdraw from overseas conflicts rather than pursue them.\n\nThursday's airstrike, while at odds with the president's long-stated desire to pull troops out of the Middle East, was the culmination of a growing proxy battle between Iran and Washington after Trump withdrew the U.S. last year from a multilateral agreement intended to curb Tehran's nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has since blamed Iran for attacking tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, downing a U.S. drone in June and a rocket barrage Friday that killed a U.S. defense contractor at a compound in northern Iraq.\n\nAfter the strike on Soleimani, the Pentagon announced the deployment of about 3,000 more troops to the Middle East.\n\nTrump told reporters in Florida Friday he was ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary to deal with Iranian aggression. He said he had already fully identified potential military targets should Iran act.\n\nIf Trump's message of seeking peace appears at odds with ordering missile strikes, selecting targets and expanding the nation's military footprint, it may be explained in part by the contradictory promises he has made to his supporters, experts said.\n\nHe's promised the base that he's going to pull us out of Middle East conflicts, and he's also promised the base that he is going to push back on Iranian efforts to threaten the United States, Israel and our allies, said Thomas Warrick, a former counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security and an Atlantic Council senior fellow.\n\nThe Iranians, Warrick said, are now going to force him to choose which of those is more important.\n\nPhotos of damage:Photos reveal extensive damage to US Embassy in Baghdad\n\nSoleimani:Who was Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani?\n\nSoleimani long a target\n\nSoleimani has long been watched by U.S. intelligence but officials said Trump authorized the strike on him shortly after the military base attack near Kirkuk on Dec. 27 that left an American contractor dead.\n\nThe decision played out over several days as the escalation between Washington and Tehran unfolded.\n\nThe president was kept apprised on an ongoing basis, White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told reporters.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday evening to brief reporters about the first round of airstrikes. Esper presaged the possibility of other military action in the region, noting he had discussed with Trump other options that are available.\n\nTrump traveled between Mar-a-Lago to nearby Trump International Golf Club, where he stayed for less than an hour rather than the several hours he has taken to golf on most days since Christmas.\n\nTrump was then suddenly shuttled back to Mar-a-Lago. He fired off a barbed tweet complaining about criticism that he went golfing when, he said, he had actually been holding meeting(s) in various locations, while closely monitoring the U.S. Embassy situation in Iraq. It was not clear why Trump held those meetings at the golf course rather than at Mar-a-Lago, and neither Trump nor his aides have explained it.\n\nAmong the people who joined Trump at the golf club was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of the president and an outspoken hawk on Iran. Graham told Fox News he had been briefed about the potential operation during his visit to Florida. I appreciate being brought into the orbit, he said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also spent time with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWhite House officials and Trump monitored the embassy attack from Florida. Images documented the extent of the damage: A burned-out reception area, broken windows and rooms that appeared to be completely destroyed.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, when Trump emerged on the red carpet to join his guests at a party, he played down the prospect of war.\n\nI don't think that would be a good idea for Iran. It wouldn't last very long, Trump said. No, I don't think Iran would want that to happen. It would go very quickly.\n\nU.S. intelligence had been tracking Soleimani's movements throughout the region, officials said, and the strike depended on his appearance at the airport. Otherwise, it would have been called off. Soleimani was a potential target for a long time – dating back to prior presidential administrations – and it appears the Trump administration may have began laying the legal groundwork for the strike as early as April. That's when the State Department designated the Revolutionary Guard as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nEver since Soleimani (was) approved as a foreign terrorist, the authority to hit him has been on the table, said Kirsten Fontenrose, former Trump national security adviser who is now at the Atlantic Council. What would have been the game changer in terms of allowing it to happen will have been the strikes on the Kirkuk base.\n\nDeterrence vs. response\n\nExperts say Trump set the stage for the rising U.S.-Iran tensions by fulfilling a campaign promise to abandon former President Barack Obama's landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in May 2018. He reimposed sanctions against Tehran and its trade partners, further isolating the U.S. from European allies who were signatories to the accord and setting in motion ripple effects that led to deeper regional tensions across the Middle East.\n\nWhat followed was a series of provocations, which included Trump abruptly calling off airstrikes on Iran in June 2019 after the downing of a U.S. drone. He revealed strikes had been planned for three locations but decided against the action after considering the potential death toll. But the U.S. has continued to strengthen its forces there, sending an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the region last year, while Pompeo and other administration officials have accused Iran of attacks in Syria and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump and his top advisers have repeatedly touted their maximum pressure policy, a sanctions-driven campaign designed to isolate Tehran diplomatically and cripple the country economically. But increased aggression by Iran has raised questions about how effective that approach has been.\n\nThe president's tough talk on Iran has been at odds with his promise to withdraw U.S. military from the Middle East and his constant criticism of predecessors for engaging the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump faced bipartisan backlash last year for withdrawing from the Syria-Turkey border, virtually clearing the way for Turkey to invade its neighbor to the south. In a series of tweets at the time, Trump said that fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East.\n\nHe added: The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\n\nPrecisely what caused Trump to risk getting involved in a war with Iran is not clear, but Trump said Friday that the decision to take out Soleimani was about preventing an impending attack on Americans.\n\nNeither the White House nor the Pentagon have detailed the plot.\n\nHe'd just come from Damascus where he was planning attacks on American soldiers, airmen, Marines, sailors and against our U.S. diplomat, O'Brien said.\n\nThis was us disrupting a plot that the leadership was well aware of – that Soleimani was involved with, he said. Neither the White House nor the Pentagon have detailed what Trump said was an 'imminent plot against Americans.\n\nSoleimani has long been in the crosshairs of U.S. military. But both former presidents George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama ultimately decided against taking him out in fear of Iranian retaliation spiraling into war. Gen. Stanley McChrystal recalled tracking the top Iranian general to a convoy traveling from Iran into northern Iraq in 2007, making the decision to let him slip away into darkness on a January night.\n\nTo avoid a firefight, and the contentious politics that would follow, I decided that we should monitor the caravan, not strike immediately, he wrote in a Foreign Policy profile of the military commander last year.\n\nWagging the dog?\n\nAaron David Miller, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Iranian military leader's death may be the most consequential act in the Middle East in decades. It will likely be perceived not just as an escalation in the US-Iran shadow war but as an act of war against regime, he said.\n\nSome critics accused Trump of wagging the dog, seeking to divert political attention ahead of the Senate impeachment trial. Trump's foreign policy – his interactions with both Russia and Ukraine, specifically – have been the subject of criticism for most of his presidency.\n\nSo what if Trump wants war, knows this leads to war and needs the distraction? Real question is, will those with congressional authority step in and stop him? Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., posted to Twitter on Friday.\n\nIn December 1998, Republicans lobbed the same accusation against President Bill Clinton, who authorized air strikes against Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq right before the House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on articles of impeachment against him. Clinton and aides rejected the charge, saying the strikes were justified by Iraq's refusal to deal with international weapons inspectors.\n\nTrump also rejected the accusation.\n\nWe took action last night to stop a war, Trump said Friday at Mar-a-Lago. We did not take action to start a war.\n\nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen, Christal Hayes, John Bacon
NEW ORLEANS — Michael Divinity Jr. hasn't known whether he should laugh, cry or jump for joy over the past couple of weeks — so he's done a bit of everything.\n\nWhen LSU head coach Ed Orgeron gave his senior linebacker the green light to wear that purple and gold No. 45 one final time, a myriad of things rushed through his head.\n\nAt the top of the list: I was ready to go.\n\nDivinity, a former star at John Ehret High School in the New Orleans area, was suspended for the Tigers' last six games for violating the athletic department's drug testing policy for marijuana. LSU's drug testing policy says an athlete who tests positive four or more times must miss at least half the season.\n\nThe Tigers' Peach Bowl victory against Oklahoma allowed the 6-foot-2, 238-pounder a chance at redemption.\n\nThis whole thing taught me how to man up and take responsibility for your own actions, Divinity said Saturday during Media Day for Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship Game against Clemson. You learn from them and move on.\n\nDivinity has played just five games this season. He's recorded 23 tackles and three sacks. In 2018, Divinity tied for the team lead with five sacks.\n\nWe'll see what fits best, but he's definitely going to play for us. We'll use him in the best situation we can, Orgeron said. Mike is one of our best pass rushers. So, I think he immediately goes back to starting in our dime (pass defense) package.\n\nDespite the suspension, Divinity was able to practice with the team and participate in all team activities. Physically, Divinity says he hasn't missed a beat. His absence on the field on Saturdays produced a different problem.\n\nThe mental part was the most challenging, said Divinity, who credits his parents and his grandmother for helping him maintain a positive attitude through the suspension. It was very hard. I was tweeting — trying to coach and be there for the guys. I love the game so much I can't stop being around it. I'm so proud of them.\n\nDivinity's penalty offered a little extra time to spend with his daughter, and in the film room. He continued to hang out with his teammates and, as unusual as it may sound, maintains he was able to remain a leader.\n\nMonday, Divinity's college career will end in the same spot as his high school career – the most iconic venue in the state.\n\nMy last high school game was in the Superdome, said Divinity, whose Patriots fell to Zachary 46-12 in the 2015 Class 5A state championship game. It's going to be wonderful. I'm hoping for a different result.\n\nClemson co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott believes Divinity could make a different despite the long absence.\n\nWith his age and his experience, you would think he'd add some leadership, Elliott said. I would imagine he gives them more depth. They've had to play (linebackers, Patrick) Queen and (Jacob) Phillips a lot — even when the game was out of hand.\n\nIn terms of Xs and Os, Divinity could be a key in third-down situations.\n\nHe provides a different element, Elliott said. He's a big enough guy, fast enough guy. (LSU's) philosophy on third down seems to be to get some of the bigger two-gap guys off the field and get some speed guys in to create some matchup problems for your offensive line.\n\nUnlike the past six games, Divinity isn't going to waste the chance of a lifetime Monday night.\n\nI'm blessed to have the opportunity to be on the playing field with my teammates again, Divinity said. I'm going to take advantage of it when we get out there.
WASHINGTON – Democratic presidential candidates say they are sending prayers to U.S. military members as reports develop of Iranian missile strikes on Iraqi military bases that house American and coalition forces.\n\nThe strike, an apparent move of retaliation for the U.S.-ordered killing of military leader Qasem Soleimani, occurred Tuesday evening and consisted of at least a dozen ballistic missiles targeting at least two sites, according to the Defense Department.\n\nIt is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil, a Pentagon spokesperson said. We are working on initial battle damage assessments.\n\nPentagon:Iran launched 'more than a dozen' missiles at bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops\n\nDemocratic candidates have criticized Trump heavily for his decision to target Soleimani, but the immediate aftermath of the Tuesday missile strikes largely focused on supporting troops while calling for a de-escalation of hostilities.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said on Twitter he would not comment on the strikes until more information was available, but there is one thing I will say: Jill and I are keeping our troops and Americans overseas in our prayers. We hope you'll keep them in yours.\n\nBiden did address the airstrike at a fundraiser outside Philadelphia as reports emerged, saying that he'd speak on it generally without many details available at the time.\n\nWhat's happening in Iraq and Iran today was predictable, Biden said, according to a pool report sent out by his campaign. Not exactly what's happening but the chaos that's ensuing. He pointed to Trump's withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and Soleimani's killing.\n\nSome of the things [Trump has] done and said in the meantime have been close to ludicrous, Biden said. Including threatening to bomb holy sites… And I just pray to God as he goes through what's happening, as we speak, that he's listening to his military commanders for the first time because so far that has not been the case.\n\nHow we got here:What you need to know about the death of Gen. Soleimani and the escalating situation with Iran\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker tweeted shortly after news broke, Praying for the safety of our troops and personnel in Iraq right now.\n\nHe added, We are quickly heading to a point of no return in the region. We must use diplomacy to deescalate and keep Americans safe at home and abroad.\n\nBooker had previously said that Trump has made that region less stable and less safe with his policy toward Iran.\n\nPrayers for safety of all military personnel. Prayers for wisdom for all governmental personnel. Prayers for peace for all the world, author Marianne Williamson said. After Soleimani was killed, Williamson said that Iran would almost certainly react significantly and warned that war with Iran would be catastrophic.\n\n2020 candidates on the issues: Presidential hopefuls talk foreign policy, extremism, climate change and more\n\nTonight, Americans in Iraq are under fire, Pete Buttigieg said. My prayers are with them, their loved ones, and their families.\n\nThe former South Bend, Ind. Mayor, like his Democratic opponents, had already noted that Soleimani was a threat to safety and security, and that he masterminded threats and attacks on America and our allies. But, he said, Congress and allies needed to be consulted before military action took place that could destabilize an entire region.\n\nWe must do all we can to protect our servicemembers and Americans at risk, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in a tweet of the Iranian missile attack. Klobuchar has expressed concern about the timing, manner and potential consequences of Soleimani's death.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren opened a speaking event in Brooklyn by informing the audience about the news. Warren, too, believes that Trump's actions were reckless and would endanger lives.\n\nElizabeth Warren:'Of course' Soleimani was a terrorist\n\n2020 candidates on Soleimani's death:Democrats react to killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani\n\nWe have to start on a very sober note, she said. For any of you who haven't been able to follow it, within the last hour, the Iranian government has announced that it has sent missiles to attack our military bases in Iraq.\n\nMy three brothers all served in the military. At this moment, my heart and my prayers are with our military and with their families in Iraq and all around the world. But this is a reminder of why we need to deescalate tension in the Middle East. The American people do not want a war with Iran.\n\nAnd entrepreneur Andrew Yang, too, sent thoughts and prayers to the service members in Iraq: may they be safe and secure and see their families again.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, who called Trump the weakest foreign policy president in my lifetime after the strike on Soleimani, also tweeted Tuesday night. American servicemembers are under attack. I'm monitoring the situation and thinking of the brave men and women serving in our military tonight.\n\n'This was an act of war': Lawmakers react to Iran's missile strike on US military bases\n\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick tweeted that, Americans and our allies are under fire tonight. Let us keep them and their families in our prayers.\n\nGaggling with reporters after an event in New Hampshire, Hawaiian Congresswoman and veteran Tulsi Gabbard described texting fellow friends and veterans who were asking, What the f*** is going on?\n\nThe day after the attack, billionaire Tom Steyer tweeted that he was grateful that no Americans or Iraqis were harmed in last night's missile strikes by Iran. Let's make one thing clear: Trump created this crisis and his remarks today demonstrate, once again, that his go at it alone strategy makes our country less safe.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders said, The American people do not want war with Iran and that Congress cannot stand by. It must act now to pass our legislation to uphold the Constitution and prevent Trump from spending trillions more on endless war.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post Tuesday night, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg touched on the uncertainty of the situation with Iran, saying of Trump, I do know that if you're making irresponsible decisions, the likelihood of bad and even calamitous results grows.
AUSTIN – No more migrant children were being held at the temporary tent shelter at the Tornillo port of entry as of Friday morning, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAll children who were at the Texas shelter have been released to sponsors or transferred to other shelters, said Lynn Johnson, assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families.\n\nOperations at Tornillo will be ongoing to appropriately and adequately continue the path towards closure, Johnson said in a statement.\n\nFederal officials had been working since early this month to close the shelter as quickly but as safely as possible. There were still 850 children at the shelter as of Monday night.\n\nThe facility at the U.S.-Mexico border opened in June as the federal government handled an influx of children entering custody after being separated from their parents at the border under the Trump administration's zero tolerance immigration policy.\n\nWhat started as an operation large enough to hold more than 300 children grew quickly and housed as many as 2,700 children in the middle of December. Those children were not among those separated from their parents, but minors who were apprehended attempting to cross the border without a guardian.\n\nJune 26:'Zero tolerance' immigration policy 'incredibly dumb,' tent city chief says\n\nJune 15:'Abhorrent': Texas officials, advocates decry placing immigrant children in tent cities\n\nRepublican Rep. Will Hurd, whose district includes parts of far East El Paso County, first announced the shelter's impending closure after speaking with management officials in Tornillo.\n\nThis tent city should never have stood in the first place but it is welcome news that it will be gone, Hurd wrote on Twitter.\n\nMore:Tornillo tent shelter for migrant children to close 'as quickly but as safely as possible,' per HHS\n\nOpponents of the facility celebrated news of its closure Friday.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, El Paso's former Democratic congressman, applauded those who joined his protest in Tornillo last year against the facility and family separations.\n\nThe last child has left Tornillo, O'Rourke wrote on Twitter. It's good for these kids and their families. And it shows the power of people who showed up for them and shared with the rest of the country that we were locking up immigrant kids for months at a time. You made this happen.\n\nFernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights, celebrated news of the closure of what he called the baby jail and said officials should learn from the facility and look for alternatives to detention in the future.\n\nTornillo was a symbol of this administration's deep inhumanity as shown by their willingness to hold tens of thousands of migrant children in detention, he said in a statement. Migrant children and families never should have been separated or held in detention. This was clear from Tornillo's opening to its closure today.\n\nThe facility had stayed operational because the federal government was slow to place children with sponsors in the United States. Authorities pointed to a delay in FBI background checks as the primary roadblock.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services changed its policy in December to expedite the release of children, requiring background checks for sponsors but not from all members of a sponsor's household.\n\nJohnson said facilities like Tornillo are necessary for HHS to care for (children) referred to us by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nFollow Madlin Mekelburg on Twitter: @madlinbmek

This means that in making a request you may be required to: provide your email and phone number, customer information, and/or account sign-up authentication or other information needed to verify your identity depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information that is the subject of the request.\n\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. If we are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to deny the request.\n\nMaking a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.\n\nIf you choose to use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete your information, we may require that you: (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so; and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. We will not require these steps if we have received proof that you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf. We may also deny a request from an agent that does not meet the requirements for authorized agents under the CCPA.\n\nOnce we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. If we are unable to complete your request in whole or in part, we will let you know why.\n\n3.6.2 Response Timing and Format\n\nWe use good faith efforts to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days after its receipt.

If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by email.\n\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. If we cannot comply with any portion of a request, the response we provide will also explain why, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information that is commonly useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, but we do not guarantee that all formats are useable in all media. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\n3.6.3 Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy Rights\n\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. In particular, we will not:\n\nDeny you goods or services\n\nCharge you different prices for goods or services, whether through denying benefits or imposing penalties\n\nProvide you with a different level or quality of goods or services\n\nThreaten you with any of the above\n\n3.6.4 Financial Incentives\n\nWe may offer you certain financial incentives for the collection of your Personal Information and as permitted by the CCPA. These incentives may result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. Details of the incentive, if applicable, including how to opt in or out and the basis for the value of the incentive, will be provided prior to or at the time of your participation.\n\n3.7 Do Not Sell My Personal Information.\n\nThe CCPA requires businesses to provide a web page where consumers can opt out of the ''sale of their Personal Information. The link to our Do Not Sell web form is located here.\n\nIn addition, you may opt out of certain interest-based advertising by using the following resources:\n\n(a) You may opt-out of tracking and receiving tailored advertisements on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other similar entities by downloading the App Choices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices.\n\n(b) You may opt-out of receiving permissible targeted advertisements by using the NAI Opt-out tool available at optout.networkadvertising.org or visiting About Ads.\n\n(c) You may opt-out of having your activity on our Websites and Services made available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out add-on for your web browser by visiting: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout for your web browser.\n\n(d) One of our providers, LiveRamp, Inc. collects certain Personal Information from you on our Websites, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system.

Joanna Allhands, Jessica Estepa, and Brett McGinness\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNever mind the gun thing.\n\nThe bigger question from President Obama's Tuesday news conference is which presidential candidate is most likely to cry first? (Hint: Don't expect The Donald. We're not even sure he has tear ducts.)\n\nObama got emotional during the conference, the second time he has cried in discussing gun violence, and as USA Today's David Jackson reports, the practice is sort of becoming a thing.\n\nThough crying as president used to be considered a sign of weakness, now it's considered a sign of humanity. Which means there's probably a consultant somewhere calculating the best moment for candidates to well up, shed exactly 2.7 tears, and bask in the resulting poll boost.\n\n(Btw, you don't need tears to boost your popularity. Just sign up for Team FTR and get this amazingness in your inbox six days a week!)\n\nSECOND GUN VERSE, SAME AS THE FIRST\n\nSo, back to the gun thing, since it was the biggest news of the day. (Wonder how we got here? Check out FTR's previous gun issue, which explains the whole thing.) Obama used executive orders to do some small things and called on Congress to open its wallet for more – which, honestly, did he think that through? Using a pretty much universally hated executive order doesn't exactly put Congress in a giving mood.\n\nAnyway, after the conference was over, presidential candidates basically repeated their previous talking points: Republicans waved their arms, touted their love for the Second Amendment and promised to annul everything if elected, while Democrats praised Obama for taking the crucial step, as Hillary Clinton called it, and vowed to do more if elected.\n\nIT'S A HARD-KNOCK LIFE (AND OTHER ADS)\n\nRepublican John Kasich channels his inner Jay Z in his first TV ad in New Hampshire, touting his hard scrabble life growing up in Pennsylvania, losing his parents to a drunken driver and tackling the budget as governor. It doesn't actually use any music from Hard Knock Life, but since we're in a singing mood, we realized that Jay Z songs would totes be great campaigning material: I'm from the school of the hard knocks/ We must not let outsiders violate our blocks.\n\nMeanwhile, Marco Rubio has unveiled an ad in South Carolina featuring U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy saying there is nobody better for president. It's probably not the best slogan, because it immediately made us think, As opposed to everyone who's worse than you? But Gowdy's kind of a big deal among conservatives, so maybe it doesn't really matter what we says, as long as he says it.\n\nAND SPEAKING OF AIRTIME\n\nNo, it's not just your imagination that Donald Trump has been sucking all of the oxygen out of media reports. The Tyndall Report tracked news coverage for each candidate and found that the major network nightly news broadcasts spent 234 minutes covering Trump from January to November – far more than any other candidate. Jim Hightower writes on Alternet that Bernie Sanders got only 20 seconds of coverage on ABC for the year, which is basically the TV equivalent of and in other news … hey, here's a picture of Bernie Sanders! Aaaand that's all the time we have, folks.\n\nMORE FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\n\nCruz to voters: Please, children, try not to fight during the caucuses.

Roger Yu, USA TODAY\n\nTax prep companies are coming to grips with an age-old business convention: Once you give it away for free, no one will want to pay for it ever again.\n\nThe industry is offering more free online options for do-it-yourself tax filers, providing financial relief to cash-strapped consumers but also triggering data security and privacy concerns.\n\nFree e-filing of federal tax returns has been around for years. The companies that offered the service generated revenue by charging extra for more complex forms and state tax filings. Innovations were slow as tax prep companies enjoyed hefty profit margins on consumers willing to pay $40 or more for their annual tax obligation.\n\nBut the preponderance of consumers clamoring for free options was eventually going to widen. Innovative startups have entered the sector, making a business of marketing consumers' data to other financial services companies. And in the last week, at least three financial services companies announced new products or features. Among the options now available:\n\nSome IRS refunds to be delayed until Feb. 15\n\nIRS' Free File. The federal agency runs a partnership with 13 tax prep companies that offers free federal and state filings for Americans whose annual income is $62,000 or less. Forms are free regardless of tax complexity. While most companies in the program support free state filings, the IRS warns that some may not.\n\nCredit Karma. The San Francisco-based company, known for free credit reports, will introduce free federal and state tax filing options on its site in 2017. It will not charge extra for complex IRS forms or other fees, and users will not be required to input their credit card number, says CEO Ken Lin.\n\nFor now, Credit Karma is placing interested users in a reservation queue. We don't know if we're going to get a million users or hundreds of millions, Lin says. We hope we can cover everyone.\n\nCredit Karma makes money by suggesting its users consider new mortgage loans, credit cards and other financial products that match income data.\n\nH&R Block. Known for its brick-and-mortar stores, H&R Block introduced last week its first free online state filing option for customers who file federal returns using 1040EZ and 1040A, which are simpler forms. Consumers with additional complexities will have to pay more for other forms.\n\nTaxAct. The company said this week that its TaxAct's Online 2016 Free Edition allows users who file simple federal returns (1040 EZ/A) to file state returns for free. Bait and switch tactics have become a common pattern in the do-it-yourself online tax preparation industry, says Rob Gettemy, TaxAct's COO. It is not customer-friendly.\n\nTurboTax. Owned by Intuit, TurboTax runs its Absolute Zero program, which lets consumers file federal and state taxes online for free if they use the simple federal returns (1040 EZ/A).\n\nWhile free e-filing options are convenient, personal information submitted to tax software companies is more sensitive than other online transactions, says Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney of the National Consumer Law Center. Look for (the site's privacy policy) carefully and don't just click, click, click, she says. There's a lot of rich information. Think about if you want to share.\n\nWith more free online options, the IRS also warns of proliferating phishing scams, in which a person claiming to be a tax company rep may seek personal information. More than 400 fraudulent tax-related domains were registered between Jan. 15 and Feb. 14, 2016, according to Online Trust Alliance.\n\nCould your taxes go up with Donald Trump as president?\n\nEarlier this year, the nonprofit group performed an online security audit of the 13 tax prep companies in the IRS Free File Alliance and found that six failed in either consumer protection or site security.\n\nThe IRS says collection notices are sent via traditional mail. It never calls to demand immediate payment using a specific payment method or ask for credit- or debit-card numbers over the phone. It also never demands that you pay taxes without an opportunity to appeal.
Christian Locka and Jabeen Bhatti\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nBANGUI, Central African Republic — The United Nations became embroiled in one of its worst scandals in 2014 when shocking allegations surfaced that U.N. peacekeepers were raping women and children in this impoverished, war-battered nation.\n\nToday, blue-helmeted soldiers and U.N. staff still rape with impunity despite pledges by U.N. leaders to end the abuses, victims allege.\n\nI am ashamed of the so-called international community, a tearful Marie-Blanche Marboua said as she described how a U.N. soldier raped her 10-year-old son a year ago in Bouar, 300 miles from this capital city. My son is still traumatized.\n\nI have realized that nothing must be expected from these white people, she added. Now, I put everything in the hands of God.\n\nThe U.N.'s international peacekeeping forces were sent to Central African Republic to stabilize the country after more than a decade of civil war. While there, soldiers sexually abused hundreds of boys, girls and women, according to child rights organizations and the U.N.'s own records.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres acknowledged the exploitation and pledged when he took office a year ago to crack down. In August, he appointed a victims' rights advocate.\n\nSexual exploitation and abuse have no place in our world, Guterres said in September. It is a global menace, and it must end.\n\nLast year, U.N. officials vowed to improve funding and staffing for sex abuse cases. Atul Khare, under-secretary general, said those efforts have led to a 50% drop in assaults on children by peacekeepers across the globe during the first 11 months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\n\nWe believe our new strategy is bearing some initial fruit, said Khare, who conceded that even one allegation is one too many.\n\nUwolowulakana Ikavi-Gbetanou, a spokeswoman for U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bangui, said abuse cases have declined in this country because of new steps, such as more training of personnel and aggressive investigations of allegations. She said the U.N. also is increasing outreach to local communities to help them report abuses and provide immediate assistance.\n\n\n\nEven so, the U.N.'s own watchdog said in a June report that while progress has been made, much improvement is needed, including recording complaints and following up on accusations.\n\nHuman rights groups dispute claims of fewer assaults, saying the U.N. still does not have an accurate account of abuse victims.\n\nThe U.N. is claiming things are getting better, but it is in complete control over the assessments of people coming forward, said Paula Donovan, a former U.N. official who is co-director of AIDS-Free World, which tracks peacekeeper abuses. They are police, judge and jury.\n\nThe number of victims is far higher than the U.N. reports, said Remy Djamouss, president of the Center for the Promotion and Defense of the Rights of Children in Bangui. His group takes the testimonies of children abused by peacekeepers.\n\nSome victims and their families fail to report assaults because they don't know how to file a claim, believe there won't be an impartial investigation or fear reprisals. So people are not coming forward, Donovan said.\n\nOne 17-year-old girl said she did not report being raped at gunpoint in June by two peacekeepers in the city of Bria because sexual assault by U.N. soldiers is so common. She said many friends and neighbors ended up having children as a result of being raped by peacekeepers.\n\nI did not tell people that I was raped by the peacekeepers because they would make fun of me, said Merveille, whose last name is being withheld to protect her privacy as a sexual assault victim under USA TODAY's policy.\n\nAnother young victim is still waiting for justice. The 13-year-old girl said she was attacked two years ago at Camp M'Poko near Bangui's international airport.\n\nThree white soldiers told me to come get candies and cookies, recalled Joanna, whose last name also is being withheld. One of them covered my mouth with his hand and then the two raped me. I want these people to be punished.\n\nPeacekeeping soldiers, who come from dozens of countries, usually are sent home when they face sexual abuse allegations, as required under U.N. rules. That policy has become a shield for alleged abusers, according to child advocates.\n\nFor example, after France withdrew its troops from a non-U.N. peacekeeping mission here in 2016, French prosecutors declined to file charges against soldiers accused of raping six children, ages 9 to 13, in 2013-14.\n\nThe victims come to tell us how a white soldier did this, another did that, said Claudia Toussonekeya, an attorney with the Central African Women Lawyers Association, which records dozens of complaints of sexual abuse by soldiers and other foreigners in the country.\n\nWe tell them that we can do nothing, and that even (Central African Republic's) justice system cannot do anything. They take it badly, but we cannot do otherwise, she said.\n\nIn fact, several peacekeepers have been punished, according to Nick Birnback, chief of public affairs at the U.N. peacekeeping unit.\n\nHe said U.N. records show six soldiers serving here were jailed for abuse or sexual exploitation and one was dismissed by his government from 2015 through 2017.\n\nYet during the same period, according to the U.N.'s own records, there were 255 alleged victims of abuse, 141 of them children.\n\nBirnback said abuse charges against peacekeepers across the globe are handled more aggressively now, with 92% of participating countries looking into allegations, up from 42% five years ago. The average time it takes a country to appoint an investigator has fallen from 79 days in 2012 to eight days currently, he said.\n\nIn addition, the U.N. has set aside $1.7 million to compensate victims. We are witnessing a change in the mindset of both the member states and the U.N. itself, Birnback said.\n\nWhile soldiers who are accused are sent home, U.N. staff members can be tried locally because most don't have diplomatic immunity. Still, the U.N. doesn't deal with them harshly enough, complained AIDS activist Donovan.\n\nIf you rape a child, you might get investigated, but that is an investigation that will lead to demotion or getting fired, not jail, she said. They don't want their people spending time in a jail in Central African Republic.\n\nU.N. figures for 2015-17 show that one civilian working for the mission here was sanctioned with a contract termination because of abusive behavior.\n\nAIDS-Free World and other groups are pushing for an independent court modeled after the International Criminal Court in The Hague to handle these cases instead of the U.N. That's because the U.N. often hides information and pretends investigations have already been carried out when they haven't been, children's advocate Djamouss charged.\n\nThe local groups want to name and shame accused rapists by publicizing their identities and possibly deter other soldiers from committing assaults. But the U.N. won't reveal identities because it says alleged perpetrators have a right to a presumption of innocence, Djamouss said. To date, not a single convicted rapist has been publicly identified in Central African Republic, according to Djamouss.\n\nLocal officials remain silent because they are embarrassed about the scandal and view the peacekeeping mission as a powerful force that provides desperately needed foreign currency for a barely functioning economy, said Pierre Marie Kporon, a researcher at Bangui University who specializes in child rights violations.\n\nWhen you touch the international community that pays the salaries of civil servants, you risk having problems even with the government, Kporon said.\n\nAs allegations of rape persist, many people here feel betrayed by an organization that sent troops to make life better for the country's citizens.\n\nWe were told that (the peacekeepers) came to protect us, said Beatrice Mokoyo, 45, a farmer and mother of seven in Biabo, near Bangui.

Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nCORAL GABLES, Fla. -- New York Yankees principal owner Hal Steinbrenner says he gave careful consideration before approving the trade for embattled closer Aroldis Chapman, and warned the public Wednesday not to pre-judge him before Major League Baseball's investigation concludes.\n\nIn this country where allegations are brought against a person,'' Steinbrenner said in his first public comments on Chapman, that person is completely innocent until proven otherwise. Not the other way around. I think we should keep that in mind right now.''\n\nSteinbrenner understands the concern and threats of protests against the Yankees for acquiring Chapman, who allegedly choked his girlfriend and fired eight bullets into his garage on Oct. 30 in an argument with his girlfriend and mother of his child.\n\nYankees trade for Aroldis Chapman, create potentially nasty bullpen\n\nMLB's domestic violence policy also stipulates it could discipline Chapman even in the absence of criminal charges.\n\nHe said he took it all under consideration before approving the deal with the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nLook, I put a lot of thought into it,'' Steinbrenner said of the Dec. 28 trade. Any trade where I'm giving up four prospects -- a couple of which are really decent prospects -- I put a lot of thought into it. …\n\nObviously, as a player, he's tremendous. We looked at him in July at the trade deadline. ... A lot of thought was put into it. But the benefits for the organization as a player, if you look at the baseball side of it, is tremendous upside, needless to say.''\n\nAroldis Chapman threw all 77 of MLB's 77 fastest pitches in 2015\n\nYork City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito publicly said she would consider boycotting Yankee games after the deal because of the domestic violence charge.\n\nIt's very disturbing, Mark-Viverito said, in an interview with POLITICO New York. I think it was really wrong of the Yankees to have signed this guy on. We all want the Yankees to do well, but at the expense of what? And I think considering the allegations -- and they're being investigated -- that this was the wrong move. …\n\nWe know that the issue of violence against women has been highlighted through the NFL and other incidents but at some point, a position has to be made and I think, in some ways, it's condoning this kind of violence, to bring him on as part of this team.\n\nThere were no charges brought against Chapman, but Major League Baseball launched an investigation in December that is continuing.\n\nI understand it is a very sensitive subject, as rightfully so,'' Steinbrenner said at the quarterly owners' meetings, but we just have to wait and see. It's a touchy subject, but again, a man is innocent proven guilty.''
WASHINGTON — The political and policy network aligned with the conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch is launching a $4 million pilot project to help former prisoners successfully reenter society.\n\nThe so-called Safe Streets & Second Chances project will be among the topics the Kochs and several hundred like-minded donors will explore this weekend when they gather near Palm Springs, Calif., for the network's annual winter meeting.\n\nThe retreat will confront what the Kochs and other donors view as obstacles to achievement in the realms of public policy, education and in local communities, said James Davis, a spokesman for the network.\n\nOverhauling the criminal-justice system has been a priority of Charles Koch, a libertarian-leaning industrialist who sits at the helm of a Kansas-based industrial conglomerate. In recent years, he and his aides have lobbied to reduce penalties for non-violent offenses, to rein in the practice of seizing the assets of criminal suspects and to make it easier for convicted felons to gain occupational licenses and other work opportunities once they are released.\n\nThe new prisoner reentry program will start with a trial experiment involving 1,000 participants in four states: Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Pennsylvania. The goal is to develop individualized reentry plans that start on the first day prisoners are jailed.\n\nOver 95 percent of people who are incarcerated will eventually be released, so it's in everyone's best interests to make sure that these individuals are better when they leave prison than before they went in, Koch Industries executive Mark Holden said in a statement.\n\nHolden, who also serves as a key official in the Kochs' policy empire, has been a leading figure in the network's criminal-justice push.\n\nEarlier this month, Holden attended a White House meeting with President Trump, governors, religious leaders and other activists to discuss ways to expand workplace opportunities for prisoners and reduce the rate of recidivism.\n\nMore:Trump tackles prison reform: 'We can help break this vicious cycle'
During her shifts at a Church's Chicken, Annita Husband looked like the other employees. She wore the same blue and red polo shirt, greeted the same customers, and slung the same fried chicken and biscuits.\n\nBut after clocking out, Husband, a mother in her 40s, had to wait for a white van with barred windows and the seal of the Mississippi Department of Corrections on its sides. It delivered her to the Flowood Restitution Center, a motel converted into a jail surrounded by razor wire, nestled among truck stops and an outlet mall. Here, Husband slept in a room with seven other women, sharing a mirror to get ready in the mornings, enduring strip searches for contraband at night.\n\nA judge sentenced Husband to the restitution center in 2015 to pay off almost $13,000 she owed from an embezzlement conviction in 2009. The corrections department would not release her until she earned enough money at her $7.25-an-hour part-time job to clear her debts and cover $11 a day for room and board at Flowood.\n\nIf I wasn't at work, I was in prison, Husband said.\n\nThe corrections department took her paychecks, she said, giving her back just $10 a week — all in quarters — so she could buy things like soap and deodorant.\n\nThe State of Mississippi had locked Husband into a modern-day debtors prison. She had other plans.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Annita Husband entered the restitution center in 2015, six years after pleading guilty to embezzlement, because she struggled to pay $255 to her probation officer... Annita Husband entered the restitution center in 2015, six years after pleading guilty to embezzlement, because she struggled to pay $255 to her probation officer and the courts. She feared she would spend years at the center trying to pay off her debts. Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today/Report for America\n\nJailed for small debts\n\nMississippi appears to be the only state where judges lock people up for an indefinite time while they work to earn money to pay off court-ordered debts. While there is no comprehensive data, legal experts who study fines, fees and restitution say Mississippi is unusual at the very least.\n\nWe don't know of any other states that have a program quite like Mississippi's, said Sharon Brett, a senior staff attorney with Harvard's Criminal Justice Policy Program.\n\nA handful of states experimented with restitution programs starting in the 1970s, but abandoned them as expensive and ineffective.\n\nNot Mississippi. Judges have sentenced hundreds of people a year to four restitution centers around the state, almost always ordering the inmates to stay until they pay off court fees, fines and restitution to victims, according to four years of government records analyzed by Mississippi Today and The Marshall Project.\n\nThis is important journalism.

Sign up\n\nPeople sent to the centers had been sentenced for felonies but didn't commit violent crimes, according to the program rules. When we tracked down the cases of more than 200 people confined there on January 1, 2019, we found that most originally got suspended sentences, meaning they did not have to go to prison.\n\nThey didn't usually owe a lot of money. Half the people living in the centers had debts of less than $3,515. One owed just $656.50. Though in arrears on fines and court fees, many didn't need to pay restitution at all—at least 20 percent of them were convicted of drug possession.\n\nBut inmates spent an average of nearly four months — and up to five years — at the centers, working for private employers to earn enough to satisfy the courts. Meanwhile their costs continued to balloon, since as they had to pay for room and board, transportation to their jobs, and medical care.\n\nThey didn't get paid much. Between 2016 and 2018, workers at the centers made an average of $6.76 an hour in take home pay, according to our analysis of state data.\n\nShow caption Hide caption During a nine-month stay at the Flowood Restitution Center starting in September 2018, Dixie D'Angelo worked four different restaurant jobs trying to pay down over... During a nine-month stay at the Flowood Restitution Center starting in September 2018, Dixie D'Angelo worked four different restaurant jobs trying to pay down over $5,000 she owed for damaging a friend's car. She said she struggled with depression and anxiety and got no treatment for her alcoholism. 'I was in a really, really dark place,' she said. Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today/Report for America\n\nDebtors prisons\n\nIt's a futile system that penalizes the poorest residents of the poorest state in the country, said Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi.\n\nDebtors prisons are an effective way of collecting money—as is kidnapping, he said. But there are constitutional, public policy and moral barriers to such a regime.\n\nMany states are reconsidering the practice of jailing the poor, especially because of its inordinate impact on people of color. Since 2018, Mississippi has required judges to find that people willfully failed to make court-ordered payments before sending them to jail or prison.\n\nBut that hasn't affected the number of people entering Mississippi's restitution-center program, which our reporting shows mostly affects those on probation for low-level offenses related to drug addiction or poverty.\n\nMississippi Today reviewed hundreds of documents, spoke with more than 50 current and former restitution-center inmates and interviewed legal experts over the course of 14 months.\n\nThe Mississippi Department of Corrections repeatedly declined our requests to visit the restitution centers and to discuss them with state officials. But in a statement issued in late December in response to our findings, the department noted that it follows state law when operating the restitution program.\n\nEmphasizing that judges are in charge of sending people to the centers, the statement says the program provides an alternative to incarceration for minimal risk offenders by facilitating their transition to the community.\n\nWhile individuals in this program are required to work, the MDOC does not force them to work, the statement said. The MDOC merely assists them in finding employment.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Darrell Bridges says he earned almost $2,000 working at Checkers during his stint in the Pascagoula Restitution Center in 2013.

But the money was never applied to the $3,403 debt he owed from an attempted robbery when he was 17, records show. He still wonders what happened to his money. Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today/Report for America\n\nThe state has a long history of forcing prisoners—especially black men—to work. After slavery was abolished, Mississippi leased a soaring number of prisoners to private industry. Public outcry over deaths and mistreatment forced the state to end that program in 1890. Mississippi then founded the state penitentiary known as Parchman Farm, which was modeled after a slave plantation. It still houses over 3,000 of the state's 21,000 prisoners.\n\nThe restitution-center program has unfortunate parallels with Mississippi's past, said Alex Lichtenstein, a historian who has written a book on convict leasing in the South. It's a form of penal labor, there's no question about it.\n\nToday, employers benefit from access to cheap and reliable labor from the restitution program. If it weren't for the restitution center, I would seriously have trouble running my business, said Barry Porter, the owner of a Sonic Drive-In near Jackson. Several inmates described him as a fair and accommodating boss.\n\nSome judges say the program helps those sentenced to it. Charles Webster, a circuit judge in Clarksdale, said that the program teaches them about responsibility by requiring them to show up for work and meet financial obligations. He had sentenced two of the people in the centers in January 2019.\n\nGoing to the restitution center's better than going to prison, I would think, he said.\n\n'Basically in prison'\n\nOne June morning in 2007, while Husband worked at a payday loan store near Biloxi on the Gulf Coast, she looked at a surveillance monitor and watched as the dealership repossessed her white Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nLike many of her clients, Husband lived paycheck to paycheck. Supporting three sons and her injured spouse on her own, she had fallen behind on making her monthly payments.\n\nAnnita Husband He said, 'Happy Mother's Day.' It was just so hurtful, because here I am, basically in prison. Quote icon\n\nTo get the truck back, she began creating fake loans, pocketing about $11,000 in cash from her employer, Money Now. Several weeks later, an internal audit uncovered the scheme. Husband, who in the past was convicted of writing bad checks and of stealing $300 from Sears, pleaded guilty to embezzlement. She was sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nBut the judge allowed her to serve five years of probation instead as long as she paid $50 a month to the corrections department for monitoring her, plus $200 a month toward her fines, fees and restitution.\n\nOver the years, she struggled to keep up with the payments as she worked at mostly low-paying housekeeping jobs at hotels and cared for her husband until he died in 2009. She said her probation officers threatened her: 'Next time you come in and you don't have any money, you're going to jail.'\n\nFearing she would be thrown in prison for nonpayment, she stopped reporting.\n\nThis led to a cycle of probation violations that landed Husband in jail for weeks and on house arrest in 2011. In 2015, she was back in court again. When she explained her fears of being imprisoned for failing to pay, the judge replied, That's no excuse for not reporting to your probation officer where they can keep up with you.\n\nJudge Roger T. Clark told Husband she had to attend and successfully complete the restitution center program at Flowood, according to the hearing transcript. But the court order he signed spelled out something more: She had to stay until she paid her $12,685.50 balance — restitution, fines and fees — with the court.\n\nThe restitution center was 170 miles from her home in Biloxi. When Husband arrived at the work camp in May 2015, she called one of her sons to let him know she had made it.\n\nHe said, 'Happy Mother's Day,' Husband said. It was just so hurtful, because here I am, basically in prison.\n\nUnusual and onerous\n\nJudges are at the heart of the system. Three judges accounted for almost a third of the people at the restitution centers in January 2019. Clark and a colleague also on the coast, Judge Christopher Schmidt, declined to comment. Judge Dal Williamson, of Jones County in South Mississippi, said he typically sends people to the restitution center when they have refused to pay their debts. And you've got a victim out there that needs to be made whole.\n\nIt's the sentences — for a dollar amount rather than a period of time — that make the restitution center program so unusual, and so onerous, inmates and experts agree.\n\nOur review of orders for more than 200 people revealed that judges sent about 80 percent to a center for violating the terms of their probation. In 16 orders, the only violation listed was the defendant's failure to pay.\n\nAlmost all of the inmates were given a specific amount of money they must earn before their release. In 15 cases we found, the judges sentenced defendants to the restitution centers for an amount of money and a time limit of 90 days to three years.\n\nTravis Tanksley, who is a part of the Mississippi Department of Corrections' restitution center program, looks for a customer's processed order while working at BB's Meat Processing in Greenwood, Miss., Monday, February 11, 2019. Marshall Project\n\n'Residents' treated like prisoners\n\nWhile Husband was at the restitution center, the state didn't call her an inmate (it uses the word resident), and she did not have to wear a striped prison uniform. Flowood does house women finishing prison sentences who perform community service for government agencies and local charities.\n\nBut Husband and the 36 other women at the Flowood restitution center at the time slept on the same prison-issued mattresses, ate the same food, and had to follow most of the same restrictions as the other prisoners.\n\nEven when they're at work, restitution program inmates are not allowed to see friends or family, talk on the phone or smoke cigarettes. At the centers, they are assigned chores—Husband said she cleaned the center's vans and washed dishes after meals.\n\nLike others, she had no idea how much money she was accumulating or how long it would take to pay her way out. Inmates can get printouts showing debits and credits in their accounts, which the state calls a monthly balance sheet. But they find the information hard to interpret.\n\nHusband said she couldn't stop thinking about someone she met who had been in the center for two years, trying to pay off $2,000. She began plotting her escape.\n\n'I got to get out of here'\n\nOn July 9, 2015, Husband got up before the other women in her room, she said. She put on jeans and a white Nike T-shirt under her Church's Chicken uniform. She called the restaurant to tell her supervisors she would be taking the day off.\n\nHusband rode with other residents in the back of a white prison van from the Flowood compound until they reached the Church's Chicken. It's at Jackson's Freedom Corner, a civil rights landmark honoring the intersection of Martin Luther King Drive and Medgar Evers Boulevard.\n\nThe van dropped her off before the restaurant opened. Husband asked a coworker to drive her to downtown Jackson. She had already exchanged her quarters for $5 bills that she smuggled into the center by rolling them tight in her ponytail. Now, she used that cash to buy a ticket at the Greyhound station.\n\nThen she hopped on the first bus headed down to the coast—and home. She was one of roughly 70 people who ran away from the restitution centers each year between 2015 and 2017, according to state data.\n\nI wasn't even thinking about those fines anymore, she said. I was just thinking about, 'I got to get out of here.'\n\nShow caption Hide caption Gaylia Mills needed to earn $2,893 at her Sonic Drive-In gig to get out of the Flowood Restitution Center, where she had been sent in... Gaylia Mills needed to earn $2,893 at her Sonic Drive-In gig to get out of the Flowood Restitution Center, where she had been sent in 2018 for violating the terms of her probation on a drug possession charge. A guard stole $660 of her earnings, according to court documents.Not knowing when you're coming home is the worst part, she said. Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today/Report for America\n\nRestitution rarely received\n\nTwo months after Husband escaped, the corrections department sent $1,179 to the Harrison County court. At the rate she was earning money, Husband would have spent more than a year and a half in the restitution center working to pay off her debts, according to our analysis of her earnings reports.\n\nAs an inmate makes money, the corrections department takes the first cut in room and board, then usually holds the remaining earnings until there's enough to pay the entire debt. When someone leaves the program, the corrections department sends their earnings to the court to cover its costs. It distributes the rest to victims, then to pay criminal fines.\n\nIn Husband's case, the payday lender she stole from received just over $600 in restitution according to county records. Paul Goldman, who runs Money Now, told Mississippi Today that he rarely receives restitution when he deals with worker embezzlement at one of his family business's two dozen locations.\n\nWithout repayment, Goldman said, he wants to see those employees locked up. Just for the sake of justice.\n\nFlowood Restitution Center in Flowood, Mississippi. Marshall Project\n\nPunished for being poor\n\nAbout six months after Husband left Flowood, officers found her when a son crashed her car and, not knowing she was evading law enforcement, gave them her address, she said.\n\nA judge sentenced her to her original prison term. She spent almost 10 months at Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in rural Rankin County.\n\nThat's about half as long as she would have spent at the restitution center.\n\nIn the years after she left prison, Husband said, she met with her parole officer each month and paid what she could, usually $20 a visit. She still owed more than $10,000 when she finished parole in September, more than a decade after she was first sentenced for her crime. Husband's criminal case is closed.\n\nNow 52, Husband lives in a small apartment surrounded by palm trees. She works two jobs as a hotel housekeeper, she said, earning about $25,000 a year for 55 to 60 hours of work every week.\n\nLooking back, Husband says she was punished for being poor, saddled with debts she could never repay. She calls her time in prison bittersweet. She felt embarrassed to be there, but relieved to know that when she got out, she would be finished with her punishment at last.\n\nIn the restitution center, You're there without an end. You do not know when you're getting out, when you're going to be finished, she said. That's torture.\n\nAbout the project: Two reporters from Mississippi Today spent 14 months interviewing more than 50 current and former restitution-center inmates and a dozen national experts. We also filed 30 public records requests and, with The Marshall Project, analyzed state data and more than 200 sentencing orders. While the Mississippi Department of Corrections and most judges we contacted denied our repeated interview requests, we relied on hundreds of pages of court documents, hearing transcripts and policy manuals to corroborate inmates' stories.

Proponents say the law, which has been derided by the National Rifle Association, will prevent suicides and other gun deaths. On the other end of the gun-law spectrum, Texas joins 44 other states that allow open carrying of guns.Also Friday, about a dozen states will raise their minimum wage as part of a national campaign to eventually lift the earnings of low-paid workers to $15 an hour. In 2015, New York approved a minimum wage increase for fast-food workers to $15 an hour by 2018 in New York City, and by 2021 in the rest of the state.

WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Lee said Sunday that he did not fault President Donald Trump for the intelligence briefing on Iran last week, which he described as insulting and demeaning, but rather the people who gave the briefing and Congress for ceding its authority on military matters.\n\nIn an interview on CBS News' Face the Nation, the Utah Republican said an adequate amount of information was not shared with Congress about the decision to kill top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike.\n\nAnd Lee said administration officials who briefed lawmakers on the intelligence behind the decision were not helpful and didn't reflect the president's great restraint on Iran.\n\nThe meeting included Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and CIA Director Gina Haspel.\n\nAfter that briefing, Trump told Fox News that one reason Soleimani posed an imminent threat was that the general was planning an attack on four U.S. embassies. Lee said that interview was the first he had heard of such a plot.\n\n'The world is watching':Trump tweets support for Iran protesters\n\nEvidence lacking:Defense secretary Mark Esper didn't see specific evidence of Iran plot against 4 US embassies\n\nI have great respect for President Trump for how he's handled this situation and how he's handled other situations involving his immense power as commander in chief, Lee said. I believe more than any other president in my lifetime, President Trump has shown restraint in the way he's exercised that power.\n\nLee said that though he was not happy to first learn of the purported plot on television, the problem there is not with the president.\n\nThe problem is with those who were briefing us, he said. Lee believed the briefers would have done a different job under the light of day had television cameras been there than they did in private where their boss couldn't see what they were saying.\n\nEsper defended the briefing Sunday on ABC News This Week, saying that for every member that didn't like the brief, there's members that thought it was the greatest brief ever.\n\nI understand the frustration of the broader members of Congress who could not see the full intelligence behind the decision to kill Soleimani, Esper said, but making it available to everyone would jeopardize sources and methods.\n\nLee said the real target of his ire was Congress.\n\nLook, my grievance here is not with the president of the United States. He's exercised his power with great restraint and respect for the Constitution, Lee said. It's not even really as much with the briefers, even though I didn't love the briefing the other day, as it is with Congress. Congress is the problem.\n\nLee plans to vote in favor of a resolution first introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., that would call for Trump to get congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran.\n\nWe have to remember that this isn't just about this president or this war. This is about the future question of what any president can do to get us into any war, Lee said. Over many decades, Congresses and White Houses of every conceivable partisan combination have put us down this path where it's very easy for members of Congress to wash their hands of it.\n\nWe have created this problem, he said.\n\nLike Lee, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is from the GOP's libertarian wing and was unsatisfied with last week's intelligence briefing. Paul also plans to vote for Kaine's war powers resolution.\n\nPaul said he, too, was pleased with Trump's restraint on the use of military force, but he said presidents of both parties have been trying to usurp the authority of Congress to declare war.\n\nI'm willing to stand up even against a president of my party, because we need to stand up and take back the power, Paul said. We also need to debate whether or not we're going to keep sending kids forever to Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nOn Saturday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., repeated his belief in an interview with Fox News that the push to limit Trump's war powers is emboldening the enemy.\n\nI like them both, Graham said when asked about Lee and Paul's position. But all I can tell you is that they're so wrong.\n\nTheir foreign policy is more like Bernie Sanders, less like Ronald Reagan, less like Donald Trump, Graham said. They are libertarians. I am not. I am a Ronald Reagan; I'm a Donald Trump; I'm a George W. Bush Republican.\n\nNavy still a target:Iran claims revenge for Qasem Soleimani's killing, but the US Navy is still a target
DES MOINES – Locked in a tight race, a smaller grouping of presidential candidates is likely to share an Iowa debate stage just three weeks before the state's caucusgoers make the nation's first picks among Democratic candidates.\n\nIt's one of the candidates' last big pitches before the caucuses Feb. 3 – and they have a lot to prove to Iowans. A majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers say they're undecided about their choice for the nomination and are open to changing their minds, according to polling and dozens of interviews along the campaign trail.\n\nThis is a last look for everybody, said Sue Dvorsky, former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party. Us, and everybody in the country.\n\nThe candidates who met the fundraising and polling thresholds are: former Vice President Joe Biden; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; businessman Tom Steyer; and U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nVisual guide:Here's where the 2020 candidates stand on gun control, immigration, student debt and more\n\nThe two-hour event, hosted by CNN in partnership with the Des Moines Register, will be held from 9 to 11 p.m. EST Tuesday at Drake University in Iowa's capital city. The debate will be livestreamed on DesMoinesRegister.com.\n\nIowans, known for paying close attention to news and policy, will have a lot to follow. In a race that has largely focused on health care and climate change, foreign policy is likely to subsume debate energy as tensions in the Middle East have risen following President Donald Trump's decision to order an airstrike that killed a top Iranian official.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's impeachment and a pending Senate trial loom over the debate. Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar, scheduled to participate in Tuesday's debate, also are likely to be jurors in an impeachment trial.\n\nClimate change:Your guide to the 2020 Democratic candidate's positions on the environment\n\nHealth care:The 2020 Democratic candidates share their thoughts on prescription drug costs, Medicare for all and more\n\nBut impeachment timing remains unclear. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she will send articles of impeachment to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell only when she is given more information about how the Senate would conduct its trial.\n\nAll of this will happen amid a backdrop of media and political pundits questioning whether Iowa should keep its first-in-the-nation role in the nomination process. With no candidates of color qualified to join the stage as of late last week, the state's predominantly white population may become a topic of conversation.\n\nI don't think (the candidates are) going … to take pot shots at Iowa, but they might use it to talk in coded language about the process, said Karen Kedrowski, director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics.\n\n'Sometimes historical events just take things over'\n\nThe killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani has dominated recent national news cycles. At events in Iowa and elsewhere, the candidates have addressed his death and escalating developments in the Middle East.\n\nThis is just a classic case of how the agenda is not in control of the people running for office, Kedrowski said. Sometimes historical events just take things over.\n\nCandidates have touched on a range of foreign policy issues in previous debates and have largely shied away from attacking one another on the issues. Given the urgency of the situation in Iran, Tuesday's debate will give them the chance to tout their foreign policy credentials, said Dave Peterson, professor of political science at Iowa State University.\n\nBiden has long emphasized his decades of foreign policy experience, which include his time as vice president under President Barack Obama and as chair of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But rivals will likely criticize his 2002 vote to authorize military force against Iraq. Biden has expressed regret over the vote, but he's also given conflicting narratives about the timeline of his disapproval. His answers have been inaccurate and unsatisfying, Peterson said.\n\nIf I were any of the campaigns, I'd spill a little blood in the water on this, he said.\n\n2020 candidates on foreign policy:The Democrats running for president tell us how they would deal with Iran and North Korea\n\nSanders, who was also a senator before the war with Iraq, voted against the U.S. invasion. He has made it a point to reflect on that and his long pacifist record on the Iowa campaign trail. In recent days, Sanders has called out Biden over his vote, a sign it could come up on Tuesday.\n\nButtigieg, who served in the U.S. Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2014, is the only candidate on stage with military experience. He is likely to showcase how that has shaped his foreign policy views.\n\nBesides veterans' issues, foreign policy nuances generally have not been top of mind for Iowans who get the chance to ask questions of candidates who traipse through the state, said Rachel Caufield, professor of political science at Drake University.\n\nAfter Soleimani's death, Warren answered questions from the media on the general's killing but was not asked about the issue by caucusgoers at recent Iowa campaign events. Biden and Sanders, on the other hand, incorporated remarks on Iran into their stump speeches.\n\nWhat does each candidate need to accomplish?\n\nWith 20 days left, Tuesday's debate leads off the candidates' final push to caucus night. Most will be looking to capture the attention of undecided caucusgoers.\n\nBecause it's the last debate before the caucuses, Caufield said she expects all the candidates to focus on why they're the best person to defeat Trump. Iowans have made beating Trump a top priority in choosing a candidate, Iowa Polls have found.\n\nCaufield predicted Klobuchar will tout her Midwestern roots and her record of winning in counties that voted for Trump; Warren will highlight her plans for anti-corruption and changing the system; Sanders will stick to his populist message; Buttigieg will highlight his faith and perspective as a Washington outsider; and Biden will remind voters that Obama handpicked him to be second-in-command.\n\nSteyer, who qualified to join the debate stage Thursday evening, has blanketed Iowa airwaves with ads promoting his ability as a successful businessman to take on Trump over stewardship of the economy.\n\nIn such a close race among the top candidates, Warren will need to remind voters why they fell in love with her in the first place, Peterson said. Warren has seen ups and downs in early-state polls, riding to the top of September's Iowa Poll, then dropping a few points.\n\nWarren will also likely highlight her recent endorsement from Julián Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development who was running for president until just a few days ago, Peterson said.\n\nI think this could allow the Warren campaign to generate some excitement among her supporters, Kedrowski said. It's not just the same old 'I've got a plan for that.'\n\nFor Biden, he'll be working to shore up existing support by touting his track record and solidifying his moderate Iowa appeal, Peterson said.\n\nButtigieg will need to come prepared to defend his lack of Washington experience and, as in previous debates, his high-dollar fundraisers.\n\nIf I were him, I would hope that everybody focuses on Bernie and Biden, Peterson said.\n\nSanders, on the other hand, may need to bring fresh ideas to the debate stage to win over new caucusgoers. He's maintained a steady core of supporters, some of whom have been ardent fans for years, but he hasn't expanded his support much beyond that base.\n\nWhat have we learned about Bernie Sanders that we didn't know four years ago? He's literally the exact same candidate, Peterson said.\n\nTuesday's debate may set the stage for a lower-tier candidate to break out of a polling rut and make a surprise showing come Feb. 3.\n\nKlobuchar, who has spent a lot of her time in Iowa, needs to build traction to make a solid showing in Iowa, Caufield said.\n\nIt is entirely common in the final week or two weeks before a caucus that one candidate gains substantial momentum and significantly surprises us, she said. Amy Klobuchar seems poised to be one of those candidates if she can really take off and build the momentum.\n\nIowans want candidates to address more than health care\n\nThe expected focus on foreign policy could further shift debate conversation away from health care, which has drawn extensive attention throughout the 2020 cycle. Candidates have been asked during multiple televised debates about whether the government should provide universal coverage to address rising health care costs.\n\nUnlike in the previous debates, health care was not discussed extensively during the sixth debate in December. Penny Rosfjord, a party activist who is a former chair of the Woodbury County Democratic Party, welcomed that.\n\nYou talk to regular Iowans, what they're worried about is their paycheck, she said. … They're worried about their kids.\n\nIn interviews with the Register, Iowans say they hope health care stays a low priority on the debate stage, making room for other issues such as immigration, college student debt and agriculture. Ongoing historic flooding in Iowa and devastating wildfires in Australia will likely serve as a backdrop for the discussion over climate change.\n\nShould it be a crime to enter the U.S. illegally?:We asked the 2020 candidates, here's what they said\n\n2020 candidates on education:Here's where they stand on student loan forgiveness, free college and more\n\nWe've sort of played health care to death, Peterson said.\n\nOlivia Habinck, the 20-year-old president of the College and Young Democrats of Iowa, said young people want more discussion on climate change and student debt.\n\nThose issues are really pivotal to us and our futures, she said.\n\nSteve Villatoro, chair of the Iowa Democratic Party's Latino Caucus, said he is hoping to hear candidates take up Castro's positions, specifically on immigration. The former candidate also highlighted issues such as racial inequity and the need for affordable housing.\n\nThe point here is the African Americans and Latinos are part of a democratic society, and we'd like to have a platform for our communities, Villatoro said.\n\nAbout the debate:\n\nWhen: 9 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 14\n\nWhere: Sheslow Auditorium, Drake University, Des Moines\n\nModerators: CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, CNN political correspondent Abby Phillip and Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nHow to watch: The debate will air live on CNN.

When it comes to equal pay for equal work, a majority of women believe that in the age of #metoo, an appropriate Twitter handle might be #notyet.\n\nA new survey by Ellevest, a financial firm focused on women investors, found 83% of women believe that men are often paid more than their female colleagues for the same work — and 61% of men agree.\n\nSurvey:money is power\n\nMeanwhile, 48% of women think they have to work twice as hard as a man to take home half the pay, and just 42% believe their opportunities on the job are the same as their male colleagues. That's compared to 58% of men who believe that the playing field is fair.\n\nStill, at a time when a national conversation is taking place about sexual harassment, Sallie Krawcheck, Ellevest's CEO, believes society may finally be poised to focus on another disparity fracturing the workplace — unequal pay.\n\nThe gender pay gap is alive and well,'' says Krawcheck, who co-founded Ellevest in Nov. 2014. But I hope this is the beginning of a first step for companies to really open their eyes, women to work together and for us to work to close it.''\n\nIn 2015, women were on average paid 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the non-profit Institute for Women's Policy Research. The numbers were even worse for women of color, with black women earning 68% of what was paid to white men and Hispanic women's pay amounting to just 62% of their white male peers, according to the IWPR.\n\nBut just as dozens of sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein triggered an examination of such behavior and led to the downfall of numerous prominent media figures, including former Today anchor Matt Lauer and actor Kevin Spacey, high-profile cases are now turning a spotlight on the gender wage gap.\n\nMore:Mark Wahlberg donates $1.5M to #TimesUp\n\nLast month, former E! News host Catt Sadler accused the network of paying her roughly half the salary earned by her male-co-host Jason Kennedy, a disparity E! Chief Frances Berwick has since said was due to their different roles.\n\nThen, this month, USA TODAY reported that actress Michelle Williams was paid less than $1,000 — or less than one-tenth of 1% — of the $1.5 million paid to her co-star Mark Wahlberg for reshoots of the film All the Money in the World. Following a fierce backlash, Wahlberg said on Saturday that he would be donating his fee, in Williams' name, to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund that has been established to assist those who are subjected to sexual harassment or abuse in the workplace.\n\nWhile the country fitfully moves toward paying women on par with their male peers, Krawcheck says that in the meantime, women need to be investing what they can. Currently, they are leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table because they are not investing at the same rate as their male counterparts.\n\nI say to them, look if you had a hole in your pocketbook ... and a hundred bucks fell out, how many days would it take you to fix your pocketbook?'' Krawcheck says. You shouldn't wait. Just because you have a gender pay gap doesn't mean 'Oh gosh. Never mind.' That's like saying 'I broke my arm and I broke my leg. Doctor, you may not fix my arm until my leg is fixed.' We all need to do what we can do to get ourselves financially stable.''\n\nMore:BBC's China editor resigns over gender pay gap dispute\n\nMore:Michelle Williams responds to Wahlberg, agency donating $2M to Time's Up\n\nMore:Three major arguments happening around the Hollywood pay gap, explained\n\nHelping women gain their financial footing was the key motivation for Krawcheck to start her own firm after a career that included stints heading Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and Smith Barney. But she says that she was initially reluctant.\n\nWhen others encouraged her to launch a women-focused investment firm, I really thought it was a sexist pandering idea, that women didn't need anything any different,'' she says. But as I took a step back I realized how much not investing was costing women ... I finally said I don't care if I, on first blush, thought it was a bad idea. Women are not being well-served by the investing industry. We have to build something from the ground up.''\n\nAnd being in command of their money significantly lifts women's self esteem, with 63% saying in the Ellevest survey that building savings and investments that can fund their goals means more to them than their education or even the support of their family.\n\nAs for the wage gap, I am actually more hopeful than I have been in a long time about us closing it,'' Krawcheck says.\n\nMoney may not buy happiness, but money is power,'' she added. It is key to peace of mind. It is key to levels of comfort, and ... in this day and age, it's key to saying 'quit chasing me around the desk. Take this job and shove it.' 
Christopher Buskirk\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nPresident Trump promised in his first inaugural address that his administration would be guided by one crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. He went on to say that every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. His first year in office has been the story of promises kept.\n\nAnd while the president's critics reflect on a year full of sound and fury, the president and his supporters will take satisfaction in a year of successes despite unyielding opposition.\n\nBy every measure of personal and national prosperity, the nation is better off than it was one year ago. The Trump administration has overseen a renewed respect for citizenship. Gone is the lofty sounding rhetoric of globalism that led to unwinnable foreign wars and open borders. Back is talk of what we can do together as Americans.\n\nMore:Don't diagnose our president. Diagnose our enemies instead.\n\nMore:Stop trying to diagnose our 'very stable genius' president. He might be right.\n\nYou'd hardly know of his accomplishments by watching cable news, which continue indulging its perverse obsession with Russian conspiracy theories, West Wing intrigue and the president's Twitter feed. It's exhausting — and also largely beside the point.\n\nAlso conspicuous were the dogs that didn't bark. These are the predictions of imminent calamity certain to accompany a Trump presidency that have, happily, failed to materialize. For one, nuclear war did not break out, despite this being one of the Trump detractors' favorite predictions. Nor did the president sell the country down the river to Russian President Vladimir Putin, he didn't ignore court orders, didn't shut down the free press, and didn't fire special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nAfter a year of peace and prosperity, more people are likely to believe that such outlandish predictions tell us less about the president and more about the temperament of his critics.\n\nSo what did Trump accomplish? For one thing, he appointed an all-star Cabinet that has been quietly and dutifully implementing the president's agenda even as their boss runs interference for them, taking the slings and arrows of a hostile media. He has appointed more judges to the federal bench in his first year than any president ever, including Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. And they are constitutionalists. This alone will represents a signal triumph that will resound for the next few generations.\n\nThere's more. Under Trump, construction has begun on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines even as the United States will soon achieve oil production of 10 million barrels per day, will become a net exporter of oil sometime in the next decade, and is set to rival Russia as the world's largest oil producer by 2019.\n\nAdd to that low unemployment, rising wages, a booming stock market and a tax cut that will put more money in middle-class pockets starting next month and you have the makings of a very successful presidency. Did I mention that Obamacare's noxious individual mandate has been consigned to history's dustbin as well?\n\nAnd there's more.\n\nAt the border, illegal crossings are down as much as 60%, showing that a willingness to enforce the law and end incentives to enter the country illegally will change behavior.\n\nLikewise, Trump has overseen a change in national security policy from the globalist moral imperialism of his recent predecessors to the interests based in realism that he calls America First. His speeches in Warsaw, Poland, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were triumphs. They encouraged our friends and put our enemies on notice.\n\nAnd for all the talk of Russian conspiracies, Trump has taken a tough stance with Putin — willing to work with him where it advances U.S. interests but also arming Ukraine in its ongoing fight with Russia.\n\nMore:Meet Trump in the middle. Come to the table and protect 'dreamers.'\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nIn the Middle East, ISIS has gone from a burgeoning caliphate stretching from the Atlantic to the Levant to a failed pseudo-state, while Trump has revitalized our decades old alliance with Saudi Arabia and its new, reformist crown prince.\n\nBack in Washington, Trump's appointees are quietly cutting regulations pursuant to one of his first executive orders, which instructs them to cut two regulations for every new one they put in place.\n\nThere is much yet to be done. There is a wall that the president has promised to build and infrastructure he has promised to rebuild. There are yet more judges to be appointed and, perhaps most difficult, a swamp yet to be drained. So to Trump's critics I say, go ahead, keep talking. While you're doing that, Trump will be governing.\n\nChris Buskirk is the editor & publisher of American Greatness.

Financial markets were jolted Wednesday by a report that China — the biggest foreign holder of U.S. government bonds — could curtail its purchases, a shift that has spooked investors already leery of a rise in interest rates at the start of 2018.\n\nBloomberg News, citing unnamed people close to the matter, said Chinese officials are considering slowing — or even stopping — its purchases of U.S. government debt. The report suggests that China feels U.S. debt is becoming less attractive when compared to other types of investments. Trade tensions between the world's two largest economies was also cited as a possible reason why China is thinking about reducing its U.S. holdings, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIf the reports turn out to be true and China no longer sees Treasuries as an attractive option, the repercussions could be significant, says Craig Erlam, senior market strategist at OANDA, a currency trading firm with offices in New York. A significant change in policy could put considerable upside pressure on U.S. yields.\n\nLow interest rates, of course, have been a big driver of the stock market rally the past nine years and has also provided a lift to the economy, as middle-class Americans have benefited from lower borrowing costs.\n\nAt the end of October 2017, China held $1.19 trillion of U.S. Treasuries, the most of any foreign country, according to the latest data from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Board. Japan was second with U.S. bond holdings worth $1.09 trillion.\n\nThe fear is that, at a time when the Federal Reserve has started reducing its holdings of U.S. debt (coupled with news that Japan is reducing its Treasury purchases and China might follow suit), there will be less demand for U.S. debt. And that fewer buyers will result in higher interest rates and borrowing costs in the U.S.\n\nMore:Why January matters to stock investors with 401(k) accounts\n\nMore:Retirement crisis: 37% of Gen X say they won't be able to afford to retire\n\nMore:Why January matters to stock investors with 401(k) accounts\n\nBond investors would also get hurt because falling bond prices is the cause of higher yields.\n\nBut Erlam says it is too early to speculate on the likelihood that China will suddenly reduce its holdings. What's more, he adds, it is likely that China would tread carefully if it does opt to sell U.S. Treasuries so as not to destabilize the markets.\n\nThe financial market reaction to the Bloomberg report was swift. The price of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, climbing as high as 2.598%, its highest level since March 14, 2017. It finished unchanged at 2.55%.\n\nStocks also dipped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 17 points, recovering nearly all of its losses after an earlier drop of nearly 129 points.\n\nInterest rates had already been rising to start 2018, as investors begin to price in prospects for faster U.S. growth, more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and rising inflation pressures, in part due to rising wages as the job market tightens further.\n\nYou already had this backdrop of rising rates and people are getting nervous, says Boris Rjavinski, senior interest rate strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. And when you get another story like China, a major holder of U.S. Treasuries possibly stepping back from the market, it adds to the overall bearish trend in the Treasury market.\n\nJim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthhold Group, a money-management firm in Minneapolis, says China is more likely eyeing sales of U.S. bonds for the same reason investors in the U.S. and elsewhere are: Fear that inflation is on the rise and will erode the value of fixed-income investments.\n\nThis happens every time rates go up, Paulsen explains. Everyone (that owns U.S. Treasuries) is worried that they will get killed if (prices fall and rates rise), so they lighten up on their exposure to these bonds,\n\nStill, Rjavinski stresses that it is premature to think that yields are on the verge of a sharp spike higher and that the multi-decade bull market in bonds is over and a bear market has begun.\n\nThe key question is whether it is in China's best interest to sell U.S. Treasuries as an opening salvo in what could become a trade war, analysts say.\n\nWould the Chinese risk losing their investments in the U.S. market to make a political statement, particularly when their holdings are most likely targeted for broader investments in the U.S.? says Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE — When it came down to the story that would dominate Thursday at the Australian Open it wasn't about who won or lost. Instead the talk was all about the scorching heat wave that is blanketing the city.\n\nTemperatures soared to over 100 degrees, and that's a lot cooler than the furnace it would feel like on court with the sun beating directly down on the cement.\n\nBroiling – or rather playing – for 2 hours, 45 minutes in the thick of the day was the fate of 14th-seeded Novak Djokovic and Gael Monfils. Both struggled through the conditions, feeling at times as if they were wilting and might not have more to give.\n\nBut in the end, they were both still standing to walk off the court after Djokovic managed to edge past Monfils 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 to move onto the third round.\n\nMORE FROM MELBOURNE:\n\nThe 39th-ranked Monfils, who won the Doha title two weeks ago, categorized Thursday's conditions as tough to breathe and the hardest I have [experienced].\n\nFor sure, you know, we took a risk, said Monfils, who had a trainer and doctor out on the court ahead of the third set. It's a little bit hot, maybe a little bit too hot.\n\nI got super dizzy, he added. I think I have a small heat stroke for 40 minutes. Couldn't feel like fresh.\n\nDjokovic, who has conquered the Australian summer to win the tournament six times in the past, concurred it was a day more suited to indoor past-times and air conditioning than outdoor activities.\n\nThe conditions were brutal, that's for sure, the former No. 1 said. We both struggled. Maybe he struggled a bit more, end of the second, entire third set. That's where I managed to get on top of him, get even on sets, obviously start off well in the third.\n\nNeedless to say, many wondered why the tournament didn't just push the button and close the convertible top roofs they have on three of their stadiums. Well, there's a rule about this kind of decision and it's called the Extreme Heat Policy, or EHP for short.\n\nTo simplify, the ultimate decision is at the Referee's discretion, but the guideline is the ambient temperature needs to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), plus a Wet Bulb Globe Temperature – it registers humidity – needs to exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Expectations are those levels could be reached on Friday, which is expected to be even hotter.\n\nThe rule also states that If there is a closure of the roofs because of heat all matches being played on courts without roofs must be suspended until conditions are deemed playable again.\n\nDjokovic, who likely was told by a teacher somewhere in his life to remember to respond to questions with complete answers, offered an entire typed page opinion on the subject of the safety to play or not to play in unbearable heat.\n\nIt was right at the limit, said Djokovic, offering his assessment of whether it reached critical conditions on Thursday.\n\nI think there are certain days where you have to, as a tournament supervisor, recognize that you might need to give players few extra hours until it [the temperatures] comes down, he added. I understand there is a factor of tickets. If you don't play matches, people will be unhappy. You have to take into consideration different angles before making a big call like that….People might say, 'Well, at this level you have to be as a professional player fit…But I think there is a limit, and that is a level of, I guess, tolerance between being fit and being, I think, in danger in terms of health.\n\nDespite at one point receiving a time violation for taking more than the 25-second rule between points, Djokovic went out of his way to compliment Australian umpire John Blom for how he handled the match considering the extenuating circumstances.\n\nChair umpire was doing a good job today, I think, he said. He was really trying to participate in the game and understand what's happening.\n\nThe weather conversation became something of a moot point in terms of play carrying on, and the win provided Djokovic with further proof he's ready to be back on tour following six months sidelined with a right elbow injury.\n\nIt was a big challenge for both of us to be on the court, to be able to finish the match, Djokovic said. I'm just glad that I managed to come out on top.\n\nDjokovic's victory extended his winning streak against Monfils to 15-0, and it's not just against Monfils that he's experienced good luck when facing French players.\n\nClearly, French opponents is a motivational factor for Djokovic as he's only lost to one Frenchman in his last 59 matches played against someone from that country. The player who had the audacity to interfere with his having a perfect winning streak against French competitors was Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who won their third round match at the 2014 Toronto tournament.\n\nDjokovic's win over Monfils extends his winning streak over French players at the Grand Slams to 25 and counting. Overall at the majors, Djokovic has a 34-2 winning record over Frenchmen, only losing to Sebastien Grosjean at 2005 Wimbledon and Tsonga at Melbourne Park in 2010.\n\nI don't have anything against the French, said Djokovic, laughing, when asked why he's made a habit of picking on them throughout his career. Actually, I get along very well with Gael and most of the guys. It's sports.
Sally Jacobs\n\nPRI\n\nGeorge Keays is not a rogue kind of a man. A Colorado real estate agent and grandfather of three, the 65-year-old practices yoga and meditates regularly. But the U.S. government, he says, has left him no choice but to break the law. If, that is, he intends to stay alive.\n\nKeays has stage 4 lung cancer. As his treatment options appeared to be dwindling this fall, he went to Cuba for a vaccine treatment despite a federal law that prohibits Americans from going there for health care. Now, with President Trump's recent tightening of the regulations governing travel to Cuba, it has become much harder to travel there. But Keays needs more of the vaccine. This spring, he's going back.\n\nI am not looking to break the law. But I am not looking to die, either, Keays declared. People with stage 4 cancer, like me, should be allowed to try whatever they want to stay alive, whatever they think will work. The last thing they need is the government on your neck over some archaic regulation saying just take what is available here and die.\n\nKeays has abundant company. In the two years since relations between the U.S. and Cuba were normalized under President Barack Obama, a growing number of lung cancer patients traveled to Cuba for a vaccine called Cimavax, and more recently, a newer vaccine, Vaxira. These patients are an elusive group. None of those who went apparently provided their real reason for going to Cuba when applying for a visa, nor did many of them declare to U.S. customs officials that they were bringing multiple vials of the vaccine into the U.S. on their return. Few even tell their doctors they are taking the injections for fear they will refuse to treat them further.\n\nI can only see it as compromising him because now he has a patient on a drug that is not approved by the FDA, said a patient in Florida named Larry, who asked that his last name not be used. Larry has gone to Cuba twice for the vaccine — both times without telling his doctor because, He might be afraid he would be sued, or he might stop treating me.\n\nJust how effective are the vaccines they're smuggling into the country in their small refrigerated lunch boxes is unclear. Neither of the vaccines prevents cancer; rather, they are a kind of immunotherapy that prompts the body's immune system to battle the disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In January, the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y., launched a clinical trial of Cimavax with Cuba's Center of Molecular Immunology, which developed the vaccine. It is the first such joint venture between the two countries since the Cuban revolution.\n\nRoswell is now doing research to determine if they want to do a similar trial with Vaxira. It will take years for either of the drugs to receive any final approval.\n\nFor many patients, including some who were not accepted into the Roswell trial, travel to Cuba has become a much-talked-about option. So popular has the practice become that patients on Internet support groups routinely trade anecdotes and travel tips about their Cuban journeys. Until, that is, Trump threw a wrench into the process.\n\nMajor changes for patients going to Cuba\n\nThe change in regulations governing travel to Cuba that went into effect in November altered one of the most popular categories of travel to Cuba initiated by Obama, known as people-to-people, which allowed travelers to go to Cuba on their own. That's how many Americans have been quietly going to the island for medical care, even though doing so is prohibited under the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Now, people in this category must travel with an organization and have a guide present.\n\nAmericans can continue to travel on their own to Cuba for the purpose of professional research or to provide support for the Cuban people. But given that travelers in those categories are required to maintain a full schedule of activities, it's likely that neither will be a good option for cancer patients.\n\nAt the La Pradera International Health Center in Havana, where most American cancer patients go for treatment, Dr. Anabely Estévez García felt the impact of the new regulations in her inbox as soon as Trump announced back in June that the changes were in the works. American patients began canceling their plans in a flood.\n\nWe can not go at this time, a Texas man emailed García on the day of Trump's announcement. President Trump changed everything today. It is not possible to go directly from here. Keep us in touch.\n\nA patient in New York on the brink of travel wrote that she had decided to wait a little longer. Now, it will be harder to get there as our President has made it impossible to travel alone.\n\nNancy Kelly, 71, a California patient who traveled to Cuba for Vaxira this past spring, emailed that she was worried about the new regulations, too. How would she replenish her vaccine supply when it ran out in October? She decided not to go herself but sent a friend to Cuba to pick up more for her.\n\nIt was important to get back to Cuba before Trump's restrictions went into effect, sighed Kelly. With the new restrictions, I would need to go through a third country. The problem is that the vaccine has to be refrigerated, so, if you were on a long flight, that was going to be a problem.\n\nThe tighter regulations are only part of what is keeping patients from going. Another factor is the State Department advisory issued this past September warning American citizens not to go to Cuba due to alleged assaults against American Embassy staff. Investigators have yet to determine exactly who or what was behind the assaults, and the staff in Havana has been significantly reduced. For some travelers, it's all just too much.\n\nSince relations between the U.S. and Cuba were normalized at the end of 2014, the number of patients going to the plush La Pradera clinic at the city's edge had risen steadily. In 2016, 50 Americans came for treatment. Last year, the number of inquiries about the vaccines tripled over the previous year, while 47 patients had already made the journey to Cuba in the first eight months of 2017, according to García. Now, the numbers have plateaued.\n\nThere are many patients who are suitable for treatment but who do not come for political reasons, said García, seated in a treatment room at La Pradera this fall. As a physician, I feel very bad because I believe our vaccine is a good treatment that can extend these people's lives.\n\nBecause their own doctors are often not involved, patients wanting to go to Cuba must make arrangements themselves. First, they get in touch with La Pradera either through email or one of a number of medical tourism agencies in the U.S. or in Canada. They then send their medical records for evaluation by La Pradera physicians who determine if they are eligible for one of the vaccines, and if so, which one.\n\nUnder the Obama-era regulations, accepted patients usually informed the airlines issuing their visas that they were going for educational purposes or under the general people-to-people category. Questions were rarely asked and most flew directly to Cuba.\n\nPatients stay at the La Pradera clinic, a resort-like facility with a swimming pool and fountains, for four days, during which they receive their first of several doses of the vaccine. Each dose consists of four injections — two to the arms and two to the buttocks. One dose costs about $860, so the total cost of the trip, including airfare, lodging and a supply of the medication to take back home, can run well over $10,000.\n\nAt P&G Travel in Ontario, long one of the more popular agencies among Americans for booking travel to Cuba, the numbers are both up and down. Since Trump announced in June that he would be reversing aspects of the Obama administration's overtures to Cuba, the number of Americans booking travel directly from the U.S. to Cuba through the agency has plummeted by 60%. Instead, they're now going through third countries just like they used to do before Obama's normalization of relations. Since June, the number of bookings by Americans going to the island from countries other than the U.S. has increased by 30%, according to Tathiana Gonzalez, the agency's Cuba travel specialist.\n\nYou're either going to go or not go, said Gonzalez. When you're given a month to live, you go. It's kind of basic.\n\nWhat they are going for is part of the new wave of immunotherapy treatment that works by triggering a patient's immune system to fight cancer. Cimavax, for example, stimulates the immune system to make antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor, or EGF, that cancer cells need to grow, effectively starving the cancer. Vaxira is somewhat different; it triggers an immune response against a molecule specific to several cancers and is intended to ultimately block the cancer's growth. Only patients who have already received chemotherapy are eligible for the vaccines.\n\nCubans research a lung cancer vaccine\n\nWhile Cuba is often recognized for its pristine beaches and throbbing rumbas, it is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry. Prompted by the country's high rate of lung cancer, researchers began work on a lung cancer vaccine back in the mid-1990s. In the most recent of several Cuban trials, patients receiving Cimavax lived about three to five months longer than those who did not. Available to Cubans for free since 2011, it has been given to more than 5,000 patients worldwide.\n\nCimavax is currently available in Cuba, Colombia, Peru, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Paraguay. Vaxira, which one Cuban clinical trial indicates can extend life by up to two months, is currently undergoing more testing in Argentina. It is available in that country and in Cuba.\n\nRoswell scientists began collaborating with Havana's Center of Molecular Immunology, which developed the vaccines, in 2011, and scientists from both countries have worked in one another's laboratories frequently over the years. In the Roswell trial, Cimavax is being combined with a checkpoint inhibitor, which blocks proteins on cancer cells, called Opdivo.\n\nWhile talk of Cimavax has circulated in American medical circles for years, much less is known about Vaxira. Roswell researchers are currently doing preclinical studies of Vaxira in animals to determine if the vaccine merits a possible human trial. Dr. Igor Puzanov, director of the early phase clinical trials program at Roswell, said that it could take up to a year before a decision can be made on whether to proceed.\n\nWe know what the vaccine is supposed to do, he said. It's just too early to say if it does it.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Center of Molecular Immunology, scientists are now focused on taking Cimavax to a next step. They are working to extend patients' survival rate by identifying markers in those who are responsive to the vaccine. Patients with high concentrations of the EGF protein, for example, have been shown to be more responsive to the vaccine than those who do not. Camilo Rodriguez, a clinical researcher at the center who has worked on Cimavax for 15 years, says he believes that eventually, the vaccine might be used on a host of cancers.\n\nWe feel that the vaccine could be very effective against prostate cancer, for example, because those patients often have a high degree of EGF and that is related to the spread of cancer, said Rodriguez, seated in his laboratory. Eventually, we feel this could be useful in all kinds of cancer affecting the head, neck, bladder and prostate.\n\nAmerican doctors are not so sure. While some are cautiously optimistic about Cimavax and await the outcome of the Roswell trial with interest, others complain that the vaccine has been oversold and is in sore need of further study. Dr. Robert Doebele, associate professor of medical oncology at the University of Colorado- Denver and a senior editor of the American Association for Cancer Research's journal Clinical Cancer Research, recalls sitting in a meeting with a dozen other oncologists discussing the best way to market a drug. Someone in the room called out, Do whatever Cimavax does!\n\nWe all let out a collective groan, said Doebele, who is George Keays' oncologist. It was hilarious. The fact is that I spend several hours a month answering questions from my patients about this. It's very prominent on the Internet and patients are understandably desperate to learn about it. But the fact is that we just don't know if this works yet.\n\nDr. Roy S. Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale University and a nationally recognized expert in the treatment of lung cancer, shares those reservations. Herbst says that without seeing new stats, it's not that impressive. For the moment, he added, I am not too worried about people not being able to go to Cuba.\n\nLike several other doctors of the patients interviewed for this story, Doebele advised Keays not to go to Cuba for the vaccine. One reason for that is that Keays is currently taking Tagrisso, a standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Doebele is concerned that if Keays shows improvement while taking that and one of the Cuban vaccines, it will be impossible to tell which medication was responsible. But Doebele has other worries.\n\nMy biggest concern is safety because of the lack of oversight and regulation. I can't control what he does; I don't even know where he's getting it. Was it even a legitimate clinic where he got it? said Doebele. I thought I'd talked him out of it.\n\nBut he hadn't. Keays did apply to participate in the Roswell trial, as Doebele suggested, but he was put on the waiting list. He became frustrated that he might wind up in the placebo group in the study, and so he decided to go right to the front of the line. Cuba.\n\nKeays arrived at the La Pradera clinic in October and was advised that the vaccine most suited to his cancer was Vaxira. After consulting with his family doctor, Boulder internist William L. Blanchet, who was traveling with him, Keays received his first dose.\n\nTwenty minutes after I received it, I felt a little tired, but that was it, said Keays. The next day, I went for an hour run. I felt great.\n\nIf Keays was impressed by the professionalism of the doctors, Blanchet was even more so.\n\nOn paper, this looks very promising, Blanchet said of the vaccine. It resonates as being medically sound and potentially a major addition. It's too soon to recommend it to patients, but I would make them aware of it and let them make the decision. If I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, I would definitely go down and have this be part of my therapy.\n\nOne of the other patients at La Pradera when Keays was there was Eduardo Sanchez, of Spain, a lean man with graying hair. Diagnosed with advanced stage 4 lung cancer, Sanchez said he, too, had exhausted most of the treatments available to him. Like most American patients, he learned much of what he knew of the Cuban vaccines on the Internet.\n\nUnfortunately, in Spain, there is no information about the Cimavax or the Vaxira, he said. It's too early for me to say, but I am very hopeful.\n\nQuestions on how to bring back the vaccine\n\nFor advanced stage cancer patients like Sanchez and Keays, going to Cuba can be difficult in itself. The trip is tiring and can be daunting for those for whom the treatment may be viewed as something of a last resort. Now, American patients face an even higher hurdle in the new and somewhat confusing regulations. The question many patients are wrestling with is how to get in and out of the country without getting caught, given the likelihood of greater scrutiny.\n\nOver the past two years, it appears that no one has been apprehended. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's personal importation policy allows some unapproved medications to be brought into the country, provided there is not an adequate alternative available in the U.S. and the amount does not exceed a three-month supply. But spokesmen for both the FDA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection say there is no record of either of the Cuban vaccines having been brought into the country or seized at the border.\n\nJust how to bring the vaccine into the U.S. is a hot topic on the online health care social network, Inspire, which supports a lung cancer group of about 53,000 members. Judy Ingels, 74, is one of them. Diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2015, Ingels went on Tarceva and her tumor shrunk somewhat. After she saw a CNN report on Cimavax at the end of 2016, she decided to go to Cuba while she was relatively well and still able to do so. Last spring, she and her family traveled from their home in Santa Rosa, Calif., to Havana, where she received her first treatment of the vaccine. All told, the trip cost about $16,000. That she was breaking the law did not trouble her in the slightest.\n\nI just didn't get hung up on it, said Ingels. My husband said, 'When they ask what your purpose is, just don't mention anything about medicine.'\n\nIngels had no trouble carrying an eight-month supply of Cimavax back into the U.S. in a hand-held refrigerated lunch bag. When she told the Transportation Security Administration agent in Florida that she was carrying a vaccine, he opened her bag and poked around but asked no questions.\n\nIn the months that followed, Ingels's tumor shrunk perceptibly, a fact that she attributes to Cimavax. Now, however, her supply has run out and she wants more. Presuming that she cannot travel with a guided group, given her purpose, she is considering hiring one of several professional mules who will fly to Cuba to get the vaccine for a fee. Two of them contacted by PRI declined to be interviewed.\n\nWe're weighing the options, said Ingels. We might travel ourselves through the Bahamas. But I have also talked to an individual who has offered to do this.\n\nNancy Kelly, who had a friend travel to Cuba on her behalf, was considering a return trip. But when a scan last fall showed that her tumor is growing, she changed her plans — at least for the moment. The change in her circumstance has not dimmed the retired administrative judge's anger at the government's imposition of limitations on American patients' ability to seek the treatment they want.\n\nI think it's absolutely outrageous. What Trump has done makes it so much more difficult to go, said Kelly. The restrictions that do not permit doctors in different countries to corroborate to help save lives is absolutely terrible.\n\n\n\nKeays is running into a similar problem since a recent scan showed that a mass on his liver is growing. Doebele, his oncologist, believes that means that neither the Vaxira nor the Tagrisso is working. Doebele has suggested Keays go off the Vaxira, in part, so that he might qualify for other treatments, but Keays continues to have faith. He's planning on returning to Havana in the spring for more of the vaccine. Keays intends to apply for a visa under the category of professional research arguing that he is a guinea pig for the Vaxira vaccine. He has become, after all, something of an expert on the subject. Over the past two years, he's tried a wide variety of treatments: two targeted therapies, multiple forms of radiation and a lot of meditation. He's been on Vaxira now for two months.\n\nIn between doctor's appointments, Keays has been working on a letter to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, hoping he might intervene on patients' behalf. He's getting other patients to write, too.\n\nI intend to do whatever I can to expose how these restrictions steal the hope, and possibly, the life, from patients suffering with terminal cancer, as well as other sicknesses that might benefit from Cuba's advances in medicine, declared Keays. The ignorance in this new policy is astounding.\n\nIn the meantime, for patients disheartened by an American government and doctors who seem to offer them only discouragement regarding Cuba, there is one source of potential support: travel agents like Tathiana Gonzalez in Ontario.\n\nUnaffected by the U.S. regulations, Gonzalez routinely forwards dozens of American patients' medical records to La Pradera, on their behalf, to see if they qualify for one of the vaccines. It's the only instance in which she gets involved in her clients' medical needs because, she says, the process is so stressful. She's the first to admit that she's no medical researcher, but she notices that some of the cancer patients that she's helped get to Cuba have lived for years. Like her clients, she waits anxiously for a response from the Cuban doctors: Are they accepted to go, or not?\n\nIt's such an emotional roller coaster, exclaimed Gonzalez. If they're not accepted, I cry because their cancer is so advanced. If they are accepted, I rejoice! I say, 'You're going! You are going to Cuba!'\n\nThis story was reported with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. It was originally published on PRI.org.

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump played down rhetorical attacks from Kim Jong Un as the end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without any new nuclear tests in North Korea – but with threats of future ones.\n\nIf the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK (North Korea), there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, the Korean Central News Agency said, quoting Kim as he announced he no longer feels bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing.\n\nTrump, speaking with reporters at his annual New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, said he still has a very good relationship with Kim, with whom he has met three times.\n\nHe likes me, I like him, we get along, Trump said, adding: He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization. ... I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out.\n\nIn announcing that his moratorium on nuclear testing is no longer operative, Kim also told a meeting of ruling party officials in North Korea he would unveil a new strategic weapon in the near future, the state news agency said. Kim had given the United States an end-of-the-year deadline to reduce economic sanctions on his country or face the prospect of new nuclear tests.\n\nThe DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy, the Korean Central News Agency reported Kim as saying.\n\nTrump administration officials had feared such a test during the holiday – a North Korea official had threatened a Christmas gift to the U.S. – but nothing had happened as midnight passed in North Korea.\n\nIn speaking with reporters, Trump joked that he hoped Kim's Christmas present was a beautiful vase ... as opposed to something else.\n\nTrump remains hopeful of a denuclearization agreement with North Korea, though critics say Kim's government has continued to develop nuclear programs even after the two leaders signed a document at their first summit in June of 2018. The two men also met in 2019 in Vietnam and at the North Korea-South Korea border.\n\nWhile Trump often cites the Singapore agreement as a hopeful sign, critics pointed out that it was nonspecific and nonbinding when it came to North Korea giving up nuclear weapons.\n\nKim signed nothing binding regarding nukes or missiles. No Kim ever has, tweeted Robert E. Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea.\n\nHe added: And Republicans used to know that the Kims shouldn't be trusted. But now the GOP's a cult of personality, right? So if the great leader says it's true, it must be so.
WASHINGTON – John Bolton, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, said Monday that he is prepared to testify in a Senate impeachment trial – if he's subpoenaed by the Republican-controlled chamber.\n\nI have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify, Bolton said in a statement Monday.\n\nBolton's unexpected statement – coming after he's played coy for weeks about what he knows and whether he would dish on Trump – plays into the hands of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrats.\n\nIf Senate Republicans now refuse to subpoena Bolton and other witnesses, they would make absolutely clear they are participating in a cover-up, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said shortly after Bolton issued his statement.\n\nDemocrats want Bolton to testify, hoping he would be a bombshell witness in their case against Trump, which accuses the president of soliciting interference from Ukraine in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBolton has hinted that he could offer new details about the Ukraine pressure campaign.\n\nHe was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, his lawyer said in a November letter to House Democrats, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\n\nOn Monday, Bolton said he's tried to balance his obligations as a citizen and as former National Security Adviser, portraying himself as torn between a presidential directive not to testify and a desire to comply with a congressional request for information.\n\nBut skeptics questioned the sincerity of Bolton's offer, saying the Republican-run Senate is unlikely to call any witnesses.\n\nThe House impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstructing Congress in a historic vote on Dec. 18. Pelosi has not yet sent the two articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial; she's holding them back as leverage in her effort to pressure Republicans to call new witnesses during a Senate trial.\n\nIn November, Bolton defied a request from Democrats leading the House impeachment inquiry to testify. At the time, Bolton's lawyer told lawmakers he would take the impeachment committee to court if it subpoenaed him.\n\nHouse Democrats decided not to subpoena Bolton during their probe, arguing it would delay their investigation with a protracted court battle; instead, they labeled Bolton's refusal to appear as evidence of obstruction.\n\nSince the House vote, Schumer has pushed for summoning four witnesses who did not testify during the House inquiry, including Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has balked at calling any witnesses, pushing for a quick trial that would lead to Trump's acquittal. Republicans have criticized Pelosi for refusing to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, saying they have not yet been able to organize the trial.\n\nMcConnell did not mention Bolton by name during a Senate floor speech on Monday, but said he wants the House impeachment prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys to present their cases before the Senate decides whether to call witnesses.\n\nThere's no question Bolton, who clashed with Trump repeatedly and left the White House on acrimonious terms, could provide an insider's account of Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for political favors.\n\nAccording to Fiona Hill, one of Bolton's former deputies, Bolton was alarmed by the Ukraine pressure campaign, particularly the role of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, played in carrying out that shadow foreign policy agenda. Hill said Bolton called Giuliani a hand grenade and referred to the Ukraine effort as a drug deal that would backfire on the White House.\n\nImpeachment supporters welcomed the prospect of Bolton's testimony, saying he can shed light on the president's decision to temporarily block aid to Ukraine as he and others pressing Zelensky to open two investigations that would benefit Trump in his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nGood for you @AmbJohnBolton, tweeted Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general and author of a book on impeachment. We are all Americans, united in our pursuit of the truth.\n\nKatyal added; I hope your White House colleagues, including President Trump, follow your lead and testify as well. The American people deserve no less.\n\nBut Barb McQuade, a former federal prosecutor, described Bolton's new statement as a PR move designed to help the former national security adviser sell copies of his forthcoming book.\n\nHe is currently in a bad spot because he looks like he was willing to tell his story only for money, not for country, said McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan. He is gambling that the Senate will not demand his testimony.\n\nIf McConnell does subpoena him, Bolton could always change his mind, citing executive privilege, McQuade said.\n\nOthers said that, depending on how the Senate trial's rules are written, a simple majority of senators could approve a subpoena – and a few GOP senators may want to hear from Bolton and others.\n\nEveryone saying 'yeah but the Senate won't subpoena Bolton' ... just chill for a moment, tweeted national security lawyer Bradley P. Moss. Let the president stew with this new cycle for a few hours.\n\nMoss told USA TODAY that all eyes would now be trained first on Trump, to see how he reacts to Bolton's statement, and then on a handful of moderate GOP senators who could potentially break with McConnell to demand testimony from Bolton and other witnesses.\n\nSchumer said Sunday it would take only four Republican senators to join Democrats in the push for witnesses, and possibly new documents.\n\nWe have the ability to require votes on the four witnesses we've asked for, whether there's agreement or not, Schumer said on ABC's This Week. We have the ability to ask for the documents and I hope, pray, and believe there's a decent chance that four Republicans will join us.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Bolton's statement.
Associated Press\n\nAs she nears a decision on whether to seek the presidency, Sen. Kamala Harris is taking on what could be a hurdle in a Democratic primary: her past as a prosecutor.\n\nIn her memoir published Tuesday, the California Democrat describes herself as a progressive prosecutor and says it's a false choice to decide between supporting the police and advocating for greater scrutiny of law enforcement. The argument is aimed at liberal critics of her record who argue she was sometimes too quick to side with the police and too slow to adopt sentencing reforms.\n\nI know that most police officers deserve to be proud of their public service and commended for the way they do their jobs, Harris writes in The Truths We Hold. ''I know how difficult and dangerous the job is, day in and day out, and I know how hard it is for the officers' families, who have to wonder if the person they love will be coming home at the end of each shift.\n\nBut, she continues, I also know this: it is a false choice to suggest you must either be for the police or for police accountability. I am for both. Most people I know are for both. Let's speak some truth about that, too.\n\nAfter high-profile fatal shootings involving police officers and unarmed people of color, the criminal justice system's treatment of minorities is a top issue among Democratic voters. The passage suggests Harris is aware that her seven years as the district attorney in San Francisco, followed by six years as California's attorney general, is something she will have to explain and signals how she may frame her law enforcement career if she decides to run for the White House.\n\nIt's a presidential campaign, and every aspect of a candidate's record is going to be scrutinized and they're going to have to answer for it, said Mo Elleithee, a longtime Democratic operative who leads Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. She knows that this is something that's heading her way and a good candidate is one who doesn't wait for it to hit them. A good candidate is someone who addresses it proactively, and she appears to be doing that.\n\nBeyond the book, Harris supported legislation that passed the Senate late last year and overhauls the criminal justice system, especially when it comes to sentencing rules.\n\nIn the book, Harris recounts an instance when she was an intern at the Alameda County district attorney's office and an innocent bystander was one of many people arrested during a drug raid. Harris said she begged and pleaded on a late Friday afternoon for a judge to hear the case so the woman could avoid spending the weekend in jail.\n\nKate Chatfield, the policy director of the California-based criminal justice reform group Re:store Justice, said Harris did do some good when she was in law enforcement, but that it was incumbent on the public to hold her accountable for the ways in which she either didn't do enough or actually did some harm.\n\nWhen the conversation shifts, one should be expected to be questioned about those choices, Chatfield said, noting among other issues Harris's advocacy for tougher truancy laws.\n\nBy addressing policing in the book, Harris is taking on an issue that confronted Democrats and some Republicans in 2016. Democrat Hillary Clinton was criticized for her husband's role in passing the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which created stricter penalties for drug offenders and funneled billions of dollars toward more police and new prisons.\n\nThe issue is likely to be the subject of fierce debate in 2020 as well and could expose divisions among the wide field of candidates — presenting hurdles for some and opportunity for others.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was the head of the Senate's Judiciary Committee when the 1994 crime bill — which is now criticized as having helped create an era of mass incarceration — was passed and signed into law, which could be an obstacle for him. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was central to the passage of the Senate's criminal justice overhaul package and is certain to tout it if he decides to launch a presidential campaign. Meanwhile, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is also considering a 2020 bid, often refers to her own prosecutorial past.\n\nThe memoir — and the publicity surrounding it — will shift the 2020 campaign spotlight to Harris this week after much of the focus has been on her Senate colleague Elizabeth Warren. Last week, the Massachusetts Democrat became the most prominent person yet to take steps toward a presidential run by forming an exploratory committee. Her weekend trip to the leadoff caucus state of Iowa also generated largely flattering headlines.\n\nSome criminal justice advocates said they were happy the issue would get more attention in 2020.\n\nWhen we had the 2016 elections, it was at the height of Ferguson and Baltimore, and we still didn't have serious engagement with criminal justice reform, said Phillip Goff, the president of the Center for Policing Equity, referring to the protests that followed the deaths of black men at the hands of police officers in Missouri and Maryland. My hope is that we require candidates to demonstrate that they know more than the catchphrases of the activists in their bases.\n\nSurveys underscore the potency of criminal justice issues among Democrats. A February 2018 poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that majorities of Democrats — but far fewer Republicans — think there's been little progress for African-Americans on criminal justice or policing issues over the past 50 years. The poll showed that 45 percent of Americans, including 62 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of Republicans, thought there had been little to no progress on fair treatment for black Americans by the criminal justice system. Similarly, 46 percent of Americans, including 63 percent of Democrats and 23 percent of Republicans, said there's been little to no progress for African-Americans on fair treatment by police.\n\nWhile it's not yet clear how Harris' prosecutorial background could affect her primary bid, it could help her if she faces President Donald Trump in the 2020 general election.\n\nHe ran as the law-and-order president, Elleithee said of Trump. Being able to go toe-to-toe with him on law and order in a smarter way, I think, is going to be important. Should she win the nomination and does it by navigating this topic well, then I think she would be a strong voice and a force to be reckoned with when it comes to issues of law and order, criminal justice and civil rights as they collide in a general election.\n\nMORE BOOKS COVERAGE:\n\nUSA TODAY's top 100 books of 2018:Michelle Obama's 'Becoming' is USA TODAY's No. 1 book of 2018.

Foster Sarell, the No. 2 player overall in the Class of 2017, committed to Stanford during Saturday's U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio.\n\nSarell, an offfensive tackle, had finalists of Nebraska, Notre Dame, Stanford, USC and Washington. He had taken official visits to all of them, except Stanford, but visited Palo Alto numerous times unofficially.\n\nIt was really tough, it was a lot of deciding and meeting with my family, rethinking everything, Sarell said this week. It comes down to best fit, where you want to be and that's where it came down for me.\n\nRELATED: Jake Fromm, Hunter Johnson lead East to victory\n\nWHAT WE LEARNED: Five observations from the Army Bowl\n\nNAJEE: No. 1 overall recruit still not saying where he's going\n\nAt 6-6 and 311, Sarell is massive, but shows great athleticism for his size in pass blocking and opening holes in the run game.\n\nIt was amazing this whole process, and it's been incredible, he said Saturday. It's been my dream school since I was a little kid. Just follow your heart and I think it led me to the right place.\n\nStanford also has a commitment from offensive tackle Walker Little, who is ranked No. 19 overall and as the No. 4 offensive tackle, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings. Stanford also has commitments from No. 1 pro style quarterback Davis Mills and top tight end Colby Parkinson.\n\nSarell, from Graham-Kapowsin (Graham, Wash.), was named the winner of the Anthony Munoz Lineman of the Year during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl Award Show on Friday night, presented to the top senior offensive or defensive lineman.\n\nThe award is named for the Hall of Fame offensive lineman who spent 13 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nWR Jamire Calvin to Oregon State\n\nWide receiver Jamire Calvin became the first player to commit during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl when he selected Oregon State in an emotional moment with his family.\n\nCalvin, from Cathedral (Los Angeles), is ranked as the No. 36 wide receiver by the 247Sports Composite.\n\nHis finalists had been Alabama, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Oregon State and Washington State with many analysts thinking he would be heading to Nebraska. He also received a New Year's Day offer from Baylor.\n\nOriginally my mind was set on another school, but in the past few days talking with everybody, talking with my dad and the other guys, I had a heart change, he said. Being able to play with my best friend is just a blessing.\n\nThe Beavers also have a commitment from Jeffrey Manning, a Cathedral defensive back.\n\nCalvin had 86 catches for more than 1,300 yards with 17 touchdowns.\n\nEno Benjamin, from Wylie East (Wylie, Texas), selected Arizona State during the broadcast.\n\nRanked as the No. 8 running back, he had a final five of Arizona State, Baylor, Texas, Utah and Michigan.\n\nBenjamin visited Arizona State in October and said he made his decision in November, although he kept it quiet until Saturday.\n\nA finalist for Army Player of the Year, he was an Iowa commit who was among the players who decommitted after defying Iowa's policy by taking other official visits. He is ranked as the No. 8 running back and will be the highest-ranked running back commit of the Todd Graham era at Arizona State.\n\nI will be committed to Arizona State University, Benjamin said. They really had what I was looking for in a program as far as academics. If I wasn't playing football that wold be a school that I would love to attend.\n\nBenjamin, who has a 3.94 GPA, is planning to student business law. That was a huge factor, knowing how many connections you can have coming out of that program.\n\nBenjamin could potentially redshirt, given Arizona State's senior depth at the position. He will report in January.\n\nChuck Filiaga to Michigan\n\nThe 6-6, 335-pound Filiaga moved from California to Aledo (Texas) before his senior year of high school after living in American Samoa, but he isn't heading west for college. Filiaga picked Michigan at the Army Bowl.\n\nIt feels great, he said after his commitment. It takes a lot of pressure off me and I can't wait to get up there.\n\nHe chose Michigan over Oklahoma and Nebraska. He is listed as the No. 14 offensive tackle.\n\nOffensive tackle was a huge priority for Michigan in this class, and head coach Jim Harbaugh handled Filiaga's recruitment in the last month.\n\nCoach Harbaugh has made me a huge priority, Filiaga told 247Sports this week. He's wanted to know if I am a team guy and not a 'fame and fortune' type of player, and that fits me perfectly. I have stayed quiet during my recruitment because I'm not big into the attention and would prefer to help my team, focus on my goals and hone my craft as an offensive lineman.\n\nBubba Bolden returns to USC\n\nBolden committed to USC for a second time at the Army Bowl.\n\nThe safety from Bishop Gorman (Las Vegas) committed to the Trojans in December 2015 and then decommitted in July 2016 before his senior season.\n\nRanked as the No. 6 safety, Bolden was being pursued by Ohio State, where high school teammates Tate Martell, Haskell Garrett and Tyjon Lindsey have committed.\n\nArizona State remained in the mix because Bolden's teammate and fellow defensive back Alex Perry had committed to the Sun Devils.\n\nI will be taking my talents to the University of Southern California, he said. My family has supported me throughout this whole thing and they love USC. Got great coaches out there and I feel like I can go in and make a great impact.\n\nDarnay Holmes to UCLA\n\nRanked as the No. 12 player overall, cornerback Darnay Holmes choose UCLA.\n\nAt the end of the day, you've got go where family is at and make sure that you're going to be taken care of, said Holmes from Calabasas (Calif.). Some college coaches might tell you things that might be true or might be true, but you've always got to stay to close to family and always keep God first.\n\nThe reference to family is to Demetrice Martin, UCLA's assistant head coach and defensive backs coach. Holmes has said Martin has been like family to his family for years.\n\nRELATED: Darnay Holmes' little nephew really wanted him to commit to Ohio State\n\nHe chose from among Nebraska, Ohio State, USC and UCLA and made a last-minute decision after his family arrived in San Antonio for the Army Bowl on Thursday.\n\nAt one point, the Bruins were seemingly the favorite, but he visited Ohio State for the Michigan game and got an in-home visit from Ohio State coaches before the dead period began in mid-December. USC also was a strong contender late in the process. He was leaning toward USC earlier in the week.\n\nHolmes is an early enrollee.\n\nRanked as the No. 7 player overall, the cornerback from South Grand Prairie (Grand Prairie, Texas) selected Ohio State over Oklahoma and Florida. Ohio State has long been considered the favorite and was the choice at the Army Bowl.\n\nWhen I got there, I was just comfortable with the coaching staff and the plan they set up for me, he said when asked why Ohio State, They're put a lot of defensive backs in the NFL. Also, because of life outside of football. They had the whole nine yards.\n\nHe also cited the reputation of the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State.\n\nWhen I researched all the schools, the best program was the Fisher College of Business, he said. I was a little taken aback by that.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story isn't what you might expect.\n\nStylish and vivid, violent and colorful, the newest installment of FX's American Crime Story anthology series (Wednesday, 10 ET/PT, ★★★½ out of four) is not a courtroom drama like 2016's The People v. O.J. Simpson. Nor is it really the story of the death of Gianni Versace, the famed fashion designer who was shot dead on the steps of his Miami Beach villa in 1997.\n\nInstead, the nine-episode series, from executive producers Ryan Murphy and Tom Rob Smith, based on the book Vulgar Favors by Maureen Orth, is the story of spree killer Andrew Cunanan, who claimed Versace as his fifth and final victim. The series spins backward in time, peeling back the layers of one of America's most enigmatic killers, brought to life with disturbing energy and commitment by Darren Criss, who has decidedly left his wholesome Glee character in the dust.\n\nMore:How USA TODAY covered the real assassination of Gianni Versace\n\nThe series unfolds like the operas for which Versace designed costumes. Its first moments are also Versace's (Edgar Ramirez) last, as they chronicle the fateful morning when he was shot by Cunanan and mourned by his lover, Antonio D'Amico (Ricky Martin), and sister, Donatella (Penélope Cruz).\n\nSoon, the series leaves the Versaces behind to focus on Cunanan, occasionally weaving in flashbacks to Versace's childhood and ascent to fashion stardom. Whether it's responsible to give a killer a starring role is never quite examined, at least not in the first eight episodes. Each takes a step backward in Cunanan's life, including his murders of Lee Miglin (Mike Farrell), David Madson (Cody Fern), Jeff Trail (Finn Wittrock) and William Reese (Gregg Lawrence). And eventually the series travels back to Cunanan's troubled childhood to decode the man.\n\nCunanan is a grotesquely fascinating figure, but Versace's weakness, especially compared to People v. O.J., is that his life (and death) wasn't eventful enough to to devote nine episodes. Cunanan's tale is simpler, with fewer points of view than the O.J. saga. The series' reverse chronology is captivating, but it occasionally confuses the events in the killer's life.\n\nVersace zeroes in on the struggles gay people faced in the 1990s, from the police homophobia it argues derailed the manhunt, or a side story about the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, but some of the moments are too heavy-handed.\n\nMore:Why title of FX's Versace series doesn't call murderer by his name\n\nHowever, the series' strengths lie in its spectacle. Murphy has a knack for grandiosity, and, as with American Horror Story, Versace marries the extravagant with the violent. Even when the series stretches its plot too thin, bold direction mostly makes up for it, ensuring that there is always something to look at, either beautiful or repulsive.\n\nThe series is grounded by sublime performances from its cast, led by Criss (and we're guessing the Emmys will notice); Martin, the singer whose deft and subtle acting skills may surprise viewers who missed him in Spanish-language TV; and Cruz, whose portrayal of Donatella never borders on cartoonish.\n\nVersace will inevitably be compared to People v. O.J., so it's better that it stands apart from the earlier Emmy-winning chapter. What it does well, it does extremely well, and its mix of beauty and horror will stick with you long after its episodes conclude.\n\nWant to talk about TV?

Kathleen Gray\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nLast fall, the presidential race seemed to be a haven for outsiders.\n\nNew York businessman Donald Trump, retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson and California businesswoman Carly Fiorina never held public office, but all, at various points and to varying degrees, were tearing up the polls as voters craved something different than the usual political suspects in 2016 GOP presidential race.\n\nCarson held the coveted top spot in polls for a few days in October and November. Fiorina, buoyed by two stellar debate performances in August and September, even occupied second place in the polls for a minute in early fall.\n\nBut only Trump has been able to maintain a hold on the top spot, while Carson and Fiorina have become the forgotten outsiders. A major campaign staff shake-up for Carson earlier this month didn't even merit a mention on Sunday morning television news programs while Fiorina has been polling so low in the single digits that she's often not even mentioned anymore in stories about the GOP horserace.\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics rolling average of polls, Carson is running a distant fourth in Iowa and nationally and is even further back in New Hampshire. Fiorina, meanwhile, barely cracks the top 10 in Iowa and is in the low single digits nationwide and in New Hampshire. Perhaps most damaging, her flagging poll numbers meant she failed to qualify for Thursday's prime-time debate stage.\n\nUSA TODAY GOP Power Rankings: Trump, Cruz break away from the pack\n\nUSA TODAY's 2016 Presidential Poll Tracker\n\nFor both of them, the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino have reminded voters that political experience may mean something, said Lara Brown, associate professor at the graduate school of political management at George Washington University. When we were focused on domestic messages and the economy, their messages worked, but when the focus shifted to national security, you saw that Republican voters wanted a candidate with some political heft.\n\nIndeed, Carson's polling numbers began their precipitous drop in mid-November, just days after the terrorist attacks in Paris, which claimed 130 lives. He hasn't recovered, falling from between around 15% to 20% support in the days before the attack to 6% to 10% in recent days.\n\nFiorina never capitalized on the momentum she gained from those good debate performances, falling quickly from a high of just under 12% in the RealClearPollings polling average in early October to the low single digits.\n\nThat's a very typical pattern in history. You have your moment in the sun and then you fade, said Allan Lichtman, a political historian and history professor at American University. The last outsider candidate who was nominated was Wendell Willkie in1940. It's been a very, very long time.\n\nTrump has managed to stay atop the polls, Lichtman said, in part because he was a built-in celebrity when he entered the race.\n\nAnd he is riding this new wave of anti-establishment and discontent in the Republican Party, Lichtman said. He's co-opted the rhetoric and co-opted that wing of the Republican Party.\n\nBoth Carson and Fiorina are still spending plenty of time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the first three states to hold presidential caucuses or primary elections.\n\nCarson released policy position papers on education and foreign policy this week, calling for a more vigorous investment in the nation's military and allowing more choice for parents. Fiorina told MSNBC last week that she's well positioned in New Hampshire.\n\nPaul, Fiorina bumped from next prime-time GOP debate\n\nHere I am with 33 days to go before the primary, and I'm in the hunt, and this race is very much wide open because, you see, voters, particularly in New Hampshire, think it's their job to decide how to winnow the field, and how to vet candidates, and who's going to win, she said\n\nHer deputy campaign manager, Sarah Isgur Flores, told supporters earlier this month that Fiorina's ground game would come through in the early voting states and aruged that her boss would be the best to compete against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\nCarson beefed up his staff last week, hiring A. Larry Ross, a former spokesman for evangelist Billy Graham, to head up his communications team and retired Marine Corp. Col Christopher Bourne to lead his policy staff.\n\nI have the experience and wisdom for fighting radical Islamic terrorism, defending the homeland, reviving our economy, fixing our healthcare system and restoring faith in our country and in each other, Carson said in a statement about the new hires.\n\nJohn Philip Sousa IV, national chairman of the 2016 Committee – the super PAC supporting Carson's candidacy – acknowledged that Carson's campaign has hit a rough patch, but said the candidate is still energized.\n\nHe is pumped, he is ready to go, Sousa said.\n\nBut their optimism is misplaced, said John Hudak, a senior fellow and deputy director the Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings Institution.\n\nRunning for president is hard. When you look at even very talented politicians who have been very successful in other races, they struggle when they try to transition to national stage, he said. It's even harder for someone who has never run for office.\n\nFor the Record: Sign up for our politics newsletter
Jeremy D. Mayer\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe Democrats might not have a nominee when the Democratic National Convention opens on July 13 in Milwaukee. A chaos convention is more likely in 2020 than at any time since the modern primary system began in 1972.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou've got the weakest front-runner in decades in former Vice President Joe Biden, a gaffe-prone septuagenarian who'd be the oldest president in U.S. history on the day of his inauguration. Also, you've got the largest field of candidates ever, and some of them won't quit even after several losses. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will go all the way to the convention, as he showed in 2016, and his fervent Bernistas will not go with anyone else until absolutely necessary (and maybe not even then!).\n\nYou've got two billionaires, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who can keep running hard even if no one gives them a dime. You've got a few people who have no more races left. Biden, Sanders and Bloomberg, at 77, 78 and 77, respectively, are in their last Democratic primaries. The same is likely true of retiring Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, 38, who has been making Democrats uneasy and flirting with third parties for years. All anyone has to do to get some delegates in a state is eke out 15% of the vote. Right now, in most early state polls, four to five candidates are at or close to that mark.\n\nScripted conventions make terrible TV\n\nMost analysts would consider a brokered Democratic convention a huge boost to President Donald Trump's reelection chances. After all, chaos at the convention has always been bad for a party. In 1968, the riots in Chicago helped Richard Nixon narrowly win. Turmoil in Miami four years later helped doom George McGovern. Since that time, both parties have done their best to present unified, well-organized conventions, to avoid the kiss of death that a tumultuous convention seems to bring.\n\nNonetheless, a brokered convention could be the best thing for the Democrats in 2020.\n\nOne positive thing about Trump's run for the presidency is it revealed that a lot of the conventional wisdom about American politics isn't true. If you had asked 20 pundits whether someone could win an American nomination fight after insulting a decorated prisoner-of-war hero, all 20 would have said hell no. Or the probability of the Republicans nominating a political novice who used to be for legal abortion and strong gun control?\n\nAnd what about Trump's convention? His top rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, stunned the crowd by refusing to endorse Trump based on conservative principles. Remember, the tepid support that Sanders gave Clinton in 2016 is still blamed by many for her defeat, but Sanders never did anything as treacherous or as shocking as Cruz did.\n\nHanding it to Trump:Democrats need to face facts about Bernie Sanders, his heart attack and his health\n\nYet Trump won, even though his convention was far more controversial and chaotic. Which, amazingly, didn't seem to bother him at all. Hey, if there's one thing Trump does know, it's how to make good television. And for nearly five decades, conventions have been terrible television. Predictable, long winded, scripted.\n\nImagine if four or five Democrats go into the Milwaukee convention with some delegates, but none has enough to win? That's great television! America would watch!\n\nObama, Franken, Clinton, Gates\n\nIt's no accident that two of the biggest shows about presidential politics, The West Wing and House of Cards, have had versions of a brokered convention. The writers knew that a regular convention was the ultimate TV sin — boring. And, after the first ballot, new names could emerge. And after the fifth or sixth or 10th ballot, they almost certainly would.\n\nMost Americans don't know it, but our executive selection system is by far the longest in the world. In many countries, a challenger to a sitting prime minister can emerge from within the ruling party in a week or less.\n\nLaw & Order: DJT:Make 2020 a referendum on Trump's crimes and corruption. The point is, he's breaking laws.\n\nImagine if America suddenly had a new name in front of it, at least to consider for a couple days. Michelle Obama. Al Franken. Hillary Clinton! Hell, Bill Gates! So long as the last picture of the convention is one of unity, the chaos and turmoil will draw more eyeballs to the affair and do no lasting harm.\n\nImagine a prime-time speech in which the dark-horse winner emerges, and millions of Americans watch her speech, because unlike every other year, it's someone whom they haven't heard much about yet. Picture Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter, Hillary Clinton and other Democratic superstars anointing the dark-horse winner after that speech, and bringing the highest rated convention in history to a close.\n\nThat's a picture that should strike fear in Donald Trump.\n\nJeremy D.

AP\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The New York Jets took a huge leap forward in Todd Bowles' first season as coach. And then, they got stuck on the outside of the playoff picture.\n\nAfter winning just four games last season under Rex Ryan, the Jets went 10-6 and created a sense of confidence and optimism throughout the organization. But with a chance to reach the postseason for the first time since the 2010 season, New York blew it — and the players and coach were left wondering what could have been.\n\nI think we have something special here, wide receiver Brandon Marshall said, and I thought we had the formula to make a run at it.\n\nMarshall, quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and wide receiver Eric Decker combined to set a handful of franchise records, leading the Jets' surprisingly efficient and high-scoring offense under Chan Gailey. Bowles' aggressive defense also had some big performances, finishing fourth overall in yardage allowed.\n\nIt all contributed to a five-game winning streak that put the Jets right in the middle of the AFC playoff mix.\n\nBut with the season on the line, they couldn't get it done. The Jets lost to Ryan's Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh topped Cleveland to send New York home disappointed.\n\nI can be better, Bowles said. You learn some things as a coach. I'm harder on myself first before I look at anybody else. I can do a lot of things better.\n\nBowles and general manager Mike Maccagnan have plenty to do this offseason, including making decisions on scheduled free agents such as Fitzpatrick, running backs Chris Ivory, Bilal Powell and Stevan Ridley, defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson, and nose tackle Damon Harrison.\n\nI thought we did a pretty good job of coming together and finding a way with guys that were new in an offense and haven't really played with each other, Fitzpatrick said. The more you can keep that together, the core group together, the better it is.\n\nHere are a few things to know as the Jets look to build on this season:\n\nFITZMAGIC THE SEQUEL?: Acquired from Houston for a sixth-round draft pick last March, Fitzpatrick was expected be a veteran backup. After Geno Smith had his jaw broken by a punch from Ikemefuna Enemkpali in training camp, Fitzpatrick was thrust into the starting role and never relinquished it even after tearing a ligament in his left thumb.\n\nThe 33-year-old Fitzpatrick set a franchise record with 31 touchdown passes, helping the Jets put up a team-best 5,925 net yards of offense. Fitzpatrick said he wants to remain with the Jets, and Bowles said he'd be the starter next season if he re-signs.\n\nI'm better right now than I have been in any point of my career, physically, mentally, all of that stuff, Fitzpatrick said. I feel like I've got a lot of good years left.\n\nDYNAMIC DUO: Marshall and Decker established themselves as one of the league's most dangerous wide receiver tandems.\n\nMarshall, acquired from Chicago for a fifth-round pick, set team records with 109 receptions, 1,502 yards receiving, 10 100-yard receiving games, and tied the mark with 14 TD catches. Decker finished with 80 catches for 1,027 yards and 12 TD receptions. The duo scored in the same game nine times, an NFL record.\n\nD-LINE DECISIONS: Wilkerson was looking for a contract extension, but never received one. He's coming off a Pro Bowl season in which he had a career-high 12 sacks, but broke his right leg in the season finale. The Jets will now have to weigh letting him hit free agency or possibly using the franchise tag on him.\n\nHarrison has established himself as one of the NFL's top nose tackles and could fetch a huge contract. New York still has Leonard Williams, coming off a solid rookie season, and Sheldon Richardson, who could be facing another suspension in 2016 for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy last offseason. It seems unlikely the Jets will be able to keep them all.\n\nBACKFIELD IN MOTION?: The only running back under contract for next season is Zac Stacy, who ended the season on IR with a broken ankle. Ivory finished as the AFC's rushing leader with 1,070 yards, his first 1,000-yard season. But he sputtered down the stretch, getting only six carries in the season finale.\n\nPowell was a versatile presence in the backfield, but has had injury issues. Ridley didn't show much after coming back from a serious knee injury suffered last season.\n\nNEED FOR SPEED: While many of the Jets' key players are in their early 30s — including Fitzpatrick, Marshall, Darrelle Revis, David Harris, D'Brickashaw Ferguson and Nick Mangold — Bowles made it clear the team must address overall speed for next season.\n\nI think we need to get faster, Bowles said. I don't know about younger. We need to get faster. Obviously, certain areas we're going to have more team speed on the field and that's always a process for me, being a faster team.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL
Dan Wolken\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nSAN ANTONIO — A mere 17 months ago, the NCAA's Division I board of directors gathered in Indianapolis to approve a new governance structure that was celebrated as a way for the five high-resource football conferences to finally get significant things done and feared by many on the outside as a separation that would leave the financial have-nots unable to compete.\n\nThe push for power conference autonomy, as it was called, had been driven by the significant legal pressures on college sports and forced upon the smaller conferences at the point of a bayonet. They would either fall in line with the wishes of former SEC Commissioner Mike Slive and Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany or else, a threat that implied the breakup of Div. I or even perhaps the entire NCAA.\n\nThose contentious times, however, seemed like a faded footnote Friday morning at the NCAA convention when officials from the 65 power conference schools and 15 athlete representatives easily passed a series of milquetoast proposals that were part of the second autonomy agenda.\n\nNCAA members OK football championship games for all conferences\n\nWhereas a year ago the autonomy group enacted some landmark legislation that rippled through Div. I — highlighted by full cost of attendance stipends, guaranteed scholarships, and concussion protocols — the legislative package adopted by the Power Five this year was thoroughly non-controversial and rooted largely in NCAA minutia.\n\nThe biggest headline, in fact, was the resolution schools adopted to come up with a plan to address time demands on athletes — for next year's convention.\n\nLast year I walked out of here feeling like we did something significant, said Ty Darlington, one of the Big 12's student representatives and the starting center on the football team. This year I felt like we sort of relaxed.\n\nWhich isn't to say any of the new rules adopted Friday were bad.\n\nOne of them will allow schools to pay for food, lodging and entertainment (but not airplane tickets) for up to four family members when recruits come on official visits. Another will allow schools to waive application fees or housing deposits for signed recruits. A rule was passed making it easier for walk-ons who earn scholarships to receive them on a semester-by-semester basis. So was a proposal allowing athletes to purchase extra tickets to championship events such as the Final Four at face value in addition to the six complementary admissions they receive.\n\nOne more significant piece of legislation passed gives the school's lead medical personnel autonomy over return-to-play decisions; another will allow baseball players to use an agent to negotiate with major league teams during the decision period between the draft and college enrollment without jeopardizing their eligibility.\n\nIndividually, these were all common sense changes that will benefit athletes. But after all the urgency that went into gaining autonomy and the promises of swift action to address big issues, this felt like a return to typical NCAA tedium, which may or may not have required Power Five autonomy to get done in the first place.\n\nThere's a lot that's happened for student-athletes to improve their experiences, and that shouldn't be lost, SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said. We pushed those things more quickly (with autonomy) than they otherwise would have been produced. You have a less encumbered process that really facilitates some action. That doesn't mean every time we have a meeting it's going to be a session where we light fireworks at the end, but there is meaningful work being done, that has been done and I think that will be done.\n\nBut not necessarily the kind of work that seemed inevitable — and necessary — when autonomy was conceived. Based on this year's agenda, fears from smaller schools that the Power Five would push for proposals allowing them to spend, spend, spend their way into a further separation from the have-nots appear to be unfounded. Though they were not allowed to vote, several commissioners from conferences outside the Power Five sat in on the autonomy session Friday and did not seem unhappy with any of the proposals that passed.\n\nMore often than not there's much more commonality, there just is, Mid-American Conference Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said. At the end of the day there's always going to be issues of resources and so on, but on many of these things, if they can do it, do it. If they don't want to do it, don't do it. Sooner or later things are going to come up that we just have philosophical differences on, but for most of this stuff we're philosophically aligned.\n\nKirby Hocutt named CFP selection committee chair\n\nOne Pac-12 proposal that could have represented a significant change in NCAA policy allowed athletes to use their names, images and likenesses to promote non-athletically related personal businesses. The Pac-12, however, withdrew the proposal this week before it came to the floor for a vote.\n\nName, image and likeness issues are central to the Ed O'Bannon antitrust lawsuit, which could ultimately end up in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nPac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said it wasn't a big deal to table the proposal because there's already an NCAA waiver process in place for athletes to address the issue if they wish.\n\nOther conferences that wanted more time; they were afraid there were loopholes, concerned about implementation, Scott said. We got feedback from conferences that were nervous and just wanted more time to digest it. As a general rule if something is routinely being approved by waivers we want it in the rule.\n\nThough Sankey, among others, insisted that the autonomy process is an improvement over the difficulties that existed before, it is obviously not a cure-all.\n\nWith cost of attendance out of the way, reducing time demands for athletes is now the No. 1 priority for college sports leaders. But it's also a problem with layers of complexity that affects different sports in different ways when you start getting into rules such as mandatory days off or set evening hours where coaches aren't allowed to engage in team activities. Essentially, the power conference schools gave themselves a mandate Friday to come up with a plan that can be enacted a year from now.\n\nWe have to get into the details of what everything means, North Carolina athletics director Bubba Cunningham said. If our basketball team charters after a game, chances are they can get back before midnight. But if our volleyball team plays on a Wednesday and travels on Thursday, and that's not the (mandatory) day off, then you have to put another day off into that week? That's pretty hard to manage. What about if a team gets home at 1 in the morning? You have to be pretty thoughtful.\n\nDarlington, the Oklahoma football player, said it was unacceptable that the autonomy group couldn't come up with a way to address the issue this year. He produced the most poignant moment of the entire session when he told the room he didn't feel like it accomplished anything to significantly impact the student-athlete experience.\n\nOklahoma athletics director Joe Castiglione applauded the sentiment behind Darlington's comments.\n\nHis statements resonated with a lot of people, maybe the vast majority of people, Castiglione said. Hopefully that adds even more of a sense of urgency to getting these changes made. I think people are very much engaged in the spirit and intent behind a number of these proposals, there were just a number of areas of the previous proposals that needed a little bit more work. In the long run, we will make a lot of progress, there's no doubt about it and let's be fair, there's been a great deal of progress already made.\n\nBut as Friday showed, progress in the world of NCAA legislation is more likely to look like it did this year than the big, bold changes autonomy produced a year ago.\n\nIt's real easy to say, 'Hey let's do this, this and this.' But real governance to do something meaningful just takes longer than we'd all like, Mississippi State athletics director Scott Stricklin said. It's a little more cumbersome than just waving a magic wand, but I do think we'll get there.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nResolution to invoke the 25th Amendment goes to full House vote\n\nHouse Republicans on Monday blocked Democrats from bringing up a resolution to urge Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office. Democrats can now bring it up for a full House vote on Tuesday. Under House rules, it took only one lawmaker to block immediate consideration of the resolution aimed at pressuring Republicans to take power away from Trump. The resolution calls on Pence and the Cabinet to, within 24 hours, declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office. Pence has not shown an interest in triggering the never-used section of the amendment that could strip Trump of his authority.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Alamo is a small town on the Texas-Mexico border where Trump plans to discuss his immigration policy and promote his presidential legacy – a legacy very much tarnished by last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol building by enraged Trump supporters. The ostensible purpose of the visit is to mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall – a promise made, promise kept – and his Administration's efforts to reform our broken immigration system, said a White House statement.\n\nNew acting DHS secretary takes over as inauguration security looms\n\nPete Gaynor, who runs the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will take over as acting Homeland Security secretary after Chad Wolf's abrupt resignation Monday. Wolf's resignation comes as his agency leads critical security planning for the upcoming inauguration. Unlike other recent members of the Trump administration who have resigned, Wolf did not cite the U.S. Capitol riots as a reason. Last week, however, Wolf asked Trump and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place at the Capitol.\n\nMan from photo inside Pelosi's office to appear in federal court\n\nThe Arkansas man who was photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office following the storming of the Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters will make his initial appearance in federal court Tuesday, according to a statement from the Department of Justice. Richard Barnett, 60, of Gravette, Arkansas, is charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds; and theft of public money, property, or records. If he is convicted, he faces up to one year in prison.

It has been nearly two years since the two national lottery games offered such giant prizes and only the second time both jackpots have topped $500 million. The projected Mega Millions grand prize is the eighth largest in U.S. history, and the Powerball jackpot is the 12th biggest. But don't get your hopes up too soon: As fun as it can be to play the games, people should realize their chance of winning the big prizes are incredibly small. The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are one in 292.2 million, and the chances are even worse for Mega Millions at one in 302.5 million.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press

Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the Transportation Committee, who proposed the change said it would insulate the air traffic control system from the funding whims of Congress, which, during a 2013 budget fight, shut down the government and furloughed air traffic controllers.\n\nShuster says the air traffic control system under the FAA is safe, but incredibly inefficient.\n\nThe problems, he said, will only get worse as passenger levels grow and as the FAA falls further behind in modernizing the system.\n\nLawmakers and various air traffic controller organization have proposed privatization at least eight times over the past 40 years. Dozens of other countries have privatized their air-traffic systems, but skeptics question whether private systems, such as the one adopted in Canada, would work in the larger, more complex U.S. airspace.\n\nThis time, National Air Traffic Controllers Association backed the proposal, and Airlines for America, a trade group for most major carriers, airline say that a private corporation governed by representatives of the aviation industry could move faster than FAA to upgrade equipment and adopt more efficient flight paths.\n\nThe opposition, however, lined up even before Schuster introduced the legislation. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., and the top Democrat, Nita Lowey of New York, said in a letter Monday to House Speaker Paul Ryan that such a move give the public less leverage to influence how the system operations.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and the top Democrat, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, in a Jan. 27 letter said privatization would mean less oversight and less accountability.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Transportation Committee, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, said the proposal gives the airlines too much power.\n\nThe same people who today determine your baggage costs would determine what you would pay to use the air-traffic control system, DeFazio said. I don't think that gives consumers a lot of confidence.\n\nThe Air Line Pilots Association, a union representing 52,000 pilots, fears airlines would shoulder the entire cost of air-traffic control rather than spreading the costs among all aircraft.\n\nDelta Air Lines also parted ways with its industry brethren. Delta's senior vice president for flight operations, Capt. Steve Dickson, said privatizing air-traffic control won't reduce heavy traffic in the Northeast and could distract from current efforts to ease congestion. Delta CEO Richard Anderson called the proposal unnecessary and unwise in a Tuesday letter to Shuster.\n\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta have remained neutral on the proposal.\n\nUnder Schuster's proposal, the private, non-profit corporation would governed by an 11-member board that includes representatives appointed by government, airlines, general aviation and both the pilots' and controllers' unions.\n\nThe group Airlines for America suggests airline taxes and fees, amounting to $13 billion a year, would easily cover the $10 billion of operating the privatized air-traffic control system.\n\nHouse transportation chairman: Privatize air-traffic control\n\nShuster's proposal kicks off the debate on broader legislation to renew FAA policy that expires in March. Pilot training, airport fees and drone regulations will also be up for discussion.\n\nThe 273-page bill includes provisions that:\n\n• Require airlines to refund baggage fees for bags delayed more than 24 hours on domestic flights.\n\n• Ban the use of cell phones for in-flight voice calls on scheduled passenger flights.\n\n• Authorize the Transportation Department to establish a smartphone application for consumer complaints.\n\n• Require large and medium airports to provide private rooms in every terminal for nursing mothers.\n\n• Require airlines to notify families before tickets are booked if family members will be assigned seats that\n\naren't together.\n\nAir-traffic control union chief: Privatization possible, but funding crucial\n\nShuster's committee votes on the bill Feb. 11.\n\nAirline executives urge privatization of air-traffic control
WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday to provide more benefits to service members transitioning from the military to civilian life in an effort to decrease veteran suicides.\n\nVeterans who have recently left the military are between two and three times more likely to commit suicide than active duty service members, and nearly 20% of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.\n\nThe order directs the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs to submit a plan within 60 days to provide seamless access to mental health treatment and suicide prevention resources.\n\nWe want them to get the highest care and the care they so richly deserve, Trump said.\n\nMore:20 veterans a day committed suicide in 2014, new data show\n\nMore:'A war within myself': One veteran's struggle for life after combat\n\nVA Secretary David Shulkin pledged that in 60 days, the VA will begin offering a full year of mental health care to all departing service members. He said they will be pre-enrolled before they leave the military.\n\nCurrently, up until your executive order, only 40 percent of those service members had coverage in the VA to get mental health, Shulkin said at a White House signing ceremony. Now, 100 percent will have that coverage.\n\nWhite House officials said the Department of Defense also plans to start the transition process sooner, so it's less abrupt, although the details and timetables are still being worked out.\n\nThe order marks another step toward delivering on the president's pledges to improve services and care for veterans and to modernize the VA, which has been buffeted in recent years by crisis after crisis.\n\nMore:VA taps Cerner for new veterans medical record system\n\nMore:Exclusive: VA goes high-tech with Uber-like tracking center for veteran health care\n\nTrump signed laws last year aimed at expediting the appeals process for veterans' benefits and extending the so-called choice program, which allows veterans more choices about where they get health care when the VA can't provide it.\n\nShulkin also announced the department will adopt the same computer programs for electronic health records used by the Department of Defense in an effort to make the transition more seamless.\n\nBut the department, the second largest federal agency behind the Pentagon, continues to grapple with outdated procedures and bureaucracy that in some cases have harmed veterans.\n\nUSA TODAY reported last year that VA regulations allowed VA hospitals to hire health care providers with revoked licenses, previous malpractice or criminal records. The agency struck secret severance deals with departing medical workers that concealed mistakes and shoddy care, and didn't ensure they were reported to state boards or a national database.\n\nShulkin clamped down on severance agreements and ordered that regulations governing hiring and reporting problem workers be rewritten following the stories. Those new policies are currently in the works, the department has said.\n\nMore:VA conceals shoddy care and health workers' mistakes\n\nMore:USA TODAY Investigation: VA knowingly hires doctors with past malpractice claims, discipline for poor care\n\nMore:Illegal VA policy allows hiring since 2002 of medical workers with revoked licenses
Associated Press\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico — U.S. authorities fired tear gas into Mexico during the first hours of the new year to repel about 150 migrants who tried to breach the border fence in Tijuana.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement later Tuesday that the gas was used to target rock throwers apart from the migrants who were trying to cross.\n\nNo agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away, the statement said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security backed Border Patrol's efforts to repel what it called a violent mob of migrants using projectiles in an attempt to illegally enter the United States.\n\nAs has happened before — in this and previous administrations — our personnel used the minimum force necessary to defend themselves, defend the border, and restore order, DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said in a statement. The agents involved should be applauded for handling the situation with no reported injuries to the attackers.\n\nAn Associated Press photographer saw at least three volleys of gas launched onto the Mexican side of the border near Tijuana's beach that affected the migrants, including women and children, as well as journalists. The AP saw rocks thrown only after U.S. agents fired the tear gas.\n\nThe agency said agents saw toddler sized children being passed over concertina wire with difficulty. It said its agents could not assist the children because of the rocks being thrown. Agents responded with smoke, pepper spray and tear gas, it said. The AP journalist also saw plastic pellets fired by U.S. agents.\n\nThe agency said 25 migrants were detained while others crawled back into Mexico through a hole under the fence.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection said that under its use of force policy the incident would be reviewed by its Office of Professional Responsibility.\n\nMigrants who spoke with AP said they arrived in Tijuana last month with the caravan from Honduras.\n\nThe caravan, which left Honduras in mid-October, grew to more than 6,000 members during its month-and-a-half trek north. It has been a constant target of President Donald Trump, who referred to it frequently in the run-up to U.S. mid-term elections in November.\n\nMany of the migrants are waiting in Tijuana for a chance to apply for asylum in the U.S., but there was a backlog before the caravan's arrival and the wait is expected to be many months. Others have found jobs in Mexico and tried to settle there.\n\nIn a previous incident, U.S. agents launched tear gas across the border after some migrants tried to breach the border following a peaceful march in Tijuana on Nov. 26. Hundreds of migrants who were downwind of the gas were affected.\n\nTrump is currently locked in a fight with congressional Democrats over funding for the border wall that he wants to build. The stalemate has led to a partial government shutdown.\n\nUnfortunately, Congress continues to ignore the professional advice from the men and women of the Border Patrol who have told them that walls work, Waldman said. Congress needs to fully fund the border wall.
WASHINGTON – Julian Castro, a former Obama Cabinet member and San Antonio mayor, officially threw his hat in the ring on Saturday, announcing he would run for president.\n\nOn a stage with his family, including his twin brother Rep. Joaquin Castro, in his hometown of San Antonio, the Texas Democrat declared his bid to try and take the White House from President Donald Trump in 2020 and fulfill a destiny that Democrats have projected since he was elected San Antonio mayor at 34.\n\nWhen my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago, I'm sure she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for President of the United States of America, Castro told a crowd of supporters in front of an American flag backdrop.\n\nCastro, who made remarks in both English and Spanish, also rolled out his campaign slogan: One Nation. One Destiny.\n\nCastro's campaign announcement at the historic Plaza Guadalupe came one day after Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, 37, said she was also running for president, telling CNN I have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week.\n\nCastro, 44, along with Gabbard, have been predicted to be two of the youngest of expected candidates. Castro may also be the most well-known Latino figure in a race that's likely to revolve around immigration policy.\n\nHis announcement also followed Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiling plans for an exploratory committee for president, a formality that comes before the launch of a presidential campaign that legally allows potential candidates to raise money.\n\nOn his way to the announcement, Castro rode a public bus to the plaza and live-streamed it to his Facebook page. The bus, No. 68, was the same one he and his twin brother rode to school as children.\n\nHis first trip as a candidate is scheduled for Puerto Rico, where he will visit with residents still coping with the effects of Hurricane Maria. He told supporters his first act as president, if elected, would be to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, something that U.S. withdrew from under Trump. In his speech, Castro touched on many issues that are likely to guide the 2020 election season, including women's reproductive rights, Medicare for all, Black Lives Matter, climate change and immigration policy.\n\nToday we're falling backwards instead of moving forward. And the opportunities that made America, the America we love, those opportunities are reaching fewer and fewer people, Castro told the crowd. Today, we're at risk of dropping the baton. And that's why we are all here today. Because we're going to make sure that the promise of America is available to everyone.\n\nCastro is likely to face stiff competition from a crowded field of high-profile Democrats in a primary challenge. Along with Gabbard and Warren, others, including former Vice President Joe Biden and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, are also said to be considering a run for the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut who seems to top the list of potential 2020 candidates is outgoing Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who lost in a November race against Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. O'Rourke has excited donors and activists who have prodded him to seek the presidency.\n\nCastro, who attended O'Rourke's election-night party in El Paso, Texas, told the Associated Press in an interview last month that O'Rourke doesn't complicate his own chances and downplayed figures that showed other prominent Democrats dwarf him in polls, saying in past election cycles early favorites ended up faltering.\n\nMore:Democrat Tulsi Gabbard announces 2020 run for president to take on Trump\n\nMore:Julian Castro moves to run for president in 2020, trails Beto badly in MoveOn wishlist\n\nPeople might say right now, 'Well, hey, you're way down here in polling that's taken.' The most dangerous place to be right now is actually in the pole position, Castro said. It doesn't bother me that in December of 2018 I'm not right up at the top of the list.\n\nYoung and telegenic, Castro rose to national prominence early in his career as a Latino leader from a state that Democrats are eager to retake after decades of Republican dominance. But in Texas, O'Rourke has eclipsed Castro after getting closer to a statewide victory than any Democrat in a generation. It now puts Texas in the formerly unthinkable position of having two Democratic presidential candidates in the same year.\n\nObama picked Castro to take over the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2014. Two years later, Castro was on the short list of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's potential running mates.\n\nHe quickly became a star in the party, marked by giving a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2012.\n\nBut as Democrats have begun announcing their candidacy for 2020, the Republican National Committee has started their own campaign aimed at delegitimizing liberals. After Castro made his announcement, the Committee sent out a cheat sheet on Castro's record that characterized him as weak and used previous news coverage that described him as a lightweight and someone who didn't have enough experience for the office of the presidency.\n\nJulián Castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president, said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. He was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being HUD secretary. This is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate.\n\nSince leaving the Obama Cabinet, Castro has established a political action committee called Opportunity First to help elect left-of-center candidates. In October, his memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, was released.\n\nHe is the grandson of a Mexican immigrant and son of a Latina activist.\n\nJulian Castro has not run for office outside of San Antonio. But in a four-minute YouTube speech last month, he offered a preview of themes he might employ in what could be a long slog for the nomination.\n\nGrowing up in Texas, America wasn't just my home, my country, it was also a promise, he said. A promise that my family could have a better life. My grandmother, Victoria, came he when she was just 7 years old. She never made it past the fourth grade, but she taught her family the value of hard work.\n\nThe last Texas Democrat to run for president was Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who had a short-lived campaign in 1976.\n\nMaryland Rep. John Delaney, Richard Ojeda, who just lost a Congressional race in West Virginia, and Rep. Gabbard are the only declared 2020 Democratic presidential candidates so far. Others are expected to announce their intentions in the coming weeks.\n\nContributing: John C Moritz, The Associated Press

Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields expects to play in the College Football Playoff championship game Monday against Alabama.\n\nI'll be good by Monday night, he said in a Zoom call Thursday afternoon.\n\nFields was injured in the second quarter of Ohio State's 49-28 victory over Clemson in the College Football Playoff semifinals at the Sugar Bowl. The quarterback took off on a scramble and as he tried to spin to absorb the contact from Clemson's James Skalski, the linebacker lowered his helmet and speared Fields in the side.\n\nSkalski was ejected for targeting. Fields missed only one play before returning. Upon his return, he threw a touchdown pass to Chris Olave in the front corner of the end zone for the third of his six touchdown passes. He completed 22 of 28 passes for 385 yards.\n\nAfter the game, Fields said he had not gotten a diagnosis from the team's medical staff and that his body was pretty messed up but that he wanted to keep playing despite the pain.\n\nHe said he and coach Ryan Day discussed which play calls should or shouldn't be used the rest of the game. But Fields said he felt healthy enough to play.\n\nIf I can't protect myself then I don't need to be out on the field, so I thought personally that I was able to go out there and protect myself if something bad would happen, he said.\n\nOPINION: Nick Saban's retirement seems far away as he keeps Alabama at top, writes Dan Wolken\n\nLOOKING AHEAD: Coronavirus, vaccine, revenue lead college football concerns\n\nBUCKEYES TOO GOOD: Ohio State's dominance in the Big Ten is unmatched\n\nFAMILIAR SPOT: Alabama again must manage key assistant's pending departure\n\nOhio State team doctor Jim Borchers told The Columbus Dispatch on Wednesday that the medical staff did not pressure Fields to play after the injury.\n\nUltimately, it is 100% the (athlete's) decision, he said. We never return anybody to play who doesn't want to go back into the game.\n\nFields said Thursday he was happy with his treatment from the team's medical staff.\n\nI think what I said after the game was kind of taken out of context, he said. I just want to make one thing clear: It's that I have my full trust in the trainers here at Ohio State and Dr. Borchers.\n\nI wasn't hesitant on taking anything that they would give me, but I was just trying to do whatever I could do to get back on the field. I think those guys handled it the way I would have wanted it to be handled.\n\nOn Tuesday, Day said Fields told him he felt better than he had anticipated when the quarterback awoke the morning after the game.\n\nI think the day after the game I woke up definitely better than expected, but the days that I didn't expect to wake up kind of hurting were two or three nights after the game, he said.\n\nI really haven't thought about how this injury is going to affect how I'm going to play. I'm just thinking about getting as much treatment as possible and trying to get my body right so it's 100% to be able to perform at a max level come Monday night.\n\nDay didn't reveal much about Fields' status.\n\nNo real update, Day said on the conference call, citing his policy on not providing daily details about injuries.\n\nFields has thrown for 1,906 yards and 21 touchdowns with six interceptions this season. He has completed 73.4% of his attempts and also has run for 316 yards and five scores.\n\nFields came to Ohio State as a transfer from Georgia last year. This week, he won for the second time the Chicago Tribune's Silver Football award given to the Big Ten's top player.\n\nOn Tuesday, Day said he definitely expected Fields to play against Alabama.\n\nOn the COVID-19 front, Day also had little to update. He said earlier this week that the team continues to deal with expected absences and that it's a day-to-day proposition.\n\nAsked if he expected the game to go on as planned Monday instead of being postponed a week, Day said, Correct.\n\nWe'll have plenty of players, he later added.\n\nFollow Bill Rabinowitz on Twitter @brdispatch
AP\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Sindarius Thornwell was especially proud of the steals that were part of his impressive return from a six-game suspension.\n\nIt's the category which best reflected his status as the Southeastern Conference's reigning defensive player of the year.\n\nP.J. Dozier scored 24 points and Thornwell had 19, leading South Carolina to a 67-61 win over Georgia in the Gamecocks' SEC opener on Wednesday night.\n\nThornwell had 11 rebounds, three blocks and six steals for South Carolina (11-3, 1-0 SEC).\n\nI like when I've got a lot of steals, he said. It just shows that I was in the right spots on defense. I had a good defensive night. You can't control the ball going in. You can't control a lot of things on the court, but one thing you control is your effort.\n\nThornwell returned as a starter after completing the suspension for an unspecified violation of athletic department policy. He apologized to teammates and fans on Monday but would not say why he was suspended.\n\nYante Maten led Georgia (9-5, 1-1) with 18 points and 10 rebounds. He sank his only 3-pointer with about 1 minute remaining to cut South Carolina's lead to 62-61.\n\nThornwell's tip-in of his own miss pushed the lead back to three points. He then dove to come up with a loose ball on the other end of the floor.\n\nHe makes such a big difference on the team, Dozier said of Thornwell. This game speaks for itself how much we missed him in all aspects of the game, rebounding, scoring, defending, everything. Just having him back was great for us.\n\nJ.J. Frazier had 16 points for Georgia despite making only one of six 3-pointers.\n\nThe Gamecocks were 7-0 and ranked No. 20 with Thornwell, who was averaging 18.7 points. They were 3-3 and fell out of the Top 25 during the suspension.\n\nEven while missing Thornwell's defensive leadership for six games, South Carolina led the SEC in scoring defense, allowing 59.3 points per game. His return added more strength to the defense which swarmed Maten, the SEC's second-leading scorer, near the basket and frustrated the Bulldogs' outside shooters.\n\nAll credit to their defense, they had us out of sorts for a little bit, Maten said. Not many teams play defense like that and are able to disrupt offensive flow.\n\nSouth Carolina opened the second half with a 12-5 run to take its biggest lead at 48-39. Georgia cut the lead to 51-49 on Juwan Parker's 3-pointer and Frazier's fast-break layup on consecutive possessions.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks outscored the Bulldogs 18-9 on points off turnovers and 13-7 on second-chance points. ... Thornwell scored on the Gamecocks' first possession and had six points in the first half. ... Dozier made two jumpers in the final 40 seconds of the first half, including a 3-pointer that just beat the buzzer as time ran out, giving the Gamecocks a 36-34 lead. ... Chris Silva had 13 points and three blocks.\n\nGeorgia: Maten became the 48th 1,000-point scorer in school history. He needed 10 points to reach 1,000. Frazier reached the milestone on Nov. 14. ... Parker had 12 points while make each of his two 3-pointers. Overall, Georgia made only 4 of 13 3s.\n\nRIVALRY\n\nThornwell said Georgia ranks right behind Clemson on the Gamecocks' list of rivals.\n\nIt's always a big game, Thornwell said. When we play Georgia, everything goes out the window. The records don't mean anything. It's always a tough game.\n\nBREAKING OUT\n\nParker scored in double figures for the third straight game and fourth time this season. He only had one game in double figures before the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouth Carolina: Hosts Texas A&M on Saturday.\n\nGeorgia: Hosts Missouri on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
Though he publicly came out almost 10 years ago, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper says he first knew something was different around the age of 6 or 7.\n\nI'm not sure I knew the word 'gay' at the time, but I realized something was up, Cooper said in a Q&A session Monday on CNN's Full Circle, adding that he began to tell friends when he was in high school but still struggled through college with fully loving himself.\n\nI think I really, truly accepted it – and not just accepted it, but fully embraced it and came around to really loving the fact that I was gay – would probably be right after college, he said.\n\nA lot of the things I wanted to do at the time, you couldn't be gay, he said, citing an interest in joining the U.S. military, though out members of the gay community were not allowed to serve at the time. The military's don't ask, don't tell policy which prohibited openly gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans from serving, was officially repealed in 2011.\n\nHe was also interested in getting married, but same-sex marriage was not legalized until 2015.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale University in 1989, Cooper decided he didn't want to waste any more time worrying about this or wishing I was some other way.\n\nHe came out as gay to the public on July 2, 2012, allowing friend and writer Andrew Sullivan to publish an email from him, saying it'd become clear that remaining silent on the topic had given the false impression that he had something to hide.\n\nThe fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud, he wrote.\n\nCooper has since welcomed a son, Wyatt Morgan Cooper, born April 27, 2020 via surrogate. He co-parents with his former partner, nightclub owner Benjamin Maisani. The two split in 2018 after nine years of dating, though they remain good friends.\n\nI think being gay is one of the great blessings of my life, Cooper added on Full Circle. And it made me a better person, it made me a better reporter... It's enabled me to love the people that I've loved and have the life that I've had. So I'm very blessed.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed\n\n'I am a dad.

MONTECITO, Calif. — The deadly mudslides that swept through this bucolic seaside town a week ago have irrevocably changed the face of the community previously known for its charming shops, famous residents and sky-high property values.\n\nThe physical damage alone will take months to repair. But the damage to residents' emotional health may linger even longer.\n\nMontecito's attraction, many residents say, is that almost nothing bad ever happens here: low crime, no snow, hurricanes or tornadoes, and relatively little danger from earthquakes. Even flooding was deemed unlikely since the whole town sits on a hillside that runs right down to the ocean.\n\nYou have beaches and mountains. It was like paradise. And nothing of this magnitude has ever hit this town. People are devastated, said Bob Santoro as he took a break from shoveling mud from a friend's driveway. People are in shock. Nothing like this has ever happened. It's more shock than frustration — shock and loss.\n\nMore:Here are all the people who died in the California mudslide\n\nHeavy rains early Tuesday night unleashed a series of mudslides that ran down mountainsides burned by last month's Thomas Fire.\n\nThe Thomas Fire alone was devastating: two dead, at least 1,000 structures destroyed. Many residents were forced to leave their homes for two weeks as the largest wildfire in recorded state history burned the mountains above. The mudslides heaped misery upon sorrow, killing at least 20 more people and destroying at least 73 more homes.\n\nTo be sure, the physical damage to Montecito isn't absolute. Most streets and homes survived unscathed. Other streets became rivers as mud tore houses in half, blasted cars from garages, ripped down trees and tumbled boulders like Legos.\n\nFirefighters are still conducting the grim task of searching rubble piles of multimillion-dollar homes for victims assisted by prisoners and cadaver-sniffing dogs that are quickly becoming exhausted in the dangerous conditions. Many evacuated residents don't yet fully grasp how badly their town has been damaged or how long the scars will remain.\n\nThe mudslides have so utterly reorganized the terrain that veteran rescue workers say the hurricanes this summer in Texas and Florida pale in comparison to the concentrated devastation they are entrenched in.\n\nStill, workers are already scraping the mud from the sidewalks outside the custom jewelry and stationary stores lining Coast Village Road and spraying clean the flower gardens. Businesses are jostling to reopen, and donations are pouring into community groups.\n\nAnd there was good news about the community's lifeline: U.S. Highway 101 was now expected to reopen next Monday.\n\nMore:Mourners gather to remember mudslide victims\n\nMore:Closure of Highway 101 leaves swamped Montecito without its lifeline\n\nMore:In mud-battered Montecito, back-to-back disasters 'overwhelming'\n\nAt a vigil on Sunday night, community leaders urged residents to be better to each other in the coming days, to take this opportunity to be kinder and more helpful to a neighbor who might be struggling inside. Das Williams, an elected county supervisor who represents Montecito, struggled to read aloud the names of the dead, particularly those of the children.\n\nI'm not used to little kids dying, he confessed. Williams urged tourists to visit neighboring Santa Barbara, which he hoped would restore a sense of normalcy. He also acknowledged that some businesses in Montecito have warned they'll simply shut down forever if their town doesn't get functioning soon.\n\nThe timetable for getting back to normal isn't known to anyone, he said, a note of frustration creeping into his voice.\n\nBack in the debris fields, that's a fact local firefighters understand. The approximately 50 men and women of the Montecito Fire Department are working shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers as they pick through debris piles in search of bodies, stopping occasionally to rescue photos or other valuable items recognizable through the muck.\n\nEven when it's all cleaned up, it's going to look different, Montecito firefighter Ryland McCracken said. I think it's changed all of us forever. There will always be 'before this' and 'after this.'
A federal judge ordered Friday that Lev Parnas, a Ukraine-born associate of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, could provide documents and iPhone data to the House Intelligence Committee as it continues its impeachment inquiry.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Paul Oetken filed a two-sentence order allowing Parnas to cooperate with the House panel while he is under indictment for campaign-finance violations.\n\nParnas worked with Giuliani as the president's lawyer sought the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, but the criminal charges are unrelated to those efforts.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee's investigation into Trump's dealings with Ukraine led to his impeachment on Dec. 18. The House accuses Trump of abuse of power for urging an investigation of his political rival, and of obstruction of Congress for defying subpoenas seeking information during the investigation.\n\nJoseph Bondy, a lawyer for Parnas, asked the judge Monday to allow Parnas to provide documents from his home and data from his iPhone 11, which were seized when he was arrested in October.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to Parnas the day after he was arrested. The documents and iPhone data fall under its request for information to corroborate the strength of Mr. Parnas's potential testimony, Bondy wrote.\n\nAt present, we do not know whether we intend to produce the entirety of the materials, or a subset filtered for either privilege or relevancy, Bondy said in his letter to the court. If a subset, we will inform the Court and Government as to what we have actually have produced.\n\nA spokesman for the Intelligence Committee declined to comment on the court order.\n\nParnas was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, giving false statements and destruction or falsification of records. He and three others charged in the case have pleaded not guilty.\n\nFederal authorities accuse Parnas of conspiring to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates' governments.\n\nParnas, who contributed heavily to Republicans and has been photographed with Trump, has offered to provide more information to Congress.\n\nGiuliani has said he worked for the removal of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Several top government officials and former officials testified during House impeachment hearings that her removal opened the door for Trump to urge that country to investigate his rival.\n\nDuring a July 25 phone call, Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the family of 2020 presidential contender and former Vice President Joe Biden. That call is central to the article of impeachment accusing Trump of abuse of power.\n\nThe other article of impeachment accuses the president of obstruction of Congress for directing aides and agencies to defy subpoenas from Congress as lawmakers investigated.\n\nTrump has argued that he was authorized to set foreign policy and justified in calling for an investigation of the Bidens.
Pelosi outlines Democrats' path to impeachment vote\n\nHouse Democrats will move forward with plans to remove President Donald Trump from office this week, starting with a resolution that calls on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi laid out the steps they plan to take in a letter to colleagues on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., will request unanimous consent for the Raskin Resolution, which calls on Pence to convene the Cabinet and activate the 25th Amendment. If they don't receive consent – which is almost guaranteed since only a single Republican would have to object – Democrats will vote on the measure on Tuesday.\n\nWe are calling on the Vice President to respond within 24 hours after the resolution is passed, Pelosi said. If Pence does not act before that deadline, House Democrats will introduce articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nIn protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both, Pelosi wrote. As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.\n\nPelosi told CBS News' 60 Minutes on Sunday that she prefers the 25th Amendment to impeachment.\n\nWell, I like the 25th Amendment because it gets rid of him. He's out of office, she said. But there's strong support in the Congress for impeaching the president a second time.\n\nUnder the 25th Amendment, if the vice president and the majority of the Cabinet declare the president unfit for office, the vice president immediately becomes the acting president.\n\nImpeachment is a lengthier process. First, a simple majority in the House must vote in favor of charges. Then, the Senate must hold a trial to consider the charges. For the president to be removed, two-thirds of its members must vote to convict.\n\n– Camille Caldera\n\nMore:Momentum for Trump impeachment soars as some in GOP say it's warranted after Capitol riot\n\n'We were trying to get answers': Md. governor says it took almost 2 hours for Pentagon to approve National Guard help amid DC riots\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday it took nearly two hours for the Pentagon to provide authorization for his state to send its National Guard contingent into Washington to help protect the U.S. Capitol as it came under attack from a violent pro-Trump mob.\n\nHe said that he and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser had been in contact and she had requested assistance but they needed the Department of Defense to sign off because of the district's unique status as a federal district.\n\nOur guard mobilized and was ready, but we couldn't actually cross over the border into D.C. without the OK, and that was quite some time. We kept running it up the flagpole – our generals talking to the National Guard generals, Hogan told CNN's State of the Union program.\n\nI can't speak as to what was going on on the other end of the line back at the Pentagon or in the White House, Hogan added. I was in the middle of a meeting when my chief of staff came in and said the Capitol was under attack. ... We were in contact with the mayor's office who requested assistance. We immediately sent police assistance. I immediately called up the National Guard.\n\nHogan said that eventually, his office got a call from Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy asking them to send to deploy their National Guard.\n\nWe had already been mobilizing. We already had our police there. We already had our Guard mobilized and we were just waiting for that call, he said.\n\nAll I know is that we were trying to get answers and we weren't getting answers, Hogan said.\n\n– Caren Bohan\n\nAmid criticism, White House lowers flag for Capitol officer fatally injured in riot\n\nThe U.S. flag at the White House and all public facilities will fly at half-staff until Jan. 13 to honor the service and sacrifice of U.S. Capitol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, according to a proclamation from President Donald Trump on Sunday.\n\nSicknick, 42, was injured engaging with pro-Trump rioters at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday and died on Thursday. He joined the force in 2008. Liebengood, 51, who also responded to the riots on Wednesday, died on Saturday. He joined the force in 2005.\n\nPrior to the proclamation, Trump and the White House faced criticism for not lowering the flag – a measure that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered take place at the Capitol on Friday.\n\nIt's hideous but we must acknowledge it: the WH flags are not at half staff in memory of Officer Sicknick because Trump doesn't mourn him, CNN's Jake Tapper wrote on Twitter.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also condemned the delay on ABC's This Week.\n\nIt is a national disgrace that the flag at the White House is not at half-staff for that Capitol Hill police officer, who gave his life in protecting one of our institutions of democracy, he said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and President-elect Joe Biden both expressed sympathy to Sicknick's family on Friday.\n\n– Camille Caldera\n\nUS Capitol Police officer, 51, dies; cause not released\n\nA U.S. Capitol Police officer died while off duty on Saturday, according to a statement released by the law enforcement agency responsible for protecting federal property in Washington.\n\nHoward Liebengood, 51, had been with the department since 2005 and was assigned to the Senate Division, police said. The department's statement did not say the cause of Liebengood's death.\n\nAccording to the Capitol Police union, Liebengood was among the officers who responded to the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. At least one police officer was killed amid the riot; four other people also died. Dozens of other officers were injured in the attack.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and colleagues, the department said in its statement. We ask that his family, and other USCP officers' and their families' privacy be respected during this profoundly difficult time.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nPhysician urges Congress members may have been exposed to COVID in Capitol riot\n\nDr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician for Congress, urged all elected officials and their staff to observe public health measures and get tested for the coronavirus after potentially being exposed to someone infected with COVID-19 while the Capitol was locked down during an armed incursion by pro-Trump rioters.\n\nDuring the attack, many members of the House community were in protective isolation in room located in a large committee hearing space, Monahan noted in an email.\n\nThe time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others. During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection, the physician wrote.\n\nAt least six Republican members of Congress refused to wear masks while in lockdown, even after Democratic colleagues pleaded with them. In one video, Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said I'm not trying to get political here, while declining a mask offered by Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del.\n\nPlease continue your usual daily coronavirus risk reduction measures (daily symptom inventory checklist, mask wear, and social distancing). Additionally, individuals should obtain an RT-PCR coronavirus test next week as a precaution, Monahan advised.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to aggressively spread across the United States. The nation has reported over 370,000 deaths and more than 22 million cases since the start of the pandemic.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nPoll: Majority wants Trump removed from office before inauguration\n\nA majority of Americans now believe President Donald Trump should be removed from office before his term ends on Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in.\n\nA new poll published Sunday by ABC News/Ipsos found that 56% of those surveyed want Trump to be removed before Inauguration Day. A higher figure – 67% – blame the commander-in-chief for the riots in Washington this week that left 5 people dead after a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol building, overpowering police and ransacking the complex.\n\nThe chaotic incident followed Trump's Save America Rally in Washington, during which he told his supporters to stop the steal of the election he lost to Biden. Trump urged them to head to the Capitol to demonstrate against Congress certifying Biden's victory.\n\nHouse Democrats are preparing Monday to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump in connection with the riot. They accuse him of having gravely endangered the security of the U.S. and its institutions. It will be Trump's second impeachment.\n\nThe ABC News/Ipsos poll found that most Democrats (94%) and a majority of independents (58%) believe Trump should be removed from office; only 13% of Republicans agree. In fact, 61% of Republicans believe Trump did nothing wrong.\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nSens. Manchin, Toomey call on Trump to resign\n\nSenators Joe Manchin, D-W.V., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., both condemned Wednesday's armed attack on the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead and dozens injured and both senators said they believe President Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses.\n\nThe senators believed that Trump, who urged his supporters to never concede, walk down to the Capitol and show strength, encouraged the violence and should resign.\n\nThe president's behavior after the election was wildly different than his behavior before, he descended into a level of madness and engaged in a level of activity that was just absolutely unthinkable, Toomey told CNN's State of the Union.\n\nToomey said Trump's incitement of the mob last week left the possibility that there's criminal liability here, though he conceded he was not sure whether there was enough evidence for a conviction.\n\nBut there should be accountability, he said.\n\nManchin condemned fellow Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., saying I don't know how they can live with themselves when people have died because of their words and actions. Both Cruz and Hawley led efforts to contest Congress' official counting of the Electoral College vote, a longshot move to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nToomey expressed doubt on NBC News' Meet the Press that impeachment would be a feasible punishment for Trump, noting it is not clear whether it can happen after a person has left office, which is what would have to happen here. However, the senator also hopes that the president has disqualified himself' from winning another election by his words and actions.\n\nManchin said during the Capitol attack, when congresspeople and aides were under secure lockdown, he persuaded Senators Steve Daines, R-Mont., and James Lankford, R-Okla., to abandon Cruz and not contest the result. Manchin urged Cruz and Hawley to do the same, with no success.\n\nI most certainly believe there is blood on their conscience, that is for sure, Manchin said. Sooner or later, someone has got to say, 'This is not who we are.' Someone has got to speak truth to power.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nEx-WH chief of staff Mulvaney: Capitol riot worse than other Trump controversies\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told NBC News' Meet the Press TV show Sunday that he doesn't currently know what's going on inside the Oval Office now and inside the president's head following riots this week in Washington, D.C.\n\nMulvaney announced his resignation Thursday as President Donald Trump's special envoy to Northern Ireland after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday. Mulvaney was Trump's former acting chief of staff.\n\nMulvaney said Sunday that people took (Trump) literally when he encouraged his supporters to stop the steal and to go to the U.S. Capitol building to express their dissatisfaction with the outcome of November's presidential election, won by Joe Biden.\n\nI never thought I'd see that, Mulvaney said.\n\nHe said the ensuing riot was a fundamental threat to the United States and recounted an episode during Trump's impeachment hearing last year in which he told the president, who was accused of witness tampering: 'Mr. President, this is a problem & we need to fix it.' He pushed back a little bit but then he ... he pivoted.\n\nIn a separate interview on Fox News, Mulvaney appeared to defend the administration's handling of earlier controversies that engulfed Trump's White House, arguing the storming of the Capitol was of an entirely different magnitude.\n\nI think everybody recognizes that what happened on Wednesday is different, Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. He said previous controversies were policy differences, many of them were stylistic. Wednesday was existential.\n\nMulvaney dodged a question on whether he supported the use of the 25th Amendment, used to get rid of an incapacitated or unfit president, to remove Trump from office.\n\nI think the 25th Amendment (is) a clumsy tool. We've never used it under these circumstances. We typically use it whenever a president goes through a medical procedure, he said.\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nKellyanne Conway condemns armed riot at US Capitol\n\nFormer Senior White House Assistant Kellyanne Conway condemned the armed invasion of the US Capitol on Wednesday by pro-Trump rioters.\n\nDon't avert your eyes & don't excuse this, Conway said on Twitter of a report compiling haunting footage of the attacks. The more we see & learn, the worse it is.\n\nThe events were outrageous and inexcusable. Democracy relies on dissent, not destruction. In this nation, differences of opinions are resolved by showing up at the ballot box, not by storming the barricade, Conway said in a statement Thursday.\n\nConway managed President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and was a senior White House adviser when Trump took office, sticking by the president through almost the entire tumult of his first term. Conway left the Trump administration in August 2020 after a public feud with her daughter in the media.\n\nThe former aide's comments come as the Trump administration is roiling in its last days in office. Former and current aides have expressed worry about their involvement in the administration, while others have also condemned the Capitol attack or resigned from their posts.\n\nConway has continued to express support for the president, despite the Capitol attack.\n\nThe thugs from yesterday are responsible for their own actions, Conway said. They don't represent the millions of Trump voters, or the massive 'MAGA' movement; they insult them.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nPence to attend Biden's inauguration\n\nVice President Mike Pence will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, even as President Donald Trump intends to skip it.\n\nThe decision came a day after Trump announced he would decline to watch his successor sworn-in, breaking with more than 150 years of tradition. A source familiar with the decision speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed Pence's expected attendance.\n\nPence is facing considerable blowback from some Trump supporters – and significant praise from others – for defying the president's demand that he somehow reject the results of the election as Congress met Wednesday to count Electoral College votes and formalized Biden's win. Despite Trump's protestations, Pence noted he had no power to reject the votes.\n\nBiden dismissed Trump's decision not to attend the inauguration, telling reporters on Friday that it was one of the few things he and I ever agreed on. But of Pence, Biden said that he was welcome to come and that he'd be honored to have him there.\n\n– John Fritze
Republican lawmakers lost thousands of Twitter followers when the company cracked down on accounts linked to QAnon following the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol stoked by President Donald Trump.\n\nUSA TODAY analyzed the Twitter followings of the congressional accounts for 507 members of the House and Senate in data provided by ProPublica. About 42% of the accounts – 213 – had fewer followers on Jan. 13 than they did on Jan. 6. The vast majority of those accounts – 200 – belonged to Republicans.\n\nThe numbers reflect followers as of Wednesday, not long before the historic House vote to impeach Trump on allegations of inciting the riot one week earlier.\n\nLeading conservatives have accused Twitter of political bias in its moderation policies. But Ethan Zuckerman, associate professor of public policy, information and communication at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said it's more likely that GOP lawmakers lost followers because their followers included QAnon adherents.\n\nIt's not a very flattering explanation, but it's more plausible, in my opinion, than a broad crackdown against conservatives on these networks, said Zuckerman.\n\nTrump ally and powerful House conservative Jim Jordan of Ohio lost the most followers: 176,672, or about 9% of the 2 million followers he had on Jan. 6. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul shed 142,156, and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy 103,815.\n\nTwitter CEO defends Donald Trump ban:'I believe this was the right decision,' Jack Dorsey said\n\nMost Americans support Trump Twitter ban:Twitter's Trump ban after Capitol attack supported by most Americans but not most Republicans, Harris Poll says\n\nA total of 37 lawmakers, all Republicans, lost at least 10% of their followers. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., lost 18%, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., lost 15% and Kelly Loeffler, an incumbent Georgia senator who was defeated in Georgia's runoff elections, lost 14%.\n\nRepublican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois was one of few who bucked the trend. Kinzinger, who voted to impeach Trump, picked up 54,671 followers, a 42% increase.\n\nThe data analyzed by USA TODAY did not specify how much of a lawmaker's decline in followers was the result of followers' accounts being banned by Twitter or users simply choosing to stop following the lawmaker.\n\nTwitter makes it nearly impossible to study follower change, said Libby Hemphill, associate professor of information at the University of Michigan.\n\nSome prominent conservatives including Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida cried foul, accusing Twitter of wiping out right-wing accounts because of their political beliefs. The representative lost about 6% of his total followers during the past week.\n\nI wish I could lose weight as fast as I'm losing followers during this Twitter purge, he wrote, while live-tweeting his plunging follower count over the weekend.\n\nRepublican follower counts plunged after Twitter purge\n\nTwitter says it removed more than 70,000 accounts, many of which the social media company saidwere associated with QAnon extremism, to root out commentary that could incite violence after banning Trump last week. QAnon adherents believe that Trump is their savior in the fight against satanic Democrats and deep state officials, who will be overthrown in some great awakening.\n\nGiven the violent events in Washington, D.C., and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon, the company said.\n\nThe previous week Twitter permanently banned Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former attorney Sidney Powell, and 8chan founder Ron Watkins, all of whom amplified QAnon content.\n\nTwitter also stepped up enforcement of accounts that persistently spread misleading and false information, warning that repeat violations could lead to permanent suspension.\n\nA number of Trump supporters vowed to delete their accounts after the president's permanent suspension. I'm a small MAGA account and I have lost 400 followers in 3 days. Goodbye Twitter. You don't want me, I don't want you, one user tweeted last Saturday.\n\nThose factors, combined with the routine removal of bot and spam accounts, likely caused dramatic fluctuations in some users' follower counts, not anti-conservative bias, said Zuckerman, the UMass Amherst professor.\n\nA simple explanation for conservatives losing large numbers of followers is that: a) they were being followed by folks who posted QAnon content; and b) they were being followed by lots of fake/sockpuppet accounts, Zuckerman said.\n\nConservatives accuse Twitter of bias in purge\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, lost 45,000 followers, according to Rob Bluey, vice president of communications.\n\nIt's just another example of conservative frustration with Big Tech, Bluey said. Conservatives feel they are being targeted unfairly and believe these companies tend to be controlled and run by liberals who have it out for them. At the same time, these companies always point back to their terms of service and their policies for the reason or excuse of why they took action.\n\nAnd that, he says, is why we find ourselves in this big debate about what to do about it.\n\nBroadly speaking, social media companies have wide latitude to decide what can stay on their platforms and what must come down thanks to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, decades-old legal protections that shield them from liability for what users post on their platforms.\n\nThe conservative outcry over the moderation of posts, particularly those of the president, has led to multiple congressional hearings and threats to narrow or repeal the law. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey have for years tried to appease the political right.\n\nDarren Linvill, lead researcher in the Clemson University Media Forensics Hub, said the scale of Twitter's recent removal of accounts was unusual.\n\nI'm still relatively surprised they would take such sweeping action, Linvill said. In the past, they have shown reticence to take action that might feed the perception of liberal bias, and this certainly has alienated many loyal users.\n\nTwitter gets more aggressive against QAnon\n\nIn the aftermath of the Capitol attacks, Twitter has become much more aggressive rooting out QAnon and other problematic content.\n\nIn July, Twitter banned 7,000 QAnon accounts and blocked topics related to the conspiracy theory from appearing in trending topics, but that action did little to undercut its influence on the platform.\n\nFor that purge, they used a scalpel, only getting rid of about 10,000 of the worst offenders, Linvill said. Clearly, this past week, Twitter switched from a scalpel to a chainsaw.\n\nDespite the outcry from conservatives, who described the account removals as the largest-ever Twitter purge, the company has cracked down much harder in the past. In 2018, Twitter suspended more than 1.2 million bogus accounts. Celebrities lost followers in the six figures. CEO Dorsey himself lost 200,000 followers.\n\nDemocrats had smaller declines and some big gains\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis shows that the declines in follower counts of 13 Congressional Democrats were far more modest than for Republicans. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein lost the most followers with 3,425.\n\nAt the same time, prominent Democrats gained a significant number of followers. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris (232,020) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (163,841) were the top gainers. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran as a Democrat for president in 2016 and 2020 and is part of the Senate Democratic leadership, increased his following by 134,251.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, nearly every member of Congress maintains one personal or campaign account and one official Twitter account. These accounts produce a flood of social media posts, far more than even a few years ago.\n\nIn the first five months of 2020, members of Congress collectively produced an average of 73,924 tweets each month.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are much more likely to use Twitter to communicate, likely because U.S. adults on Twitter are more likely to identify as Democrats, Pew found. And the number of followers for the typical Democrat has grown much more quickly than for the typical Republican. The median Democratic member of Congress has over 17,000 more Twitter followers than the median Republican.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested Thursday the central bank is likely to lower its forecast from two interest rate hikes this year amid volatile financial markets and a slowing U.S. and global economy.\n\nDuring the year, we'll look at (the economy) and tighter financial conditions and we'll also lower our rate path and monitor the effects of that on the economy and markets, Powell said in an interview at the Economic Club of Washington D.C. He stressed the Fed has made no decisions about the pace of rate increases this year and will respond to the economy as it evolves, saying officials will be flexible.\n\nPowell's remarks largely echoed his assertion at a forum in Atlanta last week that the Fed will be patient as it weighs future rate hikes – a message that has helped drive stocks higher. On Thursday, he appeared to more explicitly indicate that Fed policymakers could lower their rate-hike forecast if markets continue to be turbulent and the economy slows more than anticipated.\n\nFed policymakers' estimate of two rate increases this year was contingent on a really strong outlook for 2018, Powell said. While he said that may still happen, he added, We can be patient and wait and see what does evolve, noting that inflation has been modest.\n\nFed fund futures markets have been predicting the Fed won't raise rates at all this year.\n\nThe stock market plunged in mid-December after the Fed raised its key interest rate for a fourth time in 2018 and forecast the two additional hikes this year. Although that was a downgrade from its prior projection of three increases, markets expected the Fed to take more of a wait-and-see approach to future moves in light of slowing global growth, the U.S. trade war with China, market turbulence and stable inflation.\n\nMore:Ford plans 'significant' job cuts in Europe, expects Volkswagen ties\n\nMore:How a downgrade to the U.S. credit rating could affect the economy\n\nPowell also reiterated Thursday that he and other Fed policymakers not affected by President Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed increases, which Trump says have slowed the economy, undercutting his promises for faster growth.\n\nWe don't get distracted by other things, Powell said. We don't take political factors into consideration. The Fed is an independent agency and its insulation from political pressure has underpinned its credibility and influence.\n\nHowever, Powell said he would meet with Trump if invited, noting that previous Fed chiefs occasionally have met with U.S. presidents\n\nI'm not aware of anyone not accepting and offered to meet with a president, he said.\n\nPowell's comments on:\n\nThe economy: We see continued momentum, Powell said, adding unemployment is near a 50-year low and wages are rising. But we see financial markets express views of concern about downside risk. He added he doesn't seem elevated risk of recession this year.\n\nThe partial government shutdown: A short-term closure that's resolved shortly will likely have no effect, he said. But he added, If we have an extended shutdown, I would think that would show up in the (economic) data pretty clearly.\n\nThe US-China trade war: I don't think the tariffs on either side have had a mark… on either the Chinese economy or the US economy, he said.\n\nThe recent plunge in oil prices: Powell acknowledged a drop in prices is now less of a clear benefit for the economy because the U.S. has become the world's top oil producer, partly offsetting lower gasoline prices for consumers. Still, he said, There's still a mild benefit in the aggregate from lower oil prices.
Johnny C. Taylor Jr., Special to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor, Jr.: Handling complaints about co-workers' personal hygiene is a common challenge for employers and HR. Here are two of the questions I've received on the topic.\n\nQ: What should I do about a colleague who doesn't wash his hands after going to the bathroom? — Anonymous\n\nTaylor: I can't think of many issues in the workplace as sensitive as personal hygiene. Dealing with this problem can be uncomfortable, awkward and downright embarrassing. Because this is a tricky one, you should immediately involve your human resources department, which is trained to handle such sensitive conversations.\n\nWhile you might be appalled by your colleague's behavior (as you should be), the real issue is one of public safety. Bad hygiene can impact the health and well-being of co-workers and your company's customers and clients.\n\nAccording to research conducted by Blue Cross Blue Shield, when employees don't wash their hands, illnesses from the common cold to the flu to gastrointestinal infections can be spread to co-workers and cause them to miss work or be less productive when they do come to work while sick.\n\nAnd not a week goes by when we don't learn of a major outbreak of E. coli or Salmonella in which the suspected cause is a food worker who failed to wash his or her hands after using the restroom. Sadly, many of these outbreaks do more than sicken people — they actually kill people, particularly children, the elderly and those whose immune systems are compromised from other illnesses.\n\nIn short, an employee failing to wash his or her hands is a serious matter that could be a violation of company policy. Public-health campaigns have led to more hand-washing, but there's still a gap between those who say they wash their hands after using a public restroom and those who actually do it.\n\nIf you see that someone isn't washing his or her hands, talk to HR about your concerns.\n\nQ: My boss has body odor and bad breath. What can I do about this issue? — Anonymous\n\nTaylor: Again, HR is your best ally.\n\nMany workplaces have dress codes or policies that include personal hygiene requirements. These requirements would be discussed in any conversation that HR has with a boss who has body odor or bad breath.\n\nSometimes a personal hygiene issue stems from cultural norms or a medical condition. If this is the case, HR will respond empathetically while addressing the issue professionally.\n\nQ. Can a company fire a new employee within a 90-day probationary period without write-ups? — Chris\n\nTaylor: If an employee works in an at-will state and there is no employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, an employer can fire the employee within the first 90 days without any warning or write-ups.\n\nBefore offering details, let me define a few terms.\n\nAt-will means that an employer or employee can terminate their relationship at any time and for any reason, except for unlawful ones such as discrimination or retaliation. Employment is at-will in all states except Montana.\n\nA probationary period is a set time to give an employer the opportunity to determine whether a new hire has the required skills and abilities and is a good fit with the job and company. The length of time for this varies from company to company, although 90 days seems common.\n\nA write-up — also referred to as written warnings, disciplinary action or counseling forms — is used to document an employee's violation of company policy and issues with job performance.\n\nAs a new employee, you may want to review your company's policies to determine whether its practices include verbal or written warnings before termination within the probationary period. Monitor your own performance by asking for and documenting feedback from your supervisors.\n\nEmployers should be mindful that there is nothing magical about the number 90. Sometimes, performance issues manifest themselves in less — or more — time. And firing an employee during a probationary period does not provide greater protections against a wrongful termination lawsuit or discrimination complaint.\n\nCompanies should clearly communicate to applicants and new employees the purpose of their probationary period and whether they are an at-will employer. As a matter of good faith, supervisors should give ongoing feedback to help probationary employees understand whether they are meeting the expectations of the job.\n\nNo employer hires a worker thinking it's not going to work out. But if termination is necessary, it should be done in a way that follows the employer's practices, as well as state and federal law.\n\nHave a question?

WASHINGTON — It's axiomatic in Washington that the arguments never change — just which side is making them.\n\nAs recently as last May, Trump seemed to relish a spending fight with Democrats.\n\nOur country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess! he tweeted, after reaching a compromise with Democrats to avoid a filibuster over a spending deal.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders explained what he meant this week: He said it would be good politics. Look, that's never been a preference of this administration. It wasn't then; it isn't now.\n\nMore:No immediate resolution to spending impasse after Trump, Schumer met on shutdown\n\nMore:Need a drink? D.C. bar to offer shutdown cocktails (if the government shuts down)\n\nMore:Trump cancels Mar-a-Lago trip as government shutdown deadline approaches\n\nLook back a few years earlier — when then-President Barack Obama was sitting where Trump is now and Trump was sitting on the set of The Apprentice — and Trump seemed to have very different ideas about a government shutdown.\n\nOn who benefits politically\n\nThen: Obama & the Democrats want this shutdown.

AP\n\nWACO, Texas (AP) — After Johnathan Motley grabbed a rebound and no defender got in front of him, Baylor's 6-foot-10 forward was going all the way.\n\nMotley's full-court drive for a layup in the second half was part of his 25 points and the sixth-ranked Bears had little trouble this time with TCU in a 70-52 victory on Saturday.\n\nI was going until someone cut me off, Motley said.\n\nAnd TCU really never did that all day against Motley, who was 12-of-15 shooting with all of those makes in the paint. The breakaway drive was in a stretch when he scored nine straight points for Baylor (22-3, 9-3 Big 12), including a three-point play after getting fouled while making a layup.\n\nHe's long, he just plays hard, TCU coach Jamie Dixon said.\n\nMot was tremendous. He's had some good games, but when you shoot 12 for 15, those are special, Bears coach Scott Drew said. And he was really effective. It was fun to watch him.\n\nBaylor never trailed in winning its 11th straight game in the series since the former Southwest Conference rivals were reunited in the Big 12 when TCU (17-8, 6-6) moved into the power league four years ago.\n\nManu Lecomte added 17 points for the Bears, and King McClure scored all 13 of his before halftime.\n\nJaylen Fisher had 18 points for TCU while Kenrich Williams had 10.\n\nWhen they played about 100 miles away on Jan. 21 in Fort Worth, there were 16 lead changes, with 13 in the second half along with five ties, before Baylor pulled out a 62-53 victory. The rematch was tied only once, at 2-2.\n\nWe definitely were expecting better, Williams said. It's a little bit of an embarrassment, with me being from Waco. We've just got to keep working.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nTCU: After their first three-conference winning streak since 2008, the Frogs suffered their largest loss of the season. They still have six Big 12 wins, their most ever in the league, and would likely get back in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1998 by splitting their last six regular-season games.\n\nBaylor: The Bears have their best-ever record through 25 games overall (22-3) and best through 12 Big 12 games (9-3). Drew said his team was intent to erase what happened in its last home game, when the Bears were down by 17 points in the first half last Saturday against Kansas State before a late rally came up two points short.\n\nKING-SIZE SHOTS\n\nMcClure had back-to-back 3-pointers for Baylor to make it 15-6 during a first-half stretch when TCU went more than 7 minutes without a field goal. McClure started his second straight game in place of suspended Al Freeman, who is out for what the school called a violation of team policy. It is unclear when Freeman may be reinstated. McClure has 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting in those two starts.\n\nOVER THE SHOULDER — AND IN\n\nBaylor's last field goal of the first half was Jake Lindsey's over-the-shoulder layup with his right hand and his back to the basket after driving the baseline. That put the Bears up 32-17.\n\nBEEN A LONG TIME\n\nThe Frogs have lost their last 20 games against Top 25 teams since a win over then-No. 21 Oklahoma State on Valentine's Day two years ago. Their road losing streak against ranked teams is 39 straight since a win at No. 24 Hawaii in January 1998.\n\nNOT MUCH HELP\n\nTCU had only one assist at halftime. Then again, the Frogs had only six field goals by then. I've never been around a team with one assist in a first half, Dixon said. They trailed 32-17 at the half, their lowest-scoring half this season. They had nine assists on 14 field goals in the second half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTCU: Home against Oklahoma State on Wednesday\n\nBaylor: Plays on Monday night at Texas Tech, which lost by one at home Saturday to Big 12-leading and third-ranked Kansas. The Jayhawks are in Waco next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
Greg Gardner\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDETROIT -- General Motors released the first photos Sunday of the U.S. version of what will be the first new vehicle from Detroit's Big 3 that's being imported from China -- the Buick Envision crossover.\n\nAhead of its formal unveiling at the North American International Auto Show, Buick offered a peek at the vehicle that it that will be produced at a joint venture plant in China. Last year, Buick sold more than 140,000 Envisions in China.\n\nAmericans continue to shift from traditional passenger cars to crossovers and SUVs. Higher-driving positions and more voluminous storage are fueling much of the migration.\n\nSales of what Autodata calls sport wagons and crossovers grew 18.5% in 2015 to 4.5 million, while sales of midsize cars fell 2% to 3,5 million.\n\nBuick needed to quickly fill a hole in their product lineup, and importing the Envision is the quickest way to do it, said Erik Gordon, clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union protested General Motors' decision to import the Envision during this year's labor negotiations. But Buick can begin selling it as early as July because it's already produced in China, and shipping it here can happen faster than it would take to install new tooling in a North American plant already running near its capacity.\n\nGM officials, including Duncan Aldred, vice president of Buick and GMC, have pointed out that the company's U.S. engineers have made key changes at the Warren Tech Center that will make the U.S. version of the crossover more appealing to American consumers' driving preferences.\n\nThe engines will be of larger displacement. There will be certain comfort and technological features (such as park assist and hyperstrut front suspension) that aren't available in China, Aldred said.\n\nThe U.S. version will have a 2-liter, four-cylinder turbocharged engine, mated with a six-speed all-wheel drive transmission. The Envision sold in China offers the choice of a 2-liter or a 1.5-liter, four-cylinder engine.\n\nBuick will also unveil another new vehicle or technology tonight, but Envision fills a gap in Buick's lineup.\n\nAldred cites the Audi Q5, Acura RDX and Lincoln MKC as Envision's direct competitors. It is similar in size to such high-volume models as Ford Escape, Jeep Cherokee, Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.\n\nDespite the UAW's irritation over Envision, the economics of bringing a vehicle from China are enhanced at the moment. That country's economy appears to be slowing and its plummeting stock markets dragged down financial markets worldwide in the past five days.\n\nThe Chinese government continues to devalue its currency, the yuan, as part of a policy designed to boost exports of all Chinese-produced goods, from T-shirts to smartphones to cars and trucks.\n\nU-M's Gordon, however, doesn't see Envision as a harbinger of more vehicles being shipped from China to the U.S.\n\nIf carmakers have excess manufacturing capacity in China, they will export cars, but the U.S. market may not be their best bet, he said. It took American buyers a while to warm up to Korean cars, and Korea was a strong ally that had been exporting high-quality electronic goods to the U.S. for years.\n\nStephanie Brinley, an industry analyst with IHS Automotive, doesn't expect that most American consumers will care where the Envision or any other vehicle is built.\n\nBuick is already importing from South Korea, Europe and Poland, Brinley said. Vehicles are coming from all over the world for all manufacturers.\n\nChina is a larger market than North America for Buick, which sold more than 1 million vehicles in China in 2015, compared with 223,000 in the U.S.\n\nBuick is GM's largest brand in China, where it has deep roots dating to before World War II. According to statistics from the Shanghai government, in 1930 one out of every six cars on the city's roads was a Buick. Shanghai GM, the automaker's joint venture that launched production in 1999, chose Buick as its first model because of legacy as the car of choice among high-ranking government officials.\n\nThe center of gravity for Buick is China and that ultimately impacts manufacturing, Brinley said.\n\nLast year, Buick unveiled the Cascada, its first convertible in more than two decades, that will be imported from an assembly plant in Gliwice, Poland. Dealers expect to begin receiving Cascadas in February.\n\nIn July, Buick dealers will begin selling the 2017 Buick LaCrosse, first shown last November at the Los Angeles Auto Show. LaCrosse will be assembled at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant.
UFC anti-doping partner USADA today announced women's strawweight Jessica Penne has accepted an 18-month suspension for an unspecified steroid.\n\nUSADA today reported Penne, 34, tested positive for the presence of an anabolic androgenic steroid of exogenous origin despite initially testing negative for prohibited substances following an out-of-competition urine test conducted on March 20, 2017.\n\nPenne (12-5 MMA, 1-3 UFC) was flagged after a review of her Athlete Biological Passport revealed irregularities in her urine. USADA ordered Penne's urine sample to be retested, and it was positive for a banned substance. But the result didn't come back in time to keep her from fighting Danielle Taylor (9-2 MMA, 2-1 UFC) one month later at UFC Fight Night 108.\n\nPenne's lost the fight to Taylor, which was her third straight UFC defeat.\n\nAfter being notified of the positive test, Penne told USADA she was prescribed dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an exogenous anabolic agent, by her doctor. After a review of the case, her explanation was accepted by USADA and the Tennessee Athletic Commission, which oversaw UFC Fight Night 108, according to USADA's release.\n\nPenne's suspension is retroactive to April 23, the night of the FS1-televised event.\n\nUnder the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, as well as the World Anti-Doping Code, an athlete's period of ineligibility for using a prohibited substance may be decreased if the athlete lacks significant fault for the anti-doping policy violation, USADA stated in a press release issued. In this instance, although Penne was not successful in her attempt to obtain a retroactive or prospective Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for DHEA after her positive test, it was determined that her degree of fault was reduced because her use of the prohibited substance was under the care of a physician. Accordingly, Penne received a corresponding reduction to 18-months from the standard two-year period of ineligibility for a non-Specified Substance under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy.\n\nFor complete coverage of UFC Fight Night 108, check out the UFC Events section of the site.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is betting big on the Supreme Court in 2019 to revive controversial policies on issues ranging from immigration and border security to transgender soldiers in the military.\n\nSeeking to match the success he had at the high court on his immigration travel ban against predominantly Muslim countries last year, Trump is counting on the justices – including two that he picked – to reverse lower court losses at the hands of both liberal and conservative judges.\n\nHow the Supreme Court rules on the requests in the coming months will shed light on the justices' views about executive power, judicial discretion and Trump's proclivity for upending longstanding policies by whim, or even tweet.\n\nWaiting for word are more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children who could be threatened with deportation under Trump's policy. Also in play are some of the estimated thousands of transgender troops serving in the military and others seeking to join who face a partial ban.\n\nThe high court already is slated to hear a dispute over the Trump administration's effort to ask about citizenship in the 2020 Census. Other cases that could be headed there eventually include Trump's ban on asylum seekers who enter the country illegally and his threat to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities that do not fully cooperate with immigration authorities.\n\nIn most of those cases, the Justice Department took the unusual step of seeking Supreme Court action before lower-court appeals had run their course. The administration railed against local judges issuing nationwide injunctions against Trump's policies. But the high court has been loath to jump over lower courts.\n\nThe executive branch is mistaken if it looks to the Supreme Court to provide a quick fix for their litigation problems, says Peter Margulies, a professor specializing in national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. The Supreme Court isn't designed to be a quick fix.\n\nUSA TODAY is on WhatsApp! Sign up to get our top news story delivered to you on WhatsApp daily. Click this link on your mobile device to get started\n\nWin or lose, the confrontations at the nation's highest court will shed light on whether\n\nAssociate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's two nominees, will make a major difference – or whether the president's battle with Chief Justice John Roberts over the independence of the federal judiciary will backfire.\n\nLosing streak at lower courts\n\nTrump enters 2019 with a poor track record in the federal courts.\n\nJust as he did early in his battle to limit travelers from majority-Muslim nations, Trump has lost most of his battles with judges on issues ranging from early skirmishes over special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the revoking of CNN reporter Jim Acosta's White House press credential.\n\nMore:It's not just 'Obama judges'. Here are Republican appointees who have ruled against Trump\n\nThe Trump administration has consistently failed in the lower courts, and they've gotten some relief in the Supreme Court, says Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston who follows the high court closely.\n\nThat wasn't the case on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which has helped more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants avoid deportation and get work permits. Trump sought to end what President Barack Obama began but was swatted down by federal district and appeals court judges who said he lacked the authority to do so.\n\nThe Supreme Court refused to block the lower court orders from taking effect but is scheduled to consider hearing the government's appeal at its Friday conference. If at least four justices agree to take the case, it could be heard in April and decided by the end of June.\n\nTrump hasn't had better luck at the high court with his asylum ban. After a federal judge blocked his effort to cut off asylum for migrants who enter the country illegally – and before the case went to an appeals court – the Supreme Court narrowly refused, 5-4, to step in. Both of Trump's high court nominees joined two other conservative justices in dissent.\n\nIt probably didn't help that Trump blasted federal district court Judge Jon Tigar as an Obama judge after his initial ruling, later upheld in a 2-1 opinion by federal appeals court Judge Jay Bybee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.\n\nWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges, Roberts said in response to the president's criticism. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\n\nRoberts later provided the deciding vote against reinstating Trump's asylum ban, but the issue could reach the Supreme Court later this year or in 2020.\n\nThe asylum ban case in particular raises distinct separation-of-powers concerns because Congress has spoken directly to the issue, which the court found was not the situation with the travel ban, says Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigrants' rights project.\n\n'Better chance' at high court\n\nThe administration's effort to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 Census ties in to the overall battle over immigration, since it could depress the official count of immigrants and cause their communities to lose federal aid and representation in Congress.\n\nThat battle is being fought in lower courts, but the Supreme Court has scheduled oral argument in February over a side issue: What evidence can be considered in a challenge mounted by state and local governments and immigrant rights groups? They want to expose the Trump administration's decision-making process, while the administration says it's irrelevant.\n\nIlya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, says the administration likely thinks Kavanaugh's replacement of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy is a plus.\n\nThey probably have a better chance at the Supreme Court than at the lower courts, Somin says.\n\nThe administration had been on a losing streak in its effort to ban transgender troops from serving openly in the military – another policy from the Obama administration that Trump sought to change 18 months ago with a tweet.\n\nThat's not a great way to start a process, Margulies says, noting former Defense Secretary James Mattis and top Pentagon brass were taken by surprise. That's not a very auspicious start.\n\nFour federal district judges blocked the new policy temporarily while it works its way through the court system. But last Friday, a federal appeals court reversed one of those rulings, reasoning that the administration's policy had evolved and was not a blanket ban.\n\nThe Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to intercede now rather than wait for other appeals court rulings, and a decision could come this month.\n\nFighting nationwide injunctions\n\nOne of the administration's central arguments is that district court judges operating at the bottom rung of the federal judicial system should not be able to block executive actions nationwide. It's an argument that has won some support in legal circles.\n\nWhen a federal appeals court ruled in August against Trump's sanctuary cities policy, it nonetheless admonished a lower court for blocking the policy nationwide. And when the Supreme Court upheld Trump's travel ban in June, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should go further and consider stripping district judges of that authority.\n\nAt the same time, critics of the administration's legal efforts contend Solicitor General Noel Francisco routinely is seeking to circumvent Supreme Court rules that allow leapfrogging lower courts only upon a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice.\n\nThe Justice Department has shown a remarkable lack of respect for the judicial process by repeatedly seeking to skip over the lower courts and, rather, go straight to the Supreme Court, New York's former acting attorney general, Barbara Underwood, tweeted in November.\n\nIf the strategy proves successful, it could lead to even more efforts by the Trump administration to seek Supreme Court bailouts of lower court rulings. One prime target: The Justice Department is seeking to quash a lawsuit that alleges the president has benefited illegally from his family business, including at the Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House.
AP\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — The football player and friend in Le'Veon Bell understood why LeGarrette Blount walked off the job that cold night in Nashville more than two years ago, jogging to the locker room with the clock still running as Bell and the rest of the Pittsburgh Steelers reveled in a critical victory over Tennessee.\n\nFor the teammate in Bell, things were a bit more complicated. Here was a guy who was supposed to have his back instead pouting his way out of town while Bell was in the middle of a breakout season.\n\nIt made me think a little more differently (about him), Bell said. But LeGarrette's doing his thing.\n\nBlount's just doing it for the Patriots, not the Steelers, who cut Blount two days after his hasty retreat. Blount was back with New England by the end of the week and three months later earned a Super Bowl ring while Bell sat at home recovering from a hyperextended left knee injury that forced him to miss Pittsburgh's playoff loss to Baltimore.\n\nYet Bell holds no grudges. The two remain in constant contact, though the texting may slow this week with the Steelers (13-5) headed to Foxborough to face Blount and the Patriots (15-2) in the AFC championship game.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to work out this way.\n\nThe Steelers signed Blount in the spring of 2014 believing the hulking Blount could be the bruising change of pace back they needed to complement the rapidly maturing Bell's decidedly pragmatic style. And if Blount happened to become a mentor of sorts along the way, even better.\n\nNeither happened.\n\nIn August 2014 Bell and Blount were picked up by a police officer after he noticed the scent of marijuana smoke coming from a car Bell was driving, leading to a DUI charge for Bell, a drug charge for Blount and brief suspensions by the NFL for violating the league's substance abuse policy.\n\nThe two split carries early that season, but as Bell's touches went up and Blount's productivity went down, the future became apparent to both. Blount's frustrations bubbled over as Bell finished off a 204-yard performance in a Monday night game. By lunchtime on Wednesday, he was released. The sting in the locker room was palpable.\n\nFor him to walk out on his team, yeah it hurt, right tackle Marcus Gilbert said. Whenever LeGarette Blount was over here, it was hard for him to fit into the offense because Le'Veon was on such a roll. He wanted more touches. It was just hard.\n\nToo hard apparently, though for Blount the ends ultimately justified the means. He helped push the Patriots to a championship shortly after re-signing and ran for an NFL-high 18 touchdowns this season, including two in a 27-16 victory in Pittsburgh in October. Bell had 149 total yards, 81 receiving and 68 coming on 10 receptions in the loss, a showcase of the versatility few backs in the league can match, Blount included.\n\nNo, I've never seen anyone do that — to be as effective as he is, Blount said. It's just something that he does. It's his style. That's all I can really say about it. You can't really describe what he can do.\n\nBell, Blount and their teams have moved on professionally. The role of steadying veteran presence the Steelers thought they might be getting with Blount has instead been filled by DeAngelo Williams. The 33-year-old has fit in seamlessly, showing there's plenty of life in his legs during the first three weeks of the season while Bell served a second suspension for running afoul of the league's drug policy, then gracefully stepping aside when Bell returned.\n\nI think DeAngelo is to the point where he's like, 'Man, I just want to win. I don't want the ball 20 times,' Bell said. He kind of leans on me, being a younger guy and taking more of the carries and things like that. Because DeAngelo has done just about everything. So I'm obviously trying to be the type of player DeAngelo is.\n\nBlount wasn't at that point in his career yet when he arrived in Pittsburgh, though in a twist he's found himself now splitting carries with a resurgent Dion Lewis. The two have nearly the identical number of carries (59 for Lewis, 58 for Blount) over the last month, though don't expect Blount to literally exit stage left. This isn't two years ago. If it's something that comes up during Blount's texts with Bell, neither are saying. Their bromance stopped being limited to just football long ago. They couldn't co-exist together in the same uniform. Life, however, is another matter entirely.\n\nThis game doesn't last as long as any friendship would, Blount said. This game is limited. You never know when it's over. Friendships last forever. He's one of the guys that I'm going to continue to talk to for a really long time.\n\nNOTES: Bell did not practice on Thursday but it wasn't injury related. He is expected to play Sunday. ... LB James Harrison missed practice Thursday while dealing with shoulder and triceps injury. ... TE Ladarius Green did not practice and remains in the concussion protocol. ... Several players returned to practice after being held out Wednesday due to illness, including K Chris Boswell and WR Darrius Heyward-Bey.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Boston contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
Daniel B. Kline\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nMost people have secrets from their significant other. Maybe you didn't really have the salad for dinner or perhaps one drink at the bar was actually four (or more).\n\nFor whatever reason, a lot of folks in committed relationships aren't fully honest with their partner. In many cases, that's innocuous enough, an extra cookie or the fact that the jeans you bought weren't actually on sale fall into white lie territory.\n\nSome lies, however, are worse than others. Concealing bank accounts or credit cards, falls into that category for about a third of Americans in a committed relationship, according to a new report from CreditCards.com. Those folks, 31% of the total, believe that hiding accounts is worse than cheating physically.\n\nHow big is the problem?\n\nHiding bank and credit card accounts from a partner or spouse is more common than you might expect. Of the U.S. adults involved in a live-in romantic relationship, 15 million people currently have a credit card, checking account, or savings account that their partner or spouse doesn't know about. In addition, another nine million admit they used to have such an account, but say they have gotten rid of it.\n\nAbout one-in-five U.S. adults in a live-in relationship (21%) either are guilty or have been guilty in the past of this behavior. This behavior does skew with (31%) of Millennials (18-37) having at some point kept an account secret from their current spouse or partner. The numbers decrease as ages go up with 24% of Generation X (38-53), 17% of Baby Boomers (54-72), and 8% of the Silent Generation (73+) admitting to this financial trickery.\n\nMore: Survey: More people would take investing advice from Oprah Winfrey than Donald Trump\n\nMore: 3 ways debt settlement may not be the fix you expect\n\nMore: Trump and your finances: Taxes, student and payday loans, tips targeted in 1st year\n\nHow big a deal is this?\n\nAs noted above, 31% of those in a relationship consider that having a secret credit card, checking account or savings account is worse than cheating physically. That percentage increases for survey respondents in lower income brackets.\n\nThe problem may at least partly be due to lack of communication. Only 63% of romantic partners discuss their finances at least a few times a month. That leaves a pretty big number that does not.\n\nKeeping financial secrets in a relationship, just like any other type of infidelity, is a sure-fire way to spark an argument, said CreditCards.com senior industry analyst Matt Schulz in a press release. Honest ongoing communication about money is vital to any serious relationship. When in doubt, talk it out.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhen it comes to relationships honesty is generally the best policy. In the case of finances, if you feel the need to keep secrets that may speak to a bigger problem in the relationship.\n\nPeople who live together need to create a financial reality that both people operate under. That means being open about finances and being able to reach an agreement. If you can't, then perhaps being a live-in couple is not the correct move for you.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

The biggest question looming since Boeing ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburgtwo days before Christmas was whether the longtime executive would receive severance.\n\nThe Chicago-based plane maker answered that question late Friday: No.\n\nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing said Muilenburg, whose departure from the company took effect Dec. 22 and was announced Dec. 23, is not entitled to any severance or separation payments in connection with his retirement'' after more than 30 years with Boeing.\n\nExecutive employment agreements are usually generous, with few reasons where severance isn't warranted. Former McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook, for example, received 26 weeks of pay after he was fired for violating company policy by having a consensual relationship with an employee. He did forfeit millions in stock options.\n\nBoeing said Muilenburg, who joined Boeing as an intern in 1985, will not receive any payment under the company's 2019 incentive plan, usually a key component of compensation. He forfeited stock awards valued at $14.6 million.\n\n'Jedi mind tricks': Boeing 737 Max emails show attempts to manipulate airlines, FAA\n\nHe will, however, receive long-term incentive compensation and retirement benefits covered by his contract. The value, according to Boeing: $62.2 million.\n\nMuilenburg also retains options to purchase nearly 73,000 shares of Boeing stock at $75.97, which vested in 2013. Boeing's stock closed Friday at $329.92. The stock was as high as $446 before the Max crisis.\n\nBoeing reveals new 'very disturbing' documents on 737 Max jetliner to FAA, Congress\n\nBoeing said incoming CEO David Calhoun, a Boeing board member who begins his new role Monday, will be paid a salary of $1.4 million and was issued $10 million in restricted stock units for money he gave up when he agreed to join Boeing.

Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nEditor's Note: An earlier version of this story was incorrect about RMDs as they relate to Roth 401(k)s.\n\nMany seniors have no choice but to tap their retirement savings the moment they leave their jobs. But what if you have another income source, such as part-time work or a recent inheritance, and don't need to touch your IRA or 401(k) for quite some time?\n\nHolding off on taking withdrawals from your retirement savings is a good choice for two reasons. First, the longer you keep your money invested, the more growth it can achieve. But just as importantly, you'll avoid the taxes that come with traditional retirement plan distributions.\n\nThere's just one problem: You can't leave your retirement plan untouched indefinitely. At a certain point, you'll be subject to what are known as required minimum distributions. RMDs are yearly minimum amounts that you're required to remove from your IRA or 401(k), and they're based on your account balance and life expectancy. If you're not familiar with RMDs, here are a few important things to know about them.\n\n1. You're on the hook once you turn 70 1/2\n\nIf you retire in your early or mid-60s, you don't have to worry about RMDs right away. That's because the requirement to take yearly withdrawals doesn't kick in until you turn 70 1/2. Furthermore, you don't actually have to take your first RMD that year, but rather, by April 1 of the following year. So if, for example, you turn 70 1/2 in May 2018, you can leave your money alone for the remainder of the year. You do, however, need to take that initial withdrawal by April 1, 2019.\n\n2. You'll pay taxes on your RMDs...\n\nJust because the IRS forces you to remove funds from your retirement plan doesn't mean it doesn't also take its share. Anytime you receive a traditional IRA or 401(k) withdrawal, whether by choice or not, that money is taxed as ordinary income -- meaning, at the highest possible rate. Be sure to plan for this expense so you're not overwhelmed by a huge tax bill after the fact.\n\n3. But you'll pay even more if you fail to take them\n\nAs much as it might pain you to pay taxes on the withdrawals you're forced to take, you'll lose out even further if you neglect to take your RMD in full. That's because the IRS will assess a whopping 50% penalty on whatever required funds don't end up leaving your account in time. For example, if your RMD for a given year is $8,000 and you don't take it, you'll fork over $4,000 to the IRS -- just that like. That's why it's crucial to pay attention to RMD deadlines. Though you get until April 1 of the year after you turn 70 1/2 to take your first withdrawal, all subsequent distributions must be taken by Dec. 31 on an annual basis.\n\n4. You can delay RMDs from your 401(k) if you're still working\n\nIf you're housing your retirement savings in a traditional IRA, you'll generally be subject to RMDs regardless of your employment status at the time. But if you reach 70 1/2 and are still working and have your savings in a 401(k), you can avoid RMDs for as long as you remain employed. You still need to meet a couple of criteria, though. First, you must be employed by the company sponsoring the plan your money is in, and second, you can't own 5% or more of that company. But if you satisfy these requirements, you get a pass on RMDs until you leave that job.\n\n5. You won't need to take RMDs if you have a Roth IRA\n\nMany savers shy away from Roth accounts during their working years because they don't offer an immediate tax break on contributions. But one major benefit of Roth IRAs, aside from tax-free withdrawals in retirement, is that they don't impose RMDs. Therefore, if you have a Roth IRA account and don't need the money in it, you let it sit and continue to grow. You can even leave it to your heirs, who will also get to enjoy tax-free distributions from that account.\n\nRMDs can really trip you up if you aren't careful. If you're approaching 70 1/2, be sure to read up on RMDs and plan for them appropriately so you're not left in a precarious financial situation later on.\n\nMore: How to make your 401(k) investment last in retirement\n\nMore: No time to relax: 4 common money hassles for retirees\n\nMore: 61% of retirement savers are making this costly mistake\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Civil rights attorney Roy L. Austin, Jr., who focused on policing in the Obama administration, first at the Justice Department and then at the White House, is Facebook's new vice president of civil rights charged with helping the social media giant curb the racial hatred and violence on its platforms that over the summer led to a month-long boycott by civil rights groups and major advertisers.\n\nAustin will establish a new civil rights organization inside Facebook, one of the key recommendations of an internal audit of Facebook's practices released in July which warned that Facebook's failure to rein in toxic speech, racism and misinformation could have serious repercussions on the presidential election.\n\nTechnology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it's important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it, Austin said in a statement.\n\nPressure on Facebook escalated amid national protests over racial injustice and police brutality after the death of George Floyd under a white officer's knee. The results of a years-long civil rights audit heightened scrutiny of the spread of racism and hate on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nFacebook diversity report:Efforts still failing Black and Hispanic employees, especially women\n\nHate speech, harassment of Black users:Civil rights groups call on Facebook to take immediate steps\n\nAustin will take on the role of vice president of civil rights and deputy general counsel starting Jan. 19 in Washington, D.C. where he will build a small team, Facebook said. He joins Facebook from the law firm of Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP, where he was a partner specializing in criminal defense and civil rights law.\n\nCivil rights advocate Laura Murphy who led the Facebook audit praised the appointment.\n\nFacebook will now be taking a systematic and structural approach to addressing the many civil rights concerns that I laid out in the Facebook Civil Rights Audit, she said in a statement provided by Facebook. Roy Austin is a great choice for this role; I worked with him extensively during his tenure at the White House. I urge Facebook to give him the latitude and resources to tackle the audit recommendations and any other civil rights issues that arise.\n\nThe audit called for Facebook to bring in an experienced civil rights executive to guide policies and vet products, steps the auditors said were long overdue.\n\nHundreds of companies, including top brands Unilever, Ford and Pfizer, pulled advertising from Facebook over the summer to protest the spread of racial hatred, white supremacy and violent threats on Facebook and Instagram. The boycott organized by civil rights leaders known as #StopHateForProfit followed a push back from Facebook employees who staged a virtual walkout.\n\nBlack users have grown increasingly frustrated with how Facebook deals with racially motivated hate speech against the Black community and the erasure of Black users' speech. They told USA TODAY harassment worsened as nationwide protests following Floyd's death in police custody drew renewed attention to historic racial inequities.\n\nOne of the problems, they complained, is the dearth of underrepresented minorities at Facebook, particularly in positions of influence. Despite repeated pledges to close the racial gap, 3.7% of Facebook's U.S. employees and 3% of senior executives are Black, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 2018 figures, the most recent data available.\n\nThe other is the company's policy of protecting all racial and ethnic groups equally, even if they do not face oppression or marginalization, centuries of systemic racism.\n\nFacebook while black: Talking about racism is censored as hate speech\n\nNeil Potts, public policy director at Facebook, told USA TODAY in 2019 that applying more nuanced rules to the daily tidal wave of content rushing through Facebook and its other apps would be challenging. Since then, Facebook has said it is taking steps to address mistakes in content moderation.\n\nAustin will report to Facebook's general counsel Jennifer Newstead.\n\nIt's hard to imagine anyone better qualified to help us strengthen and advance civil rights on our platform and in our company, she said in a statement.\n\nAustin began his career as a civil rights trial lawyer with the Justice Department. From 2014 to 2017, he worked on the White House Domestic Policy Council as deputy assistant to the president for the Office of Urban Affairs, Justice and Opportunity. In this position, Roy co-authored a report on big data and civil rights, worked with President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing and helped develop the Police Data Initiative.\n\nRashad Robinson, president of online racial justice organization Color of Change, said Austin's addition was long overdue.\n\nHe will bring deep expertise to a company that has demonstrated a disturbing lack of investment in understanding and tackling key civil rights issues, Robinson said in a statement.\n\nHe called on Facebook to give Austin the authority inside Facebook to make significant change.\n\nFacebook's top leaders must empower Austin to deliver the results our communities need, Robinson said.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg raked in more than $24.7 million in political contributions in the final quarter of 2019, bringing his total for the year to more than $76 million, his campaign announced Wednesday.\n\nButtigieg's campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, said in a statement that 326,000 people contributed to the campaign in the fourth quarter with an average donation of $33. For the year, he said the campaign received contributions from more than 733,000 people. And of the more than $76 million raised in 2019, 98% was donations of less than $200, Schmuhl also said.\n\nThe totals for the mayor, whose last day in office is Wednesday, underscores his position as one of the leading candidates in the Democratic presidential primary. Buttigieg has consistently placed fourth in most recent national polls while also polling at or near in the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the 2020 primary season.\n\nThese figures are even more astounding considering that Pete started this race less than a year ago as an unknown candidate, with just a few staffers and zero dollars in the bank, Schmuhl wrote in his memo announcing the fundraising totals.\n\nThe 2020 candidates:Who is running for president? An interactive guide\n\nMore:Buttigieg leads 2020 rivals in Wall Street contributions\n\nButtigieg on the issues:The candidate tells us his thoughts on health care, immigration, gun control and more\n\nThis quarter, Pete solidified himself as a top tier presidential candidate, not by tapping into the fundraising list or bank account of a sitting Senator or someone who had run for president before, but by speaking to voters who for too long have been let down by politicians in Washington and are looking for a better path forward, he wrote.\n\nCandidates' fundraising totals are crucial in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 as the presidential hopefuls race to win over the remaining undecided voters with outreach and advertising.\n\nSchmuhl said Buttigieg's resources have allowed him to open 35 offices with 100 organizers in Iowa and 65 offices with more than 500 staffers nationwide.\n\nButtigieg's fourth-quarter total reflected something of a rebound after raising just over $19 million in the previous quarter. While still a healthy total, that haul was a dip from the campaign's $24.8 million second quarter that helped propel Buttigieg to the front of the large Democratic field.\n\nButtigieg is the first candidate to announce his fundraising total for the last quarter of 2019 ahead of the Jan. 31 filing deadline. But other campaigns have hinted at where they expect to end up.\n\nWith about $17 million raised, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a good chunk behind where she was at the same point in the third quarter, when she brought in $24.6 million, according to an email her campaign sent to supporters last week. Warren has also dipped in recent polls after topping former Vice President Joe Biden, who has consistently led the race, in some national surveys.\n\nBiden's campaign said in an email that it expected to top the $21.5 million it raised in the second quarter, according to The New York Times.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is expected to post an haul likely to top Buttigieg's total thanks to a huge number of small donations, The Times reported.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang's campaign told Fox News it expects to report a fundraising total of more than $12.5 million, which would be at least a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2019.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe\n\nPete Buttigieg:I would not have wanted my son on Ukraine board\n\nExclusive:With 218 foreign policy endorsements, Buttigieg targets a big Biden asset
Jeff Zillgitt\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nMalcolm Brogdon was 23 years old at the 2016 NBA draft in June, played four years at Virginia and turned 24 on December 11.\n\nHe also didn't have the wow factor, lacking the athleticism and potential NBA teams crave in the draft. Before the draft, he was red-flagged because of a foot surgery during the 2011-12 college season, scaring teams from taking him in the first round.\n\nCombine those facts, and that's why he was chosen No. 36 in the second round by the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWow. Look at Brogdon now, producing and dunking on LeBron James and Kyrie Irving and averaging 8.5 points, 3.8 assists, 2.6 rebounds and shooting 41.3% on three-pointers.\n\nI've heard a lot about what second-round picks usually do – whether it's D-League or whether it's not playing – but for me, I have high expectations of myself regardless of where I'm picked, Brogdon said. I just wanted to have an impact for my team.\n\nWeek 9 NBA Rookie of the Year race: Bucks' Brogdon climbing\n\nJames Harden living 'a dream' in midst of magical season with Rockets\n\nFive NBA story lines to follow in 2017\n\nAmong rookies, Brogdon is first in assists per game; fourth in points per game; sixth in minutes per game (23.6), and first in three-point shooting percentage among players who play at least 15 minutes a game.\n\nWith guard Matthew Dellavedova (injured right hamstring) out, Bucks coach Jason Kidd has started Brogdon the past four games.\n\nBrogdon had 12 points, eight assists, six rebounds and no turnovers in a 105-104 victory against the New York Knicks Wednesday and became the first rookie this season to record a triple-double (15 points, 12 assists, 11 rebounds) in Saturday's 116-96 victory against the Chicago Bulls.\n\nHe just knows how to play, Kidd said. There's no panic in his game.\n\nHe is the steal of the draft – an example of a team with a need taking the right player for the right situation and creating the perfect match for both. Though it may have cost him draft spots and money in the short term, Brogdon used his lengthy college experience to his advantage.\n\nIt helps you mature and form an identity and know who you are coming into the highest level of basketball, he said. I didn't let it deter me at all or hurt my confidence. I'm a guy who's always been underrated and under-ranked. This is part of my path. I take it on with an underdog mentality.\n\nBrogdon entered the league NBA-ready, capable of playing both ends of the court. He is mature, smart, willing to learn and is more veteran than rookie.\n\nYou talk about someone who wants to be good, Kidd said. He works at his craft. You look at his basketball IQ. We trust him as a rookie offensive and defensively. He's taken the challenge to play at a high level and we're holding him accountable to that.\n\nBrogdon considered leaving Virginia after his redshirt junior season. But he was informed through diligent counsel that he might not be drafted in 2015 and was encouraged to return for his final season.\n\nWeek 9 NBA MVP race: Harden holds steady, Westbrook right behind\n\nWeek 9 NBA power rankings: Rockets, Jazz continue to rise\n\nRare is the NBA rookie with a college degree. Even rarer is the rookie with a master's degree. Brogdon has a history degree and advanced degree in public policy.\n\nHe is from a family of achievers. His mom, Jann Adams, is an associate professor of psychology and associate dean of the division of science and mathematics at Morehouse College. His father, Mitchell, and two brothers, Gino and John, have law degrees.\n\nIn interview after interview, teams were so impressed with Brogdon, they called his agent, Danielle Cantor, and told her similar versions of this:\n\nThat's the most impressive interview I've ever had, and He'll run for president someday.\n\nI knew those interviews were important because these teams don't just draft off skill on the court, he said. They draft in terms of character and how you carry yourself off the court.\n\nWhile at least one front-office exec was convinced Brogdon would go in the first round, he was available when Milwaukee picked at 36.\n\nI do think it's about placement, he said. It's about your skillset and how good you are but also who you play for and how your teammates take you under their wings.\n\nMy game from college has translated into the pros. I'm just most happy with my impact on the game defensively and offensively. All around, I've been able to grasp the concepts and the speed of the game pretty well.\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.
Bruce Udolf\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nFor too long, Democrats have allowed Republicans to run roughshod over them, the Constitution and the rule of law in this country. For three years, we have witnessed an American president repeatedly thumb his nose at what we thought were settled constitutional norms and traditions of public behavior and policy, and use his office to enrich himself, punish his perceived enemies and sell out his country to foreign adversaries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in this process, has compromised the values and principles that are the basis of the boldest social experiment in the history of humankind. He has aligned himself with corrupt, even murderous, dictators who have sought to undermine the freedoms and rights of Americans and their long-standing allies around the world. And in spite of his boastful campaign slogan, he has conducted himself in a manner that disgraces the greatness of America and what it symbolized to our fellow citizens of the world before he defiled it.\n\nTrump has been enabled by a cowardly class of Republican legislators who shamelessly stand mute as he and his minions allow foreign adversaries to corrupt our electoral process and to obstruct lawful investigations and congressional oversight. And rather than moving aggressively to hold the president accountable for his daily assault on our democracy and feeding off of racism in this country (if not out-and-out fomenting it), the Democrats have largely responded with timidity.\n\nClinton versus Trump impeachments\n\nUnderstandably, they were concerned that public opinion might overwhelmingly rally around Trump in an impeachment, as it did with President Bill Clinton. But the differences between those two matters couldn't be starker.\n\nThe Clinton case technically was based on allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with a private civil case. But in reality, it centered on disgraceful personal behavior — not crimes or conduct based on abuse of power as president. As Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said at the Clinton trial, When you hear somebody say, 'This is not about sex,' it's about sex.\n\nThe Trump case is rooted in alleged abuses of power of the office of the president. Moreover, while many Republicans have sought to trivialize this conduct as noncriminal in nature, that contention is wholly without merit.\n\nUnder Section 201 of our federal code, it is a crime for a public official to directly or indirectly, corruptly seek anything of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by that public official. Section 1951 makes it a crime to extort property from another through the use of fear of economic loss or under color of official right. Section 666 makes it a crime to corruptly solicit anything of value from any person intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any government business or transaction.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have been at a standoff over impeachment. McConnell promises to abide by the procedures adopted by the Senate in the Clinton trial. Let's hear opening statements first, he says, then we will consider whether to hear additional evidence. McConnell is essentially saying, Trust me, we'll hear witnesses just like we did in the Clinton matter.\n\nEditorial Board:If Donald Trump is 'perfect' on Ukraine, then let Senate impeachment trial hear witnesses\n\nBut why should Democrats trust him? McConnell, whose hypocrisy truly knows no bounds, is the same man who refused to even consider President Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, because he was nominated in the final year of Obama's term, eight months before an election. Now, in the final year of Trump's term, McConnell says he will move to confirm any Supreme Court candidate Trump may nominate.\n\nAs President George W. Bush once torturously tried to say, Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nHouse should subpoena Bolton\n\nThere are at least four witnesses who have direct knowledge of the circumstances of Trump's attempt to trade congressionally appropriated military aid for a Ukraine investigation of the Bidens: Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey and former national security adviser John Bolton. Trump has endeavored to prevent all of them from testifying, and McConnell says he's working with the White House on impeachment trial procedures.\n\nImpeachment trial: 6 Republican senators Trump and McConnell should worry about\n\nBolton now says he's prepared to testify in a Senate trial if he is subpoenaed. There is a way to give him that opportunity, even without his Senate testimony. House committees can continue their investigations and can subpoena other witnesses, including Bolton. Like a grand jury, the House can, if warranted, add other charges or co-conspirators in the equivalent of a superseding indictment.\n\nIt would be hard for Bolton to refuse to comply with a House subpoena, given his public expression of willingness to testify before the Senate.\n\nWere Bolton to testify truthfully and that testimony revealed to the public, which McConnell would be powerless to prevent, it would be much more difficult for the Senate majority leader to control his caucus. McConnell's senatorial house of cards has steadfastly served to protect the president, but it might begin to fold after Bolton's testimony. Even Trump's ardent public enablers privately appear to view his behavior as cringeworthy.\n\nI believe Speaker Pelosi has the judgment and the courage to put this strategy, and her party's mettle, to the test.\n\nBruce Udolf, a lawyer in South Florida, oversaw corruption investigations and prosecutions as a federal prosecutor in Miami, and was an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton.

Rachel Bovard\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nTwitter permanently banned the president of the United States from its platform on Friday last week. Within hours, a host of other platforms followed suit, banning either the president himself or hashtags and posts related to pro-Donald Trump topics: Twitch, Facebook and its photo-sharing service Instagram, Snapchat, Google's YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, Discord, and even Pinterest. Shopify announced it would no longer sell Trump campaign merchandise. The credit card processing company, Stripe, will no longer process its campaign donations.\n\nTens of thousands of right-leaning accounts across multiple platforms were also nuked. Within days, Apple and Google announced they would remove the popular conservative Twitter alternative, Parler, from their respective app stores. Hours later, Amazon Web Services stated they would no longer host the company.\n\nIn short, the Big Tech cartel threw off its cloak and bared its teeth, demonstrating to the world just how powerful it truly is. The crackdown that followed — on individuals, viewpoints, and businesses — was swift, severe, and possibly collusive.\n\nWho owns the public square?\n\nTech companies have justified all of this behavior as the necessary response to President Donald Trump and his supporters, whose posts could risk ... further incitement of violence. Such a justification assumes, however, that Trump himself actively incited the terrible violence at the Capitol last week. While one can disagree with the wisdom of his remarks and urging his supporters to march to the Capitol, they were, as multiple experts have pointed out, hardly an exhortation to violence.\n\nMoreover, if there is a new standard for social media which maintains that what is said on the platform can be responsible for future, offline harm — so much so that the platforms should take preemptive action to prevent it — what of the image of comedian Kathy Griffin holding a fake severed head of Trump; comments from Hillary Clinton that you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about; Sen. Cory Booker's (D-N.J.) calling activists to get up in the face of some congresspeople; or Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) telling supporters to absolutely harass members of the Trump administration?\n\nUnprecedented power:Section 230 protects Big Tech from lawsuits. But it was never supposed to be bulletproof.\n\nMany Black Lives Matter protests, which began peacefully, ended in violence, causing as much as $2 billion in damages across 140 cities and costing 9 lives. Has comparable action been taken against those users for any current incitement or future harm their posts may have caused?\n\nIf the social media companies are reversing their long-held position that what's said on their platform is not the same as what's done in the world, then they ought to be responsible for a heck of a lot else.\n\nThe double standard here is obvious, but even that is almost beside the point. Regardless of what one thinks of the outgoing president or his conduct, such apparently synchronized action against individuals and viewpoints should chill anyone who values the free speech, independent thought and diversity of views that form the bedrock of pluralistic societies.\n\nWhat we are witnessing is a crackdown on speech being led by a handful of corporations that now own the public square. The ability to speak, hear and make a living using the mainstream levers of the internet is quickly becoming no longer based solely on one's original expression or innovative ideas. Rather, it requires that you hold the same views as Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Jeff Bezos.\n\nLiving under a corporate plutocracy\n\nOur self-government has rapidly devolved into a corporate plutocracy where viewpoints deemed unacceptable by the lords of Silicon Valley are suspended and banned, their holders banished from participating in mainstream society. Even alternative avenues of speech, like Parler, with users who do not comport with a specific viewpoint will be cut off from the infrastructure required to reach a mainstream audience.\n\nSuzette Hackney:Place the blame where it belongs. Trump's rabid supporters, not antifa, stormed the Capitol.\n\nThis is hardly just about Trump, who is leaving office in a matter of days. If it were, the crackdown would be limited solely to him. Rather, it's about opportunists silencing political opposition from Republicans, conservatives, and anyone who ever donned a MAGA hat. Prominent Democrats, rather than debate their opponents, are now turning to Big Tech, asking that they be banned. It's wrong and its fundamentally un-American.\n\nIn America, the people rule. Not the mob, not the bureaucrats, and not the tech tyrants. The accountability for our self-government — including the accountability for those who violate our laws — rests in the institutions of justice and democracy; not in a corporate denial of service weaponized against citizens for wrong think.\n\nWhat we have experienced in the last week is a dangerous level of unaccountable corporate control that will not sustain a free society. Unchecked private power in lockstep with government partisans aiming to permanently enforce one viewpoint and to punish others will not unify, but further divide, radicalize, and destroy.\n\nRachel Bovard is the senior director of policy at the Conservative Partnership Institute and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

Arlington\n\nOne of the most important species of fish in the ocean's food chain is getting a close look to help determine the health of its population. Two arms of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission are working on an assessment of the menhaden stock. The commission is an interstate board that regulates coastal fisheries. Menhaden are small, schooling fish that play a critical role in the ocean's health because they are important food for whales, larger fish, seabirds and others. They're also harvested commercially for use as fish oil and aquaculture feed. The Atlantic States commission says the health of the menhaden population will be the subject of meetings in Arlington in early April intended to inform the management of the Atlantic menhaden fishery.
Andrew Tilghman\n\nMilitary Times\n\nRetired Army Gen. David Petraeus says the U.S. should adopt a new policy that expands air strikes in Afghanistan, targeting a resurgent Taliban and an emerging threat posed by the Islamic State group.\n\nWe should unleash our airpower in support of our Afghan partners in the same way that we support our Iraqi and Syrian partners against extremists, Petraeus wrote in an op-ed published by The Washington Post on Thursday night.\n\nWe do not need a big U.S. troop buildup in Afghanistan, but we should take the gloves off of those who are there, Petreaus, also the former CIA director, wrote with co-author Michael O'Hanlon, a military expert with the Brookings Institution.\n\nWe have the tools in place to step up our game considerably, they wrote.\n\nDelegates from four nations meet to discuss Afghan peace\n\nThe piece highlights Pentagon data showing that about 400 U.S. and coalition aircraft missions dropped ordinance in Afghanistan last year. That's down from 1,100 in 2014.\n\nPetraeus retired in 2011 after serving as the top commander in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011 as well as the top commander in Iraq from 2007 to 2008.\n\nThe Obama administration's current policy in Afghanistan authorizes U.S. air strikes to target the remnants of al-Qaeda. Only under limited circumstances will U.S. aircraft hit the more localized Taliban insurgent group or Islamic State militants.\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. can provide air strikes targeting any insurgents who threaten the U.S. force of about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan or in situations where the Afghan military is judged to be in extremis or facing a critical and immediate threat, defense officials say.\n\nFormer CIA Director David Petraeus testifies before Benghazi committee\n\nThe Obama administration's policy predates the recent growth in Afghanistan's faction of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. U.S. officials characterize Islamic State there as operationally emergent and estimate there to be about 1,000 to 3,000 militants on the ground in Afghanistan, particularly in Nangarhar Province, which abuts the Pakistan border.\n\nArmy. Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told reporters in December that he focuses on any and all insurgents who threaten U.S. troops.\n\nI have what I need to go after any insurgent group, terrorist group that is going to cause force-protection issues for the coalition, Campbell told reporters Dec. 18 at Forward Operating Base Fenty in Nangarhar Province.\n\nI look at it from a force protection nexus right now, to make sure I don't let ISIL, Taliban, Daesh, Haqqani, you name it, come after Fenty where you are today, Campbell said.\n\nIn October, at the urging of his military commanders, President Obama announced that he would keep troop levels steady through most of next year. By the end of 2016, rather than draw down to a Kabul-only U.S. military presence of about 1,000 troops as previously planned, Obama decided the U.S. will maintain 5,500 troops in Kabul and Bagram.\n\nTop U.S. general may seek more troops for Afghanistan
Vice President-elect Kamala Harris called out President Donald Trump during a campaign rally on Sunday for pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to change the 2020 election results.\n\nHave y'all heard about that recorded conversation? Well, it was certainly the voice of desperation, most certainly that, Harris told onlookers during a drive-in rally in Savannah, Georgia. And it was a bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States.\n\nDuring an hour-long conversation on Saturday with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, the president repeatedly asked for the state election official to find enough votes to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden in Georgia, according to a recording of thephone call obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nHarris, a California Democratic senator, returned to the Peach State for a second event in as many months to charge up voters on behalf of challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who are looking to defeat Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelley Loeffler, respectively.\n\nThe appearance is part of a last-minute effort to boost Democratic chances in Tuesday's runoff elections, which will determine control of the Senate. Harris's visit comes a day before President-elect Joe Biden is set to appear in Atlanta to stump for the two Democratic candidates.\n\nBiden and Harris stopping in Georgia underscores how important the state is for Democrats in setting the policy table in 2021.\n\nThe 117th Congress saw 50 Republicans sworn into the Senate this week, along with 48 members who will caucus with Democrats.\n\nIf Ossoff and Warnock win, Harris would be the tie-breaking vote as vice president, and would give the incoming administration's priorities an edge. If either challenger loses, however, Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would retain control.\n\nHarris tied the outcome of the runoff races to putting closure on 2020, which was defined by the coronavirus pandemic infecting millions of Americans, killing more than 350,000 and destabilizing the economy.\n\nIt is not over until we get through with the end of Tuesday, then we can truly celebrate the new year, she said.\n\nDuring the rally, the incoming vice president, who will be the first woman and woman of color to hold the office, recited some of Biden's priorities, such as protecting the Affordable Care Act and providing people with a higher COVID-19 relief check of $2,000.\n\nHarris spent much of her speech, however, talking about efforts to suppress the vote in previous Georgia elections, and subsequent lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results.\n\nWhy are such powerful people trying to make it difficult for us to vote, she said. Because they know our power, they know when we vote things change and they know when we vote we win.\n\nGeorgia has been a reliable GOP stronghold for decades, but it surprised political observers when it went for a Democrat for the first time since 1992. Many point to an upswing of voter registration, in addition to higher turnout in urban centers and burgeoning suburbs, led by grassroots organizers as the source of Biden's win.\n\nAs a resultof the president's unexpected loss in the state, Trump has had sharp exchanges with Georgia's top Republican state officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nWhen the president swung through the state in early December he vowed to return for a big rally on election eve, but also took a swing at GOP state officials in the process saying how he was treated badly by the governor and Raffensperger.\n\nBut Trump reiterated how there must be a massive victory for Perdue and Loeffler, who have echoed the president's unfounded claims of a mass election fraud in the election.\n\nOn Sunday, the president continued to hammer Raffensperger, saying how the GOP secretary of state was, unwilling, or unable, to answer questions about various unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.\n\nHe has no clue! Trump tweeted.\n\nRespectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true, Raffensperger responded. The truth will come out,\n\nDemocrats point to GOP infighting as a good sign, coupled with higher state average turnout so far in areas such as Fulton, DeKalb and Cobb Counties, which were strongholds of Black voters who helped win the state for Biden.\n\nMore than 2.5 million people have already cast a ballot in the runoffs either through early in-person or by mail, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.\n\nThat's less than the roughly 3.2 million Georgia voters who had cast an early ballot at this point ahead of the November 2020 election, but Democrats are optimistic given the high early turnout in their congressional districts compared to Republican areas.\n\nDuring her speech, Harris saidGeorgia is the center of not just who will control the Senate in 2021, but is part of a national fight about the legitimacy of U.S. elections.\n\nYou will make a decision about who is holding these most powerful positions that will chart the course for Georgia families and those across the country, she said. So I'm here to thank you on behalf of Joe and myself for what you did in November, and I'm here to ask you to do it again.
AP\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Latest on the suspension of Minnesota Gophers center Reggie Lynch over a new 2016 sexual assault allegation (all times local):\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nMinnesota athletic director Mark Coyle says basketball player Reggie Lynch has been suspended from competition.\n\nCoyle says Lynch remains a member of the team for now.\n\nThe decision to suspend Lynch from playing for the Gophers reportedly came from the university's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action office after a woman accused him in an April 2016 sexual assault.\n\nNeither Coyle nor coach Richard Pitino would discuss the specifics of Lynch's case, citing student privacy.\n\nLynch was also suspended during the 2016 offseason, pending a police investigation into a different allegation of sexual assault. Lynch was cleared in that case and reinstated to the team before last season. He was named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year last season.\n\nThe Gophers host Indiana on Saturday.\n\n___\n\n6:28 a.m.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota center Reggie Lynch faces suspension over an alleged violation of the school's sexual misconduct policy.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star Tribune and the St. Paul Pioneer Press report that Lynch was accused last fall by a woman who said he assaulted her in his dorm room in April 2016. The newspapers cite an investigative report by the school's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Office that said Lynch is suspended until 2020 unless he appeals.\n\nNeither newspaper detailed the alleged incident.\n\nThe Star Tribune said neither Lynch nor his attorney returned calls seeking comment. The Associated Press sent an email to a university spokesman and left a phone message at what appeared to be Lynch's parents' home early Friday.\n\nThe 23-year-old Lynch is averaging 10 points, eight rebounds and four blocks.
WASHINGTON – Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., an Iraq War veteran who lost both of her legs in the conflict, slammed remarks by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who suggested Democrats are in love with terrorists for criticizing President Donald Trump's Iran policy.\n\nAsked about the comments, which drew strong backlash from Democrats, in a Thursday evening interview on CNN Right Now.\n\nI'm not going to dignify that with a response, Duckworth said. I left parts of my body in Iraq fighting terrorists. I don't need to justify myself to anyone.\n\nDuckworth's helicopter was hit by an RPG during a deployment to Iraq for the Army National Guard in 2004, causing her to lose her legs and partial use of her right arm, according to her Senate biography.\n\nCollins, a Georgia Republican, made the comments Wednesday night during a discussion with Fox Business host Lou Dobbs about escalating tensions with Iran and Democrats' legislation to require Trump to get congressional approval before taking further military action against the country.\n\nMore:Iran got its revenge for Qasem Soleimani's killing but the US Navy is still a target\n\nMore:Iran plane crash: U.S., Canada say intel shows Ukraine jet downed by Iranian missile\n\nHow venal, how vapid can one party become? asked Dobbs, after mentioning the measure, which the House of Representatives passed on Thursday evening.\n\n(House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi does it again, and her Democrats fall right in line. One, they are in love with terrorists. They mourn (Qasem) Soleimani more than they mourn our Gold Star families who are the ones who suffered under Soleimani, Collins said of the top Iranian general killed last week in an airstrike ordered by Trump.\n\nHe also accused Pelosi of hypocrisy for not taking a similar stand against the Obama administration's airstrikes in Libya in 2011.\n\nMore:House votes to limit Trump's ability to wage war with Iran after Soleimani killing\n\nDuckworth was also asked about Collins' remarks about Gold Star families, to which she answered, I'm disgusted. I would never, ever use Gold Star families, military men and women, or their families, as any pawn in any political game.\n\nOf Soleimani's killing, she said, No, I am not sad that this man is dead. I am glad that he's gone to meet his maker, before adding she believed U.S. forces in the Middle East had been put in greater danger because of an escalation in tensions after Soleimani's killing.\n\nDuckworth also addressed the comments in a Twitter thread posted on Thursday.\n\nIn America, even people who disagree with the President vehemently can still love this country, she wrote, along with a clip of Collins' appearance on Dobbs' show. I love my country just as much as anyone on the other side of the aisle—it's why I volunteered to serve in uniform, unlike Donald Trump.\n\nContributing: William Cummings
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Wednesday again threatened to cut off federal funds to fight California wildfires, saying the money is being wasted.\n\nBillions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen, Trump tweeted. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., responded that Trump's threat insults the memory of scores of Americans who perished in wildfires last year & thousands more who lost their homes.\n\nPelosi's tweet said House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, another Californian, must join me to condemn & call on POTUS to reassure millions in CA that our govt will be there for them in their time of need.\n\nTrump has threatened before to order the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cut off money for California fires, but the administration has not published an order.\n\nCritics on Twitter questioned whether Trump could legally withhold FEMA money that has been appropriated.\n\nState officials accused Trump of playing politics with the California wildfires and said he does not understand the issues involved in fighting fires. They questioned whether Trump is going after California because it is a Democratic state.\n\nBrian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters, cited the damage in and around Paradise, California, and said the people there have only begun to be able to rebuild their lives. ... Now, they find themselves being used as pawns in the president's ill-informed chest-pounding at their expense.\n\nRice said Trump is wrong to blame the fires on state forest management.\n\nWhile forest health can be a contributing factor in large fires, he noted, more than 60 percent of these forests are controlled by the federal government, not California.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has criticized Trump over firefighting policy, tweeted after the president's shutdown speech Tuesday that Trump's go-to is governing by fear and division.\n\nTuesday, the newly inaugurated Newsom proposed $105 million in new spending to prevent, fight and escape wildfires in the wake of one of the state's worst fire seasons.\n\nTrump has declared policy decisions only to change or modify them days later. Examples include the slowed-down withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.
Todd Campbell\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nSince 1979, the average inflation-adjusted income of the top 1% crowd has grown by 200.5%, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute. Has your income kept pace? Read on to see how much you need to earn to be in the top 1% in your state, and the one thing that could be more important than a high income to your future financial security.\n\nDigging into the data\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, the top 1% of income-earning Americans captured at least half of all income growth in 24 states, and as a result, it's gotten more difficult to reach that top-income-earner status.\n\nNationally, a family's income has to be at least $389,436 to qualify as being in the top 1%; however, your annual earnings need to be significantly higher than that to achieve this status in 12 states.\n\nFor instance, a family's income needs to eclipse $659,979 in Connecticut to reach the top 1%, due in large part to the state being home to many high-paying insurance and hedge-fund jobs. If you live in Connecticut's Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk area, then your income would have to be above the $1 million mark to be in the top 1%. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the average income of Connecticut's top 1% income earners is a nation-leading $2.4 million.\n\nAchieving 1% status is also tough in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. In New Jersey and New York, your family income needs to be north of $547,737 and $517,557, respectively. In Massachusetts, you need to be pulling in $539,055 to call yourself part of the 1%. To see the full list, click here.\n\nGetting to financial security\n\nIf you don't earn a 1%-worthy income, a disciplined savings strategy can still allow you to retire with an envy-inspiring nest egg.\n\nMany workers can participate in tax-advantaged retirement savings plans offered by their employers. Yet, large numbers of Americans are failing to make the most of these powerful tools. According to Transamerica, the average worker is contributing only 8% of their income to retirement savings plans every year, and just 12% of participants are maxing out their contribution to these plans annually. Further, Vanguard reports that nearly one-third of participants are saving 4% or less of their income in 401(k) or 403(b) plans.\n\nIn 2017, up to $18,000 of earned income can be set aside in a 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan, and if you're over 50, that figure increases to $24,000. Given those contribution statistics and these plan limits, most Americans aren't coming anywhere close to saving as much as they could be.\n\nSimilarly, many Americans aren't making the most of IRAs, either. Additional dollars can be invested pre-tax in a traditional IRAs, or after-tax in a Roth IRA, depending on your income. People under 50 can contribute up to $5,500 of income to either a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, and people over 50 can contribute $6,500 to either of those plans in 2017.\n\nWorkers who are self-employed could be under-saving too. Self-employed individuals can invest pre-tax earnings in retirement plans, including solo 401(k) plans and SEP IRAs.\n\nIn 2017, individuals can save the lesser of 100% of their earnings or $18,000 ($24,000 if over 50) in a solo 401(k) as an employee, plus they can contribute an additional 25% as an employer as profit-sharing, up to a combined maximum of $54,000. Solo 401(k) plans allow for the $6,000 catch-up contribution too, if you're over 50.\n\nIf you're moonlighting, you can max out your retirement plan at work and set up a SEP IRA to save your self-employment income. You can contribute lessor of 25% of your compensation, or $54,000 to a SEP IRA in 2017.\n\nObviously, there are a lot of savings opportunities available that can be used to amass wealth, however, one word of caution. Calculating the contribution amounts across multiple retirement plans can get complex, so sit down with your tax professional to discuss your options before making your contributions.\n\nTying it together\n\nA high income provides short-term financial security, but long-term financial security depends a lot on how much money you're saving every year. Ultimately, the percentage of your income that you save every year can be a much better indicator of your future financial independence than your income in any one given year.\n\nIn order to get to the point where you're saving the maximum allowed, it can help to take small steps. If you can't hit your maximum immediately, increase your contribution rate by 1% to 2% per year until you hit the limit. This strategy won't get you to financial freedom as quickly as maxing out contributions immediately, but it can help you avoid busting your budget.\n\nAlso, don't forget about the importance of saving sooner, rather than later. Due to compound interest, saving more money earlier in your career can have a big impact on your retirement savings; especially if that money is being invested in assets that can appreciate, such as stocks. For example, a person contributing 20% of their family's $75,000 in income from age 30 to age 65 could end up with a nest egg valued at $1.67 million, assuming a hypothetical 6% annual return.\n\nThe $15,834 Social Security bonus you could be missing\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known Social Security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $15,834 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

Now that Georgians have kicked Kelly Loeffler to the curb, the WNBA needs to do the same.\n\nYes, payback is a large part of the reason, and I'll get to that. But this is also about business, and the WNBA can no longer ignore the fact that Loeffler is a liability. An even greater one than the Atlanta Dream's co-owner already was these past few months, given that whatever clout or cachet Loeffler might have brought to the league as a U.S. Senator is now gone.\n\nEven in a pandemic, when Americans' minds were obviously on other things, the WNBA showed signs of both strength and drawing power last summer. The league got more airtime than ever before, and ratings were up. The players' social justice work, and the recognition that this has been a focus of theirs for years, won them new fans and prompted others to take a second look.\n\nThe WNBA needs to build on that, and Loeffler's continued ownership stake in the Atlanta Dream will only detract from those efforts. Just look at some of the responses to the Dream's tweet on Wednesday morning asking all those who are praising WNBA players now to continue showing their support next season.\n\nLove the team and the players but can't support you as long @SenatorLoeffler is an owner, one said.\n\nLet's say I wanted to buy some gear for myself and my ladies as a big-time thank you for using your platform and voices in a major way … how much of that money does Kelly see (fingers crossed, 'please say 0, please say 0')? wrote another.\n\nI hope the Dream goes to LeBron. Y'all deserve better than Loeffler, said still another.\n\nLoeffler's toxic effect won't just go away, making her a drag on both the Dream and the WNBA. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert tried to split hairs last summer, saying the league wouldn't try to force out Loeffler because she wasn't involved in the team's day-to-day operations.\n\nBut that distinction will be lost to the general public. It's not the depth of Loeffler's involvement that's at issue. It's that she's involved, period. There is no amount of distance the WNBA or the Dream can put between themselves and Loeffler that will make people forget they are intertwined.\n\nBesides, from the simple financial perspective, there will never be a better time for the Dream to be shopped, whether it's the team as a whole or Loeffler's 49 percent stake.\n\nAfter it became clear Tuesday night that the Rev. Raphael Warnock was going to defeat Loeffler, LeBron James Tweeted, Think I'm gone put together an ownership group for The Dream. Whose in?\n\nNow, it's not clear if James can actually own an WNBA team while he is still an active NBA player, given the ties between the leagues and restrictions in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement. But James has a lot of friends, and they've already proven they can get creative when it comes to setting up business endeavors that intersect and overlap with the NBA.\n\nJames' idea drew quick support. Mookie Betts of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Pro Football Hall of Famer Champ Bailey and World Cup champion Abby Wambach were among the famous names to express interest in joining him.\n\nIf James is serious, Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver would be doing the WNBA a disservice by not taking advantage of his significant spotlight.\n\nThe WNBA is almost 25 years old, and it does not need any man to be its savior. Ask those who know the game – really know the game – and they'll vouch for the WNBA's level of play. But women's sports still struggle for attention and coverage, and James would make the league impossible to ignore for the immediate future.\n\nAnd for the Neanderthals who love to disparage women's sports, it would be one hell of a clapback for one of the greatest to ever play the game to say he believes so strongly in the WNBA – on and off the court -- that he's willing to put his money behind it.\n\nThe WNBA didn't start this fight, Loeffler did. It's funny how she didn't object when WNBA players protested policy brutality of Black and brown men and women back in 2016. Nor did she say anything publicly when the WNBA partnered with Planned Parenthood.\n\nOnly when it became politically expedient did Loeffler take a blowtorch to the WNBA players and their causes.\n\nShe mischaracterized the Black Lives Matter movement and objected to the players spotlighting the Say Her Name campaign last season. When WNBA players called on her to sell the Dream, Loeffler styled herself as a victim – apparently forgetting that objecting to what someone is saying is not the same as preventing someone from speaking.\n\nAnd when she was forced into a runoff against Warnock, Loeffler doubled down, waging a campaign steeped in both racism and elitism.\n\nBut Loeffler and her hateful rhetoric were rejected in historic fashion. Warnock will be the second Black Senator from the South, and only the 11th in the nation's history.\n\nThe WNBA needs to follow suit. Loeffler isn't just a bad owner. She's bad for the WNBA's business.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.
WASHINGTON – Democratic lawmakers said they were left in the dark as President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike Thursday night that killed a powerful Iranian military leader and warned it could lead to an escalation of hostilities between the United States and a powerful adversary.\n\nAmerican leaders' highest priority is to protect American lives and interests, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement following news of Commander Qasem Soleimani's death. But we cannot put the lives of American servicemembers, diplomats and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions.\n\nAs head of Iran's elite Quds Force, part of the country's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Corps, Soleimani has been linked to acts of terrorism against American interests.\n\nThe Defense Department said the air strike at Baghdad's international airport was conducted because Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\n\nThe 62-year-old military commander played a key role in expanding Iran's influence and military reach in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. He was widely viewed as one of Iran's most powerful men and, at home, a heroic national figure who was standing up to Trump's maximum pressure Iran strategy that includes stinging economic sanctions and confrontational rhetoric and military deployments.\n\nMost Democrats agreed on the threat he posed but said the president's action bordered on recklessness.\n\nTroop movement:US to send 3,000 more soldiers to the Middle East in the wake of Qasem Soleimani killing\n\nRather than achieving the stated intent of deterring additional attacks by Iran, I am concerned the Trump Administration significantly increased the likelihood for direct conflict, and, with it, the risks to Americans and our national interests, said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. Killing Soleimani in this manner strengthens the hardliners in Iran and increases the likelihood that Iran's proxies will be triggered into action.\n\nRobert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told MSNBC, he wouldn't at all lament the death of Soleimani but wanted answers from the administration on the overall strategy.\n\nWhat we cannot accept is a march to an unauthorized war, Menendez said.\n\nAttack fallout:Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vows vengeance for Gen. Qasem Soleimani's death\n\nTrump told reporters said he was trying to stop an escalation of conflict.\n\nWe took action last night to stop a war, Trump said. We did not take action to start a war.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, who sits on both the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, introduced a war powers resolution to force a debate and vote in Congress on whether to approve further hostilities with Iran.\n\nFor years, I've been deeply concerned about President Trump stumbling into a war with Iran. We're now at a boiling point, and Congress must step in before Trump puts even more of our troops in harm's way, he said in a statement.\n\nTrump's refusal to share information with congressional leaders prior to the air strike was reminiscent of how the president handled the raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October. Trump decided not to notify congressional leaders before that military action because he was concerned the information would be divulged.\n\nThere's no country in the world that leaks like we do, he said at the time time. And Washington is a leaking machine.\n\nWhile condemning Soleimani as a notorious terrorist, Democrat Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., slammed Trump's decision not to notify key members of Congress beforehand.\n\nThe need for advanced consultation and transparency with Congress was put in the Constitution for reason, he said on the Senate floor. The framers of the Constitution gave war powers to the legislature and made the executive the commander in chief for the precise reason of forcing the two branches of government to consult with one another when it came to matters of war and peace.\n\nDetails revealed:What we know about the strike that killed Iranian military leader Gen. Qasem Soleimani\n\nMost GOP lawmakers applauded the president's action.\n\nIran' s master terrorist is dead, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor. For too long, this evil man operated without constraint, and countless innocents have suffered for it. Now his terrorist leadership has been ended.\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. posted a photo on Instagram of him with the president at Mar-a-Lago with the message: A memorable and historic evening at The Winter White House. Proud of our President!\n\nAn aide to Pelosi said she spoke to Defense Secretary Mark Esper Thursday around 9:40 p.m. after she issued her statement critical that there had been no consultation. The aide would not disclose the details of the phone call but said afterward that it lasted 13 minutes. The aide also said there's been no update on a request for a congressional briefing at this time.\n\nOne Democratic lawmaker, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, implied that Trump, who is facing an impeachment trial in the Senate, ordered the airstrike as a distraction.\n\nReal question is, will those with congressional authority step in and stop him? I know I will, she wrote on Twitter.\n\nOmar is one of three Muslims in Congress, along with Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and André Carson of Indiana.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has long advocated for troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, issued a series of tweets demanding that Congress be involved in the U.S. policy going forward and that a war with Iran that lacks congressional authority is a recipe for feckless intermittent eruptions of violence w/ no clear mission for our soldiers,\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, Nicholas Wu
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says he is not celebrating or feeling pride in banning President Donald Trump but made the decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter.\n\nTwitter, which had locked Trump out of his account for inflammatory posts after it said he incited supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, permanently banned him two days later.\n\nLate Wednesday, Dorsey opened up in a series of tweets detailing his reasoning on why this was the right decision for Twitter.\n\nWe faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety, Dorsey wrote. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\n\nThe tweets underscored the growing discomfort felt by social media leaders and users alike with a handful of corporations having so much control over the nation's online conversation.\n\nTwitter dumps Trump:President Donald Trump permanently banned from Twitter over risk he could incite violence\n\nMost Americans support Twitter Trump ban:Trump's permanent suspension from Twitter after Capitol attack supported by most Americans\n\nDorsey said Wednesday he regretted having to take these actions and warned it set a dangerous precedent.\n\n(They) fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation, he tweeted.\n\nThe check on that power has always been that users had the freedom to join another social media platform, Dorsey said.\n\nBut all of the major social media platforms – Facebook, Google's YouTube, Snap – have now banned the president, too. Snap said late Wednesday that it would make its ban permanent.\n\nThis concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet tool providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous. I do not believe this was coordinated. More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others, Dorsey wrote.\n\nThroughout Trump's presidency, social media companies have wrestled with how to moderate one of their most popular and powerful users.\n\nTime and again, Trump tested the boundaries of what he could say on the platform, violating Twitter's rules against election misinformation, glorifying violence and falsehoods about COVID-19.\n\nTrump's suspension escalated grievances from the political right that the nation's leading social media companies censor and silence conservatives.\n\nTwitter may ban me for this but I willingly accept that fate: Your decision to permanently ban President Trump is a serious mistake, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key ally of the president, tweeted at the time. The Ayatollah can tweet, but Trump can't. Says a lot about the people who run Twitter.\n\nThis moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet, Dorsey tweeted. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same.
Roger Yu\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nA Bloomberg News editor in its Washington, D.C. office has quit over the news agency's policy of not covering its owner, Michael Bloomberg, who may become a presidential candidate.\n\nKathy Kiely, who stepped down on Sunday as Washington news director for Bloomberg Politics, said Wednesday she couldn't continue her job of editing political stories if Bloomberg News continues to refrain from reporting and writing about the former New York City mayor as he mulls a possible bid for the presidency. Kiely previously worked as an editor at USA TODAY.\n\nI don't think it's a question of if he runs, Kiely said. But by putting his name out there, he's already a player. It's already a big story, so I think it's important to cover it aggressively.\n\nOn Jan. 23, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg has told advisers to come up with plans for a potential independent campaign in this year's presidential race.\n\nBloomberg News has published stories in recent days about the Times report, crediting the Times and other news outlets. But Bloomberg News has had a longstanding policy of not pursuing originally reported stories about its parent company, Bloomberg L.P., or its billionaire owner, who founded the financial data and news provider in 1981 after a career on Wall Street. Bloomberg's name also doesn't appear on Bloomberg News' billionaire index even though his wealth is estimated to be as much as $50 billion.\n\nBloomberg LP is a closely held entity with no obligation to divulge proprietary data, according to Bloomberg Way, its editorial guidebook. Bloomberg News doesn't originate stories about the company. Bloomberg should be included, upon approval of a standards editor, in cases where omitting the company from a broader story would be misleading or make the story incomplete...When others report about Bloomberg, we should summarize what their stories say, and the company should be given an opportunity to comment.\n\nWe've covered the speculation every day since the Times story was published, Ty Trippet, Bloomberg News spokesman said in a statement.

Bob Jordan\n\nAsbury Park (N.J.) Press\n\nTRENTON, N.J. — Minimum-wage workers in 14 states are celebrating New Year's raises, but in New Jersey unintended consequences from a constitutional amendment tie increases to the inflation rate.\n\nBackers of the 2013 amendment heralded the immediate $1-an-hour raise it created and expected automatic increases every Jan. 1. But New Jersey's minimum wage is staying at $8.38 an hour in 2016 because an inflation index didn't rise.\n\nThat means New Jersey's lowest paid workers lag compared with a $10 minimum taking effect in Massachusetts and California and the phasing in of $15 minimums in several large cities. New York is getting a $9 minimum, up from $8.75. Pennsylvania remains at $7.25.\n\nNew Jersey legislators took a strong first step by empowering voters to raise the minimum wage in 2013, said Rob Duffey, spokesman for the advocacy group New Jersey Working Families. But the simple fact is that an hourly wage of $8.38 won't even cover the basics in New Jersey, much less sustain a family.\n\nNew Year brings new laws around the nation\n\nA higher minimum has a ripple effect, pushing pay for other hourly workers higher, he said. Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, but state and local rates prevail if higher.\n\nDemocrats in New Jersey proposed the 2013 constitutional amendment, which business leaders opposed but voters overwhelmingly approved, for a $1 increase and yearly cost-of-living increases. So far, it hasn't been much of a win for the estimated 250,000 workers who are paid the minimum or close to it.\n\nLast year, they received a 13-cent raise based on the Consumer Price Index, measured from August to August, but no new boost is in store now because the calculation for 2016 declined slightly, by 0.28%.\n\nA New Jerseyan working at the minimum wage 40 hours a week every week of the year earns $17,430.\n\nThose workers must spend disproportionate amounts of their paychecks on rising-cost basic necessities like housing and food, components of the all-items CPI, said Jon Whiten of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal research group. Federal figures show food prices rose by 1.6% from August 2014 to August 2015 and the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose by 1% from 2014 to 2015.\n\nThis lack of a bump in the wage floor is a sobering reminder that too many working New Jerseyans are being left behind due to an inadequate minimum wage, Whiten said.\n\nAlthough the change was enshrined in the constitution, another adjustment could be achieved with a referendum or through the New Jersey Legislature. Lawmakers included language in the amendment that would free them to raise the minimum wage by statute in the future, but Gov. Chris Christie is unlikely to go along.\n\nThe Republican governor, who is running for the GOP presidential nominatinon, said he was tired of hearing about the minimum wage when Democrats nationally made it a topic in the 2014 midterm elections.\n\n$15 minimum wage could spread in 2016\n\nI'm tired of hearing about the minimum wage. I really am. I don't think there's a mother or a father sitting around the kitchen table tonight in America saying, 'You know, honey, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage, my God, all of our dreams would be realized,'  he said.\n\nDemocratic leadership in the state Legislature has shown little appetite for revisiting the issue.\n\nMy thoughts when they first put that on the ballot was that it was not really a proper way to legislate, to make changes through the state constitution, said Carl Golden, senior contributing analyst with the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University in Galloway, N.J. Now the inflation index didn't go up, and therein lies the problem for the proponents. There's less flexibility and ability to pivot when you enshrine something into the constitution.\n\nBernie Sanders says democratic socialism is about economic fairness\n\nState Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester, N.J., told a group of business leaders in March that he is opposed to legislation allowing municipalities to set their own minimums. He hasn't responded to inquiries on his position on another statewide change.\n\nMeanwhile, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will lead efforts for a minimum wage hike for all New York state workers to a phased-in $15 an hour. Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and two more California cities have set increases in stages to $15 an hour.\n\nActivists also are waging a campaign to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Christie and the other Republican candidates for president have dismissed that as an unwanted mandate for businesses, and Democratic frontunner Hillary Clinton says $12 an hour is a better goal.\n\nIf you go to $12, it would be the highest historical average we've ever had, Clinton said in a November Democratic debate, expressing skepticism about going higher.\n\nFollow Bob Jordan on Twitter: @bobjordanAPP\n\nRelated:\n\nWages: We were better off 10 years ago\n\nFast-food workers strike, seeking $15 wage, political muscle\n\nStates with widest gaps between rich, poor
Fredreka Schouten, and Christopher Schnaars\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Corporations with big interests in federal policy contributed millions to help underwrite President Trump's recent inauguration, federal records show.\n\nPfizer, Dow Chemical and Bank of America gave $1 million apiece to the inaugural committee, which raised private funds for the balls, receptions, parade and other events celebrating Trump's Jan. 20 swearing-in. More than two dozen companies have reported giving a little more than $7 million total through Dec. 31, a USA TODAY tally of recently filed lobbying reports show.\n\nInaugural organizers have said they collected about $100 million for last month's event — a record sum that's nearly double the $53 million in private money President Obama took in for his first inauguration. Obama did not accept corporate donations for the 2009 event but did take corporate funds for his second inauguration in 2013.\n\nA full accounting of Trump's inaugural fundraising and spending isn't due until April, but recent filings with Congress from lobbyists and the companies that employ them offer a snapshot of the efforts by corporate America to support Trump once he captured the White House.\n\nPfizer, which spent nearly $9.8 million on federal lobbying last year, made its $1 million inaugural donation on Dec. 21, records show.\n\nCompany spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said Pfizer has contributed to inaugural committees on both sides of the aisle in the past and decided to make a financial contribution to the presidential inaugural committee this time around.\n\nPfizer did not donate to Obama's 2013 inauguration, according to public records, and Castillo declined to discuss why the company did not provide financial support then.\n\nIndustries are bracing for big change under the Trump administration — from moves to roll back so-called Dodd-Frank regulations on the financial sector to efforts to drive down drug prices. Shortly before he took office, Trump said pharmaceutical companies were getting away with murder and pledged that he would allow Medicare, the federal insurance system for the disabled and elderly, to negotiate prices with drug makers.\n\nIn a Jan. 31 meeting with pharmaceutical executives at the White House, Trump was less critical and said he would cut taxes and streamline regulations as a way to drive down prices, a move applauded by the drug makers.\n\nBank of America, which donated $300,000 to Obama's 2013 inauguration, gave $1 million on Dec. 19 for Trump's festivities, records show.\n\nWe consider it part of our civic responsibility to pitch in, Lawrence Di Rita, a Bank of America spokesman, said in an email about the donation. We supported prior inaugurals at meaningful levels, just as we did this year.\n\nRecords show other Trump inaugural donors include ExxonMobil, Amgen, Florida Crystals Corp., tobacco giant Altria and Microsoft, each of which donated $500,000. Half of Microsoft's donation took the form of in-kind products and services.\n\nOther companies previously have announced contributions to the inaugural committee. Boeing, which faced a Twitter attack from Trump in December over the cost of the company's work on the next generation of the Air Force One fleet, donated $1 million to the Trump inaugural festivities, matching the amount it gave to the Obama events in 2013.\n\nTrump has since met several times with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and on Friday, traveled to South Carolina to celebrate the launch of Boeing's newest aircraft, the Dreamliner 787-10, and tout his message of preserving American jobs.\n\nRead more:\n\nLilly CEO encouraged by meeting with Trump\n\nVenturing beyond the Beltway, Trump visits Boeing in South Carolina\n\nTrump signs legislation to scrap Dodd-Frank rule on oil extraction\n\nPro-Trump lobbyist lands big clients for new D.C. office\n\nThose who gave $1 million to Trump's inauguration received an array of special perks, including tickets to a black-tie candlelight dinner at Washington's Union Station attended by Trump and his family, admission to the Inaugural Balls and VIP seating along the Inaugural Parade route.\n\nTrump and his allies also raised private funds to help pay staff and other costs associated with his presidential transition.\n\nThose donations are capped at $5,000 per donor. The lobbying reports analyzed by USA TODAY show about two dozen lobbyists, their employers and political action committees reported contributing to the transition effort through Dec. 31. Their spending totaled nearly $100,000.
Nir Kossovsky\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nPresident Donald Trump got to the White House riding the support of a stable 40 percent of still-approving voters for whom the most visible manifestation of making America great again would be a wall on our southern border. The president made that symbol the single most tangible part of his brand, and he did so very effectively. But now that his supporters expect it and his reputation depends on it, the wall is like his Alamo. He has no choice but to stand his ground and fight to the bitter end.\n\nTo him, the media's opinions don't matter, the Democrats' opinions don't matter and the opinions of more moderate, pragmatic members of his own party don't matter. What he has learned from history and his own experience — in politics and business — is that if broadening your base means disappointing your core audience, it can lead to reputational disaster. Whatever we may think about the policy implications of his actions or the position they put our country in, we should understand Trump's reputational strategy. It has wide implications not only politically, but in the corporate world as well.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTime for Trump to close on immigration deal that protects Dreamers and our borders\n\nMueller, House Democrats and slowing economy will end Trump's 'great time' in 2019\n\nTrump's lies and corruption disgrace presidential legacies of Lincoln and Washington\n\nMy firm is in the business of insuring corporations against reputational crises and has analyzed thousands of scenarios. As large companies and professional risk managers are realizing, reputation is based on the degree to which reality is in sync with expectations. Setting expectations without an adequate plan for meeting them is a dangerous game. You may be able to build a brand and market your products around some new vision, but eventually, if you stumble, angry, disappointed stakeholders will make you pay a price.\n\nCandidate Trump made a misjudgment that has been made by countless companies over the years. It wasn't enough for him to cast himself as a tough businessman who would make better trade deals for our country. It wasn't enough to posture as a skillful negotiator who could get a fractious Congress moving again. It wasn't enough to say he'd put America first and end our entanglements in foreign wars. It wasn't enough to promise he'd cut taxes and eliminate regulations on business.\n\nTrump bet his brand on a wall he can't deliver\n\nLike BP's brand promise of being beyond petroleum, like GE's imagination at work portrayal of solving the world's problems, like Wells Fargo trumpeting its new ethical standards, Trump linked his own brand inextricably with the wall. Like those companies, he hadn't thoroughly thought through what a commitment it meant, what expectations he would have to fulfill if elected, and how exactly he'd be able to deliver something he had no unilateral power to deliver.\n\nAnd now, like Col. James Bowie and frontiersman Davy Crockett at the Alamo, Trump must fight this fight to the death. At the moment, despite criminal investigations, convictions and guilty pleas swirling around him and negative news coverage off the charts, 89 percent of Republicans still approve of the president's performance, according to a recent Gallup poll. They are sticking with him for now, but they expect a wall. Failure, which seems inevitable, will be reputationally fatal.\n\nIn the corporate world, there is often an event forcing stakeholders to see reality for what it is and realize that their expectations will not be met. For BP, it was the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill that killed 11 people in 2010. At GE, imagination gave way to reality as expensive acquisitions, poor performance and rising interest rates showed that management couldn't actually deliver on its promises. At Wells Fargo, it was, well, one thing after another.\n\nFailure to build the wall will have similar implications for the president. His base will recognize that he never had a plan — that when he said, Mexico will pay for it, believe me, he was conning them.\n\nDashed expectations for Trump allies and base\n\nIf the wall wasn't funded with Republicans running Congress, how likely is it now? Democrats taking control of the House recognize that it's the president's Achilles' heel. Even Republican senators, who according to Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill privately believe he is nuts, likely appreciate that what is kryptonite to Trump can protect them in their respective primaries. They, too, will eventually abandon him, as pressure to reopen the government supersedes whatever pressure they feel from a weakened president. Like Caesar of Rome, his friends in the Senate may be his ultimate undoing.\n\nThe gap between expectations and reality is becoming hard for Trumpians to deny. Ann Coulter has angrily turned on the president for his failure to meet the clear and tangible expectation he himself set. Fox News pundits see the gap. Rush Limbaugh sees the gap. If conservative media and social media commentators begin to amplify this expectation gap as the wall failure becomes more and more clear, the president's reputation among even his ardent supporters will crumble.\n\nIn May 2017, we used our business reputation risk algorithms to predict that events eroding the president's reputation would sink him to a 40 percent level of support — a level that would hold steady until his base's expectations are shattered, which we anticipate leaving him with a 25 percent level of support. All indications are that we are headed in that direction. Like Humpty Dumpty, the wall will be his (reputational) downfall.\n\nNir Kossovsky is the CEO of Steel City Re.

Mary Troyan\n\nUSA Today\n\nWASHINGTON — All major regulations issued by federal agencies would have to be approved by Congress under legislation passed Thursday night by the House for the fourth time — but the first time in anticipation of a Republican president who would sign it.\n\nThe proposal, intended to exert more congressional power over the executive branch, was born from Republican frustration with President Obama's administration, which they accused of writing job-killing rules and regulations that went beyond the laws they were meant to implement.\n\nBut even with the imminent transition from Obama to Republican President-elect Donald Trump, the desire on Capitol Hill to curb presidential authority remains.\n\nThe House passed the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, or REINS Act, on a 237-187 vote, and it now goes to the Senate, where three previous versions stalled.\n\nCongress can already vote to disapprove of an agency rule within 60 days of its announcement, but that mechanism has been used only once in 20 years. The legislation passed Thursday goes further. Under the REINS act, a proposed regulation would be rejected if Congress was in session for 70 days and took no action to endorse it.\n\nRepublicans promoted it as a way to block bureaucratic regulations they believe stifle economic growth by burdening business owners with unnecessary rules related to environmental quality, consumer protection and labor policy, for example.\n\nThe REINS Act provides Congress, and ultimately the people, with a much needed tool to check the one-way cost ratchet that Washington's regulatory bureaucrats too often turn, said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nIf it becomes law, the proposal would apply only to rules or regulations with an economic impact of at least $100 million, with an exception for those deemed critical to national security.\n\nDemocrats were largely opposed, arguing it would allow corporate interests to scuttle rules protecting public safety if they believe they are too expensive to implement.\n\nThis is not draining the swamp, it would heighten the influence of corporate lobbyists, said Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. Maybe it would help the economy, but at what cost? What is one life worth?\n\nThe legislation is part of an overall effort by House Republicans to curb the powers of the executive branch and roll back certain agency regulations approved during Obama's presidency.\n\nContributing: Herb Jackson, USA TODAY\n\nRead more:\n\nRepublican Congress puts priority on targeting regulations\n\nRepublicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations
Alexi C. Cardona\n\nNaples (Fla.) Daily News\n\nNAPLES, Fla. — A South Florida man is the first person in at least 40 years to be attacked by a bear in the area, and it all happened in his backyard.\n\nAndrew Meunier was taking one of his Pomeranians, Howie, outside at about 11 p.m. Tuesday. Seconds after stepping outside, Howie growled at something and ran back inside.\n\nI wanted to know what scared my dog, so I walked back out, Meunier said.\n\nThree bears were standing a few feet from the back door, which leads out to a grassy area and a pond. Meunier tried to whirl around and run back inside, but he said a massive paw came down on the right side of his face before he finished turning his back on the animals.\n\nHe was able to escape and run inside of his home. When he looked at his bathroom mirror, a nightmare looked back at him.\n\nSo much blood poured from his wounds, he likened the feeling to standing under a shower nozzle.\n\nMore:Grizzly killed for preying on cattle to be displayed at Montana hospital\n\nMeunier took off his shirt, wadded it up to stop the bleeding and walked up the stairs of his North Naples town home. He then tried to comfort his 7-year-old daughter before calling 911.\n\nI went into her room and had to wake her up, Meunier said. I had to tell her what happened. She initially freaked, but when she saw I wasn't crying or anything, she calmed down.\n\nIn a 911 call to Collier County Sheriff's Office dispatchers, Meunier can be heard telling his daughter, Annabelle, that everything would be OK, that he would be OK.\n\nMeunier has an 8-inch scar starting on his hairline and crossing his temple to his cheek. He has smaller cuts under his eye and on his right cheek.\n\nIt took four hours in an emergency room and 41 stitches to patch him up.\n\nHe spent two nights at his ex-wife's house recovering before returning to sleep in his own bed Thursday night. He had some serious cleaning up to do when he got home.\n\nI've never seen a murder scene, but it looked like a murder scene, he said.\n\nDrops of blood were still visible on the back door frame Friday afternoon.\n\nMeunier isn't in pain and said the cuts to his face didn't hurt even when he was bleeding. His right cheekbone hurt from the force of the paw, but he has painkillers for that.\n\nWhat he might feel for a while is some residual worry and fear when he takes his dogs outside.\n\nOne of the times I took the dogs out, a little rabbit jumped, Meunier said. I almost jumped out of my shorts.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission set up a bear trap not far from Meunier's home in the Amberton Townhomes community across from Gulf Coast High School in North Naples.\n\nCarol Lyn Parrish, a spokeswoman for the FWC, said the agency's policy is to trap and euthanize any bear that poses a threat to public safety or that has hurt a person.\n\nIf any cubs are trapped, the cubs will be relocated, Parrish said.\n\nTuesday's incident was the 15th bear attack in Florida since 1976.\n\nThat's as far back as the data goes, Parrish said.\n\nNine of the bear attacks took place in cities along the Panhandle, and the remaining five took place in Central Florida.\n\nMost of the incidents involved humans being surprised by bears and vice versa while walking pets or taking out trash. Two incidents involved people going after bears in defense of pets.\n\nThe FWC advises that if you encounter a bear at close range:\n\nRemain standing upright.\n\nSpeak to the bear in a calm, assertive voice.\n\nBack up slowly toward a secure area. Be sure you are leaving the bear a clear escape route.\n\nAvoid direct eye contact. Bears and other animals might view direct eye contact as aggressive behavior.\n\nStop and hold your ground if your movement away seems to rouse instead of calm the bear.\n\nThe FWC advises you not:
Miriam Krinsky and Lisa Foster\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nAmericans owe billions in unpaid court debt.\n\nAnd while the new year is a chance for optimism and a fresh start, for millions of Americans 2019 will only bring continued despair as they struggle under the monetary weight of the justice system.\n\nOver the past eight years, virtually every state has increased the cost of fines and fees within the justice system. And for many jurisdictions, money collected through court-assessed debt plays a major role in keeping government in business.\n\nFinancial penalties are imposed not only for felony and misdemeanor offenses, but also for minor traffic and municipal code violations. In 43 states, defendants are charged for public defender-related fees, causing many to waive this critical constitutional right. And in most states, fines and fees are even assessed against youth for minor infractions such as skipping school — leaving parents, guardians and, in some cases, the youth themselves with added financial burdens and the threat of incarceration.\n\nFortunately, 2019 also brings newly elected prosecutors who are rethinking justice. These new leaders recognize the unfairness and inherent conflicts in relying on penalizing poor people to fund the justice system and are working with their communities on reform.\n\nRead more commentary\n\nMORE:Top Policing the USA columns of 2018\n\nCOLUMN:As FIRST STEP Act raises bar on reform, ending ban on prison Pell Grant becomes imperative\n\nPenalties perpetuate incarceration\n\nFor people who cannot afford to immediately pay fines and fees, the consequences are harsh. Interest charges and collection fees are typically imposed, and several jurisdictions even charge fees to set up payment plans. People are forced to return to court repeatedly to make payments on their debt or explain why they have not been able to pay the amount in full.\n\nIn 17 states, voting rights are restricted until all debts are paid. And in more than 40 states, if you can't afford to pay the fines and fees imposed, your driver's license is suspended. People need to drive to get to work and to take their children to school or a family member to the doctor. But driving on a suspended license can bring additional criminal charges, further monetary penalties and, in the worst cases, incarceration. The system is rigged against those who struggle most and offers no solutions.\n\nFines and fees are highly regressive and disproportionately impact low-income communities of color — serving mainly to perpetuate cycles of debt and incarceration. This troubling starting point reflects ever deeper systemic problems.\n\nMany jurisdictions raise substantial revenue from fines and fees, creating perverse incentives that depend on people committing crime to fund government. For example, North Hills, New York, a village on Long Island, derives 25 percent of its revenue from fines and fees.\n\nThis framework diverts critical law enforcement resources from the job of solving serious crimes to the task of hunting down people and using scarce resources to collect revenue.\n\nFind fine alternatives\n\nThere are jurisdictions and prosecutors working toward better options.\n\nIn Durham County, North Carolina, newly elected District Attorney Satana Deberry, who begins her term this month, advocated for a misdemeanor citation system during her campaign to divert more people from court and its associated fees.\n\nIn Chicago, the Illinois attorney's office has avoided placing financial burdens on those who come in contact with the justice system by not charging a fee for diversion programs that offer an alternative to jail time. That policy opens alternatives to those who may benefit the most.\n\nAnd in Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida, state attorneys Andrew Warren and Melissa Nelson have created programs to restore driving privileges and eliminate prosecutions for driving with suspended licenses.\n\nProsecutors have a key role to play in ending the poverty trap of fines and fees and should speak out about the injustices those costs cause. They should advocate aggressively for assessing fines and fees on a sliding scale, ending driver's license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees, and eliminating fines and fees for children and young people. Prosecutors should also find alternative mechanisms to fund courts fully and fairly.\n\nThese are just a few steps prosecutors can take to lead with compassion and ensure justice is served in 2019.\n\nLet's hope that a new year will bring a new, more compassionate and more sensible way of approaching these and other issues of great importance to our justice system.\n\nMiriam Krinsky is a former federal prosecutor and the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a national network of elected prosecutors committed to new thinking and innovation.

Todd Spangler\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nWASHINGTON — A Michigan congresswoman said Tuesday that she and her staff received word that a House committee would hold a hearing Feb. 3 on the Flint water crisis, but committee staff declined to confirm the report, calling it premature.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Brenda Lawrence's office also said it heard the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is expected to invite Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and others to testify on the crisis sparked by reports dating back nearly a year of high lead levels being found in drinking water in Flint, though the committee declined to confirm that as well.\n\nThe details being discussed surrounding a hearing on the Flint water crisis are entirely premature, the committee said in a statement. There are no confirmed details at this time, particularly with respect to a date or witness invitations.\n\nDave Murray, press secretary to Snyder, said his office had received no communication from the committee but look forward to hearing from its leaders, leaving open the question of whether the governor, who has apologized for the state's role in the crisis, would testify. He reiterated that the crisis is the result of missteps of government at all levels.\n\nPhoto of young boy helps define Flint, Mich., water crisis for nation\n\nLawrence's announcement of the hearing was atypical, given that hearing notices usually come directly from committee leaders, in this case Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. Witness lists are typically released just days before a hearing, meaning details could change.\n\nBut if the hearing comes off as Lawrence's office believes, it would be the first public congressional inquiry into a crisis that has received international attention after first Snyder, on Jan. 5, and then President Obama last Saturday declared a state of emergency in Genesee County and Flint.\n\nSpeaking to CBS News on Wednesday in Detroit, Obama called the handling of the Flint water crisis inexplicable and inexcusable after lead was found in the water. That came as long ago as February 2015, when a homeowner in Flint contacted local, state and federal EPA officials about high lead-levels at her home — levels an EPA manager confirmed for himself not long after, though state officials continued to insist the water was safe.\n\nLater in 2015, a local pediatrician, Mona Hanna-Atissha, found that blood lead levels in children had risen significantly. Even after that, however, it took months before the state, with the Department of Environmental Quality having primary responsibility over Flint's water, acknowledged mistakes in not requiring corrosion controls as required which could have stopped lead from leaching into the water supply from old service lines throughout the city.\n\nObama promises aid to help Flint resolve water crisis\n\nNow, Flint residents are being urged not to drink the water without using filters and tens of thousands of cases of bottled water have been distributed, along with water testing kits, water filters and more. And while not committing funding for infrastructure repair, the federal government has deployed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other agencies to help respond to the crisis.\n\nFlint, one of the poorest cities in the nation, has also seen a spike in cases of Legionnaire's disease, which some, including Virginia Tech University researcher Marc Edwards, who has led an independent response to test residents' water and gather government documents related to it through Freedom of Information Act requests, believe also may be linked to old service lines affected by the increased corrosive properties of water from Flint River water.\n\nThe city switched to drawing water from the Flint River as a temporary cost-saving money in 2014. The EPA has said since that the state DEQ should have required corrosion control from the beginning, though it, too, has acknowledged its rules may have been subject to interpretation.\n\nThe situation in Flint represents a crisis of leadership on all levels, said Lawrence in a letter sent a week ago to leaders of the Oversight Committee, which she is a member of, asking for a hearing. She said it was Congress' responsibility to address a man-made disaster created by the poor policy decisions of elected and career government officials.\n\nSo far, the DEQ has taken the brunt of the blame for not requiring corrosion control treatments, but in recent weeks and months, questions have also been raised about when Snyder's office was aware of the concerns in Flint and what it did to address them.\n\nSnyder has said he will do his best to address them, asking the Legislature for $28.5 million in emergency funding to aid in the effort.\n\nBut there have also been questions asked as to why the EPA, with authority for regulating the nation's rules on lead in drinking water, didn't move more aggressively when it became clear that Flint wasn't performing corrosion controls as long ago as last April, according to emails received by Edwards.\n\nAnother congressional panel, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., has called on the EPA to explain its role in investigating the Flint crisis. On Thursday, Peter Grevatt, director of the EPA's Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water, spent nearly 1 1/2 hours briefing congressional staff members on the crisis but refused to answer questions from a reporter afterwards as he was hustled outside by his staff.\n\nRequests to interview Hedman have gone unanswered as well.\n\nThe people of Flint deserve answers, an aide to Upton said after the briefing. Today's bipartisan staff briefing was to learn more details about the Flint water crisis, specifically what the EPA knew and when, the relationships between EPA and the state, and EPA and the city. ... Questions still remain.\n\nThe aide spoke anonymously because the briefing was done in private.
Hospitals across the country rang in the New Year with a federal mandate to reveal their once-secret master price lists, although it's unclear whether the new requirement will assist many patients or contain ever-rising health care costs.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, hospitals must publish online the starting price tags for every service or procedure. These detailed lists, known as chargemasters, include thousands of entries.\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act required hospitals to make these lists available to the public, but until this week, hospitals were not required to publish them. The new mandate marks an effort by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to improve price transparency in health care.\n\nHowever, health care experts stress that consumers – even those with high-deductible plans or even no insurance – should not consider these lists to be realistic price guides.\n\nMore:Is one of your New Year's resolutions to exercise more? Why you may want to rethink that gym membership.\n\nMore:Streaming video will continue to dominate screens as cord cutting accelerates into 2019\n\nMore:Charter Spectrum-Tribune dispute causes TV channel blackout that hits millions across US\n\nThat is because the prices are typically starting points for payment negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies and have little connection to what most patients actually pay.\n\nThe only time that most consumers glimpse chargemaster prices is on hospital bills as amounts they might have owed before insurance negotiated down the price.\n\nIt's not a particularly useful datapoint, said Marianne Udow-Phillips, executive director of the Center for Health and Research Transformation in Ann Arbor, Mich. I don't expect it to have a significant impact, and I don't expect it to be a driver of lowering health care costs.\n\nFor patients with commercial health plans such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, the price of services and procedures is determined by private negotiations between their insurance company and the hospital.\n\nSo these patients should check with their insurance company for actual pricing information, including whatever deductibles they must pay before insurance fully kicks in.\n\nIf a patient goes online and sees a (chargemaster) price that they can't afford, I'm concerned that some consumers might forego needed care – especially if that price is the total cost of service and not what the consumer is expected to pay based on what their insurance plan covers or not, said Mark Fendrick, a University of Michigan professor.\n\nSome uninsured patients may indeed be directly billed at chargemaster prices.

WASHINGTON – Ominous statements from Washington and Tehran on Thursday highlighted the quandary President Donald Trump faces in confronting an increasingly aggressive Iran, even though Iran-backed protesters pulled back from their attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\n\nThe tensions were underscored when Defense Secretary Mike Esper warned that Iran might be planning additional military strikes on U.S. targets, just hours after a top Iranian military commander boasted that Tehran was not worried about the United States.\n\nWe have the power to break them several times over and are not worried, Revolutionary Guards Commander Brigadier General Hossein Salami said, according to Tasnim, a government-affiliated news outlet. We are not leading the country to war, but we are not afraid of any war.\n\nTrump and his top advisers have repeatedly touted their maximum pressure policy, a sanctions-driven campaign designed to isolate Tehran diplomatically and cripple the country economically.\n\nBut the recent clashes demonstrate that Iran has its own strategy, one that has proven remarkably effective. Iran's leaders, and its proxy forces in places like Iraq, remain willing and able to lash out at the U.S. – causing spikes in global oil prices, undermining American allies and threatening U.S. assets abroad.\n\nThey're showing our impotence, said Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank in Washington. This is maximum resistance to maximum pressure.\n\nThe embassy protest erupted Tuesday, two days after U.S. airstrikes hit Iranian-backed militia targets in Iraq and killed more than 25 people. The airstrikes were retaliation, U.S. officials said, for an Iranian-sponsored attack on an Iraqi base that killed an American civilian contractor and wounded American servicemen.\n\nSlavin and others said the U.S. response was counterproductive and demonstrates the dilemma Trump faces as he walks a tightrope between a war he doesn't want and capitulation his supporters would abhor.\n\nRisk of another strike?\n\nIran's attack on the Iraq base may well have been designed to goad the U.S. into striking inside Iraq, according to an analysis by Abbas Kadhim, an expert on Iraq who is also with the Atlantic Council.\n\nTehran got exactly what it wanted, he wrote in a post Wednesday.\n\nNow, he noted, Iraqi political leaders are condemning the U.S. reprisal and some are even calling for the withdrawal of American troops from that strategic country. Meanwhile, Iran is likely searching for yet another way to strike the U.S., as Esper hinted on Thursday.\n\nIn the dangerous stalemate between the US and Iran ... the US has to expect that Iran will react to any action by choosing another battlefield where the balance of power is more favorable, Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador to the U.S. and Israel, tweeted on Wednesday. We saw it in the Gulf, we are seeing it in Iraq.\n\nChants of 'Death to America'\n\nThe embassy attack in Baghdad – a confrontational move that prompted Trump to dispatch hundreds of additional U.S. troops to the region – immediately captured Washington's attention and revived memories of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. That standoff lasted 444 days and helped doom then-President Jimmy Carter's bid for re-election. As in 1979, the protesters in Baghdad this week shouted Death to America! and smashed their way into the diplomatic compound, setting fire to a reception area as U.S. combat helicopters swooped over the complex.\n\nImages from the scene at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad revealed extensive damage, showing a burned and charred reception area, smashed windows and vandalized rooms left behind by supporters and members of the Iranian-trained Hashed al-Shaabi military network, also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. No deaths or serious injuries have been reported, and the embassy was not evacuated.\n\nThis week's tit-for-tat aggressions in Iraq are part of a broader campaign that stretches back to Trump's decision to withdraw in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal, a multilateral agreement aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions but which Trump blasted as weak. The U.S. has since imposed massive sanctions on Iran in an effort to force Tehran to negotiate a new deal. Trump's advisers have demanded that Iran end its ballistic missile program and stop funding proxy forces in the region, among other steps.\n\nNone of that has worked. Instead, according to U.S. officials, Iran sabotaged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf in May, downed a U.S. drone in June and struck Saudi oil facilities in September. The Saudi attack alone disrupted more than 5% of the world's daily oil supply.\n\nThe Iranians have not stopped trying to extend their influence in the region. The Iranians have not come back on bended knee to accept a new nuclear negotiation with more Iranian concessions, said Robert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria and Algeria.\n\nThe Iranians didn't even agree to meet Trump in New York last September, despite Trump's repeated entreaties to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, said Ford, now a senior fellow at Yale University and the Middle East Institute in Washington.\n\nNow, with every escalation, Trump's predicament worsens, Peter Beinart, a professor at the City University of New York, wrote a piece published Wednesday in The Atlantic.\n\nHis confidants insist that he can't afford a war – which would likely boost oil prices and damage the economy – especially in an election year. Yet he also can't pursue real diplomacy, at least not without provoking a confrontation with the GOP's hawkish foreign-policy elite, Beinart writes. He's caught between his desire to avoid being like George W. Bush and his desire to avoid being like Barack Obama.\n\nFord said the Trump administration's maximalist position may be viewed within Iran as an indication that the U.S. is more interested in regime change than any kind of compromise. It looks to me like Tehran is hoping that in a year, Donald Trump will be gone, he said.\n\nSlavin said Trump has few palatable options to solve the current standoff.\n\nWe've already sanctioned Iran up to the eyeballs, she said. We can kill some of their proxies here or there. But the next level is to attack Iran itself, and if we do that, then it's off to the races. We have another Middle East war – one that the U.S. doesn't want to fight and that could result in another failed state, just like Iraq after the U.S. ousted Saddam Hussein.\n\nContributing: John Bacon and the Associated Press
Andrew Logue\n\nalogue@dmreg.com\n\nAn examination of Tyler Sash's brain brought a small measure of peace to his family — and sobering questions to anyone who loves Iowa football.\n\nSash, an Oskaloosa native who became a star defensive back for the University of Iowa and then a member of the New York Giants' Super Bowl XLVI champions, died last September at age 27, due to a toxic mixture of methadone and hydrocodone.\n\nHis parents agreed to have Sash's brain tested for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, commonly known as CTE, and the New York Times reported Tuesday that doctors found their son suffered from the disease.\n\nI don't think we really knew for sure what the news would be, Josh Sash, Tyler's brother, told the Register. It seemed to clear something up, as to maybe some of the struggles Tyler had in the last couple years.\n\nMORE COVERAGE\n\nDr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System, told the Times the severity of Sash's condition was similar to Junior Seau, a Pro Football hall-of-famer who committed suicide in 2012, at 43.\n\nThe differences in age and NFL experience — Sash played a total of 23 regular-season games in the league compared to Seau's 268 — was alarming.\n\nReaction to the news has been very strong nationally, said Chris Nowinski, executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Because he was known to be so beloved and he was so young with such a severe disease.\n\nNowinski, a football player at Harvard in the 1990s and author of Head Games: The Global Concussion Crisis, has been pushing for more awareness of brain injuries since 2006. Some of his proposals, once thought to be extreme, are gaining momentum.\n\nI'm very firm in my belief that children should not be playing tackle football, Nowinski said. No one should put a helmet on, at least before high school.\n\nThere's just no upside, and a ton of downside.\n\nSash suffered two concussions in high school, at least one with the Hawkeyes and two more in the NFL.\n\nThe severity of CTE is measured on a scale of zero to 4, and Sash was found to be at Stage 2.\n\nBut it's a condition that cannot be diagnosed until after someone dies, leaving loved ones to wonder what damage the sport played.\n\nWe noticed some changes in Tyler, Josh Sash said. I guess I don't want to paint the picture that he was just a completely different person, but there were a lot of very subtle changes.\n\nMaybe in how he acted or how he talked, or some of the things he'd get upset about.\n\nSash was suspended four games in 2012 for violating the NFL's policy for performance enhancing substances, by using Adderall.\n\nAfter being cut by the Giants in 2013, Sash was arrested in Oskaloosa for public intoxication and led police on a brief chase on a motorized scooter.\n\nHe displayed other erratic behaviors, especially when it came to maintaining focus.\n\nOne day, he was maybe going to try and sell insurance, Josh Sash explained. Maybe he was going to get his real-estate license. And then he was going to try and be a graduate assistant with the Iowa football program.\n\nHe was kind of all over the place.\n\nAs more information emerges, people in and outside the game try to pinpoint causes and effects.\n\nThe reality is, we're still working out all of the details and all the mechanisms, Nowinski said. But it's very clear your brain does not like trauma, and some terrible things happen when it's trying to recover or stabilize itself after injury.\n\nMeanwhile, fans, coaches and players are left with dilemmas.\n\nWith the fans, it's like everybody makes a choice, Robert Klemko, an NFL writer for Sports Illustrated and MMQB.com, said. You understand that the players are taking enormous risks, whether it's their brains or their ACLs.\n\nWith the players, I think a lot of them got to the level they're at by ignoring injury risks. Because if you're running around thinking about busting your ankle or breaking your arm in an NFL game, you're just not going to be effective.\n\nThose who follow the Hawkeyes, and cheered for Sash throughout his 38 games at Iowa, are torn.\n\nYou can say 'I enjoy football, and Hawkeye football,' said Adam Jacobi, managing editor of BlackHeartGoldPants.com, but you can also be concerned for these guys and sort of want to make sure that they're well taken care of after their careers are over.\n\nYou can't assume this is safe for these guys anymore, which is a bummer.\n\nMixed feelings can be traced to the wording used by those who oversee football.\n\nThey call a brain injury a concussion, Klemko said. You don't call a knee injury or an ankle injury something that doesn't use the word 'knee' or 'ankle.' So why wouldn't you call a brain injury a brain injury?\n\nThat's because it has horrible connotations.\n\nA gladiator's code also prevails.\n\nYou put your body through so much as a player, said Anthony Herron, an ex-Hawkeye player and current analyst for the Pac-12 Network who played in the NFL. I can remember times when you're seeing double or you're seeing triple. You feel like you're going to pass out or faint, going through different things on the field.\n\nSo, your body is so often on the brink of something traumatic that it feels like the norm.\n\nJosh Sash grew up playing football and remembers younger brother Tyler being a ball boy. He's now the father of two sons, Tandon (4) and Tayson (7 months), and wonders if he wants them to carry on that tradition.\n\nIt's something I'm really still trying to take in, Josh said. The way that I feel right now, it's hard for me to put my stamp of approval on my own two boys playing football, at this point.
Leo Roth\n\n@leoroth\n\nORCHARD PARK - Buffalo Bills general manager Doug Whaley said the team's 7-9 record this season was not good enough and that it starts with me in a Monday news conference.\n\nWhaley, who was alone at the podium, said he was representing owners Kim and Terry Pegula, team president Russ Brandon and the football department.\n\nYou are what your record says you are and we are 7-9, Whaley said. We have to get better in every aspect.\n\nWhaley said the team's search for a head coach will be different than the previous two that he has been involved with, as he will lead the search. Whaley was an assistant general manager when Doug Marrone was hired in 2013 and the team used a committee approach when Rex Ryan was hired in 2015.\n\nI have full confidence in myself and the process that we have in place, Whaley said.\n\nDespite reports that interim coach Anthony Lynn has the inside track to secure the job permanently, Whaley insisted it will be an open search for the Bills' next head coach. Whaley confirmed that the Bills have reached out and requested an interview with Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Harold Goodwin. Whaley said there is not a timetable for hiring the head coach.\n\nYou don't want to rush to make a decision like this, you want to make the right decision, Whaley said.\n\nHe also said that Ryan spoke to team owner Terry Pegula on the phone privately last Tuesday before the team made the decision to part ways with Ryan.\n\nI wasn't privy to the conversation (between Pegula and Ryan), so I cannot get into the details, Whaley said.\n\nWhaley later said that he had no input into the decision to fire Ryan.\n\nWhaley also said that he did not speak after Ryan's firing last week because the team has a policy during the season to have a singular voice during the regular season and that voice is the head coach. He said that he and Lynn have spoken about the team's decision to bench Taylor for the season finale and that Anthony and I have talked, and we are fine.\n\nHe also said he understands why Taylor was unhappy with the team's decision to rest him on Sunday.\n\nI would be upset if he wasn't upset, Whaley said.\n\nWhaley also said that he has often leaned on Brandon for administrative advice, but with Brandon taking on expanded responsibilities with the Buffalo Sabres and Pegula Sports Entertainment (his official title is managing partner and president), their relationship is likely to change.\n\nWith his duties taking him away, (Brandon's involvement in football decisions) will probably be less and less, Whaley said.\n\nAfter starting the season 4-2, the Bills lost four of their last five games to finish 7-9 and miss the NFL playoffs for the 17th straight season.\n\nThe Bills finished their season with a disappointing 30-10 loss to the New York Jets on Sunday.\n\nWhaley said the team was highly competitive for much of the season.\n\nIf you look at the season in totality, we did some good things, Whaley said. We just weren't consistent.\n\nWe're not that far away, we believe.\n\nLROTH@Gannett.com
WASHINGTON – Before he retired, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., frequently used his perch as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to lob cutting critiques at President Donald Trump – accusing the president of putting America on a path to World War III and being submissive to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDon't expect those kind of verbal bangers from Corker's successor, Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, a Trump loyalist who is poised to win the Foreign Relations gavel this week.\n\nA self-made millionaire, former trial lawyer and current cattle rancher, Risch is a low-key legislator, unlike Corker, a high-profile media star. Risch shuns public confrontations; Corker relished them.\n\nRisch will take the helm of the committee at a turbulent moment in U.S. foreign policy: Lawmakers in both parties question the Trump administration's approach to Saudi Arabia, Russia, Syria and North Korea, among other global hot spots. Risch will have to oversee the potentially controversial nomination of Heather Nauert, Trump's pick to succeed Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nHow Risch will navigate that thicket remains to be seen. Foreign policy experts and even some of his Senate colleagues said they're not sure what to expect from the Idaho Republican's chairmanship, in part because Risch has yet to make a big mark in the foreign policy arena. In the previous Congress, he sponsored only one foreign affairs bill – a resolution commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift. In the subcommittee he chaired, Risch convened just two hearings in the past two years,although he stood in for Corker three times to chair the full committee.\n\nWe're going to have a frankly much more quiet voice in the Senate majority on foreign policy than we did in the last two years, said Michael Fuchs, who served as a senior State Department official in the Obama administration and is a fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress.\n\nI don't know how he's going to be, Corker said of Risch in an interview last month as the Senate was in the midst of a contentious debate over the Saudi crown prince's role in the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCorker said Risch was preparing for the post in a sober way – hiring top-notch staff and seeking out advice. He told me yesterday … 'I really want you to know that I'm really taking this seriously. I know what a step it is.' \n\nRisch's spokeswoman, Suzanne Wrasse, said the senator has been engaged on a wide range of foreign policy matters, from arms control treaties to Russia sanctions.\n\nRisch is a workhorse, not a show horse, Wrasse said. He is extremely engaged on these issues, and whether his input is behind the scenes, member-to-member or more public, he is very strategic and focused on the end result. He has four decades of legislative and executive leadership experience, which includes a number of major policy victories, so it is no surprise when he succeeds.\n\nWrasse said Risch wanted to wait until he is officially selected as chairman before speaking to the media about his priorities and outlook.\n\nRisch's allies said he will bring an open mind and self-effacing style to a panel that has often been run by senators with national ambitions.\n\nJim Risch is just an energetic, happy Westerner, said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who is close to Risch. Gardner said that because Risch also sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, he will have, I think, an unparalleled understanding of the threats this nation faces.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who serves with Risch on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, said Risch won't try to use his new post to raise his own profile. He will let others on the committee help shape the agenda.\n\nHe tries to find something that you care about and allow people to play a leading role on that issue, Rubio said. I think he would tell you his job is to run the committee and not necessarily be a shadow secretary of state.\n\nRisch will have plenty of competition for the limelight, since the foreign relations panel is stocked with senators who are far better known than he is – including Rubio, Mitt Romney of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, all former (and possibly future) GOP presidential candidates.\n\nRisch will have to contend with a coterie of Democrats on the committee seeking aggressive oversight of the Trump administration. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who has voiced fierce opposition to Trump's foreign policy, said he believes Risch will be fair and will make an effort to work with Democrats.\n\nHe tends to back up the administration but not blindly, Murphy said. I think we're going to butt heads a bunch, but I think he has the ability to be a real honest broker.\n\nRisch has been a fairly conventional conservative in his foreign policy views. He has voted with Trump 90.5 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight, a website that conducts political, economic and other analyses. He did buck the president on a few issues. Last July, Risch voted in favor of a sweeping Russia sanctions bill that Trump opposed. He voted to open debate on a Yemen war resolution the administration tried to quash, though Risch eventually voted against final passage.\n\nEvery indication that we have is that Sen. Risch adheres to the traditional pro-trade, tough-on-bad-guys wing of … the Republican Party, said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. She said he and other Republicans will inevitably clash with Trump on some major policy issues, such as Russia and Syria.\n\nRisch will not be afraid to take on Trump when he thinks the president is wrong, Rubio and others said, but he'll be measured – and probably private – about any policy disagreements with the president.\n\nJim Risch has never stood down from anything, Gardner said. This guy's faced 2,000-pound animals on his ranch. There's nothing that's going to frighten this guy.\n\nOther foreign policy coverage:\n\nTrump's foreign policy agenda faces a gantlet of House Democrats led by New York's Eliot Engel\n\n'The president needs to go to Afghanistan,' Sen.

Mike Snider\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLAS VEGAS -- Panasonic's goal to drive $10 billion in sales by 2018 includes a budding smart city project in Denver and a new tech-infused ballpark for the Atlanta Braves.\n\nSet to hit its 100th year in 2018, Panasonic has a goal of hitting 10 trillion yen that year -- an increase of about $8 billion to $10 billion globally from its current $77 billion.\n\nAmong the new businesses Panasonic is leaning on to drive growth: smart energy and industrial displays. With the city of Denver, Panasonic will begin building a smart city near Denver International Airport that will expand into the city and surrounding area.\n\nThese technologies make communities smarter, cleaner, greener and safer, said Peter Fannon, Panasonic Corp. of North America's vice president of technology policy. It starts with a commercial development and we'll add residential but within the city itself our involvement will include a bunch of urban infrastructure activities including lighting, security, communications, data management and monitoring both for security and traffic flow.\n\nCES 2016\n\nPanasonic has already begun other smart city projects including the Fujisawa sustainable smart town outside Tokyo and others in Yokohama, Japan, Singapore and two in China.\n\nAs part of the Denver project, power provider Xcel Energy will team with Panasonic on a microgrid model program of solar power and lithium batteries.\n\nIn Atlanta, Panasonic will provide a massive LED scoreboard for Suntrust Park, expected to open in 2017. The company will also supply the wraparound lighting displays in the bowl of the stadium as well as some security and communications installations not just in the stadium but in the adjacent corporate development in that area, Fannon said.\n\nPanasonic has also provided the world's largest 4K screen in the world, the 90-foot tall display at Churchill Downs, and the largest HD display at the Big Hoss TV at the Texas Motor Speedway near Dallas. That is a good example of growing based on current businesses, Fannon said.\n\nAnother partnership is one with Facebook, which along with Panasonic internally developed 100 Gigabyte Freeze-ray Blu-ray Disc arrays for use in its data centers. Newly designed 300-GB arrays are expected to be deployed later this year. A giant cold storage system, it stores massive amounts of data that is accessible but not always on, Fannon said.\n\nOh, Panasonic does have some consumer products on the way including an Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc player and OLED TV.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider

A.J. Perez, USA TODAY Sports\n\nJohnny Manziel will make a Super Bowl appearance next month --- at a mall.\n\nHe is scheduled to sign autographs and take selfies at two Houston-area malls the week of the Super Bowl.\n\nThe former Heisman Trophy winner, who was cut by the Cleveland Browns last year as he faced a domestic violence accusation, will sign any item for $99 and take a selfie for $50 in those two appearances.\n\nThe signing is scheduled at the Stadium Signatures locations at Katy Mills (Feb.2) and Woodland (Feb. 3) malls.\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney's office agreed to the conditional agreement in December that would lead to the domestic violence charge related to an incident with his then-girlfriend last January to be dropped. Manziel must undergo counseling and have his conduct monitored by prosecutors for up to a year as part of the agreement.\n\nNo NFL team signed Manziel for the 2016 season. He was reinstated by the league in October after a four-game ban for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy.\n\nPHOTOS: Best of NFL wild-card weekend
The Tennessean\n\nNASHVILLE — It was a melee that unfolded on the doorstep of a Nashville home where three women tried to escape police officers who came to do their jobs.\n\nThe women, according to court testimony, did not believe the police had the authority to interfere in their lives. One police officer testified in a recent trial that the women shouted that police were not law enforcement, we were merely policy enforcers.\n\nThe women are followers of what is called the Moorish Nation, a black nationalist group that has scattered followers in Nashville. Their case is an example of the alternative populations that do not believe in government authority and how they pose a challenge to the criminal justice system. Those cases are rare but do occasionally come through Nashville courts, officials said.\n\nIn Oregon, a new-age militia holds its ground\n\nPolice encountered the three women, who are triplets, while trying to arrest one for failing to appear in court on a driver's license charge. But as officers tried to make an arrest, the women began to resist, resulting in a fight.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center considers Moorish nationals a black nationalist movement and notes there are many distinct ideologies within the Moorish movement. Generally, the groups share a belief that they are not subject to American government authority — including things such as the tax and criminal justice system.\n\nBut Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said that the groups' actions are far different than those of many patriot movement groups. Unlike the militia that has taken over federal land in Oregon, and unlike Sovereign Citizens, who are anti-government and call on others to actively disobey authority, Moorish Nation members generally do not call for anti-government activism, Potok said.\n\nThe Moorish Science Temple of America was founded more than 100 years ago by Noble Drew Ali, according to a 2011 SPLC article. In the same article, the grand sheik of the temple denied any affiliation with sovereignty movements. Ali taught that the Moors were America's original inhabitants and therefore could self-govern, according to SPLC.\n\nNashville's Moorish population tends to live in northern and eastern parts of the city, according to Metro Police Detective Sgt. Chris West of the specialized investigations division.\n\nWhat we've seen from the Moors mostly is they don't believe in having a driver's license. They don't believe in paying taxes, West said. We've run into them along with the sheriff's department in evictions.\n\nHe said Moors and Sovereign Citizen followers in Nashville are not as organized as in other cities, and most often encounter law enforcement in traffic stops when they are driving without a license. West said all sworn Metro police officers learn about the groups during annual training. They learn about the history of the groups and what to watch for — such as statements someone is making — that could indicate that person does not believe in government authority.\n\nThey also learn to treat those people just the same as anyone else, he said.\n\nBeing a sovereign is not against the law, he said. If you say you're a sovereign, you're not under arrest.\n\nOur interaction is just the same as it is with other people, other than we need to have a mindset, be informed about their beliefs and what might happen. We're not going to treat them differently.\n\nPart of that mindset, he said, is to be aware that one tactic sometimes used by the groups is filing excessive lawsuits that can keep officers tangled in litigation for years. The Southern Poverty Law Center notes that has been dubbed paper terrorism by some.\n\nA woman who claimed allegiance with the Moorish Republic in 2013 moved into a $3 million East Memphis home and claimed it as her own, according to media reports. She was later sentenced to 20 years in prison for theft and aggravated burglary. And in 2010, a father and son allied with the Sovereign Citizen movement shot and killed two police officers in West Memphis, Ark., after they were pulled over, according to media reports.\n\nCiting that case as an example, West said officers must be prepared for interactions in case they turn violent.\n\nJust as they did at Briana Wigfall's Nashville house on Aug. 27, 2014.\n\nNashville Police Officer Cameron Brown testified in a November trial that officers were looking for Briana Wigfall because she did not show up in court on a driving on a revoked license charge. They found her outside a house in a neighborhood near Brick Church Pike.\n\nBut as officers tried to take her into custody, her two sisters got involved. The Wigfalls became disorderly, saying police were policy enforcers and pulling Briana Wigfall into the house, Brown said in court.\n\nPolice officers tangled with the triplets in a sort of tug-of-war over Briana Wigfall on the doorstep.\n\nPublic records and court testimony said that Briana Wigfall hit two officers, who eventually used a Taser to subdue her and take her into custody. Shaquana Wigfall hit Brown twice near his right eye, spit on one officer and later slipped her hand out of handcuffs and continued assaulting police, records show. The third sister, Keeana Wigfall, bit an officer on the hand, leaving teeth marks, while being put in the back of a patrol car.\n\nThe only issue this case boils down to is the total and utter disrespect for a police officer who came out there to do a very simple requirement of his job, Nashville Criminal Court Judge Mark Fishburn said at the Dec. 16 sentencing of the Wigfall triplets.\n\nThe Wigfalls initially agreed to an interview for this story, but then stopped responding to a reporter's requests.\n\nThe women were charged with a slew of crimes: assaulting an officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct among them. They went to trial before Fishburn in November, and their attorneys — Will Conway, Chase Gober and Greg King — argued that police responded during the incident by using excessive force on the triplets and escalating the violence. The judge found the women guilty of some, but not all, charges.\n\nFishburn said in a December sentencing hearing that allowing everyone to choose what laws to follow would not lead to peaceful coexistence.\n\nAnybody who lives in this country is subject to the laws of this country, he said.\n\nCase files\n\n• Briana Wigfall: Guilty of resisting arrest and two counts of assaulting an officer. Sentenced to 30 days in jail and 11 months and 29 days of probation.\n\n• Keeana Wigfall: Not guilty of assault of an officer and two counts of disorderly conduct. She was found guilty of assault of an officer and resisting arrest, but can have those charges expunged if she completes 11 months and 29 days of probation.\n\n• Shaquana Wigfall: Guilty of resisting arrest and three counts of assault of an officer. Not guilty of attempted theft of more than $1,000 and two counts of disorderly conduct. Sentenced to 30 days in jail and 11 months and 29 days of probation.\n\nFollow Stacey Barchenger on Twitter: @sbarchenger
Zach Despart\n\nBurlington (Vt.) Free Press\n\nBURLINGTON, Vt. — Someone in Donald Trump's camp, or perhaps the candidate himself, must have worried about how friendly an audience Trump would find in Burlington, the liberal bastion where rival Bernie Sanders began his political career.\n\nThe campaign's solution was crude, yet simple: As attendees filed into the Flynn Center for a Trump rally Thursday evening, his staff barred people who refused to pledge allegiance to the candidate.\n\nFor 70 minutes, the Republican presidential candidate enthralled a capacity crowd. Though he was unable to prevent all protesters from entering the theater, Trump stifled any large demonstrations that would give the impression he was unwelcome in Burlington.\n\nRally attendees said they were surprised to be confronted with a loyalty test at the theater's entrance.\n\nTrump's campaign seems immune to what felled others � so far\n\nThere was a man in a suit who asked us if we were Trump supporters, said Jennifer Vincent of South Burlington. A couple ahead of us said they weren't, and they were escorted out.\n\nBurlington City Councilor Joan Shannon refused to declare herself a Trump supporter and also was barred. Shannon, the former council president, said she was flabbergasted Trump would weed out people who simply wanted to hear the candidate speak.\n\nWhat was the point of tickets exactly? Shannon said. It was incredibly dishonest.\n\nTrump defended the tactic in a statement to the Burlington Free Press.\n\nWe have more than 20,000 people that showed up for 1,400 spots, the billionaire New York businessman said in a statement. I'm taking care of my people, not people who don't want to vote for me or are undecided. They are loyal to me, and I am loyal to them.\n\nThe Trump campaign was within its rights to refuse admittance to anyone, Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo said.\n\nThey have the right to say who's trespassing in violation of their lease agreement, so when people are asked to leave, police escort them out, the chief told the Free Press. He said that campaigns remove people from events all the time whom they do not wish to have attend.\n\nFROM THE STUMP\n\nTrump, in a dark suit with red tie, spoke without notes. In front of a backdrop bearing his campaign slogan, Make America great again, Trump meandered between topics without warning and occasionally without context. Some topics, such as a long aside about the Iran nuclear deal, left listeners scratching their heads. Others, such as a staunch defense of gun rights and a proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, brought the crowd to its feet.\n\nHe attacked Republicans and Democrats alike — including GOP rivals former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is the leading candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.\n\nTrump's thesis was simple: The United States is failing under poor leadership, and he will right the ship. He eschewed policy proposals in favor of sentimental references to America's past.\n\nElections 2016 | USA TODAY Network\n\nWe need Douglas MacArthur, we need General Patton, Trump said, referencing the World War II-era military leaders. We need great people. These were people who won.\n\nTrump made few references to Vermont, other than a few jabs at Sanders, who is vying for the presidential nomination in the Democratic Party.\n\nAs hard as his campaign tried, a few dozen protesters evaded detection and slipped into the theater. At least six times, groups interrupted Trump.\n\nGet 'em out! Trump barked, as his supporters shouted down protesters with an almost religious fervor. Trump egged them on and criticized Burlington police for not removing dissenters more quickly.\n\nEach time he would continue, with the same topic or by launching into another. Trump was blunt and unapologetic. His supporters loved him.\n\nHe's going to be a great president, Lynn Doney of Northfield said after the speech.\n\nVictoria Carter of Burlington agreed.\n\nIt's a night I will take to my grave, Carter said. Just about everything he said was something I had thought a long time ago.\n\nOther Burlington residents were unimpressed. Sanders said Thursday evening that Trump would be a poor candidate.\n\nThere are people who disagree with me who I respect. There are conservatives I regard as friends, Sanders said. But this guy is a pathological liar.\n\nCITY LEADERS ANGERED\n\nAn hour before the rally began, Flynn Center Executive Director John Killacky was incensed with Trump campaign staff who distributed hundreds of placards to the audience. Killacky said in leasing the theater, the campaign had agreed to a prohibition on signs.\n\nNow there's a box of Trump things being distributed, so I stopped them, said Killacky, his voice wavering with anger.\n\nMoments earlier, when Killacky and another Flynn employee confronted campaign staff about the signs, a Trump staff member accused the theater of being Sanders supporters.\n\nThe ugly confrontation, in which the young man shouted and shook his finger at a theater employee, was one of many incidents where the campaign had managed to offend well-meaning Burlington officials who had tried to accommodate Trump.\n\n'People occupy different realities' on guns, Obama says in CNN town hall\n\nAlthough Trump spent mere hours in Vermont, his deputies managed to upset several city officials.\n\nTuesday, Trump's camp flummoxed Burlington police with the admission the campaign had distributed more than 20,000 tickets for the 1,400-seat theater. del Pozo said the prospect of thousands rejected ticket holders placed an unreasonable burden on his officers.\n\nAfter the rally, Trump declared 25,000 had lined up to see him speak. Del Pozo pegged that figure at 2,000 people, with another 700 demonstrating outside.\n\nMayor Miro Weinberger, who watched the crowds from his City Hall office across the street from the theater, took Trump to task for forcing city police to handle the overflow crowds.\n\nSeeing Mr. Trump himself apparently tweeting that they're going to take care of their own tonight, that doesn't sound like the words of a president to me, Weinberger said. If he were elected president I'd hope he would understand that he's got a responsibility to all Americans, whether they agree with him or not.\n\nWeinberger said he found it pretty distasteful for the Trump campaign to overbook the event, to encourage as large a crowd as possible, and then not communicate in any way how people would be treated at the door.\n\nAs Trump's entourage retreated to the airport after the rally, the usually reticent mayor couldn't resist a dig at the brash businessman.\n\nDonald Trump didn't bring much game, Weinberger tweeted. He appended the hashtag Emperor Has No Clothes.\n\nContributing: Jess Aloe, Dan D'Ambrosio, Elizabeth Murray and Adam Silverman of the Free Press.
Normally, a workplace death in the United States is met with a swift and thorough response.\n\nBy law, employers must report a death within eight hours to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration. An inspector from OSHA typically arrives within a day to interview workers, review the site of the incident and determine whether the death resulted from unsafe conditions.\n\nFor workers in the meatpacking industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the system of swift reporting and next-day inspections that should protect them has broken down.\n\nAt least 239 meatpacking workers have died and 45,000 have contracted the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, according to tracking by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. But companies reported less than half that number of deaths to OSHA, a joint investigation by USA TODAY and the Midwest Center found. Experts say that's in large part because the agency weakened reporting requirements during the pandemic.\n\nEven fewer deaths triggered the kind of robust investigation OSHA typically conducted before the pandemic. Worker advocates say that's also a consequence of a hands-off approach from OSHA.\n\nDeaths at meatpacking plants\n\nAnd it isn't just how many died, but who. The U.S. meatpacking industry has long relied on vulnerable populations to fill its workforce: immigrants, refugees, people of color, and those who lack other employment opportunities. During its last data release in July, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 87% of coronavirus cases in meatpacking plants occurred among racial or ethnic minorities.\n\nDebbie Berkowitz, a former senior policy adviser at OSHA and now director of the National Employment Law Project's worker health and safety program, says that many coronavirus deaths are going unreported and uninvestigated, letting employers off the hook for unsafe conditions.\n\nThe agency failed. It failed, Berkowitz said. I don't know what else to say.\n\nAnatomy of an outbreak: 'They think workers are like dogs.' How pork plant execs sacrificed safety for profits.\n\nWhy meatpacking plants? Cheap chicken, beef came at a cost. How American meat plants bred coronavirus hot spots.\n\nThe meatpacking industry and OSHA separately pushed back against those conclusions. Sarah Little, a spokesperson for the industry group North American Meat Institute, said not all COVID-19 deaths need to be reported.\n\nThe fact that any employee contracts COVID-19 does not indicate the infection was related to their workplace, Little said.\n\nIn an email, a spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Labor, which houses OSHA, said the hands-off characterization of the agency was patently false and that the agency investigates every complaint it receives.\n\nOSHA has been clear that employers are and will continue to be responsible for providing a workplace free of known health and safety hazards, the department said.\n\nBut evidence shows deaths are going unreported.\n\nAt a Seaboard Foods plant in Guymon, Oklahoma, 961 workers have tested positive for the virus and six have died from COVID-19, according to the company. The Department of Labor has not received any reports of deaths from the plant, a spokesperson said.\n\nA Seaboard spokesperson said the company did not report the deaths because it determined they were not work-related.\n\nOSHA opened an inspection into the plant in July, but it was not related to COVID-19, according to Seaboard. A Labor Department spokesperson said the inspection resulted in Seaboard abating hazards. But no one from OSHA has actually visited the plant during the pandemic, said Martin Rosas, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 2. The agency has not issued any fines or citations.\n\nLoren Sweatt, principal deputy assistant secretary of labor at OSHA, denied that such instances are proof of any systemic failings.\n\nBy pulling isolated alleged incidents out of context from the thousands of inspections conducted by OSHA, these criticisms unfairly disparage the work of dedicated OSHA inspectors across the country, Sweatt said.\n\nPublicly available data, as well as input from half a dozen former OSHA officials, suggest the problem is more widespread.\n\nThe last time the federal government estimated the number of meatpacking workers who died from COVID-19 was in July, when the CDC said the number stood at 86. But reporters have scoured media reports, obtained government records and interviewed industry workers throughout the pandemic to tally up the 239 deaths.\n\nThat figure substantially outpaces OSHA's response. In an email, the agency said it has received 77 reports totaling 90 fatalities from COVID-19 in meatpacking plants, accounting for less than 4 in 10 of the deaths noted by the Midwest Center. Similarly, of the 65 meatpacking plants where reporters found at least one worker died, OSHA has not inspected 26 to date.\n\nInspection is an official term OSHA uses to describe a robust process in which an employee typically visits a plant in person and conducts a wide-ranging inquiry into the circumstances of a complaint, injury or death. Such inspections show up publicly on the agency's inspection database.\n\nDuring the pandemic, OSHA is responding to some cases – including deaths – with rapid response investigations, a less robust process in which the agency asks companies about an incident by phone, email or fax. Often, it accepts the company's response and closes the case. The agency does not publish the reports in its database.\n\nOSHA says it has conducted 11 rapid response investigations of deaths at meatpacking plants to date. Even when added to the inspections, it means that nearly 1 of every 4 plants with known deaths have received no OSHA inspection or investigation.\n\nFormer agency officials say OSHA already had staffing problems before COVID-19. Inspectors are now even more swamped, tasked with handling coronavirus on top of their normal caseloads of unrelated worker injury and deaths. Epidemiological experts normally available to them to sort out tricky infectious disease scenarios are preoccupied elsewhere.\n\nAs a result, worker unions and advocates say even when OSHA does get involved, the results have been poor. Gone are the days of rapid next-day inspections of fatalities. Instead, OSHA now conducts some inspections virtually, with many coming a week or more after the death occurred. A Department of Labor spokesperson said OSHA has conducted 10 virtual inspections following worker deaths.\n\nWorkers have noticed the difference. In 2019, OSHA issued a $180,000 fine to Noah's Ark, a beef processing plant in Hastings, Nebraska, after gaseous ammonia severely burned an employee. But when the coronavirus struck this spring, sickening dozens of workers and leaving one dead, the outcome was different.\n\nAccording to a federal lawsuit filed by three former Noah's Ark employees represented by the ACLU, at least two workers contacted OSHA in August to file complaints about the plant. Their complaints alleged a lack of distancing, that the company wasn't replacing soiled masks and that sick workers continued to report to the plant.\n\nOSHA didn't inspect the plant until September, and its investigation remains open. The agency has not fined or cited the plant. Without any changes, the ACLU escalated by filing a federal lawsuit. Mike Helzer, the plant manager, disputed the allegations in the lawsuit.\n\nThe workers are asking the court to do what OSHA has not – require basic protections against the spread of coronavirus.\n\nWe've talked to workers at a lot of different plants who feel like they have nobody whose job it is to advocate for their safety, outside of themselves and their unions, said Spencer Amdur, a staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. In meatpacking especially, OSHA has been so unwilling to take meaningful action.\n\nExperts point out that OSHA has cited just five meatpacking plants for COVID-19 violations, totaling $69,000 in fines.\n\nAsked about the figures, the agency said it has received 13,477 COVID-19 complaints across all industries since Feb. 1, and of those, 273 have led to citations and a total of $3.6 million in fines.\n\nBut those watching meatpacking plants, now notorious for their potential to be superspreader environments, said the five locations cited weren't enough to prompt the entire industry to provide the safest workplaces possible.\n\nIt is sort of arbitrary, Berkowitz said. When the exact same conditions exist in so many other meatpacking and poultry plants where workers died.\n\nEmployers decide\n\nExperts say the tug-of-war between companies and OSHA over reporting deaths and illnesses predates the pandemic.\n\nThe agency's legal reporting requirements at times conflict. One says that when the circumstances of an employee's death or illness are unclear, companies can evaluate and decide whether or not it must be reported to OSHA. But another rule says that in the instance of a heart attack, employers must report the incident to OSHA and let the agency decide if it is work-related.\n\nClyde Payne, a former area director for OSHA's regional office in Jackson, Mississippi, said historically, decisions often came down to how aggressively OSHA wielded its authority. He told employers that if any fatality occurred at their worksite, they had to report it. If they didn't, they risked being cited for a failure to report.\n\nIt was really my job to make the decision that it is or it isn't work related, Payne said.\n\nPayne and other experts say that policies OSHA instituted last year to clarify the rules for reporting COVID-19 incidents swung too far in the other direction.\n\nIn April, OSHA first released a policy that said only health care settings would have to report COVID-19 deaths, except in rare circumstances in other industries. After receiving pushback, the agency restored reporting requirements in May for most businesses. But, it explicitly empowered employers to decide what was workplace related.\n\nKeira Lombardo, chief administrative officer for Smithfield Foods, said that was no different than OSHA's prior approach.\n\nOSHA requirements and standards include a decision tree and guidance with multiple scenarios ... to assist with making determinations, Lombardo said.\n\nOthers see it differently, saying the May notice telegraphed that the agency would be unlikely to cite companies for failing to report a COVID-19 death.\n\nAdam Finkel, a clinical professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan and a former OSHA official, said the agency should have required reporting rather than letting employers decide what to report.\n\nThis is a recipe for missing most of the cases, he said.\n\nIn September, OSHA again updated its policies to say employers had to report COVID-19 hospitalizations only if they occurred within 24 hours of workplace exposures, and deaths within 30 days of exposure.\n\nExperts said that created an almost impossibly high bar with COVID-19 because it can be difficult to pinpoint exposure without contact tracing. Symptom onset often comes days after exposure, and hospitalization and death can occur weeks, if not months, later.\n\nJohn Newquist, a safety consultant who worked for OSHA for nearly three decades, said after the September memo, the fear is gone from employers.\n\nThe consequences have played out on the ground.\n\nAt a JBS plant in Marshalltown, Iowa, the League of United Latin Americans Citizens filed a complaint with Iowa OSHA on April 1, on behalf of workers who said there was a lack of distancing at the plant. In response, the agency sent a letter to JBS containing the allegations, which the company denied.\n\nAround that time, employee Jose Andrade-Garcia began experiencing shortness of breath. On April 17, he was hospitalized and put on a ventilator. He spent the last month of his life unresponsive before his death on May 15.\n\nJBS did not report Andrade-Garcia's death to Iowa OSHA. Asked why the agency did not cite the company for failure to report, Mary Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Department of Labor, said employers don't have to report COVID-19 cases if they can't determine whether they were related to work.\n\nIowa OSHA did open an inspection on May 21, six days after Andrade-Garcia's death and one day after his daughter, Maria Andrade, shared the family's experience with the Des Moines Register.\n\nMontgomery confirmed that media reports, not JBS' recording of a death, spurred Iowa OSHA's inspection.\n\nEven though an employee of JBS died from COVID-19, that in itself should not and did not impact the inspection process, Montgomery said.\n\nThe agency closed the inspection in June without issuing a citation. The agency evaluated JBS' due diligence to protect employees from occupational COVID exposure and found it in compliance with federal guidelines, Montgomery said.\n\nAndrade said Iowa OSHA never contacted her about the circumstances of her father's illness and death.\n\nOSHA had been in there and JBS had come back to OSHA stating that they were doing everything by the book, Andrade said, Which of course, it was questionable after what happened to Dad.\n\nUSA TODAY and the Midwest Center found more than two dozen meatpacking plants where workers died but OSHA did not conduct an inspection. To date, OSHA has fined just a single plant – Quality Sausage in Dallas – for failure to report a COVID-19 death.\n\nCompanies don't log deaths\n\nIn addition to reporting hospitalizations and deaths to OSHA, the agency requires companies to record incidents needing care beyond first aid on a 300 log kept on site.\n\nUnion officials say companies are leaving COVID-19 cases off those books, too.\n\nEric Reeder, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 293 in Nebraska, said he cross-checked known worker deaths against logs in six plants. He found that 11 deaths known to his union were not listed.\n\nThey're not reporting on their logs, Reeder said of the plants.\n\nFive deaths were at a JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, Reeder said. Three were at a pair of Smithfield facilities in Crete, also in Nebraska. Those facilities recorded outbreaks of more than 250 cases each this spring.\n\nAsked about the apparent discrepancies, a JBS spokesperson replied only that the company follows OSHA guidance and all applicable laws and regulations regarding the reporting of injuries and illnesses, including 300 logs.\n\nLombardo, with Smithfield, said the company conducts a thorough inquiry for each case of COVID-19.\n\nWe follow the OSHA standards and guidance while also ensuring that each case is fully reported to appropriate health agencies, she said.\n\nA U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said OSHA initiated two fatality inspections in Crete in June, based on media reports. One death was determined to be of natural causes, and the other investigation remains open. The agency opened a third inspection of a potential COVID-related fatality based on a public notification, which also remains open.\n\nFormer OSHA officials said they believe companies are hiding in the ambiguities of the agency's guidelines, and that it didn't have to be the case. Berkowitz said the agency would have been better off saying nothing at all.\n\nYou had OSHA saying, 'We're going to give you the benefit of the doubt that this isn't work related,' Berkowitz said. It was just bending over backwards to say we're not going to come after you.\n\nInadequate inspections\n\nCritics of OSHA say the agency's failings go beyond reporting requirements.\n\nIn April, OSHA and the CDC issued workplace safety recommendations to protect employees at meatpacking plants. CDC teams had just investigated major outbreaks at a Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and a JBS plant in Greeley, Colorado, to develop best practices.\n\nBut experts say the agencies undermined the effort by making their recommendations voluntary and filled with loopholes. The instructions urged 6 feet of distance when possible and modifying work lines to spread workers out if feasible.\n\nMark Lauritsen, director of food processing, meatpacking and manufacturing for the UFCW union, said OSHA should have required employers to spread workers out, provide proper protection and relax attendance policies to ensure safety.\n\nIf the system was working properly, OSHA would have issued an emergency standard, Lauritsen said, so that everybody in this country, meatpacking and other employers alike, would all know, 'Here are the minimums I have to do to make the workers safe from coronavirus and COVID-19.'\n\nIn May, OSHA issued a separate instruction that said for industries outside of health care, agency field directors must maximize the use of remote inspections via video conferences, phone interviews, faxes and emails.\n\nThat never existed, prior to COVID-19, Berkowitz said of remote inspections. It's invented.\n\nThose on the ground said they saw the quality of inspections change.\n\nAt a Maid-Rite processing facility in northeast Pennsylvania, workers filed a complaint with OSHA in May claiming an imminent danger in their workplace, a top priority that can lead to immediate inspection and correction.\n\nBut that didn't happen. At first, OSHA sent the company a letter. Then it did a virtual inspection, though the inspector testified during a court hearing that she didn't actually see the plant.\n\nWhen OSHA finally did perform an in-person inspection almost two months later, the agency gave Maid-Rite advance notice, which workers said allowed the company to temporarily improve conditions to pass muster. The danger returned afterward, they said.\n\nEmployees later filed a federal lawsuit against OSHA, asking a court to compel the agency to resolve the hazards alleged in their complaint.\n\nAsked during a hearing why OSHA took the unusual step of giving the plant advance notice of its visit, inspector Shannon Warner testified she and her supervisors had done a hazard analysis.\n\nOSHA has a right to protect their employees also, Warner said. I was going into a worksite with potential COVID-19 exposure.\n\nFor its part, the Department of Labor said OSHA by law can give up to 24 hours advance notice of a visit when special precautions are necessary. It added that OSHA investigates every allegation, including spending at least 1,200 employee hours inspecting the Sioux Falls and Greeley plants.\n\nAn OSHA field instructor and member of the American Federation of Government Employees, a federal workers union, told USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity that inspectors are in a tough position.\n\nThey are safety and health professionals that want to keep the American worker safe no matter the cost, the instructor said. However, those same inspectors don't want to contract the virus and then in turn bring it home to their families.\n\nLack of citations\n\nMore than 10 months into the pandemic, many critics of OSHA say one of the clearest signs of the agency's hands-off approach is the small number of COVID-19 citations and fines the agency has issued to meatpacking plants.\n\nAccording to its website, the agency has cited just five: the JBS plant in Colorado and another in Green Bay, Wisconsin; a JBS subsidiary plant in Cactus, Texas; the Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls; and Quality Sausage in Dallas.\n\nThe fines total $69,593, and each company is appealing.\n\nPeople are really not worried about getting cited, Newquist said. They know OSHA is overwhelmed, so they call it in and the most likely case is, 'Do you have a COVID program? Yes. Do you do this, this and this? Yes. OK, we're going to close the case. Thank you very much.'\n\nMost of the citations OSHA issued came under the general duty clause, a catch-all rule that says employers are required to provide a workplace free from known hazards. OSHA officials tout the rule as proof the agency can hold employers to account even though its COVID-19 guidelines are largely perceived as voluntary.\n\nBerkowitz noted the two most high profile general duty citations – of the Sioux Falls and Greeley plants – occurred in the runup to 2020 election. She believes they had more to do with politics than policy.\n\nPayne, the former OSHA area director, added that general duty claims are difficult to sustain in court.\n\nIt brings to the agency a higher burden of proof when you go to litigate the case, Payne said.\n\nAnd Amdur, with the ACLU, said the general duty citations present another problem. Because companies can challenge them, the citations can take months, or even years, to resolve. All along, dangerous conditions continue.\n\nOSHA's doing it in a way that guarantees it won't lead to any changes during the pandemic, Amdur said. They're saying even if you tell us that people are inches apart, breathing on each other with no masks and no barriers, indoors for hours at a time, we're still not going to take immediate action.\n\nWhat now?\n\nMany critics of OSHA have their eyes on the calendar. Union officials said they believe the incoming administration of President-elect Joseph Biden will offer a chance at a reset. They expect a more aggressive OSHA.\n\nLauritsen, with the UFCW, said that even though he feels his union has successfully worked with employers to institute safeguards even without OSHA, additional in-person inspections would offer backup.\n\nThe real value of an inspector is to bring those highly trained professional eyes into plants and say, 'Here's what you need to do,' Lauritsen said. And right now we don't have that.\n\nOthers are more pessimistic. Much of the damage is done they say; hundreds of workers have died.\n\nEarlier in the pandemic, when meatpacking plants were the primary drivers of coronavirus in many rural communities, it was easier to determine that positive cases were connected to a plant. Now that the virus is so widespread and crippling to rural communities across the country, experts say, it's impossible to separate the signal from the noise.\n\nFrom the beginning, (OSHA) said they're not going to investigate, said Marcy Goldstein-Gelb, co-executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health. They basically reneged on their responsibility and mission throughout.\n\nContributed: Tyler Jett, Des Moines Register\n\nThis story is a collaboration between USA TODAY and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe prisoner swap that freed four U.S.-Iranian citizens held on political charges in Iran also bought the freedom of U.S. convicts who illegally helped supply sensitive technology to Iran's military.\n\nThe four Americans, Washington Post Tehran bureau chief Jason Rezaian, retired U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, Pastor Saeed Abedini and Nosratollah Khosravi, were detained in Iran on national security charges, but their violations amounted to having the wrong kinds of friends, having served in the U.S. military and setting up churches.\n\nThe Iranians and Iranian-Americans released from U.S. prisons are technical experts who made millions of dollars providing restricted U.S. technology to Iran's military and aerospace industry, according to their indictments, the Justice Department and other reports.\n\nInternational sanctions against Iran lifted in landmark nuke deal\n\nThe swap came hours before the United Nations nuclear watchdog declared Iran has complied with its obligations under the nuclear deal reached in July.\n\nU.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in a statement that she is greatly relieved at the release of innocent Americans and hope that this will signal a true shift in relations that would include Iran living up to all international obligations.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described the prisoner swap as uneven and dangerous because he says it will help Iran develop missiles and nuclear weapons in the future.\n\nIran is subject to limitations on (the) purchase of nuclear and missile technology and needs expertise to evade these controls, Sherman said in a statement. Iran benefits from this deal by showing all those in its evasion network that if they get caught, they will be rescued.\n\nIran frees 'unjustly detained' reporter Jason Rezaian, 4 other Americans\n\nThe seven people being released from American custody will provide Iran with significant expertise in how to evade missile and nuclear control sanctions and how not to get caught next time, Sherman said.\n\nThe Islamic Republic News Agency identified the seven being freed from U.S. jails as Nader Modanlo, Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afghahi, Arash Ghahreman, Tooraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Saboun.\n\nModanlo, an Iranian-born naturalized American citizen, was sentenced in December 2013 to eight years in prison for helping Iran launch communications satellites, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nModanlo was a mechanical engineer trained at George Washington University who presented himself as an internationally recognized expert on strategic policy and finances affecting the space-based telecommunications industry. He claimed to have managed space and science programs for the Department of Defense, NASA and the industry, according to the Justice Department.\n\nA look at other Americans held, released by Iran\n\nHis company, Final Analysis, Inc. (FAI), arranged with an aerospace company owned by the Russian Federation to launch Iran's first-ever satellite, a remote sensing and telecommunications satellite from Russia, in October 2005.\n\nMechanic, Afghahi and Faridi are all Iranian-born businessmen who worked in the United States through a company in Houston. According to the Department of Justice, they worked to illegally procure U.S. military microelectronics and power supplies, which they sent to an Iranian company, Faratel, owned by Mechanic and Afghani.\n\nFaratel provided shopping lists of needed goods to Mechanic, Faridi and Afghani for purchase in the USA, according to a report on the April 2015 indictment by the Institute for Science and International Security.\n\nThe equipment was described in court documents as dual-use United States-origin microelectronics that Mechanic and others sought to illegally export to Iran, according to a report by the Washington Times.\n\nMechanic was convicted in 1987 of trying to export electronic devices used to develop guided missile tracking systems in violation of U.S. law that restricts the export of sensitive technology without an export license.\n\nGhahreman, who lived in Staten Island, N.Y., was convicted of violating U.S. export and money laundering laws through a scheme to purchase marine navigation and other military electronic equipment for illegal export to Iran.\n\nTrial evidence showed Ghahreman worked as an agent of an illegal Iranian procurement network, which used a front company in Dubai.\n\nGolestaneh was an Iranian university student who hacked into the computer system of a Vermont aerodynamics company to steal millions of dollars worth of software, according to federal authorities.\n\nTurkey deported Golestaneh to the United States in February to face the federal indictment, which alleges four felony counts of wire fraud and single counts of computer fraud and conspiracy to defraud the Vermont company.\n\nFeds: Iranian hacker targeted Vermont aerodynamics firm\n\nInformation on Saboun could not be found.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state notched almost a third of its coronavirus cases in December, an alarming bulge that echoed the warnings of medical experts who said the state would see some dark days before the widespread availability of a vaccine to fight the pandemic. Alabama saw 109,000 of its 361,226 confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases reported in December. The surge came after the Thanksgiving holiday, and health officials said they are concerned caseloads will continue to grow in January from the fallout of Christmas and New Year's gatherings. We are being overwhelmed right now, State Health Officer Scott Harris said. I believe, unfortunately, we are going to see even worse numbers than we have now, and the ones we have now are pretty bad. The cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases was 251,787 on Nov. 30 and rose to 361,226 cases Dec. 31. While there were some backlogged cases recorded in December, almost all of the reported cases were from December.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies Pfizer and Moderna. That figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in December. Thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in Alaska. Starting Monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. That group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can't be done remotely or postponed. Almost 50 Alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last Monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. That group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the Daily News reports. Alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last Monday.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Despite a surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Doug Ducey on Saturday rejected the state's top education official's call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. Given the severity of our state's situation and the virus's trajectory after the holiday period, schools need a two-week quarantine period for education leaders and local officials to use local health data to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities, Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman said in a Twitter thread. Hoffman called for the two-week quarantine period for schools after the Department of Health Services on Saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known COVID-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. However, Ducey spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the governor will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. This is a local decision. The online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: Kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely. Many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. There were 1,216 people in Arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. Arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. The Arkansas Department of Health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. Those case counts are down from Friday's record high, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on New Year's Day. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Hospitals struggling to provide enough oxygen for the sickest coronavirus patients in the Los Angeles area began to receive help Saturday when U.S. Army Corps of Engineers crews arrived to update their oxygen delivery systems. The collaboration comes as the six aging hospitals struggle to maintain oxygen pressure while treating an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. Some COVID-19 patients can require 10 times as much oxygen as a normal patient. California started the new year Friday by reporting a record 585 coronavirus deaths in a single day. The state Department of Public Health on Saturday reported another 386 deaths and more than than 53,341 new confirmed COVID-19 cases. More than 20,000 people were hospitalized as of Saturday with COVID-19; 4,500 of them were in intensive care, according to state records. The southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to the Mexico border. Hospitals are swamped, and intensive care units don't have any more beds for COVID-19 patients. Makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A day after Gov. Jared Polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. The governor cited improving statewide COVID-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including Denver and the entire Front Range, but his announcement Wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the Denver Post reports. It appears that if there's enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that's kind of frustrating, said Mark Johnson, executive director of Jefferson County Public Health. The announcement came a day after Colorado said it had confirmed the United States' first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. We don't believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with Christmas, New Year's or the new variant that is more infectious, Johnson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Some of the city's public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. Superintendent Iline Tracey announced on the district website Thursday that officials are preparing for a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model starting Jan. 19. The New Haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last March. Officials in New Haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in September as other districts in Connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. A plan to reopen New Haven's schools on Nov. 9 was shelved amid rising COVID-19 cases. Tracey said schools will open Jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district's schools. Two schools, Quinnipiac School and West Rock School, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, Tracey said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After health workers, long-term care staff and long-term care residents are inoculated, the next people to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the state will be front-line essential workers and residents 65 and older. Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, announced the state's decision during Gov. John Carney's weekly coronavirus press briefing Tuesday. Front-line essential workers include first responders such as firefighters and police, as well as teachers, U.S. Postal Service workers and grocery store workers. The group also includes corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, day care workers and public transit workers. But these people likely won't start getting the vaccine until mid- to late January due to the limited supply of the vaccine. Please be patient with us. There's just not enough vaccine for everyone right now, Rattay said, adding that employers need to start planning how they will administer their vaccine to workers. People who work in Delaware but live in a neighboring state will likely be eligible for the vaccine in Delaware because they will likely get it through their employer.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Curators Sam Vong and Shannon Perich at the National Museum of American History are collecting written submissions from people across the country describing how they experienced 2020, WUSA-TV reports. As historians, what we really want to do is document what's going on before it kind of escapes from us, Vong said. The Smithsonian museum has put out an open invitation to submit, with the hope that Americans' recollections will preserve for the future the experiences of a year that really was like no other. All of these stories will help people drill down or will open up new avenues of exploration and research, Perich said. The submissions can be mundane. What did it mean to sit in your home by yourself? asked Perich. The only way we're ever going to know the answer to that question is if people tell us. Or they can be extraordinary, like one of Vong's favorites so far from a former Bhutanese refugee who resurrected a grassroots media outlet to share information during the pandemic. The submission period opened in December and runs through March.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths Saturday. Florida's Department of Health did not release numbers on New Year's Day. The state has also chosen not to report COVID-19 cases on two other holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. The two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Florida to 1,354,833. The agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported Friday and 9,752 reported Saturday. The state's death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. On New Year's Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. Also on Thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department's HealthyFla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in England has been detected in a Martin County man with no recent travel history. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, which along with Miami-Dade and Broward counties have comprised the state's hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: As vaccines are being administered to health care workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, law enforcement and first responder agencies are in line to get them soon. Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey announced Wednesday that adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders were being added to Phase 1A – the highest-priority group eligible to receive vaccinations. Some Augusta-area firefighters and deputies have already started getting vaccinated. The Richmond County Sheriff's Office said some deputies were inoculated last week, and it is in the process of compiling a list of deputies interested in getting the vaccine. Dr. Stephen Goggans, the director of the East Central Health District, said the timeline for first responders and those 65 or older to get vaccinated was moved up because some parts of the state have already completed or are close to completing vaccinations for health care workers and long-term care facilities.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Residents have been warned to be extra vigilant and continue to follow safety guidelines as cases of a new, seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus have recently been reported in the U.S., health officials said. The Hawaii Department of Health, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there have been increased efforts to find the new variant and to understand how it is transmissible, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It has not been detected in Hawaii. Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strains have been found in the United Kingdom and South Africa and in the U.S. in Colorado, California and Florida. All we know is that we have not yet found it, State Laboratories Division Dr. Edward Desmond said. We're going to cast a wide net to see if we can quickly find it when it is here, and then we can make decisions about whether that should impact our community mitigation measures. The vaccines being distributed are thought to be effective against the new strain. Health officials have said about 25,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered statewide. Local pharmacies received a surprise shipment of 3,800 doses last week, boosting the total delivered in December to 65,250.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little plans to propose tax cuts and investments in transportation, education and water projects to lawmakers this month following another monthly revenue report that exceeded projections despite rising coronavirus infections and deaths. The Republican governor in a statement last month spent little time trumpeting the budget numbers and his fiscal conservatism as he has in the past during live news conferences. The latest numbers show a projected budget surplus of $630 million after November tax revenue came in $45 million higher than expected. For 2020, state revenues were ahead of projections by nearly $170 million, or 10.6%. Little warned that tax cuts and investments are threatened by the pandemic that could overwhelm hospitals with COVID-19 patients. Among those getting sick with the virus are health care workers, he said. Health and the economy are intertwined, Little said. Idahoans must choose to do a better job of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings with people outside their households if we are going to continue this trend.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state's public health department reported 29 COVID-19-related deaths Saturday, the smallest one-day total in Illinois since mid-November. Not only was the total, included in a news release from the Illinois Department of Public Health, lower than any single day since Nov. 13, but it is also just about a quarter of the 111 daily deaths the state has been averaging over the past two weeks. The latest numbers bring the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Illinois since the pandemic began to 16,674 and the number of cases to 975,352. The health department also reported that there were 4,762 new confirmed and probable cases, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 975,352. But the release included a potentially worrisome statistic as well. The cases that were detected among 61,987 tests submitted on New Year's Day helped raise the statewide average positivity rate over the past week to 8.3% from 6.8% a week ago, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among Hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state's top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. Many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by COVID-19 itself, Jennifer Sullivan, secretary of the state's Family and Social Services Administration, said during Gov. Eric Holcomb's weekly briefing Wednesday on the state's coronavirus response. That includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. Cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. As a way to help, Sullivan encouraged Hoosiers to use the state-run BeWellIndiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. Since April, more than 25,000 Hoosiers have completed those assessments. For more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, Sullivan said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge has rejected an argument by Tyson Foods that is is not liable in the death of a worker because it was following federal guidance when it kept meatpacking plants open during the coronavirus pandemic. Tyson was sued in August by the family of Isidro Fernandez, who worked at the company's plant in Waterloo, after he died April 26 from complications of COVID-19. More than 1,000 Tyson workers tested positive for the virus in May, and at least six died. The families of Fernandez and at least three other employees who died claim in lawsuits that the company was negligent in how it reacted to the pandemic. Tyson fired seven managers in December after an investigation found that supervisors held a betting pool on how many employees would test positive for the coronavirus. The Fernandez case was filed in state court but was moved at Tyson's request to federal court after the company claimed it was following the direction of federal officials, including President Donald Trump, when it remained open in April. But last Monday, U.S. District Judge Linda Reade rejected the argument.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state will rely on genetic tests to identify cases of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain that was first seen in England, the director of the state Department of Health and Environment said last week. No cases of the new strain have been detected in Kansas. Cases have been confirmed in Colorado, Florida and California. Dr. Lee Norman said Kansas already does genetic testing with about 1% of COVID-19 patients and plans to increase its lab capacity so it can do more tests. Norman told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that Kansas already has seen other variations of the virus that causes COVID-19, including a Utah strain and a Wisconsin strain. Viruses always change, kind of over time, with minor genetic variations. Mostly, they don't make much difference, Norman said. They're more alike than different, quite honestly. The state on Friday reported another 138 deaths from COVID-19 since Wednesday, for a total of 2,879 since the pandemic began. Kansas has confirmed 227,745 COVID-19 cases, an increase of 5,312 since Wednesday, the health department said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 22.7% as 18,408 cases were reported. The previous week had 14,999 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Kentucky ranked No. 24 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. The worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Boyle, Lawrence and Clinton counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Jefferson County, with 2,743 cases; Fayette County, with 1,170 cases; and Kenton County, with 702. Weekly case counts rose in 79 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week's pace were in Oldham, Hardin and Jefferson counties. The share of Kentucky test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.6% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don't begin until Monday and require a scheduled appointment. The Louisiana Department of Health said Friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 Moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. Still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which Neel described as a promising sign. With thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Protesters gathered outside the Maine Statehouse on Saturday to criticize how Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. WABI-TV reports the protest organized by the Swinging Gate Organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. There's this undercurrent of pent-up energy that's not doing well under this governor's rule, and it's important to harness that organic energy that's out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied, said event organizer Dick Campbell. More than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced Sunday. One additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. Just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on Dec. 19 to 528 on Saturday.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Maryland Department of Health is working with regional and federal partners to test patient samples for infection with the new variant of the coronavirus. The Baltimore Sun reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are collaborating with the state's public health lab, as well as state laboratories in California and Delaware, to test for the apparently more contagious variant. There have been at least two cases of the COVID-19 variant identified in the U.S., one in California and another in Colorado. A Maryland health department spokesman said the variant has not been detected in Maryland. The CDC has said medical professionals do not now believe that the new variant is more deadly than existing ones or that it will not respond to vaccines. But it could much more contagious and make the pandemic even harder to contain.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill Friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in Massachusetts to cover COVID-19 testing and treatment. It also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. Baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of COVID-19 on the health care system, among other steps. Meanwhile, a COVID-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at UMass Lowell last week instead will open Monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. While the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. Lowell General Hospital currently has 63 COVID-19 patients at its main campus.\n\nMichigan\n\nCalumet: A judge has ordered the shutdown of a cafe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula where customers have been supporting an owner who has defiantly served indoor diners despite coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration got a restraining order against Cafe Rosetta in Calumet, a small town in Houghton County. Since November, bars and restaurants in Michigan have been limited to carryout service or outdoor dining in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kristi Painter, a state food scientist, visited the cafe for an undercover exam and observed a busy place with 17 people eating or drinking. She ordered a cup of bean soup and a half turkey sandwich. I did not observe any signs encouraging mask use. … I observed a tip-jar like container that was labeled 'Legal Fund-join our fight to stand up for your rights,'  Painter said in a court filing. Cafe co-owner Amy Heikkinen, a mother of six, said she can't afford to limit her business to carryout orders. She said sales are up because of her dispute with authorities. It's my right to earn an income to protect and feed my family, she said. That's the right of every American. You can't make me not work.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state on Saturday reported 54 deaths from COVID-19, along with 2,543 positive coronavirus tests, in its final reporting period of 2020. The new numbers bring the state's pandemic death toll to 5,377 people. A total of 417,832 cases of the coronavirus were detected since the pandemic began. The Department of Health has reported a slowdown in new cases, with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by 48% over the past two weeks. In that period, the state reported one of the nation's lowest rates of new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. Gov. Tim Walz has kept a ban on indoor dining in place through the holiday period, but some businesses defied that order for New Year's celebrations. The attorney general has sued one such bar, Alibi Drinkery in Lakeville, for repeated violations of the order. Despite a court injunction ordering it to close, people packed into the bar for a New Year's party, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: A hospital is offering $5,000 bonuses for qualified nurses as it works to recruit staff during a pandemic and at a time when health care workers are in short supply. WCBI reports Baptist Memorial Hospital - Golden Triangle is offering a number of incentives including the bonus as it works to recruit amid a nationwide nursing shortage. Johnny Judson is responsible for recruiting nurses for the hospital. I am literally in every school, nursing school, in the area, including along the Alabama border, he told the station. I go up to north Mississippi, south Mississippi, and I go to these nursing schools, and I talk to these students. He said the country's nursing shortage has been going on for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse. The bonus is for registered nurses with at least two years of experience. Judson stressed that there are no shortcuts when it comes to hiring new staff. We put incentives in place to attract more people, but we don't lower the standards, he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The chairman of the Missouri Veterans Commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since September. Tim Noonan told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday that he was resigning, citing comments Gov. Mike Parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. A summary of the investigation was released earlier in December, but Noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the Post-Dispatch to release the full report. Officials inside Parson's administration and state Sen. Jill Schupp, a Democrat from Creve Coeur, had urged Noonan to release the full report, and he did so after Attorney General Eric Schmitt directed him to, Noonan said. That came after Parson on Wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. I'm not going to worry about everybody's personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman, Parson said. I'm just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that's my whole focus. Noonan said he resigned because of those comments.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana PBS has announced plans to renew a broadcast created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March to support schoolchildren who were learning remotely or in temporary quarantine. The new schedule for the Learn at Home broadcast was set to launch Monday and continue through the end of the school year June 4, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The shows run each weekday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and cover multiple subjects from language arts, social studies, science and math for elementary and middle school students. We know that not all households in the state have the same access to devices and a strong internet connection but that most homes have a TV that receives our broadcast signal, Montana PBS Director of Education Nikki Vradenburg said. Chief Operator Paul Heitt-Rennie estimated most households have tuned into the Learn at Home program. He said Nielsen data through the summer showed it was watched by up to 150,000 households, or up to 45% of households in the state. Every educator we talked to asked us to keep it going, Vradenburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. The Omaha World-Herald reports the Nebraska Restaurant Association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. The waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. This is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic, said Zoe Olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. Olson said the association's proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. The proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. But the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. When you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that's when you get increased harms, said Chris Wagner, executive director of Project Extra Mile, an Omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Community advocates and health officials are working to engage with the state's diverse communities and reach out in Spanish and other languages as Nevada lays plans for mass coronavirus vaccinations. Erika Marquez, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas public health professor and vice chair of the Nevada Minority Health & Equity Coalition, said merely translating information about the vaccine into other languages is not enough. We had to engage these communities in the conversation, and that takes some time, Marquez told the Las Vegas Sun. Nevada is a diverse state with a 29% Latino population that includes native Spanish speakers. Nevada also has a fast-growing group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders, of which 70% speak a language other than English at home, according to data shared by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. Marquez's coalition has been working throughout the pandemic to share information encouraging physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks with diverse communities and is preparing vaccine education materials in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Thai.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has set a goal of administering 100 shots per hour at each of the 13 state-run COVID-19 vaccination sites when it moves to Phase 2. Perry Plummer, the former assistant commissioner of safety, is overseeing vaccine distribution. He told WMUR-TV the goal is realistic, but it will take time to get the effort up to speed. We expect this to be a little bit of a windy road and to make sure we're ready to take turns wherever we need to, to make sure we can get people vaccinated in the State of New Hampshire as quickly as possible, Plummer said. The first phase of distribution has focused on health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and first responders. The second phase includes teachers, critical workers in high-risk settings, homeless shelter residents and others. As of Friday, more than 21,000 vaccines had been administered.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: More than 70% of the state's supply of COVID-19 vaccine had not been used as of Thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. Of the 265,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered to New Jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by Thursday afternoon. Despite months of planning, state officials said Wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. Remember, you need health care workers to do this, Gov. Phil Murphy said at a briefing. I'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. The slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 New Jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. State Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the rollout of the Moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before Christmas. Persichilli said 57% of the state's stockpile of Pfizer doses had been administered as of Wednesday, calling it one of the highest percentages that I've seen nationally.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: More than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. That's about half of the companies that applied, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The number (of applications) that we couldn't fund was very hard for us, said Marquita Russel, CEO of the New Mexico Finance Authority, the state agency that administered the program. The state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by New Mexico lawmakers. The program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. About $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state's four largest cities. Russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. In all, 6,530 applications were funded. Russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New York City Sheriff's Department shut down a series of illegal New Year's Eve parties for violating coronavirus restrictions, operating without a liquor license and other infractions, authorities announced Friday. More than 300 people gathered Thursday night for karaoke and dancing at an illegal bottle club on 58th Street in Queens, the department said on Twitter. Five people were charged with offenses including violating emergency orders that ban indoor gatherings, providing alcohol without a liquor license and obstructed egress. Deputies also raided an illegal gathering on Prince Street in Soho, where more than 145 people were partying in a space with no liquor license, the department said. Four people were charged with multiple offenses. The patrons were not wearing masks in the venue's overcrowded sixth floor. Deputy sheriffs also found nearly 80 people dancing and smoking hookah at Stars Hall in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. The organizer of the event was ticketed for violating an executive order.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: COVID-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with COVID-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state's hospitals. Two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. That's a difference of 793 people. On Friday, the last day for which data is available, the state's health department says 13.6% of COVID-19 tests came back positive. That brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least April. The average is seen as giving a better indication of COVID-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. Every day since Christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including Thursday's record-high 15.5%.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is prioritizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to those who speak Dakota and Lakota languages. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Mike Faith told KXMB-TV the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. It's something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. We don't have it in black and white; we tell stories. That's why it's so important, Faith said. The Standing Rock reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in North Dakota. Faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. Front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the Fort Yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. In addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. Tribal Health Director Margaret Gates said the Lakota and Dakota speakers are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Gov. Mike DeWine applies pressure to get COVID-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. Vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. In some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. Shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. Protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. This is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. This is a whole different operation, said Dr. Andy Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. On Wednesday, DeWine said he had grown impatient with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a moral imperative to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has reported more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases, as hospitalizations from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus remained near their all-time high. Oklahoma recorded 1,083 new confirmed cases of the virus Friday and another 38 fatalities, state health officials said Saturday. The Oklahoma State Department of Health has delayed reporting case counts over the holiday weekend. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. There were 1,910 people hospitalized with the virus in Oklahoma on New Year's Day, according to the department. The state's record was set last Monday, when there were 1,927 people with the virus in Oklahoma hospitals. Over the past week, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The worker, an employee at Wallowa Memorial Hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late Thursday. The health authority said vaccines for COVID-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, health officials said in a press release. An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen, or if they must go to the hospital. Health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south Philadelphia stomping grounds for a New Year's celebration of Mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd Street in South Philadelphia on Friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. Some wore masks, but many did not. Mayor Jim Kenney announced in July that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. Some Mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. City spokeswoman Lauren Cox said there were no major issues Friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic. She urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The first person to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in the state got his second shot Saturday. Dr. Christian Arbelaez, an emergency room physician at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, received his second dose without the fanfare that surrounded him nearly three weeks prior, the Providence Journal reports. The moment came as his workplace continues to treat a post-Thanksgiving wave of patients and is bracing for another wave after Christmas and New Year's Day. It's this perfect storm – can we take care of everyone? Arbelaez said. Do we have capacity? Do we have front-line workers well enough? Those are all the things that worry me. More than 20,500 people have received their first shots in Rhode Island, according to state health officials.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Administration announced Wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. Among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. The grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. The state had to turn down another several million dollars' worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. The volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. That delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, Frank Knapp, president of the state's Small Business Chamber of Commerce, told The Post and Courier. The monies were allocated by the Legislature in September to spend federal COVID-19 aid for South Carolina. The state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal judge says a state court can't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay a Codington County trial. U.S. District Judge Charles B. Kornmann also criticized South Dakota's response to the pandemic, saying it has done little, if anything, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Kornmann ordered that unless the Codington County state court resolves Matthew Kurtenbach's May 2019 case by Jan. 15, Kurtenbach will win a federal petition he filed claiming wrongful imprisonment and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. South Dakota cannot 'take advantage' of its own failures to follow scientific facts and safeguards in entering blanket denials of the rights of speedy trials, the judge wrote. Kurtenbach petitioned the court at least 25 times for a right to a speedy trial. At one point, Kornmann directly criticized Gov. Kristi Noem's actions during the pandemic. The Governor has steadfastly refused to impose a statewide mask mandate. She has often questioned publicly the scientific fact that mask wearing prevents the virus from spreading, the judge wrote.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Shelby County Health Department will begin vaccinating workers and residents at congregate care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, this week, the department said Saturday. The health department started vaccinating first responders with the Moderna vaccine Dec. 28 and is continuing to vaccinate law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, said spokesperson Joan Carr. Doug McGowen, chief operating officer for the City of Memphis, said there are 50,000 health care workers and 6,000 first responders in the Shelby County community, and it's going to take a while to get all of those individuals vaccinated. Some people in priority group 1a2, which includes funeral home workers and people who are 75 or older, have also been vaccinated by the health department. As of Saturday afternoon, all the available weekend appointments for vaccinations at the department's two drive-thru centers had been filled. The health department has also started vaccinating staff at mass COVID-19 testing sites.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly Saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. Texas reported 12,319 COVID-19 patients in hospitals Saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. But even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from Friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. Intensive care units in several parts of Texas were full or nearly full, with 626 ICU beds available statewide Saturday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 487 probable cases. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Texas came back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of COVID-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, Deseret News reports. The initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said Rich Lakin, immunization program director with the Utah Department of Health. We hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. Utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson Tom Hudachko said Thursday. More than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state Thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. What's making the difference, Hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. In Davis County, a mass drive-thru clinic at the Legacy Events Center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. At long-term care facilities, CVS and Walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.\n\nVermont\n\nStamford: The town has voted to overturn in its community Gov. Phil Scott's emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The select board of the town of about 800 people along the Massachusetts border voted 3-2 Tuesday to terminate the governor's restrictions. The three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of Vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. Select board member Daniel Potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. He asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. Scott hasn't enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, but that could change. Potvin said Friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of Vermont, but until it's cleared up, the governor's orders are still in effect.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State Sen. Ben Chafin has died after contracting the coronavirus, Senate Republicans said Friday. Chafin represented southwest Virginia and was from Russell County. A Republican, he was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2013 and then moved to the state Senate in 2014. He was 60. Lawmakers from around the state mourned Chafin's death late Friday. I knew Ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in Moccasin Valley, working the land just as generations of his family had done before him, Gov. Ralph Northam said. He loved the outdoors, and he loved serving people even more. Senate Republicans said in a statement: He served to ensure that his region and community, and the people he loved, would never be forgotten. Chafin is the first Virginia lawmaker to die from the virus.\n\nWashington\n\nVancouver: Quartz Mountain Distillers was surprised last week by a $14,060 fine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. Owner Randy Kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in April. The family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the Columbian reports. All distillers that made hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic were facing the fine. The Department of Health & Human Services on Thursday announced it was directing the FDA not to enforce the fine after the FDA received heavy backlash on social media. Small businesses who stepped up to fight COVID-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so, the Department of Health & Human Services said on Twitter. Kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. If the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. I'd just have to lock the door and walk away, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state has reported a weekly record in the number of positive coronavirus cases entering the new year. West Virginia had at least 6,915 confirmed virus cases for the six-day period last week, excluding Sunday, according to health statistics. Officials have cautioned that figures could be skewed due to a lag in reporting cases over the Christmas holiday period. Sunday's cases won't be reported until Monday. Still, the state had its three highest daily figures last week since the start of the pandemic: at least 1,385 positive cases Tuesday, 1,618 Wednesday and 1,516 Thursday. Last week's cases marked the ninth weekly record in the past 13 weeks. The previous record of 6,871 positive cases was set two weeks ago. There also were a record 810 people hospitalized for the virus Friday. As of Saturday there were a record 27,418 active cases of the virus statewide, up 57% in the past month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGrafton: What was initially thought to be a major human error of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the Aurora Medical Center Grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. A pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be useless to those who received them. On Dec. 26, Aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. After further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. On Wednesday, Aurora notified Grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. The pharmacist was arrested Thursday. The FBI and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were also investigating, police said. Jeff Bahr, president of Aurora Health Care Medical Group, called the pharmacist a bad actor. According to Grafton police, the now-former pharmacist intentionally took the vials out of the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing it would render the vaccines useless and make people who received them believe they were vaccinated when they were not.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Bars and restaurants across the state will be allowed to return to normal operating hours beginning next Saturday as COVID-19 hospitalizations decline in the state. Gov. Mark Gordon made the announcement last Saturday, praising businesses for adapting to health orders and thanking the people of Wyoming who recognized the strain on their hospitals and health care workers and acted accordingly, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. These have not been easy times for anyone, he said. We are not out of the woods yet, but continued personal safety measures while the vaccine is being distributed will enable our state's schools and businesses to continue to remain open. The updated health orders allow bars and restaurants to resume on-site consumption from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., and they allow gyms to increase the number of participants in group fitness classes from 10 to 25. Counties can still opt out of the requirements if local conditions move to safer levels in accordance with White House metrics.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — The Latest on Friday at the Australian Open (all times local):\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nAfter saving two match points and trailing 5-1 in the third set in her last match, there were no real dramas in the third round for Caroline Wozniacki.\n\nThe second-seeded Wozniacki beat Kiki Bertens 6-4, 6-3 to advance to a fourth-round match against Magdalena Rybarikova.\n\nWozniacki had to save four break points while serving for the match on Friday but clinched it on her fourth match point when Bertens' return of serve went long.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wozniacki won the last six games of her match with Jana Fett in the second round.\n\nThe former No. 1 Wozniacki is one of four players here who could overtake top-seeded Simona Halep for the No 1. ranking at the end of the Australian Open.\n\n_____\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nFrench Open champion Jelena Ostapenko is out of the Australian Open, beaten 6-3, 1-6, 6-3 by Anett Kontaveit in the third round at Melbourne Park.\n\nOstapenko won six out of seven games after an injury timeout following the first set to have her left thigh strapped.\n\nIn the third set, Kontaveit broke Ostapenko's service in the seventh game, held and then broke again in the ninth to end the match.\n\nIt continued Ostapenko's poor start to the season since hiring a new coach, Australian David Taylor. She lost in the first round at tournaments in Shenzhen and Sydney.\n\n_____\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nMarin Cilic has reached the fourth round of the Australian Open for the first time in seven years with a 7-6 (4), 6-3, 7-6 (4) win over Ryan Harrison.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Cilic made the round of 16 at Melbourne Park for four straight years from 2008-11, including a run to the semifinals in 2010, but hasn't returned since.\n\nCilic had 53 winners in the match, including 16 aces, and won 26 of 29 points at net.\n\nCilic next faces 10th-seeded Pablo Carreno Busta for a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\n____\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nNick Kyrgios won the last five points of the tiebreaker to beat 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (5), 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5) and remain with a chance of providing a first Australian male singles winner of the Australian Open in 42 years.\n\nTrailing 5-2 in the tiebreaker, Kyrgios went on a roll as Tsonga appeared to struggle with a knee issue.\n\nKyrgios is the last of nine Australian male players left in the singles draw. Mark Edmondson was the last Australian to win his national championship in 1976, although Lleyton Hewitt came close, losing the 2005 final to Marat Safin.\n\nThe 17th-seeded Kyrgios will play third-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round. Dimitrov beat Andrey Rublev in four sets earlier Friday.\n\n_____\n\n9:35 p.m.\n\nIvo Karlovic may have lost his third-round match at the Australian Open against Andreas Seppi, but he's still accomplishing new feats — at nearly 39 years old.\n\nThe big-serving 2.11 meter (6-foot-11) Croatian player smacked 50 aces in back-to-back matches for the first time in his career, hitting 53 in his five-set, second-round win over Yuichi Sugita and another 52 in Friday's five-set loss to Seppi.\n\nKarlovic fell just short of becoming the oldest player to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam since Jimmy Connors' run to the U.S. Open semifinals in 1991.\n\nHow does he keep doing it? Karlovic says it's simple: He hits the gym, lifts weights and runs.\n\nI always say that it's about the fitness level, he says. I don't feel any weaker than when I was 28.\n\nKarlovic's ranking has slid from No. 21 to No. 89 in the past year, but if he can keep it high enough to continue playing in ATP-level events, he could see himself sticking around for several more years.\n\nI think I can still do upsets here and there, so I like it still, he said.\n\n____\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nTop-seeded Rafael Nadal is through to the fourth round at Melbourne Park, beating Damir Dzumhur 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 in a night match at Margaret Court Arena.\n\nNadal, who lost the 2017 final here to Roger Federer, is attempting to win the Australian Open for the second time — the first was in 2009 — and add to his 16 major titles, second only among men to Federer's 19.\n\nIn the round of 16 on Sunday, the Spanish lefthander will play Diego Schwartzman, who beat Alexandr Dolgopolov in four sets earlier Friday.\n\n_____\n\n8:50 p.m.\n\nWill Smith made his Grand Slam debut on Friday night, taking a seat at Rod Laver Arena for a third-round Australian Open match between local hope Nick Kyrgios and 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\n\nThe actor briefly met Tsonga before the players walked onto the court.\n\nReally a great guy. Really sweet. Love his energy, Smith told former player Jim Courier in an interview aired on the Seven Network. Happy being here watching these guys play.\n\nSmith has spent 10 days in Australia taking a break before starting work on a movie.\n\nThis is the first time at the Open — this is my first Slam, said Smith, who planned to watch top-ranked Rafael Nadal on nearby Margaret Court Arena but decided to stick around on the main show court.\n\nHe is the second Hollywood personality at the Australian Open this week. Will Ferrell appeared in the crowd over the first few days, doing an on-court interview with Roger Federer.\n\n_____\n\n7:55 p.m.\n\nAndreas Seppi overcame Ivo Karlovic and the Croatian's 52 aces to advance to the fourth round with a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (5), 9-7 win that spanned 3 hours, 51 minutes.\n\nThe 33-year-old Seppi clinched the match with a break of the 38-year-old Karlovic's service, only his second break of nine attempts during the match. Seppi saved both break points against him.\n\nSeppi plays Kyle Edmund of Britain in the fourth round. Edmund also had a five-set win Friday, beating Nikoloz Basilashvili in 3 hours, 34 minutes.\n\n_____\n\n6:10 p.m.\n\nThird-seeded Grigor Dimitrov has advanced to the fourth round at Melbourne Park, beating Andrey Rublev 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a Rod Laver Arena match which concluded the day session on the main show court.\n\nAfter beating qualifiers in his first two matches, Dimitrov had a much more difficult time against the 30th-seeded Rublev. Serving for the match, Dimitrov faced a break point before advancing on his first match point, clinching it with a winner off a Rublev drop shot.\n\nDimitrov will next play the winner of Friday night's match on Rod Laver between local hope Nick Kyrgios and 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the round of 16.\n\n_____\n\n4:40 p.m.\n\nCoco Vandeweghe has been hit with the largest fine of the 2018 Australian Open so far — a $10,000 penalty for unsporting conduct for screaming an obscenity at her first-round opponent, Timea Babos.\n\nVandeweghe said after the match that she was irritated by what she described as excessive celebrating by her Hungarian opponent during their match.\n\nThe 10th-seeded Vandeweghe was assessed a code violation for the obscenity and delay of game for insisting on eating a banana during a changeover, getting docked a point in the second set of her 7-6 (4), 6-2 loss.\n\nBorna Coric has received the largest fine thus far in the men's draw — $5,000 for shattering his racket during his first-round loss to John Millman.\n\n____\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nThe worst of the extremely hot temperatures appears to be over at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe forecast high of 42 Celsius (108 Fahrenheit) was never quite reached, with the temperature hitting 40.3 C (104.5 F) before a weather change came through that cooled things off, somewhat.\n\nWithin an hour, the temperature had starting dropping. At 3 p.m. it was 35.6 C (96 F).\n\nAlize Cornet took a medical timeout and had her pulse and blood pressure checked during her match with Elise Mertens when the French player complained of shortness of breath.\n\nBut after being iced down by a trainer, she continued her match.\n\n____\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nElina Svitolina has ended 15-year-old Marta Kostyuk's strong run at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Svitolina beat her fellow Ukrainian 6-2, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena to advance to the fourth round.\n\nKostyuk, who had nine double faults Friday, including on match point, received entry into qualifying because of her junior girls' victory last year at the Australian Open. She won all three qualifying matches, then her first two in the main draw.\n\nHer win over Peng Shuai in the first round made her the youngest player to win a main-draw match at the Australian Open since Martina Hingis in 1996.\n\nKostyuk entered the tournament ranked No. 521. A Women's Tennis Association official said Friday her ranking should improve to around 250 because of her performance at Melbourne Park.\n\n_____\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nPetra Martic celebrated her 27th birthday with a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 win over Luksika Kumkhum to advance to the fourth round at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe Croatian player will take on Elise Mertens or Alize Cornet in the final 16.

When play began at 11 a.m., it was already 35 C (95 F).\n\nOn Thursday, officials were criticized when play continued after the temperature reached 40 C (104 F), and several players, including Gael Monfils, complained it should have been stopped.\n\nThe tournament has an Extreme Heat Policy which goes into effect when the air temperature exceeds 40 Celsius and the wet-bulb reading, which takes into account other factors such as humidity, is more than 32.5 C (91 F).\n\nWhen both those temperatures are exceeded, matches on outside courts are supposed to be suspended and the roofs closed on all three main stadiums — Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena and Hisense Arena.\n\n_____\n\nMore AP coverage: www.apnews.com/tag/AustralianOpen
Princeton businesswoman Michelle Lambros Pirone opened her summer home on Long Beach Island in August 2018 to congressional candidate Jeff Van Drew so that local Democrats could open up their wallets.\n\nShe invited friends, neighbors and stalwarts from the Democratic Club of Long Beach Island to mingle with Van Drew, a Cape May County state legislator who was poised to be the first Democrat to seize the sprawling 2nd Congressional District in South Jersey in nearly a quarter of a century.\n\nVan Drew talked about the need to defeat his Republican opponent, Seth Grossman, who had been shunned by the state and national party over racially charged remarks, she said. But Van Drew also touched on the elephant-in-the-room issue that was stoking Democratic Party fury: Donald Trump.\n\nHe trashed his opponent more than Trump, but it was all in the same vein, Pirone said. It was about how we needed to put up a fight against Trump and Trumpism and where the direction of the country was going.\n\nLast month, Van Drew pivoted in a different direction. He joined the Republican Party and pledged his undying support for Trump, thrusting the once quiet, below-the-radar South Jersey district into the center of the national debate over the potential perils and payoffs of Trump's impeachment for both parties.\n\nNew Jersey Democrats are now lashing out, furious that the Jeff Van Drew that they nurtured and protected with money and political muscle during his three-decade climb from Dennis Township committeeman to Congress has morphed into a Trump enabler.\n\nTo many Democrats, Van Drew's party switch goes far beyond the rank opportunism that often prompts such a move. Van Drew is now propping up a reckless president who poses as an existential threat to democracy itself, they argue. And he's aiding and abetting Trump with their donations, they say.\n\nVan Drew formally defected the day after voting against impeaching Trump. He was one of only three House Democrats to break ranks.\n\nYeah, I want a refund,'' Pirone said of the event, which netted a modest haul of $2,500 to $3,000 in small donations.\n\nJohn Kostopoulos, president of the Democratic Club of Long Beach Island, succinctly put it this way: I gave money to him to represent the Democratic Party, not take the money to buy advertisements as a Republican with my money.\n\nDemocratic chairmen of the eight South Jersey counties also fired off a statement last month, demanding an immediate refund of every dime he raised from Democrats since he sold out in December.\n\nTrending news:Penn Station expansion plan to include 8 new tracks, increasing capacity by 40 percent\n\nMore Stile:Whether you know their names or not, keep an eye on these NJ politicos in 2020\n\nHis refusal to do the right thing would only prove he's nothing more than a Bernie Madoff-style con artist stealing other people's money in a scheme to fill his campaign coffers,'' they fumed in a joint statement.\n\nAtlantic County Democratic Party Chairman Michael Suleiman didn't narrow the demand to Van Drew's post-defection donations. He said Van Drew should return it all, although he doubts that's going to happen. While it was Van Drew's prerogative to vote no on impeachment, Suleiman should face the music from the people who supported you.\n\nYou took our money, we knocked on doors for you, we made phone calls for you, but you're going to tuck your tail between your legs?'' he said in an interview with NJTV last week. That's ridiculous.\n\nVan Drew did not respond to messages seeking comment on Monday. His federal campaign account reported $932,000 on hand as of Sept. 30. He is under no obligation to return money to aggrieved donors, campaign finance experts say, although it's not unprecedented.\n\nThe late U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania agreed to return donations upon request when he switched from the Republican Party to the Democrats in 2009. Many took him up on the offer.\n\nVan Drew was a conservative Democrat from South Jersey who was often given a pass from party-line votes on sensitive, progressive legislation during his tenure in the state Legislature, on the grounds that those votes could harm his chances at reelection.\n\nTo many, Van Drew was adopting the same logic as a first-term congressman, fearing that a vote for impeachment was unpopular in his district. He argued that the issue was doomed to die in the Republican Senate and diverted attention away from priorities voters cared about.\n\nBut he was caught in a tight squeeze: Internal polling showed that a no'' vote could destroy his chances of winning the Democratic nomination. And some Democratic leaders, like Suleiman, made it clear that he would not tolerate Van Drew's no vote.\n\nSo Van Drew jumped ship. And he is taking the money with him.\n\nVan Drew is staked with other valuable benefits that may come in handy in a likely primary this spring. Trump's campaign dispatched former Trump White House political director Bill Stepien to help run Van Drew's campaign. Stepien has a deep knowledge of New Jersey's political landscape, having served twice as former Gov. Chris Christie's campaign manager.\n\nA pro-Trump political action committee is also planning to run $200,000 worth of television ads for Van Drew and $50,000 in digital ads. And then, of course, there is Trump, whose blessing will likely give Van Drew an edge against challengers in the June Republican primary. The Trump campaign announced Monday that the president will hold a Jan. 28 rally in Wildwood, at the southern end of Van Drew's district.\n\nYet, to Pirone, the switch is still baffling. In her eyes, the fundraiser was the start of a budding political relationship. After the fundraiser, Van Drew invited Pirone to a luncheon in Philadelphia with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. She became familiar with his staff.\n\nPirone noted that Van Drew was a little more conservative from where I am on the spectrum, but a Democrat nonetheless. She was willing to support him to help Democrats reclaim the House and capture a seat represented by Republican Frank LoBiondo, who was stepping down after 24 years.\n\nCertainly, if I had any inkling, I would have never done anything for him, let alone host a fundraiser,'' said Pirone, who was elected to the Princeton Borough Council in November.\n\nOther Democrats also had a nuanced view of Van Drew.\n\nKostopoulos recalled meeting with Van Drew with a small group three weeks before the switch to discuss climate change policy. Van Drew named one of the members to his advisory panel, Kostopoulos said.\n\nAlthough we suspected that he wasn't a 100 percent Democrat, he was doing the right thing here and there,'' he said. His record was not bad.\n\nKostopoulos was among the guests at Pirone's event last year. He doesn't remember much of what Van Drew said beyond some general remarks. But one moment stands out.\n\nI remember handing him ... an envelope with checks, which he took graciously, Kostopoulos said.\n\nEmail: stile@northjersey.com Twitter: @politicalstile
Adam Shell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNotwithstanding the Dow's nearly 400-point rally Friday, Wall Street is more than happy to bid good riddance to a dismal January and spin the dice on things getting better in February and beyond.\n\nThe first month of the new year was far from a happy one for investors. Doom and gloom prevailed, with major stock indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average, off 5.5% this month, and Standard & Poor's 500, down 5.1%, posting their biggest January losses since the financial crisis in 2009. It would have been worse had the broad U.S. market not surged 2.5% on the final day of trading due to an interest-rate cut in Japan and strong earnings in the U.S.\n\nBy now, the litany of fears that spooked investors and sparked selling are well-known: plunging oil prices; slowing growth in once-booming China; angst surrounding the number of coming interest-rate hikes this year from the Federal Reserve at a time when the global economy is wobbly and investor confidence shaken.\n\nEconomy grew just 0.7% in Q4\n\nHistory says the January dive could bode poorly for stocks for the rest of the year. The January Barometer — a phrase coined by The Stock Trader's Almanac, which states that as the S&P 500 goes in January, so goes the year — has a strong accuracy rate of more than 75%.\n\nAlso worth noting is that February has a history of flat performance for the blue-chip stocks in the Dow, according to Bespoke Investment Group. In the past 100 years, the Dow has risen just 0.1% on average in February, ranking 11th out of 12 months.\n\nStill, while Wall Street pros debate whether the final correction low has been put in, and most money managers see continued volatility ahead, there is also a silver lining when stocks crater as much as they did in January.\n\nWhat is happening is the market is repricing for a slower growth pattern, says Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust. And although Cecilia thinks this process could drag on for three to six months longer, he isn't sending an apocalyptic message. At this point, we don't see the pre-conditions for a bear market (or drop of 20% or more).\n\nThe good news is the big sell-off has made the stock market less expensive.\n\nWhat Wall Street wants is clarity on the headwinds that are keeping traders up at night, says John Jares, senior portfolio manager at USAA Investments.\n\nWhere that bottom ends up is still to be determined, but it likely won't happen until the major uncertainties hovering over the market settle somewhat, Jares noted in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nAfter the January swoon, the level of downside risk has lessened, says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. The S&P 500's pricey valuation based on its past 12-month earnings has been trimmed by more than 10%, with many sectors seeing their price-to-earnings ratios reduced 11% to 26%.\n\n19 big companies' profits are about to vanish\n\n(We) believe the downside risk this year from current levels is now probably less than upside potential through year-end, argues Paulsen, who believes the S&P 500, which closed Friday at 1940.24, will trade in a range of 1800 to 2200 this year. This correction has significantly improved valuation.\n\nFor the market narrative to shift away from doom and gloom, investors want to see a few things, says Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. His list: price stabilization in the oil patch; data that debunk fears that China's economy is in free fall and the U.S. is headed for recession; reassurances from Fed Chair Janet Yellen when she testifies before Congress in a few weeks that the central bank won't risk choking off the U.S. recovery with an overly aggressive interest-rate-hike policy; and more good earnings news in the next few weeks outside the battered energy and industrial sectors.\n\nI think we will see improvement, says Arone. The market has overshot to the downside and fears got exaggerated.
USA TODAY\n\nA+ Still Not Hillary: Last year, I graded President Trump as an A+ because he was doing an outstanding job of not being Hillary Clinton. A year after his inauguration, he's even more not-Hillary. And the childish and irrational effort by Democrats to escape into fantasies of undoing the 2016 election via impeachment or 25th Amendment medical disability demonstrates that their party isn't ready to govern anytime soon. Aside from not being Hillary, Trump has some actual accomplishments, and not just in terms of judicial appointments.The tax bill passed, the economy is already benefiting, and the results are already showing up in workers' paychecks. Trump has exceeded his goal of undoing two regulations for every new regulation passed, and he's on track to shrink the federal government significantly — though not enough — in his first term. As a libertarian, my expectations for Trump were pretty modest, and in this respect, he has already surpassed them. And, with Trump in the White House, the plague of sexual abuse in the news and entertainment worlds has been brought to light, when it almost certainly would have been kept quiet under Hillary so as to avoid embarrassing associations with Bill Clinton's past offenses. Every day when Trump wakes up, he's not Hillary, and that's the main reason he is in the White House now.\n\n— Glenn Reynolds, University of Tennessee law professor. @instapundit\n\nA- Docked from straight A: What Trump has given us during his first year in office is dazzling — a raft of federal judicial nominees (starting with Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court) who actually believe in interpreting the Constitution as written instead of plucking brand-new fundamental rights out of thin air; renewed economic optimism and low unemployment via tax reform; and the dismantling of crippling regulations. But what has really earned Trump his top-tier grade is that laundry list of dismal pen-and-phone leftovers from the Obama years that we don't have to put up with anymore. Title IX campus kangaroo courts lacking the basics of due process for your college-student son accused of rape after a date went badly? No more. (Thanks, Betsy DeVos.) Forcing K-12 public schools to let biological males use the girls' bathroom? Gone. (Thanks, Jeff Sessions.) No more Paris climate agreement. No more super-secret, U.S.-jobs-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. No more catch and release for illegal immigrants. No more forcing nuns to buy birth control under Obamacare. In fact, as looks likely, no more Obamacare, period. I do feel obliged to dock Trump's A grade a notch over the panic that ensued when he dangled amnesty for 800,000 illegal-immigrant dreamers to whom President Obama extended the welcome mat, and he entertained even the possibility of accepting the Gang of Six bill promoting chain migration. Fortunately, that plan blew up and now seems to be safely down the shithole.\n\n— Charlotte Allen, columnist for First Things magazine. @MeanCharlotte\n\nB- Can't stay out of his own way: For a newcomer to the game of politics, Trump has shown himself to be quite skilled at it. He took time out from battling with a biased and hostile media to rack up a respectable list of accomplishments, even at the cost of some controversy — putting Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, backing off the Iran deal, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and pulling off the Band-Aid of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, pressuring Congress to come up with a permanent fix for dreamers, etc. But Trump also showed repeatedly that he is his own worst enemy by saying, doing and, yes, tweeting the wrong thing. His tacky comments about how the United States takes in too many immigrants from shithole countries is just the latest example. More will come. Trump can't help himself and, with every outrageous spasm, he hurts his presidency and its agenda.\n\n— Ruben Navarrette, syndicated columnist with The Washington Post Writers Group. @RubenNavarrette\n\nC Stuck with the lout: What do you do with a student who disrupts class on those rare days he bothers to show up, skips quizzes, turns in plagiarized term papers, and doodles in the margins instead of answering the essay questions on the final? Any sane teacher would flunk him, but from time immemorial there have been exceptions to that rule. What do you do with the lazy kid whose dad bought his way in with a flurry of vital donations? Generations of sane teachers have given those kids a C and hoped never to see them again. The cost of giving him the F he deserves is just too high for the teacher. Let's face facts — Trump has been that kid since his daddy's money set him up to succeed in business. Now he is blessed with a right-wing media that keeps shouting he deserves an A, a Republican Party apparatus willing to look the other way and an indifferent electorate still looking for the easy way out. We're stuck with this lout and the C he totally doesn't deserve.\n\n— David Mastio, deputy editor of USA TODAY's editorial page. @DavidMastio\n\nD+ President Pence: Trump has defied all odds to survive a year as president of the United States, and he did it mostly by copying off of Mike Pence's paper. You could spend all your executive time trying to name a policy or an appointment that would be different right now if the current vice president weren't in the Oval Office — from gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to attempting (and failing) to ban transgender soldiers to Neil Gorsuch. The protectionism that Trump trumpeted on the campaign trail has been hot air, and most of the alt-right bloggers have been run out of the White House. Trump's cruel deportation regime and useless Muslim ban may be his only distinctive contributions to his administration — besides his general unfitness, his rampant corruption and his odd allegiances with the country that hacked our elections. But as long as Trump keeps turning in Pence's work, who's going to bother checking him? Certainly not a GOP Congress.\n\n— Jason Sattler, a columnist for The National Memo. @LOLGOP\n\nF Hideous stain: It only took one year for Trump to earn the position of worst president in American history. His singular achievement is to allow all previous candidates for that dubious honor to move up at least a notch in the ranking. Each of them — presidents like Millard Fillmore, James Buchanan and Franklin Pierce — had his own flaws and shortcomings. Trump displays all of their various flaws and shortcomings in both high intensity and combination, adding a large cluster of his own defects to the mix. In an office that demands integrity, intelligence and leadership, Trump has given us ignorance, dishonesty, greed, impulsivity, inexperience, nepotism, racism, bigotry, misogyny, cowardice, irresponsibility, irrationality and, not least, butchery of the English language. Whether this 71-year-old man can grow, learn or change seems more unlikely than ever. What is certain beyond doubt is that Trump has already left a hideous stain on American history. Erasing it will be the work of generations.\n\n— Gabriel Schoenfeld, senior adviser to the 2012 Romney for President campaign. @gabeschoenfeld\n\nF Season 1: Even grading Trump on a curve, it's impossible for me to give him a passing grade. He ends his first year embroiled in a debate over exactly what racist phrase he used to slander entire countries, leaning on a doctor's assurance that his seeming madness is not due to cognitive decline, and fending off reports that he paid a porn star hush money. His one big legislative achievement — a massive tax cut — may conceivably boost economic growth but will almost certainly boost economic inequality and definitely increase the national debt. It is far from the boon to the middle class that Trump promised, and it is not a big enough accomplishment to elevate his presidency to greatness, especially in light of his own words and actions that have dragged the office into the gutter. Americans deserve better than a president longing for reluctant Norwegians to contribute their whiteness to America as he insults people of color at home and around the globe.\n\n— Ellis Cose, author of The Rage of a Privileged Class. @EllisCose\n\nF Season 2: Season 1 of President Trump, the Reality TV Show ended with lots of explosive potential plots for Season 2. Will Trump trigger a shooting war with North Korea and/or Iran, or just a trade war over NAFTA? Will Trump purge the FBI of non-supporters, and make the remaining staff swear personal allegiance to him? How low can the GOP stoop in groveling to Trump? How will the Mueller investigations end? How many other porn stars signed non-disclosure agreements with Trump? Did Trump say shithole or shithouse, and why is this difference important? Will Trump and the GOP officially come out as the party of authoritarian white supremacy? Most interesting of all is the plot line lurking in the wings. Season 2 might end with a real cliffhanger — large scale Russian intervention in the November 2018 election helping the GOP to victory, leaving our political system teetering towards implosion. Do we have enough popcorn for (at least) three more years of this?\n\n— Steven Strauss, a visiting professor at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. @Steven_Strauss
Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan made waves Wednesday with an historic announcement that they would step back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family.\n\nThe royals said they intend to work to become financially independent while continuing to fully support his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. . We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honor our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages, their statement said.\n\nBut what does that mean? We're answering all your burning questions about what could be next for the couple shaking things up in the royal family.\n\nWhy are Harry and Meghan 'stepping back'?\n\nThey haven't voiced exactly why. But the decision comes after the couple's vocal frustration with British media coverage of their family, including lawsuits against three British tabloids for alleged mistreatment, including copyright infringement, invasion of privacy and phone hacking.\n\nIn October, Prince Harry, 35, and Duchess Meghan, 38, appeared in ITV's documentary, Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, and opened up about their struggles coping with overwhelming and often critical media coverage. Harry also voiced his lingering resentment over how his mother, Princess Diana, was treated by the media before her 1997 death.\n\nMeghan, who at one point in the interview teared up, said she had tried and failed to acquire a traditional British stiff upper lip and regrets discounting her British friends' warnings and her own underestimation of British tabloids' zeal.\n\nI never thought that this (media scrutiny) would be easy, but I thought it would be fair. And that's the part that's really hard to reconcile, she said.\n\nWhat does Queen Elizabeth II have to say about Harry and Meghan's decision?\n\nAbout an hour after their announcement, another palace announcement, sent in an email from the office of the private secretary and the spokesperson for Queen Elizabeth II, landed in media inboxes. It suggested fraught times ahead.\n\nDiscussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage, the statement said carefully. We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\n\nThe 93-year-old monarch moved Thursday to take control of the situation. Britain's national news agency, Press Association, reported that the queen had ordered officials representing the monarch, Charles, Prince William, and Harry and Meghan to meet and find workable solutions within days not weeks.\n\nHarry and Meghan wish Kate a happy birthday via Instagram after their decision to step back\n\nWhat does 'stepping back' as a senior royal entail?\n\nThe use of the term stepping back is the same phrase that was used by Prince Andrew in November when he announced he had gotten permission from the queen to step back from public duties for the foreseeable future amid scandal over his involvement with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHarry and Meghan haven't gotten into specifics on what their scaled-back roles will look like, though they still plan to focus on charity endeavors.\n\nAnd the move doesn't mean they stop being royal. Harry is sixth in line for the throne and that doesn't end with his announcement.\n\nThey also announced they'll break another longtime tradition and no longer participate in the palace's Royal Rota system of inviting long-standing U.K. outlets to report exclusively on their activities. Their new media policy will invite a wider array of credible media outlets focused on objective and appropriate coverage. They noted in a pointed message that they value privacy as individuals and as a family.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess believe in a free, strong and open media industry, which upholds accuracy and fosters inclusivity, diversity and tolerance, the new Sussex Royal website states.\n\nWhat does it mean to be financially independent?\n\nThe Duke and Duchess say they're parting ways with the Sovereign Grant, money from British taxpayers that supports the queen and senior royals for public duties, that makes up 5% of the Sussex office's total costs.\n\nWhat will apparently continue: Money from Harry's father, Prince Charles, who has supported their private life and the other 95% of their office. And Meghan made plenty of money as an actress on Suits, while Harry inherited a considerable amount of money from his mother which has likely grown since 1997.\n\nThe couple also recently made headlines for publishing a trademark for their Sussex Royal brand, a move that could theoretically pave the way for Harry and Meghan merchandise. It could simply be a measure to block others from producing unofficial knockoff products, but it also gives the royals ample room to create branded items themselves.\n\nThe trademark covers a myriad of goods and services, including books, magazines, posters, apparel, charity campaigns, fundraisers, classes, training, sporting activities and counseling services.\n\nWhat are Harry and Meghan thinking? They don't want to be 'senior royals' anymore?\n\nWhere will Prince Harry and Meghan live?\n\nWe don't know yet. All their release said was they plan to split their time between the U.K. and North America. By North America, they could mean Canada or the U.S. (They're not likely to choose Mexico, also part of North America.) There are pros and cons to either country for the pair. Or, they could choose to spend time in both.\n\nWhile in the U.K., Harry, Meghan and baby Archie will still use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Castle estate as their official residence, though it will continue to be property of the queen, according to the Sussex website.\n\nWhen it comes to potential North American locations, Harry and Meghan have ties to both Los Angeles and Canada. L.A. is where Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, lives. Canada, in addition to being one of the largest of the U.K.'s 53 Commonwealth nations, is where the Duchess spent seven years living in Toronto while acting on the TV show Suits. Canada is also where the Sussexes spent time off over the holiday break.\n\nThis geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity, the couple's statement said.\n\nDuchess Meghan's dad, celebrities and fans express shock over her, Harry's 'major' step back\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson, The Associated Press
AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — AL MVP Mookie Betts, NL Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom and major league home run champion Khris Davis reached high-priced one-year deals to avoid salary arbitration, while slugger Nolan Arenado and pitchers Gerrit Cole, Luis Severino and Aaron Nola were among 15 players still on track for hearings.\n\nBetts and the World Series champion Boston Red Sox agreed to a $20 million, one-year contract on Friday, a $9.5 million raise that topped pitcher Max Scherzer's $8.8 million hike from Detroit in 2014.\n\nBetts' standard didn't last the day, broken when deGrom and the New York Mets agreed at $17 million, a $9.6 million increase.\n\nCleveland shortstop Francisco Lindor, eligible for the first time, got an even bigger raise. His salary went up more than $9.9 million, from $643,200 to $10.55 million.\n\nDavis and the Oakland Athletics reached a $16.5 million deal, a $6 million raise after he hit 48 home runs with a career-high 123 RBIs.\n\nArenado asked for a record $30 million in arbitration from Colorado and was offered $24 million. He will top the record for a salary for an arbitration-eligible player, a $23 million deal last year by Toronto and third baseman Josh Donaldson.\n\nAmong the 157 players eligible for arbitration at the start of the day, 142 reached deals on the busiest day of the offseason. All were for one year, though Milwaukee catcher Manny Pina's agreement included a team option for 2020.\n\nThere will be fewer hearings this winter than last year, when players won 12 of 22 cases argued — the most since 24 in 1990.\n\nWashington reached an $18.8 million deal with third baseman Anthony Rendon, who got a $6.5 million raise, and Chicago White Sox slugger Jose Abreu agreed at $16 million, a raise of $3 million.\n\nBoston also reached deals with shortstop Xander Bogaerts for $12 million and outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. for $8.55 million.\n\nSuspended shortstop Addison Russell and the Chicago Cubs agreed to a $3.4 million, one-year contract, a relatively small $200,000 raise for a player whose relationship with the team appeared strained after a domestic violence suspension.\n\nRussell accepted a 40-game suspension last October for violating baseball's domestic violence policy following allegations made by his ex-wife. He missed the final 11 regular-season games plus the wild-card playoff loss and will be eligible to return May 3, barring postponements.\n\nRussell will lose pay during the suspension. He can earn an additional $600,000 in roster bonuses if he is on the active roster for up to 150 days.\n\nCubs third baseman Kris Bryant agreed to a $12.9 million, one-year deal, a raise from $10.85 million.\n\nAmong the players still on track for hearings, Cole asked Houston for $13.5 million and was offered $11,425,000; and Trevor Bauer asked Cleveland for $13 million and was offered $11 million. Bauer won his hearing last winter.\n\nTwo first-time eligible starting pitchers didn't reach deals: Severino asked for $5.25 million and was offered $4.4 million by the New York Yankees, and Aaron Nola requested $6.75 million and was offered $4.45 million by Philadelphia.\n\nTraded to Cincinnati by the Los Angeles Dodgers, Alex Wood asked the Reds for $9.65 million and was offered $8.7 million.\n\nHearings are scheduled for Jan. 28 to Feb. 15 in St. Petersburg, Florida. While many teams say they have a file and trial strategy for players who don't reach deals before the exchange, some of with pending cases may settle.\n\nSome of the gaps are relatively modest: Washington outfielder Michael A. Taylor ($3.5 million vs. $3.25 million), Houston right-hander Chris Devenski ($1.65 million vs. $1.4 million) and Toronto right-hander Ryan Tepera ($1.8 million vs. $1,525,000)\n\nThree of the remaining cases involve the Astros: shortstop Carlos Correa asked for $5 million and was offered $4.25 million.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
Laura Carlsen\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nPresident Donald Trump's border wall has been one of the most useless and expensive infrastructure projects in American history. But it succeeded beyond expectations as a symbol that unites and mobilizes Trump supporters — which is why he used it as a distraction and a showcase for defiance the day before the House impeached him for the second time.\n\nLess than a week after his followers stormed the nation's Capitol in a siege that led to five dead, Trump was anything but remorseful in a speech to border security agents near the small town of Alamo in Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Hedismissed efforts to remove him from office before his term ends next Wednesday and suggested — absurdly — that President-elect Joe Biden could be the one removed.\n\nThe 25th Amendment is of zero risk to me but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration. As the expression goes, be careful what you wish for, Trump told the crowd. More ominously, he claimed that impeachment is a hoax causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time.\n\nThe insinuation: There could be a violent response.\n\nFamiliar lies about a MAGA symbol\n\nTrump spent most of his speech touting the wall, his signature act in office. In a flurry of last-minute construction, the Department of Homeland Security announced the completion of 450 miles of the emblematic barrier. However, Customs and Border Protection reports that only 47 miles of that are new primary wall where no barrier had existed. That's a scant accomplishment for $15 billion of taxpayer money.\n\nReports have shown enormous cost overruns and supplemental contracts to construction firms without competitive bidding, triggering a Government Accountability Office investigation with findings due early this year. This follows a 2018 GAO report that anticipated the waste and found that the project did not follow protocols and had no clear measure of effectiveness. Scores of legal challenges have been filed related to appropriation of private land and violation of environmental laws.\n\nThe DHS inspector general also found that the agency did not assess costs and benefits of the project or follow other procedures.\n\nTrump, however, considers the wall a triumph and signed his name on a plaque affixed to the metal strips before rattling off a familiar list of lies and misleading statistics. He took credit for the 2020 drop in border apprehensions without mentioning that overall crossings fell by half under pandemic lockdowns. He heralded statistics on seizures of illicit drugs, failing to point out that 90% of those take place at ports of entry that have nothing to do with the wall.\n\nTrump's lies:Trump's 5-year campaign of lies led to the Capitol attack. And we just let it happen.\n\nHe lauded his offensive against what he called asylum fraud, despite the fact that his government closed asylum on the U.S-Mexico border in violation of international law, rather than assess and hear cases. He also repeated unsubstantiated claims that migrants live off U.S. welfare and that Middle East terrorists come over the southern border — an assertion that his own counterterrorist officials have repeatedly debunked.\n\nVeiled warnings are danger signs\n\nThe litany was a rehash of Trump's greatest hits, but since the attempt to subvert the legal transfer of power, there were dangerous signs embedded in the braggadocio. Trump stated, Removing any of these measures would hamstring our workers, endanger our country and cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year — knowing that the president-elect has called for the removal of many of these unilateral measures. Trump further warned, We can't let the next administration even think about taking it (the wall) down.\n\nBoot Trump now:Trump doesn't deserve post-presidential benefits. Remove him and ensure he won't get them.\n\nAmong hardcore Trump supporters who consider the wall a pillar of the MAGA agenda, these veiled warnings could be interpreted as further reason to block a peaceful transfer of power. Given Biden's promise to immediately halt construction on the wall, Trump's statements to Border Patrol agents could also incite disobedience. Most Americans oppose the wall, but Border Patrol union leaders support it and claim that a partial survey shows union members do, too.\n\nMobilization in defense of the wall would be a disaster. Trump's wall has been an ineffective farce, designed to foment hate disguised as security. It has already cost the nation far too much — in resources, division and human lives. The country faces a health security threat that requires prioritizing resources to save lives. An immediate halt to the corruption, waste and deception of the border wall is a welcome and necessary step to a safer nation.\n\nLaura Carlsen is director of the Americas Policy Program, an independent international think tank based in Mexico City.

The Amazon-owned security camera company Ring fired four employees who abused internal access and spied on customers as the company faces a negligence lawsuit over hacked home surveillance cameras.\n\nIn November, a group of senators asked Amazon a series of questions related to privacy practices at the maker of doorbell security cameras. Amazon said in a letter in January that Ring fired four employees for snooping on users' homes.\n\nOver the last four years, Ring has received four complaints or inquiries regarding a team member's access to Ring video data, Amazon's Vice President of Public Policy Brian Huseman wrote in the letter addressed to senators.\n\nHuseman said that although the staffers involved were authorized to view video data from the cameras, the attempted access to that data exceeded what was necessary for their job functions.\n\nAmazon said Ring investigated each report promptly and dismissed the workers after it determined they violated company policies.\n\nCyberattack:The risk of an Iran cyberattack is up after missile strike on Iraqi military bases\n\nCES 2020:Fast & Furious actor Ludacris' thoughts on Tesla as EVs have a major moment\n\nLike any rapidly growing company, we recognize that we must continually evolve and enhance our data and security practices to block efforts by bad actors, Ring said.\n\nLate last year, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., sent a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about Ring's video-sharing agreements with law enforcement agencies.\n\nAfter an investigation in November, Markey released findings calling Ring's privacy policies an open door for privacy and civil liberty violations. Markey accused Amazon of not doing enough to ensure that its products and practices do not run afoul of our civil liberties.\n\nIn December, reports surfaced that hackers could use the security cameras to spy on unsuspecting homeowners.\n\nUSA TODAY obtained a video of one incident that shows a view of a child's room as mysterious music starts playing from the Ring. A voice calls out, Hello there and I'm your best friend. I'm Santa Claus.\n\nIn January, the child's parents filed a federal lawsuit against Ring in California accusing the company of negligence and other violations.\n\nRing said that the incident was not related to a breach or compromise of its security but that the hack was due to weak user-generated passwords.\n\nRing said it launched a campaign to educate customers on how to better protect their online accounts. The campaign includes prompts both in-app and via email to use two-factor authentication.\n\nNo employees or contractors have unrestricted access to customers' camera data, regardless of where they are based, Ring said. Though some employees have access to user-approved footage to maintain and improve the customer experience.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown
Maybe, just maybe, Bryce Harper won't get a dime more than the contract he turned down three-and-a-half months ago from the Washington Nationals.\n\nPerhaps that $300 million won't be deposited into Manny Machado's bank account, either. Here we are, only six weeks before the start of spring training, and neither are remotely close to signing.\n\nHowever, the Chicago White Sox, who along with the Philadelphia Phillies are the only teams to publicly express interest in both players, have formally offered Machado a long-term contract proposal, four persons with direct knowledge of the offer told USA TODAY Sports. They spoke only on the condition of anonymity since they are in the middle of negotiations.\n\nIt's characterized as a serious offer, likely closer to $200 million than $300 million, but not enough to sway Machado to board a flight from Miami to Chicago for a press conference.\n\nThe White Sox have yet to make a formal offer for Harper but remain in constant contact, meeting six weeks ago in person with Harper, his wife and agent Scott Boras.\n\nIf Machado had his wish, and the offers were relatively close, friends believe he'd choose the New York Yankees, his favorite team growing up. Yet if the Yankees were convinced that Machado was coming their way, they wouldn't have even bothered with shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, signing him to a no-risk insurance policy at the major-league minimum of $550,000, but informing Machado beforehand of their plans.\n\nIf Harper had his choice, with the offers being close, friends believe he'd pick the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers may have interest, but haven't publicly declared they will even make a short-term offer.\n\nIf it's solely about the money with Harper and Machado, it may be between the Phillies and White Sox, with the Phillies prepared to spend stupid'' money, in the words of owner John Middleton.\n\nWhile nothing has yet transpired, at least the landscape is starting to become clear.\n\nThe White Sox have expressed serious interest in both, meeting with Harper in Las Vegas and Machado in Chicago. The Phillies hosted Machado before Christmas and are now working to schedule a meeting in Las Vegas with Harper, Phillies GM Matt Klentak said Thursday.\n\nManny and his group were great,'' Klentak said. It was an opportunity for us to talk to Manny about our organization and have him meet a lot of people, and also a chance for him to ask us questions and learn a little more about us.\n\nI expect the dialogue there will continue.''\n\nOptimistic?\n\nHard to say,'' Klentak said. These things take a lot of twists and turns.''\n\nMORE BASEBALL\n\nThe Phillies' biggest challenge with Harper may be convincing him that while Philadelphia may be one of the toughest baseball markets to play in, he could still be embraced and beloved by fans after spending his career with the rival Nationals.\n\nReally, the X-factor in all of the Harper talks may be the Nationals. They offered a 10-year, $300 million contract on Sept. 26 that included deferred payments that devalue the total to about $284 million or less, two officials with direct knowledge told USA TODAY.\n\nNationals owner Mark Lerner said that offer is no longer on the table, but it certainly didn't stop the Nationals from spending five hours with Harper and Boras on Dec. 22, according to The Washington Post.\n\nSo unless the Dodgers are playing it awfully coy, or the Chicago Cubs find a taker for Jason Heyward or Yu Darvish, there are only three teams involved in the bidding, or four, if the Nationals jump back in the mix for Harper.\n\nThat's it. Three teams in; at least 26 are out.\n\nWhen free agency began, it seemed preordained that Harper would wind up with the Phillies and Machado with the Yankees. Now here we are, and precious little has changed.\n\nWho knows -- maybe the White Sox could become more attractive each day, the Dodgers could feel an urge to add star power or the Phillies could act really crazy by signing both.\n\nAll we really know is that this wait could be a doozy. Maybe even into spring training.\n\nI wouldn't even venture a guess, Klentak said. I'm not smart enough to predict what will drive markets.''\n\nMoney will do a whole lot of talking, but until it reaches historic proportions, the wait goes on.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale
WASHINGTON — President Trump signed a pair of trade actions imposing steep tariffs on washing machines and solar panels on Tuesday, saying the taxes on imports demonstrate to the world that the United States won't be taken advantage of any more.\n\nThe tariffs result from investigations into unfair trade practices by foreign manufacturers accused of dumping products in the U.S. market. Two Korean manufacturers, LG and Samsung, have flooded the U.S. market in recent years, evading duties by moving production to Thailand and Vietnam. China dominates the solar cell market.\n\nThe tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could add as much as 50% to the cost of imported washing machines and 30% to solar panels.\n\nMore:Trump's 30% tariff on imported solar panels may cost jobs\n\nBut the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates that the tariffs could end up threatening 23,000 American jobs. That's because most jobs are in installing and assembling solar panels, not in manufacturing the solar cells.\n\nThe tariffs — particularly those on solar panels — rankled even Republican members of Congress, many of whom come from Sun Belt states and support free trade policies.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the tariffs nothing more than a tax on consumers. Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa., said it was misguided, and Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C. said it was a mistake.\n\nHere's something Republicans used to understand: Tariffs are taxes on families, said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. Moms and dads shopping on a budget for a new washing machine will pay for this — not big companies. You don't fix eight years of bad energy policy with bad trade policy.\n\nTrump said the tariffs would encourage foreign manufacturers to build plants in the United States. Samsung and LG have announced plans to build factories in South Carolina and Tennessee, creating 1,600 jobs.\n\nThat's exactly what the president wants to see, said Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser. Ultimately we're getting the outcome we want to get.\n\nCohn said Trump made the decision after a rigorous process that considered the impact of the tariffs on consumer goods prices. But he also cares very much about the workforce in the United States and making sure we create a good job environment in the United States, he said.\n\nChinese ambassador Cui Tiankai, who met with USA TODAY's editorial board on Tuesday, did not say whether the country would impose its own tariffs against American products or retaliate in any way.\n\nI think people in Beijing are still assessing the situation, and we'll do whatever is needed to defend our own interests, he said. These things are rather complicated, and you could take measures against one of your trading partners, and your partner could also take measures back. But I think such a trade war would not help anybody. It would hurt everybody. A better option is to have consultation and to solve the dispute.\n\nTrump also seemed to suggest that the tariffs were a shot across the bow for other trading partners, noting that talks on renegotiating trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea are underway.\n\nNAFTA is moving along pretty well, he said of the North American Free Trade Agreement talks underway in Montreal. I happen to be of the opinion that if it doesn't work out, we'll terminate it. We'll see how it works out.\n\nThe move had some defenders among Republicans in Congress.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rob Portman said his state, Ohio, has more washing machine manufacturing than anywhere else in the U.S. If other countries are not following the rules of trade they have to be held accountable, Portman said.\n\nCompanies shouldn't have to compete with unfair trade, he continued, arguing that these tariffs are temporary and necessary right now to keep these good jobs in Ohio.\n\nTrump signed the tariff declarations at an Oval Office ceremony Tuesday, even though U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had already announced them the previous day.\n\nWhile insisting that there won't be a trade war, Trump also said he would take his America First trade policy to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland later this week.\n\nYou're going to have people getting good jobs again, and they'll be making more product again, he said. It's been a long time.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins and Deirdre Shesgreen.
Jane Onyanga-Omara\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHundreds of thousands of mourners descended on the streets of the Iranian capital of Tehran on Tuesday for the funeral of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe assembled crowds wailed and beat their chests in the streets.\n\nRafsanjani died Sunday at the age of 82 in a hospital in the capital. The cause of death was a heart attack, the official IRNA news agency reported.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led the prayers at the funeral ceremony at Tehran University. Rafsanjani was laid to rest in the mausoleum of his ally, the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini, IRNA reported.\n\nThe moderate current President Hassan Rouhani and hard-liners including Qassem Soleimani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force — responsible for operations outside Iran — also took part in the ceremony.\n\nRafsanjani, who helped found the Islamic republic and served as president between 1989 and 1997, was an influential leader, political survivor and multimillionaire.\n\nInfluential former Iranian leader Rafsanjani dies\n\nI rarely attend religious ceremonies, but I am here as an Iranian who cannot forget Rafsanjani's contribution to developing political sphere in favor of people in recent years, Nima Sheikhi, a computer teacher at a private school, told the Associated Press as Rafsanjani's casket traveled through the streets.\n\nReza Babei, a cleric from the eastern town of Birjand, said: I am here to say goodbye to a man who dedicated his life to make Iran better. He founded the university in my city and developed our region when he was in power, according to the AP.\n\nThe White House sent condolences to Rafsanjani's family on Monday.\n\nHe was a consequential figure inside Iran, said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. As for what potential impact this may have for Iranian policy, I wouldn't speculate.
Virginia State Sen. Amanda F. Chase said Friday that Facebook has suspended her political campaign page for 60 days because of her recent posts addressing Wednesday's uprising at the Capitol by pro-Trump supporters.\n\nChase, who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor this year, said in a post on her personal Facebook page that she received a notice from the social media network that she would not be able to post on her Chase4Senate page for the next two months. The Chesterfield, Virginia Republican, whose district includes the city of Colonial Heights, has used her Facebook page as a primary reach-out point to her backers.\n\nShe claimed in her personal post that Facebook banned her over a disagreement of political opinions.\n\nCapitol riots:What their selfie obsession revealed about the psychology of the pro-Trump rioters\n\nMore:Reddit bans '/donaldtrump' subreddit for 'repeated policy violations'\n\nFacebook continues to restrict free speech, she wrote. Because what I have to say does not fit their narrative, my Senator Amanda Chase page has been silenced for 60 days. We no longer have free speech here in America.\n\nChase's campaign staff confirmed the ban. A message left with Facebook's corporate office in California seeking comment has not been answered yet.\n\nAccording to Facebook, it monitors content for community standards and will take action against a poster if they determine the post has malicious intent.\n\nFor instance, we may warn someone for a first violation, but if they continue to violate our policies, we may restrict their ability to post on Facebook or disable their profile, Facebook says on its Reporting Abuse page.\n\nHer campaign page is followed by more than 135,000 Facebook users.\n\nChase, an ardent backer of President Donald Trump, has used her campaign page to voice her support for Trump. She also has launched attacks on both Democrats and Republicans — Democrats for advancing what conservatives say is a socialist agenda, and Republicans for kowtowing to what she terms pay-to-play politics.\n\nMore:Michelle Obama calls for Trump to be 'permanently' banned as pressure mounts on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\n\nThis week, Chase posted several items pertaining to the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally in Washington, at which she was a speaker. While she did not take part in the breach at the Capitol, she has refused to condemn it, saying in subsequent Facebook posts that the rush on the building was the start of a revolution by people tired of being backed into a corner by Democrats.\n\nIn her last post Thursday, Chase linked a tweet alleging that Antifa was responsible for the rioting, which left five people dead and more than 100 others arrested.\n\nAntifa is the culprit. Listen to Patriots who told them to stop, she wrote above the link.\n\nThat post was flagged by Facebook as false information checked by independent fact-checkers.\n\nBill Atkinson (he/him) is the news director of The Progress-Index, located in his hometown of Petersburg, Va.
Nicole Austin-Hillery and Sarah Margon\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nThe new 116th Congress, with its diverse pool of new members ushered in by a record number of voters, has an opportunity to demonstrate that human rights remain a priority for the American people.\n\nFor years, the U.S. has promoted respect for these rights, even if it has not always abided by the laws and treaties that protect them. This has advanced the long-term strategic interests of the U.S., as well as peace and security in the rest of the world. After all, these rights — to be free from discrimination, to have due process, to have an adequate standard of living and to participate in free and fair elections — benefit not just Americans but everyone, everywhere.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, with his America First agenda, has all but scrapped this approach. To varying degrees, all U.S. presidents have downplayed or overlooked human rights concerns when other interests were in play. But Trump has gutted support for them by embracing abusive foreign leaders who are jailing, torturing and killing dissidents, by selling weapons to militaries committing massive war crimes, and by undermining international institutions and courts that seek justice for some of the world's worst atrocities. At home, Trump has turned his back on refugees, detained immigrant children, and rolled back regulations that protect women's health, LGBT rights, and the water we drink.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nGender-related violence should be grounds for asylum. Congress must fix this.\n\nKhashoggi murder lays bare Trump's tragic disregard for American values and interests\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo: Religious persecution in Iran, China must end now\n\nMembers of this new Congress have an opportunity to reverse course, reiterate the importance of respect for human rights, and make clear that the current path is not acceptable.\n\nThey can do this by protecting gains made under the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded access to health care for millions of Americans, and ensuring that coverage includes the full range of sexual and reproductive health care services. They can pass even stronger criminal justice reform that eliminates mandatory minimum sentencing and the racial disparities that permeate the criminal justice, education and health systems.\n\nThey should also protect Dreamers, and hold oversight hearings into family separation and dangerous detention conditions. To help protect and restore the right to vote in the federal elections, they should pass the Democracy Restoration Act, and hold oversight hearings on voter suppression tactics.\n\nBipartisan legislation has been proposed to reverse the transgender military ban — a discriminatory policy that met with immediate opposition from military leadership, lawmakers in both parties, the public, and federal courts. They should pass this legislation, as well as the Equality Act, which would curb the administration's wider efforts to roll back federal protections of transgender rights.\n\nUse power of the purse to shape foreign policy\n\nOn foreign policy, although the executive branch has predominant power, Congress can be a vital check while also vigorously promoting a foreign policy that not only defends but also safeguards basic rights. Congress can let both allies and adversaries know that even if the White House isn't invested in human rights promotion overseas, the rest of America is.\n\nCongress can also aggressively influence U.S. foreign policy by using the power of the purse to ensure that U.S. programs and policies overseas align more explicitly with the promotion of basic rights. And building on bipartisan support in the current Senate, Congress should permanently repeal the Global Gag rule, which restricts the use of U.S. funds for programs critical for women's health care abroad.\n\nIt should also take up legislation in other areas on which the administration has failed to engage constructively, including forced political re-education camps in China's Xinjiang region and the need to make human rights a key element of US relations with Saudi Arabia. Systematically blocking weapons sales to repressive leaders would rein in President Trump's commercially centered approach to arms transfers while also sending a clear message: the US will not be complicit in other countries' war crimes.\n\nCongress needs to course-correct on rights\n\nRegular oversight hearings should explore the administration's uncritical support of autocratic and abusive governments, including in Hungary, Poland and Thailand. Congress should look at the State Department's move to strike reproductive rights from its annual global human rights report, and the troubling likelihood that Sudan will be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list. Finally, regular meetings with and statements to support independent activists, journalists and lawyers as well as overseas travel are all ways Congress can revive a more inclusive and rights-respecting foreign policy.\n\nAs lawmakers lay out their agenda and attempt to repair the damage done over the last two years, a crucial part of their leadership requires asserting basic rights as a core policy component — whether domestic or foreign. That's not just the right thing to do, it is in America's best interests.\n\nNicole Austin-Hillery is the US program director and Sarah Margon is the Washington director at Human Rights Watch.

Trying to get out of the Garden State? You may not be alone.\n\nAccording to an annual study from United Van Lines, New Jersey was the top state people were moving out of in 2018, while Vermont topped the list as the top state people moved to.\n\nThe company, which has tracked interstate moves for the study since 1977, used data from the more than 200,000 household moves it completed in 2018 within the 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe data showed that roughly two-thirds of New Jersey moves were outbound in 2018. New Jersey has been in the top 10 for outbound moves for the past 10 years, United Van Lines said.\n\nIllinois (65.9%), Connecticut (62%), New York (61.5%) and Kansas (58.7%) rounded out the top five list for states people were leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, over 7 in 10 moves in Vermont were inbound in 2018. Among the other states that people moved to: Oregon (63.8%), Idaho (62.4%), Nevada (61.8%) and Arizona (60.2%).\n\nAccording to United Van Lines, the data overall shows a growing number of moves to western and southern regions, while Northeastern states saw a growing number of moves away.\n\nThe data collected by United Van Lines aligns with longer-term migration patterns to southern and western states, trends driven by factors like job growth, lower costs of living, state budgetary challenges and more temperate climates, Michael Stoll, a public policy professor and economist at UCLA, said in a statement.\n\nCareer changes accounted for about half of all moves across the country, according to a survey from United Van Lines. Retirement, lifestyle change and family were also among top reasons for moving in some regions.\n\nIdaho welcomed the highest percentage of movers seeking a new lifestyle at roughly 25 percent, while New Mexico led the way for retirees with 42 percent of movers wrapping up their careers.\n\nUnlike a few decades ago, retirees are leaving California, instead choosing other states in the Pacific West and Mountain West, Stoll added.\n\nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nMore:2018 year in review: 50 stories from 50 states that moved us\n\nMore:Beto O'Rourke, freekah and other words you've been saying wrong all year\n\nMore:Blood pressure drug recalls, Mollie Tibbetts, Toys R Us and Roseanne: Our most-read stories of 2018

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAs liquidation looms for Sears and Kmart, many consumers are wondering if there will be any liquidation sales. And if so, will they be any good?\n\nThis has happened before, like when Toys R Us went out of business in late 2018 and had liquidation sales.\n\nWhile you might expect steep discounts on popular items before a company closes its doors for the last time, that may not be the case. Depending on how a store gets rid of leftover merchandise, you could actually end up paying more than what the same items cost at a competing retailer.\n\nHere's how to shop at a going out of business sale without getting fleeced.\n\nKnow who you're buying from\n\nCredit: Getty Images Big stores often sell their wares to a professional liquidator.\n\nIf a retailer is only closing a few locations, don't expect to find the best merchandise sitting around in a store that's soon to be shuttered. Chances are it will have been moved to a location that's staying open, where it might have a better chance of selling.\n\nThings are different if the entire chain is folding, however, and shoppers should be aware of the difference.\n\nLiquidation sales are very different from regular, ordinary sales going on in the store, said Dr. Tony Gao, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Massachusetts Lowell's Manning School of Business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat's because most major retailers use professional liquidation companies to move merchandise. These liquidators—like Great American and Tiger Direct, who handled HH Gregg's liquidation—often buy remaining merchandise outright. So even if the retailer's name is still on the front of the store, you're buying that new camera or laptop from a liquidator.\n\nAs a result, the store's ordinary return policy may not apply, or coupons may not be valid. Make sure to read the fine print before you buy.\n\nDon't get psyched out\n\nCredit: Getty Images These signs are down to a science.\n\nEven those red-and-white signs that proclaim, EVERYTHING MUST GO! are there for a reason. Liquidators have done thousands of going out of business sales, and they know what works.\n\nThey understand the consumer's buying psychology, and they know when to start the sales, how long they'll last, and they'll also move around inventory from store to store, Gao said. They operate on the assumption that consumers are attracted by liquidation sales.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, it's not uncommon for liquidators to warehouse merchandise from closed retailers, and move it to wherever they think it might sell. Anything left behind goes back in the warehouse until it's time to liquidate another retailer—which is why you might see discount furniture at an electronics store, or outdated fashions at a clothing store.\n\nLiquidation companies do that—they have patience, said Gao. Many of them have more patience than the retailers being closed themselves.\n\nTo avoid getting sucked in, ask yourself if you actually need what's going on sale. If you do, check prices from other retailers on your phone to make sure you're getting a good deal.\n\nShop small and save\n\nCredit: Getty Images Smaller retailers sometimes offer better deals.\n\nAlthough major retailers tend to rely on liquidators to empty stock, shoppers can still sometimes find deals when smaller stores or specialty retailers go out of business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe larger stores play more games than the little stores, said Bob Nelson of Power Retail, a Phoenix, AZ-based liquidation consultant.\n\nMany of the smaller customers Nelson works with are shutting down due to an illness or retirement. They've often been fixtures in a community, and want to maximize the value of their inventory without upsetting loyal customers.\n\nThe larger stores play more games than the little stores.\n\nThe smart ones want to get out of there clean. It's only the desperate ones that would sell it to a liquidator, he said. Working with the smaller retailers, we always tell them they have to keep their integrity.\n\nAccording to Nelson, some of the best deals can come from specialty stores that carry unique merchandise—like high-end clothing. In that case, he said, you want to get there early, not late, because late everything's picked over.
Fred DuVal\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOn our family coffee table is the book Phoenix, Now vs. Then. It compares photos of various local locations now and 40 years ago. My recent experience in China reminded me of that book.\n\nI participated in one of the first American cultural exchanges with China 40 years ago. Our host counterparts were ambitious young Chinese leaders who demonstrated an insatiable curiosity about America, both our free enterprise system and our democracy. The youth in China were at the cusp of pressing their nation to resemble ours.\n\nThat was then.\n\nToday the many young people we met have now largely concluded that their managed economy and managed democracy serve them better than the American-inspired and freer alternatives.\n\nChina has national strategies. We don't\n\nThey celebrate an economic growth rate almost twice ours, which is lifting more than 400 million Chinese into the middle class. They cheer their eventual emergence as the biggest economy on the globe.\n\nAnd while they admire American self-expression and expansive human rights, the young Chinese now acquiesce to limits on it as an acceptable trade-off for the autocratically driven economic success that is occurring. As one pointedly said: You may have a lot of free speech, but it seems that's all you have, is talk.\n\nThe stakes are too high for my family: Farmer: I won't vote for Trump again without an end to high tariffs, trade war with China\n\nFor centuries the Chinese were mired in a political and economic system that rendered them voiceless — and powerless — to change. Now they have more say and are exercising a choice. America is no longer seen as a better alternative.\n\nThey proudly explain that they have unified national strategies for long-term economic growth, education investment, energy and their global engagement.\n\nAnd we have none of them. They are playing the long game — and we aren't.\n\nThey observe Western democracies, such as our Congress and its policy paralysis, and cheap partisan vitriol and say, no thanks. They follow Brexit and think, that's another competitor gone.\n\nWe win partisan battles yet lose the war\n\nWhat does this mean for us?\n\nOur two-party system, calcified by social media and siloed news corridors, has turned forward thinking and collaboration into political death warrants for our elected leaders.\n\nNow, winning elections isn't about better ideas but about better tactics for making the other side unelectable. Governing is about risk management, not leadership.\n\nTo those on both the right and left who have come to see the other team as evil in intent and traitorous in deed, and seek to punish those seeking broader common ground, it may work for partisan scorecards. But it isn't working for our country.\n\nWhen will the world take notice? I've fought China's slow-motion genocide of Uighur Muslims. Now, my family are victims.\n\nWe are stalling out. In our total preoccupation with defeating the other political party, we are losing our ability to address greater existential threats.\n\nWe have historic gaps in opportunity and income. We are falling behind other nations in educational achievement in a knowledge-based economy. Our national debt grows to new historic highs enabled by both parties — and we owe most of it to China.\n\nCan democracy win? 2020 is a test\n\nThe climate crisis is exploding. The primacy of individual-based identity politics cannibalizes common national identity and goals.\n\nWe are stuck in ideological debates of the '60s and '70s. We have no strategy for the future. Both sides seem satisfied with winning the next election while sacrificing the century.\n\nAmerica won the 20th century because we pulled together as one nation to build a competitive economy for its time. We prevailed in two World Wars and built a functioning democracy that most of the world sought to emulate.\n\nChurchill opined that the ills of democracy can be cured by the strengths of democracy. The 2020 election will test that belief.\n\nThe 21st century has its own new challenges. Leading it is not an American birthright. And the competition — with fundamentally different values — is bringing their game.\n\nFred DuVal is a member of the Arizona Board of Regents, a former gubernatorial candidate and former senior staff member in the Clinton White House .

In a contentious Meet the Press interview on Sunday, Sen. Ron Johnson acknowledged that President-elect Joe Biden won the state of Wisconsin but said it was still necessary to investigate unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.\n\nJohnson provided no evidence of voting irregularities in Wisconsin or anywhere else during his interview with host Chuck Todd.\n\nJohnson went on the popular Sunday morning talk show — an appearance cut short by Todd, who accused Johnson of spreading conspiracy theories — to explain why he is one of a dozen Republican senators who say they will object to certifying Electoral College results on Wednesday.\n\nJohnson and the others are calling for a nonpartisan commission to investigate the results, which already have been certified by state governments across the country. They show Biden won by more than 7 million votes. The former vice president received 306 electoral votes. President Donald Trump got 232.\n\nSince the election, Trump has refused to concede and has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that the results were tainted by widespread fraud. However, elections experts say that even amid a dangerous pandemic, the balloting was conducted fairly and without major incident.\n\nAt one point during the interview, Todd pressed Johnson to say which candidate he believed won in Wisconsin.\n\nVice President Joe Biden has won by 20,000 votes, Johnson said, but there were also issues in Wisconsin.\n\nJohnson did not say what those issues were.\n\nRELATED:Sen. Ron Johnson from Wisconsin to join others from the GOP in refusing to certify Electoral College results\n\nOther Wisconsin Republicans rejected efforts by Johnson and the other senators to challenge the Electoral College results, which were certified Dec. 14.\n\nEfforts to reject the votes of the Electoral College and sow doubt about Joe Biden's victory strike at the foundation of our republic, former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said in a statement.\n\nIt is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of Americans. The fact that this effort will fail does not mean it will not do significant damage to American democracy.\n\nThe Trump campaign had ample opportunity to challenge election results, and those efforts failed from lack of evidence, Ryan's statement went on to say. The legal process was exhausted, and the results were decisively confirmed.\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher and six GOP House members also said they had concerns about the attempt to challenge the Electoral College's final results certifying Joe Biden as the winner of the election.\n\nWe must respect the states' authority here, the statement said. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals.\n\nThe letter also noted that the GOP House members had concerns about fraud, but not enough concern to disenfranchise the election.\n\nMore:Call to challenge the Electoral College count has split Senate Republicans\n\nJohnson's NBC interview got heated when Todd accused Johnson and Trump of starting the fire of accusations of voter fraud without evidence.\n\nYou made an allegation that there was widespread fraud. You have failed to offer specific evidence of that widespread fraud. But you're demanding an investigation on the grounds that there are allegations of widespread fraud, Todd said.\n\nYou're the arsonist here. Donald Trump is the arsonist here. You've started this fire. ... And now all these people believe what you told them because you didn't have the guts to tell them the truth, that this election was fair.\n\nJohnson replied that the GOP senators simply want to investigate allegations of fraud further.\n\nAt another point, Johnson mentioned unproven allegations of fraud in Nevada, but Todd interrupted. Stop, you don't get to make these allegations that haven't been proven true, Todd said.\n\nJohnson accused the media, the FBI and the Department of Justice of being biased and not credible.\n\nWe have an enormous problem in this country, it's unsustainable, and the only way you solve it is with information, and transparency, and hearings, and investigations. It's not quackery, it's not a conspiracy theory. It's what is going to be required, Johnson said.\n\nAn exasperated Todd then asked Johnson why the government didn't hold hearings on other conspiracy theories such as whether the 9/11 attacks were an inside job.\n\nWhy didn't you hold hearings about the 9/11 truthers? Todd asked. How about the moon landing? Are you going to hold hearings on that?\n\nJohnson responded that there were multiple things he would like to hold hearings on, including the coronavirus response but said the election was a priority.\n\nRight now we have this election, we have tens of millions of Americans who think this election was stolen. We need to get to the bottom of it, Johnson said.\n\nBut Todd was having none of it.\n\nWhen you tell people a million times that something was stolen, or something was fraud, and then they believe it, I think you need to look in the mirror and ask yourself why so many people believe it, Todd said.\n\nJohnson countered that it was Todd and the media who were at fault, telling Todd, You destroyed the credibility of the press — not me as the two men talked heatedly over one another.\n\nTodd then cut Johnson off and thanked him for coming on the show. Only two of your colleagues had the guts to say 'yes' this weekend about this conspiracy theory that you're working on, Todd said. Thanks for coming on — that I appreciate.\n\nJohnson replied: Have a good day.
Michael J. Stern\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWhen I was trying cases as a federal prosecutor, there was a jury instruction that made me cringe every time the judge read it at the end of my case. It always came at the same point in the jury charge, and as the judge approached the dreaded instruction I would curl my toes in my shoes as a way of releasing anxiety without letting the jury see me sweat. The instruction told the jurors that if they felt a witness had lied about one thing, they were entitled to disbelieve all of the witness' testimony.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president, there was an undercurrent of comment that he was not as bad as he convinced us he is, and that once in office he would rise to the occasion of the presidency. This hopeful theory was put to the test on the day of Trump's inauguration.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the president and his administration, then-White House spokesman Sean Spicer's public introduction to the world came with his demonstrably false claim that Trump's inauguration crowd was the largest ever recorded. The experts said no, the photographs said no, and my own eyes said no.\n\nEven a stupid lie can make you question all that comes after it. And so the seeds of disbelief were planted.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\n9 facts you should know before Trump border wall address to the nation\n\nTrump's lies and corruption disgrace presidential legacies of Lincoln and Washington\n\nStop helping Donald Trump spread his lies. Don't correct, don't rage, just turn away.\n\nHaving worked for the federal government for more than two decades, I was resistant to the idea that the institution to which I had devoted my professional career could change in any fundamental way due to a single administration. I was wrong.\n\nWhat began as weekly fodder for Saturday Night Live was followed by false claims that voter fraud accounted for Hillary Clinton's popular vote victory; the Trump Tower meeting with Russians was to discuss adoption rules; there was no administration policy separating children from parents who applied for legal asylum; and thousands of terrorists are crossing the southern border.\n\nKellyanne Conway tried to convince us there was no objective truth, only alternative facts. And Rudy Giuliani told us that truth isn't truth.\n\nUnfortunately, truth has not come with time. Just Sunday, on Trump-friendly Fox News, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders doubled down when confronted with the lie about those thousands of terrorist border-crossings. Last week, the Justice Department acknowledged errors in a year-old report linking immigrants to terrorism but refused to correct it — leaving the impression that the stain of misinformation was the point and not a regrettable mistake.\n\nAnd Tuesday night, after Trump gave his televised Oval Office speech arguing for a border wall, CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta summed it up this way: That address probably should have come with a surgeon general's warning. It was hazardous to the truth.\n\nMy default setting now is government is lying\n\nSeveral news outlets have kept a running list of false or misleading Trump claims that now runs into the thousands and is longer than a CVS drugstore receipt. The evolution of this sliding trust is mirrored in the news media, which originally reported presidential and administration misstatements, then falsehoods and now lies.\n\nFrom outward appearances, the administration does not acknowledge, or even understand, that it presents itself as liars. Recently, while scrolling through Facebook, I saw a headline that Sanders felt her legacy would include a transparent and honest effort at informing journalists. Given Sanders' history of deflection and lies, I assumed the story was satire. It wasn't.\n\nThe real danger of losing faith comes not in the disbelief of any individual claim by the government, but in the recalibration of our respect for the larger institution. I no longer listen to a government news conference and take what is said at face value.\n\nI've always had a healthy skepticism for the shades of truth that come from both Democratic and Republican administrations. Now, my default setting is to assume that what my government tells me is a lie. I'm not alone in this credibility crisis. An NBC News poll from last year showed that more than 60 percent of Americans believe President Trump regularly has trouble telling the truth.\n\nDon't surrender to collective exhaustion\n\nThe systemic disbelief most of us are experiencing is exhausting. When the president, or his lawyer or his press secretary says something, we are sent scrambling to Google to find a reliable source that we can rely on to tell us the truth.\n\nThere is a surrender that comes with repetition. Lies and scandals that would have outraged most of us before Trump taking office have been subjugated to varying degrees of irritation. And the more we are collectively exhausted, the more the administration can implement policies that will haunt us for years to come.\n\nThe sleight of hand that daily captivates our attention, with the rolling disclosure of political corruption, leaves us too weary to muster the political will to press effective objections to things such as doing away with regulations that prevent mining companies from dumping waste into public streams.\n\nI yearn for the days when the press had the luxury of taking a little bit of nothing and making it into a lot of something: her emails, her emails! At some point, there will be a series finale to the Trump show. When that day comes, as a nation we must make the decision to bring back the premium we once placed on truth and integrity. The absence of anything for too long places it at risk of not being found.\n\nMichael J. Stern was a federal prosecutor with the Department of Justice, for 25 years, in Detroit and Los Angeles.
John Bacon\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCivil rights activist and Black Lives Matter member DeRay Mckesson wants to join the system he has battled to fix, announcing on social media that he will run for mayor of Baltimore.\n\nMckesson, 30, filed his petition just before the deadline late Wednesday and said he will release details of his policy plans in coming weeks.\n\nMckesson has developed a reputation for activism driven by social media. He was involved in protests in Ferguson, Mo., after the fatal shooting of black teen Michael Brown by a white police officer in August 2014, and was arrested there during a protest marking the first anniversary of Brown's death. He also was involved in hometown protests following the April death of Freddie Gray, who died while in the custody of Baltimore police.\n\nThe city has struggled to recover from the riots and crime that followed Gray's death. The police chief was fired and six police officers are facing trial.\n\nI am not the silver bullet for the challenges of our city — no one individual is, Mckesson said in a statement linked from his Twitter account. But together, with the right ideas, the right passion, the right people, we can take this city in a new direction.\n\nMckesson describes himself as the son of two recovered drug addicts. He is an alum of Maine's prestigious Bowdoin College and Teach for America, and has worked as an educator in New York, Minnesota and Maryland. He is on the planning team for Campaign Zero, a movement aimed at ending police violence in America.\n\nI am running to be the 50th Mayor of Baltimore in order to usher our city into an era where the government is accountable to its people and is aggressively innovative in how it identifies and solves its problems, he said.\n\nMckesson joins a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls in the heavily Democratic city of more than 600,000 people, almost two-thirds of whom are black. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is not seeking re-election. Well-known candidates include former mayor Sheila Dixon, City Council member Carl Stokes and state Sen. Catherine E. Pugh.\n\nMckesson, who has almost 300,000 Twitter followers, said too many people believe the city is run by money and political connections and can't be fixed.\n\nIn order to achieve the promise of our city and become the Baltimore we know we can become, we must challenge the practices that have not and will not lead to transformation, he said.
Johnny C. Taylor Jr.\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, is tackling your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.\n\nThe questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers below have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHave a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you'd like me to answer? Submit it here.\n\nQuestion: My office will not be reopening for the foreseeable future. Before we shut down, the office gym was popular among employees. Since it's no longer open, how can my company provide more health and wellness benefits? What are some examples? – Anonymous\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr.: Your question is spot on. A major part of creating a positive workplace culture is ensuring employers are supporting their workers both physically and mentally.\n\nAs we welcome a new year, there are several things employers can do to provide health and wellness benefits – and the good news is, they are likely already in place. After all, 58% of organizations offered general wellness programs in 2019.\n\nHow to work out in 2021:Some back at the gym, but many use fitness apps, online classes\n\nStep one is to look at your health insurance and employee assistance programs. Even in these strange times, I imagine there are plenty of virtual wellness options to choose from. While you mentioned your office gym is closed, employee assistance programs may offer exercise and wellness classes like virtual boot camps or yoga as well as cooking and nutrition classes.\n\nIf you and your colleagues are missing the office camaraderie, like so many of us are, you could also suggest fun, health-focused activities like a step contest or a healthy cooking competition.\n\nGoing further, I cannot highlight the importance of access to mental health services enough. Employee assistance programs often include resources that connect employees with a provider for their mental and emotional health needs. With 41% of workers feeling burned out as a result of the pandemic, these resources can help employees navigate these incredibly challenging times through additional psychological services.\n\nIf your employer doesn't – or can't – provide such a program, ask your HR team if they can compile resources and information from your local health department to share with employees.\n\nIf you really want to make your health and wellness program unique to your workforce, survey those who know it best: employees. An employee poll can reveal what sparks their interest.\n\nI'm willing to bet you'll get plenty of responses to help you determine the kind of benefits best suited for them. Some may even have recommendations and referrals you might have overlooked.\n\nWhatever you decide, don't forget to measure their engagement to help you refine your program throughout the year. Good luck on what I'm certain will be the start of a healthy journey for your organization!\n\nInformational interview:How do I ask for one without sounding awkward? Ask HR\n\nDiscrimination:Is my workplace being ageist? Ask HR\n\nQ: Our company policy is that everyone must wear a mask while in the building, even at your desk. I have one supervisor who pulls his mask off while at his desk and has his nose uncovered when walking through the office. As the HR Manager, I have spoken to him about the need for the personal protective equipment. This seems to only last as long as HR is in the vicinity. How should I handle this situation? – Anonymous\n\nTaylor.: The answer is in your question – it's your company's policy to wear a mask when inside the workplace. Unless there is a legitimate health or safety reason, or a sincerely held religious belief, everyone at the worksite should comply.\n\nAs an HR Manager, you know this: Organizations must provide a reasonably safe environment for their workforce. But we can't create a hazard-free workspace if there's no follow-through. The policy is therule for a reason, and if employees aren't getting the message, employers may need to reinforce measures to ensure a healthy worksite, up to and including disciplinary measures.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says employers can mandate employees to wear masks or other protective clothing, such as gloves and gowns, during a pandemic – something many employers are considering. In fact, 86% of organizations are implementing or considering the required use of personal protective equipment.\n\nMasks are also recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and certain states and municipalities have their own mask requirement laws.\n\nThere are, of course, exceptions to the rule. Accommodations may be necessary under the American with Disabilities Act for employees with disabilities or sincerely held religious beliefs that prevent them from wearing a mask.\n\nIt sounds like you've already taken the steps to speak to this employee. Continue to respectfully, but firmly, stress the importance of wearing a mask at the worksite. It's not just a single employee that could be impacted, but the entire organization. The HR team can continue to communicate your company's policy on masks through emails, signs around the office, and verbally during meetings.\n\nYou mention that this person is a supervisor, but supervisors must lead by example. When leaders refuse to wear masks, it sends a message to the whole team that it might be acceptable when that's not the reality of your company.\n\nMay your team remain safe in the new year!
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threatened to impose deep sanctions on Iraq if it moves to expel U.S. troops and said Sunday he would not withdraw entirely unless the military is compensated for the extraordinarily expensive air base there.\n\nTrump's remarks came on the same day that Iraq's Parliament voted to support expelling the U.S. military from its country over mounting anger about a drone strike the president ordered last week that killed Iran's Qasem Soleimani and earlier U.S. airstrikes in the country. The vote was nonbinding.\n\nWe've spent a lot of money in Iraq, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington after spending the holidays at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. ... We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it.\n\nRetaliation:Trump threatens 'disproportionate' military response if Iran launches attack\n\nThe president added that if Iraqi officials try to kick the United States out the country it would not leave on a very friendly basis. The U.S. invasion of Iraq took place in 2003.\n\nWe will charge them sanctions like they've never seen before ever, Trump said. It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.\n\nIraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi told lawmakers that a timetable for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, including those from the U.S., was required for the sake of our national sovereignty. About 5,000 American troops are in various parts of Iraq.\n\nMahdi described the strike authorized by Trump as a political assassination and said it was time for American troops to leave. Withdrawing U.S. troops from the Middle East has been a central component of Trump's foreign policy; however, he has been forced to deploy additional soldiers to region to respond to several crises.\n\nIran has promised 'severe revenge':Iraq votes to expel US troops after Iran Gen. Qasem Soleimani's killing\n\nSo with Iraq, I told you, Iraq, was the worst decision, going into the Middle East was the worst decision ever made in the history of our country, Trump told reporters on Sunday. But we went in and we're there and we're pulling out, pulling out of a lot of different areas.\n\nTrump did not specify which air base he was referring to, but the president flew into Al Asad Air Base during a surprise visit with troops there in 2018.\n\nIraq has been caught in the middle of increasing tensions between Washington and Iran. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq was the site of violent protests last week following a series of U.S. airstrikes ordered in retaliation for the death of an American civilian contractor killed in a rocket attack last month.\n\nThose tensions were further inflamed by the killing of Soleimani near the airport in Baghdad. Iran has promised retaliation and Iraq has said the U.S. attacks violate their sovereignty.\n\nTrump also reiterated a threat to target Iranian cultural sites if Tehran launches an attack in retaliation for Soleimani. The president has said a U.S. response to such an attack could be disproportionate.\n\nContributing: David Jackson, Courtney Subramanian and Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY.
Paul Davidson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story didn't clearly state that 25% of unemployed Americans have been out of work for at least six months.\n\nThe labor market ended 2016 on a positive note. The unemployment rate is low at 4.7%. Employers are increasing wages to snag fewer available workers.\n\nThat all sounds good, at least until you ask the 25% of unemployed Americans who have been out of work six months or more.\n\nThe tightening job market that the Labor Department portrayed last week has delivered only limited benefits to one group: the long-term unemployed. The number of people jobless six months or more may have fallen by 25,000 to 1.8 million in December and is down from 6.8 million in 2010. Yet they still represent a quarter of all those unemployed, about the same as a year ago and up from 18% before the recession began in late 2007.\n\nDaniel Brown, who led a $200 million business unit that made material for packaging and labels and has an MBA from the University of Chicago, thought he would land a similar six-figure job within a few months of losing the position in September 2015 due to a restructuring.\n\nIt used to be jobs found me, says Brown, 46, who lives in Wheaton, Ill. The world has definitely changed. He has learned, for example, that his diverse work history, which includes overseeing marketing, strategy, and mergers and acquisitions, is viewed as a negative by the many firms that seek in-depth experience in specific areas.\n\nEmployers add 156,000 jobs in Dec., wage gains hit 7-year high\n\nBrown and other job-seekers are experiencing a market where companies really need workers but they're being very selective. Many businesses remain locked in a post-recession mindset ingrained by the downturn's severity, and that's adding up to long-term frustration for workers on the sidelines for at least six months.\n\nThey have realized that it's very expensive to hire and very expensive to make a mistake, and they're less willing to take a risk, says Jeanne Branthover, managing partner of DHR International, an executive search firm. Before 2007, my clients were hiring and firing and not thinking about it.\n\nAnd while a shortage of workers, particularly for high-skilled jobs, is helping many of the chronically jobless land positions, a tepid economic recovery and post-recession caution still leads many employers to balk at hiring them.\n\nBy contrast, the tight market is more clearly benefiting groups such as high school graduates, whose unemployment rate has fallen the past year even while the rate for college grads has been stagnant.\n\nDean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, has a theory: I don't see it as that strong a labor market despite solid job gains in recent years and a near-normal unemployment rate.\n\nWhat happens to worker pay, benefits under Trump?\n\nBaker notes that the number of part-time workers who prefer full-time jobs also remains elevated at 5.6 million, up from 4.5 million before the downturn. And while annual wage growth picked up in November to 2.9%, it's still below levels consistent with the near-normal jobless rate.\n\nCarl Van Horn, director of the Heidrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, rattles off the roadblocks faced by the long-term unemployed including having to explain large gaps on a resume and age discrimination. In 2015, about 36% of the long-term unemployed were 55 or older, Labor Department figures show. And some have seen their skills atrophy or have succumbed to depression, alcoholism or drug abuse, Van Horn says.\n\nSuch issues historically have plagued long-idled workers. A big difference nowadays, he says, is that some of the nearly 9 million workers who lost jobs in the recession have yet to find work, or retire, and continue to drift in and out of the labor force, searching for jobs sporadically.\n\nAbout 5.5 million Americans are not in the labor force — and so not counted among the unemployed — but still want a job now, up from 4.3 million before the recession, the Labor Department says. Simply put, Van Horn says, the occasional job searches by those laid off in the downturn creates more competition for jobs among the long-term unemployed.\n\nMeanwhile, many employers are grappling with low growth in productivity, or output per labor hour, that has narrowed their profit margins and made them less willing to invest in workers that may need retraining, such as the long-term unemployed.\n\nEconomists: Growth will pick up next year\n\nIn the 1990s, when productivity growth was high, they were willing to go out and hire anybody that had a pulse, says economist Diane Swonk, who heads DS Economics. When you really need people, you do what it takes.\n\nBaiju Coilparampil, 47, lost his job as chief financial officer of a company that provides mail and document management services when it was acquired by a larger firm nine months ago. He also thought his job search would be brief. But he says companies that used to seek candidates who met eight of their 10 requirements now want perfection.\n\nThey always think there's a better candidate out there, says Coilparampil, of Monroe, Conn. He has exhausted his severance and his unemployment insurance will run out within weeks, forcing his family to cut back or eliminate frills such as dining out and vacations. It's tough to stay positive all the time.\n\nYet a growing number of companies that had been reluctant to bring on the long-term unemployed are more willing to offer them temporary jobs initially or training, says Paul McDonald, senior executive director of staffing firm Robert Half.\n\nCiting the tight labor market, he says, It's out of necessity.\n\nFollow Paul Davidson on Twitter: @PDavidsonusat
Aileen Chuang and Nia Prater\n\nMedill News Service\n\nZach Bartman, 20, junior, Gettysburg College\n\nState chair, Pennsylvania Federation of College Republicans\n\nHow long have you been a member of your school's Republicans chapter?\n\nI've been a member for three years. I've been the state chairman for the Pennsylvania College Republicans for one year.\n\nWhat made you pursue that position?\n\nI actually interned on Kasich's campaign and was kinda inspired to get further involved in the political process.\n\nFuture plans?\n\nI want to practice law for five to 10 years at least, and possibly run for office after that.\n\nWhat sort of work do you do at your school chapter?\n\nWe're active with promoting conservative candidates on campus and in our communities. We raise awareness through the student body as well as provide a spot for people who have conservative leanings on campus.\n\nWhat would you like to see from the Trump administration?\n\nI'd like to see the focus on two main aspects and that would be the economy and national security. I think those are the two main focus points that won Trump the election and he needs to really follow through with those promises to reduce security risks and to promote economic prosperity and job creation.\n\nThoughts on 2016?\n\nPeople are sick of the interest groups really controlling the candidates and lobbying firms and people who are obviously donating a lot of money. They're sick of that system and they wanted to see someone who has no connection to that. Someone who is an outsider who can fix the broken system.\n\nWhy did you attend the inauguration?\n\nIt's kind of like a culmination of all the hard work that was put in through the fall. All the emotional attachments to your candidate, you want to celebrate that win. I'm gonna see a lot of friends this weekend that I worked with.\n\nJessica Browning, 20, junior at Texas A&M\n\nChair, Texas Federation of College Republicans\n\nHow long have you been a member of your school's chapter?\n\nSince my freshman year. At the A&M College Republicans, I'm the activities director. For the Texas Federation of College Republicans, I'm the state chair. My responsibilities are mainly just to communicate with all my chapters, help build chapters, spread conservative ideologies and teach really what the Republican Party's about to get young people involved in the party.\n\nWhat do you want to see for your chapter?\n\nMainly for all my chapters, I just want to see them grow. Continue to break those Republican stereotypes that a lot of times we hear. They say the Republican Party is 'old white men.' And a lot of people don't think that Republicans are young and diverse and they really differ within the party.\n\nFuture plans?\n\nMainly just going to law school, focusing on constitutional law and international law. I mainly want to stay in the private sector and help with policy. I don't really ever want to run for office or get involved with that. I just want to help those individuals who are in office make decisions and help push the country in the direction that the people want it to go in.\n\nWhat do you want to see from the Trump administration?\n\nI want to see our budget under control. I want to see us cut our national debt.\n\nWhy attend?\n\nThis is just an election like no other. It was very hard on everybody, Republicans and Democrats. It was a very tough election year, and it has finally come to a close. I worked on some campaigns throughout this. This is the end of the election cycle and I just really want to see that.\n\nBen Rajadurai, 21, senior, Stonehill College\n\nState chair, Massachusetts Alliance of College Republicans\n\nHow long have you been involved with your chapter?\n\nSince the day I first came on campus, so four years now. The College Republican community both in our state and across the country is really just a big family and provides a really great network to get involved and find like-minded people, and it's been valuable to me for all four years. The way I've always seen it the more we can encourage discussion among friends on an equal playing field, our ideas will win. That's really what we encourage on our campuses as well as activism.\n\nFuture plans?\n\nI'm undecided. When I first started political science, I did it to go to law school. And then I got an internship with the Sean Bielat campaign. He ran for Congress a few years ago, didn't win. But, once you do one, you kinda get hooked.\n\nWhat issues do you want the new administration to address?\n\nA big one for me has always been education. When we're growing up, we're always taught that if you work hard in school and you get out there and do your best, you're gonna be successful in the long run. And I think what we've seen in the last few years, especially in our low-income cities and our low-income schools, that dream just isn't a reality for far too many students. And I think the pick of Betsy DeVos was a very smart choice to shake up the education establishment and fix a system that's failed a lot of our students for far too long.\n\nHopes for the future?\n\nIn Massachusetts, I'd love to see Republicans win the youth vote in 2018.\n\nCaitlin Holman, 21, senior, University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nState chair, Nebraska Federation of College Republicans\n\nHow long have you been involved in your chapter?\n\nI've been a member since I started college. I just finished up 2 and a half years of being chapter chair at the University of Nebraska. And I've been on the executive on both the state level and the chapter level \n\nThoughts on 2016?\n\nI saw a lot of young people really wanting to get active, really wanting to learn and get involved.\n\nWhat issues do you want the new administration to address?\n\nForeign policy is really important to me, especially our relationship and our role in the Middle East. I really want him to be thoughtful and really consider a lot of different angles when he's making decisions. I was pretty critical of Obama's decision to pull troops out, so I'm really excited to see how he handles a lot of those complex relationships that we have in the region.\n\nAustin Emineth, 20, junior, University of North Dakota\n\nState chair, North Dakota College Republicans\n\nThoughts on 2016?\n\nThis election was huge on social media. So what it's done is it's gotten people inspired of all sorts, of all parties.\n\nProudest moment?\n\nWe've actually had members that were campaign managers for some of the state elections. One senate seat hadn't been Republican ever before, and a College Republican was actually the campaign manager for them.\n\nThoughts on Trump?\n\nI think he's got the motivation. He's ambitious and he's ready to go. I think that entrepreneurship is kind of the heart of America. I think that's what Donald Trump represents.\n\nHope for the future of the Republican Party?\n\nI just think it's important to work across the aisle and be bipartisan. History has kinda shown that it's the best way to do it. We can't just ignore someone because of their party. We have to work with them.\n\nWhat do you want to see for your chapter?\n\nI want to see the involvement stay. I want to see kids keep going. I don't want it to be, Hey we won! We don't have to pay attention anymore! That's not the case. We have to hold Trump accountable and actually stay engaged.\n\nFuture plans?\n\nI love business. I love the way it operates. I would also consider doing something to serve my country, if that means through D.C. or state legislature.\n\nAileen Chuang and Nia Prater are reporters with Medill News Service.\n\nThis article comes from The USA TODAY College Contributor network.

As insurrectionists laid siege to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, attacking police and ransacking the halls of Congress, a question reverberated on TV and in living rooms around the nation: Where's the National Guard?\n\nThe query loomed as rioters bashed into the cradle of democracy, hunting for Vice President Mike Pence amid a chant that called for his hanging.\n\nIt echoed when lawmakers ducked for cover and barely escaped to the Capitol's inner sanctums.\n\nIt was still unanswered as Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick died after being bashed in the head. And as Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran radicalized by the QAnon conspiracy movement, tried to crawl through a broken window and was shot dead by police.\n\nWhere was the National Guard?\n\nInvestigations eventually will provide full answers, said Richard Kohn, a history professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in defense and national security issues.\n\nBut he said the lack of a backup force while Congress tallied electoral votes boils down to four words: a failure of imagination.\n\nBecause federal and local authorities underestimated the threat, National Guard troops were not poised to respond. Kohn and other experts said that mistake was compounded by paralysis once the siege began, with those same officials nervous that a show of military force would prompt political blowback.\n\nWhat was attackers' goal? Feds walk back claims Capitol rioters meant to 'capture and assassinate' elected officials\n\nArrest tracker:See who has been arrested in connection with Capitol attack\n\nBlow by blow:How police failures let a violent insurrection into the Capitol\n\nThe notion of failed imagination was used by 9/11 investigators to explain why the FBI and other agencies didn't prevent Islamic terrorists from crashing jetliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\nSecurity experts say inquiries into the assault on the Capitol are likely to reach a similar conclusion. From Congress to the Pentagon, those designated to maintain order and protect the Capitol did not anticipate an insurrection that was advertised by participants, and they hesitated as the violence erupted.\n\n'Everybody knew'\n\nTrump had pressed his devotees for weeks, telling them the election had been stolen and they had to act.\n\nOn Dec. 12, the president tweeted, Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington for Stop the Steal. … WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!! A week later, he encouraged followers to attend the big protest, saying, Be there, will be wild!\n\nThen, at a Georgia rally two days before the electoral count, Trump repeated his claim that the White House had been stolen. We're going to fight like hell, I'll tell you right now, he said. We're going to take it back.\n\nBased on intelligence from social media, the FBI warned on Jan. 5 that far-right extremists were planning a war on the Capitol.\n\nThe next day, Trump urged the crowd to descend on the House and Senate, telling them, When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by different rules. … If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\n\nClint Watts, a distinguished research fellow with the nonpartisan Foreign Policy Research Institute, said anyone paying attention knew the Jan. 6 march was a potential flashpoint because of Trump's rhetoric and his followers' battle plans on social media.\n\nThey were talking about storming the Capitol, Watts said. I expected cops being beaten, cops being shot, Molotov cocktails. … Everybody knew. The intelligence community knew.\n\nMichael Linick, a retired Army colonel who has planned for presidential inaugurations, said Capitol agencies have a blueprint for security that includes exercises and coordination with the military for major events. Yet those protocols apparently did not come into play.\n\nSomething stopped what normally should have happened from happening, said Linick, a senior defense and international policy researcher with the Rand Corp.\n\nThat something, he and others said, was paralysis spawned by two things.\n\nPolice and military authorities at all levels were smarting from criticism after National Guard troops joined police last summer to violently clear Black Lives Matter demonstrators near the White House.\n\nAnd some worried about putting soldiers at the Capitol when Trump supporters were openly suggesting the use of martial law to keep the president in power.\n\nThere's a simple reason soldiers weren't in place to protect the Capitol, reflected in a Defense Department timeline and a police account: The National Guard was not asked in advance to show up, even though Pentagon officials said they offered to provide backup.\n\nIt wasn't until the Capitol had been stormed that the Pentagon got a request – and without planning, the Guard couldn't muster quickly enough.\n\nThe miscalculation will not be repeated during Biden's inauguration next week, when more than 21,000 soldiers are expected to protect the Capitol.\n\nUnderestimating the threat\n\nThe Save America March was organized in part by Women for America First, a pro-Trump organization that obtained a permit from the National Park Service for an event to follow Trump's rally at the White House.\n\nDemonstrations at the Capitol are commonplace, and a handful of organizations share responsibility for security planning.\n\nThat includes the U.S. Capitol Police, overseen by Congress and directed by sergeants at arms for the House and Senate and the Capitol architect, and Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, which is responsible for law enforcement in nonfederal areas. It also includes federal law enforcement agencies such as the National Park Service and the Secret Service, as well as the National Guard and the Defense Department.\n\nOn Dec. 31, Mayor Muriel Bowser requested support from the district's National Guard. In a letter to the commanding general, William Walker, she asked that troops be deployed for traffic duty, freeing up Metro police to work security during the march. Bowser stressed in her letter that no (Guard) personnel shall be armed during this mission.\n\nUnlike governors, who command National Guard operations within their states, Bowser has no authority to call up district soldiers; they are directed by the Defense Department.\n\nStill, Bowser got exactly what she requested. According to a Pentagon timeline, Trump approved 340 soldiers to handle traffic on Jan. 6 so Metro Police officers could work crowd control.\n\nAs Congress' certification of the Electoral College results grew near – and extremist messaging on the internet grew more ominous – mainstream media warned of violence. And Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund began to sweat.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Sund said he reached out to Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger and his counterpart at the House, Paul Irving, on Jan. 4, asking for Guard backup.\n\nAccording to Sund, permission was denied because Irving didn't like the optics and Stenger thought the chief could informally ask National Guard leaders to be on alert. (Sund, Stenger and Irving, all of whom resigned after the siege, could not be reached for comment.)\n\nThe next day, an FBI memo warned of bloodshed in graphic terms, citing an online thread shared among prospective demonstrators: Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood … being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march. … Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die.\n\nIt is unclear how widely FBI intelligence was shared among law enforcement agencies and the military.\n\nAbout that time, the Save America March permit was amended. Instead of 5,000 participants, there would be up to 30,000.\n\nThe miscalculation\n\nRight-wing radicals are notorious for bloodthirsty rhetoric that often doesn't lead to action. Moreover, the mob that descended on the Capitol had full-throated backing from Trump, who positioned himself as the law-and-order president.\n\nStill, Watts, Kohn and others said the failure to anticipate an attack was remarkable given the volume and intensity of violent rhetoric from Trump and his devotees.\n\nThat miscalculation may have been enhanced, Watts suggested, by unconscious bias. The attendees weren't people of color, but mostly white – so some in authority may have viewed them as less threatening.\n\nThis is a Blue Lives Matter crowd, Watts said, referring to a pro-police slogan. I think that kind of gave (security officials) a disorienting way to think about it.\n\nAvoiding a repeat fiasco\n\nOn June 1, National Guard troops and federal law enforcement used tear gas, batons and less lethal projectiles to drive peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters out of Lafayette Square, clearing the way for Trump to pose with a Bible at St. John's Church. National Guard helicopters buzzed demonstrators later that evening.\n\nThe use of military force against civilians drew such a fierce backlash that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a public apology. In Congress, hearings were convened to challenge the use of National Guard troops for a political event.\n\nWatts said concerns about that fiasco appear to have factored into the House and Senate sergeants at arms' denial for Sund to seek National Guard reinforcements. It also may have influenced the District of Columbia's preparations.\n\nTwo days before last week's rally, the District of Columbia Council issued a statement calling on all coordinating agencies to ensure safety, prevent violence, and to do so with no appearance of preference or disparate treatment.\n\nKenyan McDuffie, chair pro tempore of the council, said the goal was to avoid any repeat of what happened during Black Lives Matter demonstrations.\n\nThe world watched law enforcement attack peaceful protesters with rubber bullets and chemical agents, all to facilitate a photo op for President Trump, McDuffie said.\n\nThe day before last week's rally, Bowser wrote a second letter – this one to the Pentagon and the U.S. Attorney General. During summer protests, she noted, Washington's Metropolitan Police Department had to manage crowds while working around unidentifiable, armed federal law enforcement.\n\nThat caused confusion among residents and visitors and could become a national security threat with no way for MPD and federal law enforcement to decipher armed groups, she wrote.\n\nTo be clear, Bowser concluded, the District of Columbia is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel and discourages any additional deployment without notification.\n\nFears of martial law?\n\nWith Trump planning a rally and social media pushing his supporters toward violence, Sund told The Washington Post he grew increasingly worried.\n\nOn Jan. 4, the Capitol Police chief asked House and Senate sergeants at arms for permission to request additional Guard members. The congressional officers balked, Sund said, with Irving citing concerns that declaring an emergency would produce bad optics.\n\nThat evening, Sund spoke with the National Guard commander in the district about leaning forward so there would be some readiness in case troops needed to be called in an emergency, according to the Post. But there was no plan, no force in place.\n\nThis is where some analysts believe a third factor influenced decision-making: the issue of martial law.\n\nAs the threat of violence loomed, Sund told the Post, Lt. Gen. Walter E. Piatt, director of the Army Staff, declined to recommend that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy approve an urgent request for Guard deployment, saying he did not like the image of the National Guard standing a police line with the Capitol in the background.\n\nAs the mob was storming the Capitol, Sund told the Post, he pleaded with the Defense Department to send troops but got no help until the assault was over. His account was corroborated by John Falcicchio, Bowser's chief of staff, who said Sund was literally crying for help during a conference call, according to the Post.\n\nPiatt disputed that version of events. He said when McCarthy received the Capitol Police request for reinforcements, he immediately ran to the Acting Secretary of Defense's office to request approval.\n\nPentagon and National Guard officials have stressed that, after a request has been submitted, it takes hours to assemble, equip and transport civilian soldiers unless they have already been mobilized.\n\nLinick, the retired Army colonel, said notions of a martial law declaration may have added to Pentagon concerns over the Lafayette Square scandal.\n\nIn December, a pro-Trump organization called We the People took out an ad in The Washington Times urging the president to immediately declare a limited form of Martial Law and temporarily suspend the Constitution so the military could oversee a revote in key states.\n\nFormer national security adviser Michael Flynn, a Trump confidant and retired Army lieutenant general who had been pardoned by the president days earlier, broached the idea on Newsmax and was invited to a meeting with the president. According to The New York Times, the ensuing discussion led to infighting among White House staffers.\n\nTen former secretaries of defense were so disturbed by talk of military interference with the democratic process they authored an op-ed Jan. 3, exhorting current Pentagon leaders to refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team.\n\nWatts, the Foreign Policy Research Institute fellow, said angst about political sensitivities undoubtedly was magnified by Trump's willingness to castigate and fire officials who challenged him.\n\nThe result, Watts said: a systemic breakdown where security officials were in this sort of paralysis about what to do. … Everybody's just trying to ride out the term and not get fired or draw the president's ire.\n\nThe fear of getting cross-wise with the commander and chief has to weigh on decision-making, agreed Linick.\n\nA mob attacks\n\nAfter Trump's fiery speech at the White House, his followers trekked toward a joint session of Congress that had just gotten underway. Some wore riot helmets and were armed with chemical spray, metal pipes and baseball bats.\n\nDon Ritchie, historian emeritus of the U.S. Senate, said the Capitol Police force has been beefed up and professionalized over the years in response to previous riots, shootings and other violence. Still, he said, the duty mostly involves keeping tabs on high school kids, and the force seemed overwhelmed and underprepared on Jan. 6.\n\nThere's never been an incident such as this where a mob attacked the building, broke in and tried to attack the members of Congress, Ritchie said.\n\nThe National Guard had been called up only twice previously to protect the Capitol, Ritchie said – in 1932 when military veterans marched peacefully to request World War I pensions, and during the 1968 political riots. The halls of Congress were not breached in either incident.\n\nWhile many police officers resisted valiantly last week, video showed some simply stepping aside. (Two Capitol Police officers have been suspended for misconduct and at least 20 reportedly are under investigation.)\n\nInsurgents pushed through barricades, scaled walls, bashed windows, vandalized offices and posed for selfies. For about two hours, they occupied the Capitol.\n\nThis week, all eight members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff signed a memo to military personnel urging them to obey lawful orders from civilian leadership … and remain fully committed to protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States from enemies foreign and domestic.\n\nFive people died in the Jan. 6 insurrection, including two officers. Dozens of law enforcement personnel were hurt.\n\nWhen it was over, a question lingered like smoke over a battlefield: Where was the National Guard?\n\nMitch McConnell, R-Ky., the Senate majority leader, has launched a congressional probe into what he described as a massive failure of security.\n\nBut Watts said that's not the end of the story. A dysfunctional presidency has weakened democratic institutions and undermined public confidence, he warned, leaving polarization, distrust and vulnerability. It's a corrosive, slow cancer.\n\nContributing: Kevin McCoy
Mike Hembree\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nCONCORD, N.C. — NASCAR teams will no longer be allowed to repair heavily damaged race cars and return them to competition during events, the sanctioning body announced Wednesday.\n\nNASCAR's new Damaged Vehicle Policy will allow teams to make relatively minor repairs on pit road during a five-minute window but will prevent drivers from returning to races after heavy damage from accidents.\n\nNASCAR senior vice president of competition Scott Miller said the changes are being made to improve safety both on-track and in speedway garages.\n\nI've been involved in crash repairs, and that's not a great situation in the garage with 20 people running around, oil leaking on the floor, things catching on fire and sharp sheet metal being cut off, Miller said. It's a fairly unsafe situation. And at times it would be unsafe really for the driver to get back in a car that was damaged that heavily.\n\nIt's more about crashed vehicles and all that is involved with that, from the crew guys to the drivers to dropping more debris on the track, which always happens.\n\nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE:\n\nNew points system leaves Truex Jr. pondering, 'what if'\n\nNASCAR adds traveling medical team for all Cup races\n\nBrad Keselowski, visiting Wings, not worried about NASCAR's changes\n\nTeams will be allowed to correct mechanical problems or replace batteries and make similar repairs, but fixing extensive damage caused by accidents will no longer be allowed, Miller said.\n\nOften, teams have repaired accident damage so that drivers can return to the track to make a few laps and pick up points.\n\nThe most famous example of this occurred in the final race of the 1973 season, when point leader Benny Parsons crashed heavily early in the event. Mechanics from other teams swarmed Parsons' car and pieced together repairs to allow him to return to the track and score enough points to win the championship.\n\nUnder the new rules, Parsons would not have been allowed to return to the track.\n\nThe changes will be in effect for all three national series: Monster Energy NASCAR Cup, Xfinity and Camping World Truck.\n\nAdditionally, Miller said Wednesday that NASCAR's move to segmented races will impact the point at which events are considered official in case of weather issues. Previously, a race that reached the halfway point was considered official. Now, Miller said, races that reach the end of the second of three stages will be official.\n\nStage lengths will be different at each track, and many of those lengths have not been determined. Officials said Wednesday that the stages for the season-opening Daytona 500, scheduled for Feb. 26, will be 60 laps for stages one and two and 80 laps for stage three. The race would be considered official after 120 laps, as opposed to 100 laps (halfway) in previous seasons.\n\nThe Daytona stage lengths were determined after calculating probable fuel windows, Miller said. Segment lengths for other races and tracks are still under consideration, but NASCAR anticipates announcing more news within days.\n\nFollow Hembree on Twitter @mikehembree\n\nPHOTOS: HISTORY OF THE DAYTONA 500
Saritha Prabhu\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nSaritha Prabhu of Clarksville is a USA TODAY NETWORK Tennessee columnist.\n\nOne of the reasons Donald Trump got elected president was because he spoke the truth about our nearly two decades-long foreign policy in the Middle East.\n\nThe gist of his argument was: We've spent trillions of dollars on wars, occupation and nation-building in the Middle East and have achieved nothing. Our soldiers have suffered grievously with our military adventurism. That money could've been better spent on domestic nation-building to help Americans lead better lives.\n\nWhatever one thinks of Trump and his character, his argument was sound and was embraced by tens of millions of Americans. It also echoed what another populist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was saying in much of 2016.\n\nWith this argument, Trump was able to pulverize the foreign policy establishment wings of both parties, represented by Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.\n\nOUR VIEW:Backtracking on Syria leaves foreign policy in a better place\n\nRead more commentary:As a Syrian refugee in America, I watched my country collapse. But there is a path to hope.\n\nMy husband lost a limb in Afghanistan. Now, as his caregiver, I'm on the front lines.\n\nAs American troops install razor wire in Arizona, images of the Berlin Wall resurface\n\nFast-forward to 2018, and to Trump's unilateral decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, overriding the advice of his generals and almost the entire foreign policy establishment.\n\nElites want the US in Middle East conflict forever\n\nMany foreign policy and military elites and experts have been crying foul in recent weeks. The usual arguments have unfolded: America is in retreat and its global leadership role will be weakened; we'll cede Syria to Russia and Iran; our ally Israel will be threatened and so on and so forth.\n\nIn other words, America should have a military presence forever and ever till death do us part in several Middle Eastern countries.\n\nOne can't help noticing that many of these people are the same experts who thought it a good idea to advance regime-change in Iraq and Libya, who are now advocating the same in Syria, and who think occupying Afghanistan for 17 years and running is sound.\n\nWhy are we still listening to them? They may have impeccable credentials, but their motives, judgment and agendas can often be suspect.\n\nBetween the neoconservatives and the liberal interventionists in our foreign policy establishment, America has become toast.\n\nSuggestions for future military interventions\n\nAs a party-less, ideology-less independent voter who wants only the best for America, I'll take political courage and common sense wherever I can find them. So I applaud Trump's courage, pragmatism and independence in bucking our military-industrial complex.\n\nGoing forward, I have three humble suggestions for any gung-ho military interventions:\n\n►We sorely need separate congressional authorization for each new military incursion. That means exhaustive hearings, democratic debate and public consensus. One problem we've had since the 2001 terrorist attacks is that we've had a roving, all-purpose Authorization for Use of Military Force used and/or abused to initiate, expand and/or unendingly keep our armed forces in an increasing number of Muslim-majority countries. Does the American public even know the size and nature of our post-2001 expanding military footprint?\n\n►For the love of God, let's spread the sacrifice around. When commentators such as Max Boot, Joe Scarborough, Bret Stephens and other foreign policy and media elites send their grown children to fight in the Middle East, Middle America's sons and daughters can go, too. Otherwise, no can do.\n\n►For any new future military interventions, there ought to be clear goals and a clear exit strategy delineated with no room for mission creep and endless quagmires.\n\nOne reason we admire President George H.W. Bush was because he kept the Persian Gulf War in check and didn't get us embroiled in Iraq. Let's emulate that restraint and wisdom.\n\nThere will always be strife and chaos in the Middle East due to the centuries-long Shiite-Sunni enmity. Our military presence there doesn't mitigate it; we are, in some ways, participants there and often end up sowing more discord and creating more terrorists.\n\nAnd of course there are the unforeseen, unintended consequences: Our Iraq misadventure ended up empowering Iran and imperiling the Christian minority in Iraq. Our Libyan fiasco ended up creating the refugee and migrant crisis affecting Europe.\n\nTo the American voter I'd humbly say: Think for yourself. Don't fall for the same tired drumbeats. Reject blind loyalty to party and ideology. Realize that on the issues of illegal immigration and war, especially, there are vested interests with ulterior motives pushing counterintuitive policies. Always keep America's interests in mind.\n\nSaritha Prabhu is a columnist for The Tennessean, where this column originally appeared.
Michelle R. Martinelli\n\nFor The Win\n\nThis week, the Arizona Cardinals hired Kliff Kingsbury, the 39-year-old former Texas Tech coach who was recently fired after six seasons and a 35-40 record, including three straight losing seasons.\n\nLike many fans — they were also stunned that Kingsbury lasted only a few weeks as USC's offensive coordinator — Dallas WFAA sportscaster Dale Hansen was surprised by the Cardinals' coaching hire and criticized it.\n\nAs Hansen explicitly says on the ABC affiliate station, it is not because Kingsbury was fired and is now being given a second chance. His outrage and shock echos that of countless fans who have pointed out the lack of diversity among NFL coaches, specifically that white privilege enables less accomplished white coaches to be elevated over coaches of color with stronger resumes.\n\nWhile admonishing the NFL for consistently overlooking coaches of color or being too quick to fire them compared with their white counterparts — he takes a shot at Dallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett — Hansen recognizes his own white privilege and argues for an end to the obvious double standard.\n\nHe said:\n\nKingsbury fits all the criteria to be a head coach in the NFL: He's an offensive genius, he's young — and he's white, and not necessarily in that order.\n\nThere have been six new coaches hired so far, all white and two coaches of color. They are replacing Steve Wilks, fired in Arizona after just one year, Vance Joseph in Denver after just two. The Cowboys coach Jason Garrett is in his ninth year — apparently because he wins so much.\n\nA lot of people don't understand how Kingsbury can have a losing record at Texas Tech, no NFL experience, and get one of the 32 NFL jobs. But getting fired at Tech doesn't eliminate him from moving up — at least it doesn't to me. I've had 11 jobs in my life, been fired from eight of them, and moved up every time. And I am arrogant enough to tell you I think Channel 8 was right to give me another chance. But I am the product of white privilege in America, and I've never denied that I wasn't, either. If they made a poster, my picture should be on it.\n\nGetting fired at one place and getting another chance isn't the problem. But young talented coaches of color not getting the chance — that's a huge problem. The covert racism of the NFL ownership group was so bad, the NFL had to make a rule so that minority coaches could at least get an interview.\n\nCowboys secondary coach Kris Richard has been interviewed, and there are reports saying he might get the Miami job. After what he's done with this Cowboys defense, how could he not? Unless it is true what black parents have been telling their children for decades now: You have to be twice as good to go half as far. I dream of the day when those parents are wrong, because now, they're not.\n\nHansen isn't one to keep his thoughts to himself and has previously taken strong stances against things like Jerry Jones' hypocritical national anthem policy and defended peaceful protests in the league.\n\nMORE:\n\nTwitter absolutely destroyed the Jets for hiring Adam Gase as their new head coach\n\nBaker Mayfield had a simple, 3-letter response to claim that he scares away coaches\n\nColts' Quenton Nelson is so good, he's making offensive line highlights a thing\n\nManny Pacquiao challenges Floyd Mayweather to... a game of one-on-one hoops?\n\nThe Cardinals Twitter account zinged Stephen A.

Melissa Johns\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nA little boy I met in an immigration detention facility in December loves pizza. His brother loves carne asada. The three of us had a lengthy discussion on the relative merits of the two (I prefer carne asada) while their mother regained her composure. She had just told me about their escape from gang extortion in Honduras, and how the three of them would be tortured and murdered if they returned.\n\nI saw many families like theirs in the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, a privately-run detention center with beds for 2,400 women and children. Most of the people confined there are sent after being apprehended by border patrol. I volunteered with the Dilley Pro Bono Project, a legal services and advocacy organization providing on-the-ground assistance to families seeking asylum.\n\nIt was a stressful scene. We worked in a trailer to which the detainees could come if they wanted legal assistance, hearing by word of mouth and a slip of paper from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that we were available to help them.\n\nThe trailer had a capacity of 135 people and it was regularly packed with lines out the door. Most of the women brought small children in with them, most of whom were coughing. All seemed overwhelmed by the process but some of the women clearly seemed traumatized: blank stares, slow to respond when we spoke to them. Detainees wore sweatshirts and sweatpants distributed by center staff with tennis shoes and plastic rosary beads.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nGender-related violence should be grounds for asylum. Congress must fix this for women.\n\nMy son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die.\n\nAs American troops install razor wire in Arizona, images of the Berlin Wall resurface\n\nThe clients I served had horrible stories. There was a Salvadoran woman who had been paying the MS-13 gang $200 in rent every month since 2010. Her husband missed one payment and was killed by them. My client went to the police for help finding the body, sparking the kidnapping of one of her children and threats to the level that the police told her she needed to leave. They could not protect her.\n\nAnother client protested against the Nicaraguan government in the street demonstrations last spring. She attended meetings with opposition leaders and later saw police taking pictures of her house. They told her to stop organizing or she'd face the same fate as others who were kidnapped, tortured and killed by the government earlier that year.\n\nI also helped a Honduran woman who had been beaten and raped by her husband weekly for the last 10 years. He wouldn't let her go out or attend her church. This woman was so articulate in her denunciation of the misogynistic attitudes that pervaded her home, I was inspired.\n\nThe other volunteers and I worked in the trailer from 7:30 am to 8:00 pm every day, seeing woman after woman. The volume of need is overwhelming. The women I met have legitimate asylum claims that meet the standards of U.S. law, but few presented their case at first in a way that hit all the elements required by asylum officers. This is not because the connections and facts weren't there, but because they didn't know how to speak about these traumas and terrors in ways designed to meet an arcane statute.\n\nLuck and lawyers determine who gets help\n\nA credible claim of deadly persecution is not enough — under U.S. asylum law, it must be coupled with a specific category and the client needs to show in detail why the local authorities won't help. If they had not had the help of lawyers and other volunteers, many would have been unfairly sent back to horrible dangers.\n\nThe vagaries of luck on who gets support and who doesn't haunt me. Applicants for asylum are far more likely to prevail in their claims with the help of a lawyer than on their own. The additional barriers the Trump administration seeks to place between asylum seekers and their rights under U.S. and international law (including detaining them in Mexico) will likely only lower women's access to counsel.\n\nDetention is costly to the U.S. public as well. Family facility detention costs an average of $161.36 per day, according to a Department of Homeland Security 2017 Budget in Brief report.\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking $2.8 billion to increase the number of beds in immigration detention centers from about 40,000 to 52,000 — an unconscionable amount given how inhumane and unnecessary these policies are. Holding asylum seekers in Mexico will likely add to the expense as the U.S. government shuttles asylum seekers back and forth for court hearings.\n\nSecurity and deterrence claims fall flat\n\nWhat is the return on all this investment? Greater national security is a flimsy justification: Immigrants who participated in alternatives to detention programs from 2011 to 2013 appeared at their final hearings 95 percent of the time, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nDeterrence as a reason is also unconvincing. The women I met were afraid of being killed. Treating them as threats to our communities and locking them up when they arrive with their scared children does more to debase us as a people than to stop desperate families from fleeing violence.\n\nIs this who we are as a country? Those little boys debating pizza versus carne asada should be in school, reunited with their family and helping their mother heal from the painful separation from her country, culture and community. And my taxpayer dollars should be going towards civilized and effective ways of supporting asylum seekers who come to the United States, not funding the effective imprisonment and offshoring of sick and terrified women and children.\n\nMelissa Johns, a volunteer at the Immigration Justice Campaign, works at the United Nations Foundation.

Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani counted on the nuclear deal he promoted with world powers as a pathway to extend his influence and offset hard-line forces in his country. U.S. and European leaders hoped the deal would boost Rouhani's moderate bloc, particularly now that an end to international sanctions opens Iranian trade with Europe and Asia.\n\nInternational sanctions against Iran lifted in landmark nuke deal\n\nImplementing the Iran deal means new tests, starting now\n\nRouhani found little short-term political payoff from sanctions relief, which he called a victory for the people of Iran, according to Iran's state-controlled Islamic Students News Agency.\n\nSunday, a day after the sanctions were lifted, Rouhani said he was not happy that only four of his candidates in Tehran to run in next month's parliamentary elections were approved by Iran's Guardian Council, according to Iranian reporter Rohollah Faghihi at Entekhab News.\n\nThe four are among 30 moderates approved to run, representing a mere 1% of all candidates, said Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst with the International Crisis Group based in London. The Guardian Council consists of members appointed by the supreme leader and parliament to vet candidates seeking office.\n\nThe nuclear deal has exacerbated political infighting in Iran between Rouhani and hard-liners who opposed the accord, and the clash will get worse before it gets even worse, Vaez said.\n\nIt comes as three pivotal elections are scheduled over the next 18 months, he said. Two elections in February will be held for parliament and the Assembly of Experts, which selects a successor to supreme leader Ali Khamenei. In June 2017, Iran will choose a new president.\n\nThe stakes in all of these elections are high, Vaez said. If the existing balance of power in the parliament is significantly tilted in favor of President Rouhani and his pragmatic allies, he will be in a better position to challenge other power centers. If the opposite happens, he might become a lame duck president for the rest of his term.\n\nFaghihi said the success of the nuclear deal should help Rouhani's camp in elections, but the country's hard-liners still wield great influence and are widely expected to work to undermine Rouhani and the deal, he wrote in an analysis published by independent news site Middle East Eye.\n\nAs news of the deal broke Saturday, Iran's state TV, controlled by Rouhani's political rivals, barely covered the subject, Faghihi said.\n\nThe Fars News Agency, which is tied to Iran's radical Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, carried defiant reactions from military generals to new economic sanctions the United States imposed Sunday over Iran's ballistic missile tests last year.\n\nIran's defense minister, Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehqan, said Monday that Iran will soon unveil new missiles in defiance of the latest U.S. sanctions, Iran's PressTV reported.\n\nU.S. sanctions Iran's ballistic missile program\n\nThe new sanctions are indicative of the continued U.S. hostile policy and acrimony toward the Iranian nation, and a futile effort to undermine Iran's defense might, Dehqan said.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry weighed in to protest the sanctions, saying, The Islamic Republic of Iran will respond to such propaganda and harassing measures with pursuing its legal missile program more seriously and enhancing its national defense and security capabilities, according to the Fars News Agency.
Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The Pentagon will review more than 1,100 medals issued since the 9/11 terror attacks for possible upgrade to the Medal of Honor, the country's highest award issued for valor in combat, according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe sweeping review ordered by Defense Secretary Ash Carter would represent one of the most significant steps in decades to honor troops who have displayed extraordinary courage in combat. It stems from a study of military decorations and awards that was ordered in March 2014 by then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to ensure that after 13 years of combat the awards system appropriately recognizes the service, sacrifices and action of our service members.\n\nShould even a fraction of the medals under review be upgraded, it's possible that dozens more troops would receive the Medal of Honor for their bravery in Iraq and Afghanistan. A formal announcement is scheduled for Thursday. The review and creation of new awards to honor the-post 9/11 generation of troops are the latest in a series of dramatic steps Carter has taken regarding military personnel; others include opening all combat jobs to women, and preparing to rescind the ban on transgender troops from serving.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, Marine veteran and member of the House Armed Services Committee, saluted the Pentagon's medal review but called it overdue. He blamed military red tape and too many layers of approval required for all the medals it awards for valor.\n\nIt's a systemic problem, Hunter said. I'm glad they're finally getting around to fixing it. This is military bureaucracy at its worst.\n\nAmong the other recommendations Carter has approved:\n\n• A new award for troops who have directed drones over battlefields in the Middle East and Afghanistan. The R device would be awarded to recognize remote impacts on combat operations.\n\n• Establishing a standard definition for meritorious service that limits combat awards to those exposed to hostile action or at significant risk of exposure.\n\n• Setting goals and guidelines to ensure Medal of Honor and other awards are made in a timely way.\n\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the service organization that represents 1.7 million members, supports the review and the recognition for drone operators, said Joe Davis, a spokesman.\n\nFor those too few who survived, and to the memories of those who did not, the VFW welcomes Secretary Carter's decision and that of his predecessor to make sure that whenever we finally exit these wars that it is with the full confidence that we properly took care of those who took care of the mission, Davis said. They, their families and our nation deserve nothing less.\n\nThe proposal for potential upgrades to Medal of Honor has the potential to be the most controversial. Of the 37 recommendations, it was the only one not reached by consensus, records show. It would require the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy to re-examine each of the Service Cross and Silver Star nominations they have awarded since Sept. 11, 2001. The Army alone awarded 718 Silver Stars.\n\nThe Army and Air Force plan to review the Service Crosses and Silver Stars each branch has awarded. But the Navy and Marine Corps oppose such a review, according to a briefing paper, because top officials there believe reviewing prior decisions undermines the integrity of commanders' decisions. The Marine Corps is a department of the Navy.\n\nA memo from Navy Secretary Ray Mabus added that such a review may have long-term detrimental impact on our service culture and our awards program.\n\nMabus' memo goes on to note that the Pentagon certified in 2010 that the services' Medal of Honor processes and standards were sound.\n\nMuch of the prestige of our valor decorations stems from confidence in the process before awarding them, the memo says. Reconsidering all previous valor award decisions without an evidentiary basis would reverse the longstanding policy that protects the integrity of the process by which we award our highest decorations.\n\nPart of the rationale for the recommendation to review the Service Crosses and Silver Stars, according to another briefing paper, is that from 2001 to 2010, all the Medals of Honor for U.S. conflicts were bestowed posthumously. After this Pentagon guidance was issued, there is no requirement to meet the 'risk of life' portion of the (Medal of Honor) award criteria all recipients have been living.\n\nIn addition, the paper notes, Combat experience of commanders differed early in the conflict and this lack of combat experience may have led to an initial reluctance to recommend members for the (Medal of Honor).\n\nThe review included input from more than 1,000 combat-experienced troops at 13 posts, according to another document.\n\nSeventeen Medals of Honor have been awarded since 2001. Four were for service in Iraq, while 13 were for Afghanistan. All four medals for Iran were posthumous.\n\nListen to reporter Tom Vanden Brook what he learned while reporting on this big change to the Medal of Honor process:\n\nAsked about the Pentagon's actions on medals, White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Wednesday said he didn't want his remarks to affect the rigorous process in awarding the medal. But he did acknowledge the sacrifices troops have made since 9/11.\n\nThat's an indication that this generation of Americans has — has borne a significant burden in protecting our country since 9/11, Earnest said. And we certainly have — the president himself has raised concerns about the wisdom of the decision that was made by the previous administration to go to war in Iraq, but that does not in any way diminish the president's deep appreciation, respect and even honor for those who have served our country in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11.\n\nObama bestows Medal of Honor on soldier who showed 'guts' in suicide attack\n\nThe most recent recipient of the Medal of Honor was Army Capt. Florent Groberg. He was serving on a personal-protection detail on Aug. 8, 2012 when his patrol was ambushed by two suicide bombers. Groberg grabbed the first bomber and pushed him away, triggering an explosion that severely wounded him but saved several lives.\n\nHunter, who has advocated for upgrades in honors for several troops, said he does not anticipate a flood of new Medal of Honor awards. But several should be changed quickly, he said.\n\nNone of these guys cares about getting the awards, Hunter said. This is something that the brass should do for the people who serve under them.
Is President Trump intelligent? A majority of American voters believe he is — but that doesn't mean a majority believe he's level-headed, according to a new poll out Wednesday.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University National Poll found that 53% believe the president is intelligent, compared to 44% who believe he is not. That's part of an overall downward trend over the past year, according to Quinnipiac. In January 2017, prior to his inauguration, 68% of voters said the president was intelligent, while 27% said he was not.\n\nFurther, 69% of voters said they didn't believe the president was level-headed, while 28% said he was. The number of voters saying they didn't think the president was level-headed was up from January 2017, when 62% said they didn't think the president was level-headed and 33% said he was.\n\nThe new numbers were released days after the president proclaimed that he was intelligent, in the wake of a new tell-all book that claimed aides were unsure of his mental capacities. The White House has disavowed the book.\n\nActually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart, Trump tweeted on Saturday, the day after the book, Fire and Fury, was released. He also said he was a very stable genius.\n\nThe poll also asked voters to grade the president's first year in office:\n\n39% gave him an F\n\n17% gave him a D\n\n16% gave him an A\n\n16% gave him a B\n\n11% gave him a C\n\nIt's been a very tough freshman year for President Donald Trump, by any measure, Tim Malloy, the poll's assistant director, said in a statement. Considered an intelligent person with a really bad report card, filled with far more F's than A's or B's, the president is a long way from the dean's list in the eyes of voters.\n\nQuinnipiac surveyed 1,106 voters around the country from Jan. 5-9. The poll has an error margin of 3.6 points.\n\nMore:Trump, mocking questions on his mental state, tweets he is a 'stable genius'\n\nMore:Battles over Trump's mental health and 'fitness' for office sidetrack his policy agenda
WASHINGTON — President Trump called on the Senate to pass a bill outlawing abortions after 20 weeks, telling a group of anti-abortion protesters in the Rose Garden that late-term abortions are wrong and it has to change.\n\nUnder my administration, we will always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence, and that is the right to life, Trump told anti-abortion activists taking part in the March for Life.\n\nTrump is the first president to directly address the annual rally, an event that marks the 45th anniversary Monday of the Supreme Court's Roe. v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.\n\nTrump's speech to marchers gave the protest added visibility, rededicating himself to a conservative base that he sees as the key to his election victory in 2016.\n\nMore:Trump, Paul Ryan will speak at Friday's March for Life anti-abortion rally in D.C.\n\nA top priority for those voters: The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which passed the House on a largely party-line vote in October. But the bill appears unlikely to pass the Senate, where Democrats have enough numbers to force a filibuster.\n\nAbortion rights supporters dispute the science behind the proposed law, and say it's an unconstitutional attempt to restrict a woman's right to have an abortion.\n\nBut the White House said Friday the president would continue to push for the bill's passage. We think it's important for this administration to be on record in support of life, said White House legislative director Marc Short.\n\nTrump also touted executive action he's taken on abortion-related issues during his first year in office. He reinstated and expanded President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy, which forbids U.S. foreign development aid from supporting abortion — a policy critics call the global gag rule. And he signed an executive order on religious freedom.\n\nThat executive order has resulted in a new policy, announced Thursday, to defend the rights of health care professionals to refuse to perform abortion-related services on religious or conscientious objection grounds.\n\nGreeting marchers at a White House event Thursday night — and again in the Rose Garden Friday — Vice President Pence called Trump the most pro-life president in American history.\n\nMore:Trump is the 'most pro-life president in American history,' Pence says\n\nThe Rose Garden event was part of a deliberate strategy to raise the visibility of anti-abortion protesters, who have complained they haven't gotten as much attention as other Washington protests, including last year's Women's March — which specifically excluded women opposed to abortion.\n\nYou know, the press never gives them the credit that they deserve. They'll have three hundred, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred thousand people, you won't even read about it, Trump told ABC News in an interview last year.
Terry DeMio\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nEDGEWOOD, Ky. — The number of HIV cases linked to injection-drug use in Northern Kentucky and Southwest Ohio increased dramatically last year, according to public health officials.\n\nNow the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is assisting with genetic testing to determine if the cases are connected.\n\nThe realization hit the treatment field over four years ago that we stood on a threshold of an epidemic within an epidemic: HIV, as a consequence of our opioid epidemic, said Dr. Mina Mike Kalfas of Fort Wright, Ky., an addiction expert who treats more than 200 heroin-addicted patients in Northern Kentucky.\n\nHIV outbreaks tied to injected drugs have occurred in recent years in places as disparate as Boston and rural Indiana.\n\n► Nov. 8:More than overdoses, IV opioid users' diseases overwhelm hospitals\n\n► Oct. 26:Trump orders public health emergency for opioids\n\n► Oct. 26:What Trump's opioid emergency declaration does — and doesn't — do\n\nHIV can be treated but not cured with expensive drugs, which can prevent retransmission of the virus in many patients. But if left untreated, people with the HIV virus develop AIDS, resulting in a range of opportunistic infections and death.\n\nThe Northern Kentucky Health Department in this Cincinnati suburb saw 18 cases of HIV-positive people in 2017 who identified injection drug use as a risk factor. The preliminary total is three times the number of such cases from 2009 to 2016 when zero to five cases were reported each year.\n\nCincinnati residents reported 40% higher rates of HIV than 2016, said Sharon Hutchins, supervising epidemiologist for the city health department's communicable disease unit. Cases linked to injection-drug use increased nearly 250% from 2016 to last year.\n\nThose who inject drugs are at risk of contracting HIV because the virus can stay on a used needle or other injection equipment, and people with addiction often share that equipment.\n\nAnyone who works in public safety and emergency health care is also at risk if they work with people who inject drugs. Paramedics in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky have treated many overdosed people with a needle still in their arm or near their body, and hospital caregivers have found needles buried in the clothing of those who have overdosed and are brought to hospitals.\n\nWhat's so frustrating is that Northern Kentucky had the opportunity to get in front of this, said Daniel Raymond, policy director for the National Harm Reduction Coalition in New York City who helped Northern Kentucky officials when they began efforts to attack the heroin epidemic.\n\nElected officials in Northern Kentucky's largest counties — Boone, Campbell and Kenton — have resisted needle-exchange operations.\n\n► July 2016:Indiana's HIV outbreak was avoidable, study says\n\n► April 2016:190 people in this Indiana town were diagnosed with HIV\n\nFarther south, Grant County, Ky., has one syringe exchange in the county health department's Williamstown office. Private grant money pays for the program.\n\nCincinnati and Hamilton County in Ohio have approved public money for needle-exchange programs for this year, a first in their history. They did so because of an upswing in hepatitis C, which also is raging in Northern Kentucky, and concerns about other communicable diseases such as HIV.\n\nLast year, the CDC warned that 54 Kentucky counties and 11 in Ohio were under threat of HIV outbreaks because of high hepatitis C rates.\n\n► October 2015:Needle-sharing dropped among addicts using Indiana exchange\n\n► September 2015:Needle-exchange policy prevented HIV\n\nRural Scott County in Indiana was the crucial red flag that spurred disease experts to do the analysis. That county experienced a quick and vicious HIV outbreak in 2014 and 2015.\n\nMore than 188 IV drug users were infected. About 90% also tested positive for hepatitis C.\n\nInfectious disease specialists learned that those afflicted were intravenous opioid drug users with the prescription painkiller Opana as their main choice to crush and inject.\n\n► May 2015:Indiana HIV outbreak may be peaking, officials say\n\n► March 2015:Indiana OKs clean needle exchange amid HIV outbreak\n\nKalfas, who has seen more HIV cases in the past year, called the spike in cases the sum of my fears.\n\nBut it's not as bad as it can get, he said. There's still prevention to be done.\n\nPrevention hinges on public health officials' quick action, Raymond said.\n\nThis has got to be an alarm signal for those communities that there's no time to waste, he said.\n\nFollow Terry DeMio on Twitter: @tdemio
Adom M. Cooper\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nI received my first dose of Pfizer's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020 and received the second dose on Monday, Jan. 11, 2021. Truthfully — I was nervous. Although tens of millions of Americans still wait for their chance to be vaccinated, I found myself uniquely positioned for early voluntary access because of my job at the United States Department of State.\n\nI have a privileged background and have no issue discussing it. My parents are Ivy Leaguers. My father is an anesthesiologist at the Cleveland Clinic medical center. I have a law degree and many friends and colleagues who are practicing physicians. Wealthy folks are offering $25,000 for vaccine access and my employment situation offered vaccination right away.\n\nSo why was I hesitant? I am African American.\n\nDistrust runs deep\n\nThis country's history, including the history of public health, is tainted with racist policies and practices. Black folks are skeptical and suspicious for many reasons. Our health care system has consistently fallen short of serving us in the same manner as our non-Black counterparts.\n\nAsk tennis pro Serena Williams about her risky emergency C-section when she delivered her daughter. Wealth does not protect you when Black women are 243% more likely than white women to die of pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes. Ask any Tuskegee Study victim and their families about one of the worst actions this country's health care system has taken against African Americans. President Bill Clinton apologized for the experiment in 1997, calling it so clearly racist. Ask any person belonging to a racial minority who feels they are treated differently by health care professionals due to their skin color.\n\nThe last place you want to be:The horrors of an ICU with COVID-19 should be enough to make you very cautious\n\nRacism is the risk factor, not race.\n\nCOVID-19 is no different. It continues to disproportionately affect and kill Blacks when compared to whites. Like compound interest, underlying societal and health care disadvantages are stacked against Black and brown communities; COVID-19 exposed everything. Despite this history, we are asked to trust a vaccine expedited from creation to mass production. But many African Americans would likely not be at such a high risk of contracting COVID-19 from the start if our health care system dedicated sufficient resources to addressing health issues they face.\n\nA supportive community convinced me\n\nGiven this history, I called my father when I was notified at work about vaccine access. I called my uncle who is a cardiologist (He said he was jealous that I had access this early. He wouldn't be vaccinated until Dec. 24). I texted two friends from college who are practicing physicians. I called another friend from college whose father is also a physician. The advice was consistent: Get the vaccine.\n\nI spent five hours worth of conversations spread across these five people. But if I did not have any family or friends in the medical field, whom would I call to reassure me? Who can less-privileged African Americans call for informed advice? The most ironic part: I had access to a vaccine before any of those I called, all of whom are working closer to COVID-19.\n\nFront line doctor:Overworked doctors, nurses are getting vaccinated. Here's why you should too.\n\nIf there were a way for me to donate my access, I would have given it to my father or uncle in a heartbeat. My father told me stories about Code Blues at hospitals, which usually warrant everyone dropping whatever they are doing to respond. Now, doctors and nurses must first suit up, if they aren't already, to protect themselves from COVID-19 before responding.\n\nI have the privilege of people in my life to discuss things with and help me weigh costs and benefits. If you are a Black or brown American, your government and institutions continually fail to provide a baseline of understanding and support. This is precisely why many Blacks folks do not want the vaccine right away. A recent poll conducted by The Undefeated and the Kaiser Family Foundation found that half of Black adults do not plan to take a coronavirus vaccine, even if scientists declare it safe and it is available at no cost.\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2020, a Black physician named Dr. Susan Moore died from COVID-19 in Indiana. Prior to her death, Moore said she had to beg for proper care, other doctors downplayed her pain and was prematurely discharged. Her case shows why the lack of faith in institutions and policy has never been restored.\n\nVaccination can only be the beginning\n\nAs I travel often, I have been vaccinated often. I understand vaccines, their efficacy, and potential side effects. I've taken malaria medication numerous times (yes, the dreams are that crazy). Yet, I was still hesitant. Many friends in my demographic (African American, educated with more than a bachelor's, living in a major U.S. city) shared their plans to stay away from any vaccine for at least a year.\n\nI am still going to socially distance and wear a mask. My lifestyle is not going to change.\n\nSo why did I choose COVID-19 vaccination?\n\nBias persists:How diversity training for health care workers can save patients' lives\n\nMy father put it best: The risks of not getting vaccinated are now greater than the risks of getting vaccinated. Waiting for any treatment or vaccine to stand the test of time does not apply here. You want as much protection as you can from the debilitating conditions of COVID-19. Without vaccination, you are betting on everyone around you not infecting you, consistently taking proper precautions and caring about you as much as themselves.\n\nThese are awful bets to place, especially for African Americans in 2020. The risks are too high. Everyone deserves the American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To fulfill that, we must end disparities in healthcare by ensuring everyone has not only vaccine access, but access to equitable health care.\n\nAdom M.

Delta Air Lines joined Alaska and American Thursday by announcing it will no longer accept emotional support animals, and will require official documentation for trained service dogs.\n\nStarting Monday, Delta will no longer take new bookings for emotional support animals, though those confirmed for travel prior to that date will be permitted to fly.\n\nThe airline's new policy defines trained service animals as dogs, regardless of breed, specifically trained to assist a person with a disability.\n\nPassengers traveling with a service dog after Monday will have to submit Department of Transportation documentation through the Delta website attesting to the dog's health, training and behavior and that it will not relieve itself on the aircraft on flights over eight hours or can do so without causing sanitation issues. The paperwork should be filed 48 hours prior to departure.\n\nIf travel is booked less than 48 hours prior to departure, a customer may present the documentation at the ticket counter or at the departure gate, the release said.\n\nService dogs with the right credentials will continue to fly free. Animals that do not may still be able to fly in the cargo hold or in a carrier under the passenger's seat, provided they meet Delta's requirements. But owners will have to pay a fee to bring them now. One-way fees start at $125. (The prices are similar on American.)\n\nDelta also said it is lifting its ban on pit bull type dogs as long as they meet the documentation requirements for trained service animals.\n\nAlaska Airlines and American will also implement their new policies Monday.\n\nAlaska, which announced its policy change just before New Years, was the first to act on new guidelines announced by the DOT on Dec. 2, which define what constitutes a service animal and give carriers the latitude to ban other animals other than dogs formally trained to aid people with physical or psychological disabilities. The updates to the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) also go into effect Monday.\n\nAlaska will honor previously booked travel with emotional support animals through Feb. 28, nearly a month longer than American, which will stop on Feb. 1.\n\nAmerican said Tuesday that it will allow animals in the cabin free of charge if they are trained service dogs. The change takes effect next Monday, although passengers who already bought tickets can fly with a companion animal until Feb. 1.\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department cleared the way for the crackdown against companion animals last month.\n\nAmerican said passengers with a service dog will need to complete a government form vouching for the dog's health, training and temperament.\n\nJessica Tyler, American's president of cargo, said the rules will help passengers with service animals and protect employees on planes and in airports.\n\nThe number of passengers flying with companion animals grew rapidly in recent years, with some saying the animals helped them overcome anxiety and other issues. Passengers only needed a note from a health professional, thus a cottage industry sprang up to provide those notes along with vests and other accoutrements for their animals.\n\nAirlines and particularly flight attendants took a more critical view, saying passengers were exploiting a loophole in federal regulations to avoid pet fees. In a few cases, some involving serious injuries, companion animals bit other passengers.\n\nThe DOT estimated that under the new rules airlines will scoop up $59.6 million a year in pet fees.\n\nTrendsetter: Alaska Airlines becomes first major US airline to announce emotional support animal ban\n\nContributing: Associated Press
How to outsmart Amazon's one card per purchase policy\n\nA workaround for two cards, one cart.
Jane Onyanga-Omara\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLONDON — The liquid lunch — once a mainstay for British white-collar workers — may finally be going down the drain.\n\nFinancial giant Lloyd's of London became the latest to bar its 800 employees from consuming alcohol from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday.\n\nLloyd's, an insurance market, made drinking a firing offense because roughly half of its disciplinary cases in the past year involve alcohol, spokesman Stewart Todd said.\n\nMany employees privately expressed anger that the ban is heavy-handed, the Financial Times reported.\n\nWorkers in the City of London and Canary Wharf — the British capital's main financial districts with numerous pubs, bars and restaurants — had a long-standing reputation for hard drinking. Those habits came to public attention during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nA number of staff at Lehman Brothers were spotted downing beer and tequila on the London trading floor as they heard of the bank's collapse, chronicling the beginning of the global meltdown. Lehman staffers later hit the bars in Canary Wharf in droves.\n\nTodd said Lloyd's introduced the ban because the firm wanted to reflect practices both in the city and at workplaces countrywide. U.S. companies were doing this years ago.\n\nThe lunchtime pint is something that has been fading away for a number of years in all businesses, he said.\n\nAn internal memo to the staff said: The policy we've introduced aligns us with many firms in the market. Drinking alcohol affects individuals differently. A zero limit is therefore simpler, more consistent and in line with the modern, global and high performance culture that we want to embrace.\n\nInsurance brokers and underwriters working for other firms at Lloyd's are exempt from the ban.\n\nLife is so professionally competitive now that few people working in banks or in brokers want to drink during the week. Of course, it is more than made up for at night when the wine, spirits and beer flow like Victoria Falls, market commentator David Buik told the London Evening Standard:\n\nDrinking in the City — the oldest part of London — has happened for hundreds of years, and traditions die hard, said Richard Kingdon, who co-founded City Beacon, an addiction counseling service, in the financial district about seven years ago.\n\nThere's still a network of drinkers, he told USA TODAY. It's a tradition, it's hard to break that generational thing.\n\nKingdon, who has worked with addicts for more than 20 years, said insurance workers and lawyers network during the day, while bankers and traders entertain clients in the evening.\n\nAbout 90% of his clients are men in their late 20s and early 30s, and they include senior workers in banking and law, brokers, traders and IT workers. Their main addictions are alcohol, cocaine, gambling and some porn, he said.\n\nKingdon said he can't see that banning alcohol will stop City workers from drinking during office hours.\n\nHow can they ban it if it's not even illegal? he said. There's a report of sacking (firing) people, but someone can't be discriminated against, even if they have a problem with substances. ... It all sounds good, but how are they going to enforce it?\n\nHe said employees are working under stressful conditions in a climate of fear and uncertainty due in part to Brexit — Britain's impending exit from the European Union.\n\nIt's a perfect storm, coupled with alpha males in a risk-taking environment, Kingdon said. When you bring in money, everyone turns a blind eye. Once you've become less effective, you're out.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state hotline for COVID-19 vaccination appointments has been overwhelmed with calls after Alabama announced Friday that the state will begin giving the shots to people 75 years old or older, as well as first responders, later this month. The Alabama Department of Public Health said Saturday that the telephone number received 1.1 million calls in the first day of being open to the public. The Health Department pleaded with people not to call unless they are in the eligible groups. Due to the overwhelming amount of calls, our target population cannot get through to schedule their appointments, the health department wrote in a social media post. The state health department said the free vaccinations can be made by appointment only. Eligible people can call the ADPH toll-free phone number at 1-855-566-5333, from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. seven days a week. Appointments will be made on a first-come, first-serve basis beginning Jan. 18 at locations throughout the state. Health officials urged people to try again later if they get a busy signal because of the massive influx of calls.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Some teachers in the city have asked the school district to delay a return to in-person instruction until they are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. While some educators and school staff are ready to return to classrooms with or without the shot, others said they are being forced to choose between employment or staying safe. State health officials said front-line essential workers likely will not begin receiving vaccines until late February. The Anchorage School District plans to reopen schools Jan. 19 for elementary students in pre-K through second grade and high-needs special education students through the sixth grade. The Anchorage School Board last month directed Superintendent Deena Bishop not to delay reopening plans, which were postponed three times previously during the pandemic. The district has a robust virus mitigation plan and must prioritize its mission to educate children, Bishop said Wednesday. The state's tiered plan for vaccinating essential workers places teachers 50 years and older in tier 2, teachers under 50 with two or more high-risk health conditions in tier 3, and all other educators in tier 4.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A new COVID-19 vaccination site will open Monday at the suburban Phoenix stadium that is home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals as the state with the worst diagnosis rate in the U.S. moves to expand the availability of vaccine doses. The new site at State Farm Stadium in Glendale will be capable of vaccinating thousands of people daily, the state Department of Health Services said Friday. The site will open as Maricopa County, which includes most of metro Phoenix, moves into an expanded eligibility phase that prioritizes people 75 and older as well as groups that include teachers and law enforcement personnel. Arizona remains a national COVID-19 hot spot, with health officials on Sunday reporting more than 11,000 new cases for the third consecutive day plus 105 more deaths. That pushed the state's grim figures to 618,546 cases and 10,141 known deaths since the pandemic began. It passed the 10,000-death milestone Saturday. As of Saturday, Arizona had the second-highest coronavirus case rate and death rate per capita nationally in the past seven days, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers return to the Capitol on Monday for a legislative session overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic that has killed thousands in the state. Arkansas begins its session tied with South Dakota for the second-largest outbreak in a state legislature. The virus has changed the way the Legislature operates, and a fight over Arkansas' response to it is expected. COVID response and recovery are going to bookend the session, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. In between that, lawmakers face a busy agenda. House and Senate leaders have announced steps they'll take during the session aimed at curbing further outbreaks but still allowing the public to participate. The very essence of a session deals with us negotiating face-to-face and public participation, incoming Senate President Jimmy Hickey said. We're still going to have our session; we're just going to move into a fashion that's safe. House Speaker Matthew Shepherd left open the possibility of halting the session if a major outbreak occurs but said there's not a set number of infected lawmakers that would trigger it.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: San Diego County is opening what it calls a vaccination superstation that aims to inject up to 5,000 health care workers daily with a COVID-19 vaccine, officials said Friday. The effort that begins Monday is one of the most ambitious yet in California to accelerate the pace of vaccinations that Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week was not good enough. Only about 1% of the state's 40 million residents have been vaccinated against the coronavirus at a time when a surge of infections has pushed hospitals to the breaking point. The drive-thru superstation, staffed by medical crews from the University of California, San Diego, will operate out of a parking lot near the baseball stadium where the Padres play in downtown San Diego. State health authorities reported a record one-day total of 695 coronavirus deaths Saturday. California's death toll since the start of the pandemic rose to 29,233, according to the state Department of Public Health's website. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are nearly 22,000, and state models project the number could reach 30,000 by Feb. 1. A surge of cases following Halloween and Thanksgiving produced record hospitalizations in California, and now the most seriously ill of those patients are dying in unprecedented numbers.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: As the state moves into its next phase of vaccine distribution, Gov. Jared Polis explained plans for vaccinating adults 70 and up. The goal is to have 70% of Colorado residents ages 70 and older vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of February, Polis said Friday. Across the state, local health officials are feeling frustrated about the lack of clear guidance in the phased distribution and vaccine disparities. They're also fielding complaints and worries from older Colorado residents who are confused and unaware of how to actually get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine, the Colorado Sun reports. Hospitals are contacting all patients in the 70-year-plus age group who are in their systems to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments, Polis said. Those in the correct age group who are interested in getting the vaccine but have not heard from a local hospital can set up an account online. For those who don't have access to a hospital, there will be community centers and health clinics distributing vaccines for interested seniors, Polis said. He also said Colorado is developing weekly partnerships with mobile health clinics to bring vaccines to underserved areas.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The first round of COVID-19 vaccination clinics held at the state's 210 nursing homes was completed Friday – a milestone that comes as skilled nursing facilities continue to battle a second wave of infections. LiveWell, a long-term care facility in Plantsville, was the last facility to hold its first clinic. Connecticut is one of the first states in the country to reach this point. Officials hope to have the second round of vaccinations at all nursing homes completed by the end of January. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said the nursing home vaccinations are especially important now as the state's overall infection rate is spiking. According to data through Jan. 7 from Johns Hopkins University, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 629.9, an increase of 34.9%, over the past two weeks. More than 70% of the state's nursing homes had an outbreak in the past month, said Matt Barrett, president and CEO the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities/Connecticut Center for Assisted Living. He said the cases appear to be leveling off somewhat now.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Public health officials on Friday reported the first COVID-19-related death of a child in the state. Officials said the under the age of 5 from New Castle County had a significant number of underlying health problems. Also Friday, Democratic Gov. John Carney signed a revised emergency order lifting a 10 p.m. curfew on restaurants and bars starting Friday night. Those establishments must still require patrons to wear masks and post signs on each table stating that only people from the same household may share a table. The revised order also allows all sports contests and competitions to resume, with a maximum occupancy of 30%. That includes athletes, coaches, and other employees or staff. Each athlete may be accompanied by one person, who would not be included in the 30% capacity limit, but additional spectators are not permitted. Meanwhile, officials continue to investigate outbreaks among residents and staff at more than two dozen long-term care facilities throughout Delaware. Residents of those facilities account for more than half of reported COVID-19-related fatalities but only about 3% of positive cases and less than 1% of Delaware's population.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center in Leesburg, Virginia, reported a COVID-19 case Sunday, prompting a temporary closure for cleaning, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, WUSA-TV reports. Officials didn't immediately provide any additional details about the person who tested positive for the coronavirus. While the cleaning is taking place, officials said ARTCC controllers would work from an alternate location. Every ATC facility has a backup plan in case it has to close temporarily, FAA officials said. The backup plans have been in place for years and aren't related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency said there are scheduled COVID-19 cleanings for the overnight hours.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Data from the Centers for Disease Control shows Florida has nearly half the known cases in the United States of a mutated and likely more contagious strain of the coronavirus. The development came Friday as the state reported nearly 20,000 more cases in a single day. A CDC map showed Florida had 22 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in Britain. Statistics from the Florida Department of Health showed Friday's total of new coronavirus cases – 19,530 – almost reached the previous day's record of 19,816 new daily cases. Florida's death toll from the virus also keeps climbing, reaching 23,011 deaths Friday. Since the pandemic began in March, about 1.4 million people in Florida have contracted COVID-19. Meanwhile, people 65 and older who are eager for the vaccine have swamped online registration sites in some counties. Florida followed federal recommendations for rolling out the first vaccinations in mid-December to front-line medical workers and the residents and staff of nursing homes. But instead of putting essential workers and people over 75 next in line, as federal recommendations suggested, or fully completing shots for the first group of recipients, Gov. Ron DeSantis moved in late December to open up vaccinations more broadly to those 65 and up.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia ranks last among states for the share of available COVID-19 vaccines that it has administered, but Gov. Brian Kemp said the data is misleading because some hospitals have failed to report all the shots they've given. Still, the Republican governor acknowledged Friday that the state is struggling with the vaccine rollout that has become his primary focus even as Georgia sets daily records for people hospitalized with the respiratory illness. Look, I'm not happy with it, Kemp said of the rollout. I'm pleased with how hard everybody's working, but I'm not happy with where we are; we got to keep moving the needle. We're working on that every single day. Kemp said the state now has the capacity to administer 11,428 doses a day. At that rate, it would take more than 21/ 2 years to vaccinate every Georgia resident. Some of it is due to poor planning and execution of a mass vaccination strategy, if Georgia ever actually had one, wrote Amber Schmidtke, an epidemiologist who reports daily on Georgia's outbreak. Instead, the responsibility for vaccinating a population of 10.6 million people has been pushed down to 18 underfunded public health districts, operating with a skeleton crew.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State House Speaker Scott Saiki plans to introduce legislation to establish statewide COVID-19 travel rules to reduce confusion for residents and tourists. The Democratic speaker said he also likely would introduce legislation to lower the penalty for not wearing a mask in public to a citation or violation, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The violation is now a misdemeanor carrying a possible maximum penalty of $5,000 and a year in jail. The misdemeanor offense is too harsh for the mask mandate, Saiki said. Convert it to something like a ticket or a violation. Saiki said he expects opposition from individual counties on making uniform, statewide travel rules. A bill calling for a uniform travel policy would not allow for the kinds of exemptions that we are currently seeing, such as on Kauai, Saiki said. He is also likely to introduce legislation allowing inbound passengers to take a COVID-19 test at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu if they do not have a negative test before landing. Passengers testing negative would not be subject to quarantine, he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two Democratic state lawmakers filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court against the Legislature and the Republican speaker of the House contending the Statehouse is unsafe for them and others with chronic health conditions because coronavirus precautions are being ignored. Reps. Sue Chew of Boise and Muffy Davis of Ketchum filed the lawsuit asking a judge to order House Speaker Scott Bedke to allow lawmakers to participate remotely and provide other work accommodations. Chew and Davis said Bedke has refused to follow recommendations set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as guidelines from Republican Gov. Brad Little recommending the wearing of masks where social distancing isn't possible. The Legislature is scheduled to convene Monday, drawing 105 lawmakers from across the state. Bedke said he's working with the leadership team from the House Republican Caucus to make a safe and productive environment where lawmakers can wrap up business as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State public health officials on Sunday reported 4,711 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 81 additional deaths. The Department of Public Health reported the state has seen 1,028,750 coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, including 17,574 deaths. Officials say in the prior 24 hours, 77,775 coronavirus tests were conducted in the state. As of late Saturday, 3,527 people infected with the coronavirus were hospitalized, with 740 patients in intensive care units and 391 patients on ventilators.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb will have a low-key start to his second term Monday as the pandemic that has dominated the past year continues looming over the state. The 52-year-old Republican governor, who won a landslide reelection in November, entered office in 2017 with an inaugural ball at a downtown Indianapolis hotel and an inauguration ceremony attended by about 2,000 people at the state fairgrounds coliseum. His oath-taking ceremony Monday will be largely a virtual event in keeping with the COVID-19 precautions that he has urged even as his actions, such as the statewide face mask mandate, have stirred some conservative opposition and will be debated during this year's legislative session. Holcomb maintains Indiana's economy is bouncing back quickly. He said he wants to focus during the coming months on distributing COVID-19 vaccines and helping the state's economy recover further with steps such as boosting rural internet service and grants to help businesses modernize. Democrats have criticized Holcomb for not directing more support toward those struggling with lost income during the pandemic, while backing the protection of businesses from possible COVID-19 lawsuits as a top Republican priority.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Visitors to the Statehouse will not be required to wear masks, and employees will not be required to disclose if they have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to safety protocols released ahead of Monday's start of the 2021 legislative session. House Speaker Pat Grassley and Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, both Republicans, released the guidelines a few days before the Legislature was due to return. Because Republicans hold majorities in the Iowa House and Senate, they are responsible for setting the rules. The guidelines ask anyone who is sick or has a fever or other symptoms to please stay home. They state that anyone in the Capitol building should practice social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet away from others. If an individual is unable to practice social distancing, a face covering is recommended. Masks and face shields will be made available at the Capitol for those who voluntarily want to wear a mask, the guidelines state. Members of the public will be required to have their temperature checked and complete a questionnaire administered by Capitol security officers when they enter the building. Those requirements do not appear to apply to lawmakers.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: State prisons ravaged by COVID-19 are set to be prioritized for vaccinations next – frustrating news for some lawmakers but welcome by inmates' families and activists. The state prison system, housing about 8,600 inmates, has reported 5,320 cases among offenders and another 1,076 among staff. Thirteen inmates and four staff members have died. Gov. Laura Kelly confirmed Thursday that inmates would be vaccinated after health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. She said they were being prioritized based on guidance from doctors and public health experts. The second group also will include people 65 and older and critical workers such as firefighters, law enforcement officers, meatpacking employees, grocery store workers, teachers and child care workers. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Gene Suellentrop, R-Wichita, said if it were early in the game, he'd say, Let's do it, since the state pays for inmates' medical care. But Nadine Johnson, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas, said the vaccines were critical, noting in a statement that the virus's spread in prisons also continues to threaten corrections staff and officers, their families, and communities statewide.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state is dealing with a surge in COVID-19 cases caused at least partly by people getting together during the holidays despite warnings not to do so, officials said Friday. We are now seeing a real and significant increase in cases and positivity rate from people's gatherings over the holidays, Gov. Andy Beshear said during a briefing in which he urged the public to follow health guidelines. Dr. Steven Stack, the state's public health commissioner, said a third virus surge was halted before the holidays, but over Thanksgiving and Christmas, people socialized, and they spread disease in ways that are now resulting in an increase in our positivity rate. New coronavirus cases leaped in Kentucky in the week ending Saturday, rising 43.6% as 26,427 cases were reported. The share of test results that came back positive was 26.4% in the latest week, compared with 18.9% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows. In the latest week, 99,995 tests were administered; a week earlier, that figure was 97,149.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Tulane University has been designated as a COVID-19 vaccine provider. The Louisiana Department of Health announced Friday that it has allowed Tulane to become one of the first universities in the state to administer the vaccine. Under the designation, Tulane will be able to receive doses directly from manufacturers so it can rapidly mobilize staff members to provide the vaccine to those in the university community who are eligible. As the largest private employer in New Orleans, allowing us to participate in the distribution of the vaccine helps to make the entire community safer, Tulane President Michael Fitts said. We are committed to rapidly administering vaccines and will be prepared to support vaccinations for those in the Tulane community and beyond as more become available. Tulane is expected to receive 5,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine early this week, with more to come later this month. The first groups to receive the vaccine will be those working on the front lines of COVID-19 research and community response. Those who are eligible will receive an email to schedule an appointment.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of new COVID-19 infections and deaths soared to new heights during a surge of the coronavirus across the state, officials said Friday. The Maine Center for Disease Control reported 41 deaths and 782 infections, both daily records in the state. The rolling 14-day daily average was 476 infections Friday compared to 187 infections Dec. 1. Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine CDC, predicted the numbers would grow after holiday travel and gatherings at the end of the year. The number of deaths was more than double the previously daily high of 20 set Dec. 1. The state's tally of the number of deaths is subject to a lag in reporting. Meanwhile, new unemployment claims have ticked up. The Maine Department of Labor said there were about 3,900 initial claims for state unemployment insurance during the week that ended Jan. 2. That number was an increase from 2,700 new claims the previous week. The labor department said a total of 4,300 people filed a new claim or reopened an unemployment claims. That was an increase of 1,000 from the previous week.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Worcester County public schools will return to in-person learning Jan.19 for small groups of students. The move comes as the county's coronavirus positivity rate remains well above that of the state. Controversy had stirred about a previous return date. Superintendent Lou Taylor announced the return-to-classrooms date in an online message Friday, saying the school system had lengthy discussions with our local health officials and had their support. Faculty and staff are due to return Monday. The average positivity rate in Worcester County stood at 12.99% as of Friday, while the state rate was 9.16%, according to the county health department's website. Worcester schools reluctantly pushed back the restart of in-person learning after the winter holidays as the county's COVID-19 rate climbed to one of the top in the state. It was 14.83% on Jan. 5. The Worcester County Health Department requested the delay, according to Taylor.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is preparing to launch a pooled testing program in schools that aims to help expand monitoring for COVID-19 and encourage schools to remain open with students attending in person. Pooled testing is designed to test larger batches of people at a lower cost. Under the program outlined by Gov. Charlie Baker at a news conference Friday, teachers, staffers and students would be tested in batches of 10 using swabs in the front part of the nose. Ten swabs at a time would be placed in a single tube and shipped off to a lab for testing. If the tube is tested and comes back negative, all 10 individuals are presumed to be negative for the coronavirus. If the test for a tube comes back positive, the 10 who contributed swabs to the tube are tested individually to determine who is positive and who is negative. A handful of school districts are already using pooled testing, including Salem, Watertown and Medford. The new program will be available to schools next month. Baker said the goal is to make sure that students can remain in their classes rather than relying on remote learning.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday strongly encouraged all K-12 schools to offer in-person instruction by March 1 or earlier if possible, but she stopped short of requiring it, saying face-to-face classes should at least be an option. Many schools, including in large districts such as Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids, have been fully remote amid the coronavirus pandemic. Teachers and child care staff are among residents who will begin being vaccinated starting Monday as the state transitions to the next phase of its vaccine rollout. Vaccines were first offered to health care workers and nursing home residents. The value of in-person learning for our kids is immeasurable, Whitmer said, adding that it is safe if schools require masks and adopt infection-prevention protocols. The Democratic governor last month lifted her administration's temporary ban on in-person learning in high schools as a spike in COVID-19 infections receded. In December, at least 800,000 public school students – 55% – were in districts that planned to offer only virtual instruction amid the surge, according to a study by Michigan State University. About 453,000, or 31%, were in districts with an option of full in-person learning. Others had hybrid or other setups.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Health officials have confirmed five cases of a more contagious variant of the coronavirus in the Twin Cities area. The variant, first detected late last year in the United Kingdom, was identified in specimens from residents in four Minnesota counties. Although officials aren't surprised by the discovery and don't believe it will lead to more serious cases, it raises the potential for the virus to spread even more rapidly. It should be a red alert to localities that this variant is now here, and we have to be even more concerned about its potential to cause more infections and what that will do to our health care system, said Michael Osterholm of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. This will just add to the capacity challenges we've already had. Health officials said they didn't know if any of the five people had been hospitalized. Two of the five people said they had traveled abroad, and one said they hadn't left the country. Officials didn't know the travel histories of the other two people. Minnesota on Saturday reported 2,489 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 43 more deaths from the disease.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that the state's COVID-19 vaccine rollout is not going fast enough, and officials are working behind the scenes to eliminate roadblocks so more people can get inoculated quickly. The Republican governor said the state is planning to double the number of sites where people can be vaccinated in the coming days and double the appointment capacity of those sites, as well as the number of days they are open. If you want a vaccine, you should have quick, simple access, Reeves said. Government logistics should not stand in your way. Mississippi set up 18 drive-thru sites for vaccinations, which opened for health care workers last Monday and individuals 75 and over on Wednesday. About 7,600 coronavirus vaccinations were administered at drive-thru vaccination sites in the state last week, said State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs. However, residents said the process has not been as smooth as they would like. Online appointments were filling up quickly, calls to the hotline to make appointments were backed up, and some said they were not able to make appointments after waiting or had to go to counties far from where they live.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: As coronavirus cases surge, public health officials are thankful that, so far, the flu has remained largely in check. Health leaders worried about a possible twindemic as the severe flu season began in the late fall – something that would leave patients with the flu and COVID-19 competing for ventilators and hospital beds. Missouri's influenza report shows that by Dec. 26, 681 people had tested positive for influenza, the lowest total by that time of year in at least the past six flu seasons, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Typically, case numbers by the end of December have averaged just under 13,000. There has been one confirmed influenza death in the state since October. In comparison, 3,730 people have died from COVID-19 in Missouri since October. I think this year shows that the steps we're taking to drop our COVID numbers are also preventing the flu, said Dr. Hilary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist with the Washington University School of Medicine and BJC HealthCare. She cited measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Legislative leaders are highly recommending but not requiring face coverings for people participating in the Legislature, after Friday's initial meeting of the body's COVID-19 panel. The group met less than 14 hours after committee chair Republican Sen. Jason Ellsworth announced that Republican Rep. David Bedey of Hamilton had tested positive for the coronavirus. Bedey came into contact with someone with the virus prior to Monday's start of the legislative session, Ellsworth said. Bedey, who has been wearing a mask at the Capitol, notified Republican leadership after learning his test results and plans to work remotely while he is quarantined, Ellsworth said. Bedey said he has no symptoms. Despite the positive test, the Republican majority among House and Senate leadership rejected a mask mandate Friday, as Ellsworth noted remote participation in the sessions is allowed. No one, no legislator, no member of the public has to be in this building if they don't want to be and don't choose to be, he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts said Friday that he's reasonably satisfied with the state's distribution of COVID-19 vaccines despite a slowdown last month but urged residents to remain patient and expect some logistical delays. Ricketts said the state had received an additional 40,000 doses in the past couple of days, but it will take a few more days to get them distributed. I think this program is really going along as well as can be expected considering we have not done this kind of mass vaccination in this country ever, Ricketts said a coronavirus news conference. On Thursday, state officials said they were preparing to launch a website that will allow people to register for a vaccination even if they don't immediately qualify. The first eligible people in Nebraska are front-line health care workers and people who live in or work at long-term care facilities. Nebraska also saw a reported surge in deaths Thursday, but a local public health official said Friday that those numbers weren't accurate.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Funeral homes and the county coroner in Las Vegas are preparing for a post-holiday spike in coronavirus deaths by adding storage space – including refrigerated trailers with special shelving – for corpses. Michael Murphy, a consultant serving as interim Clark County coroner, said southern Nevada was fortunate in procuring the portable metal containers early in the pandemic because jurisdictions throughout the country are now competing for ways to store bodies awaiting burial or cremation. If you don't get them for your community, they are going to another community, Murphy said. They're getting hard to come by. Nevada has reported more than 2,500 coronavirus-related deaths in Clark County, where most of the state's population resides. State health officials had reported more deaths last week – 243 as of just Thursday – than any week since March. Murphy said the coroner's office distributed nine storage containers ranging in length from 20 feet to 40 feet funeral homes and had three more on the way. In case of a surge, one container was left in the coroner's office parking lot in mid-December. It's not being used but could add space for up to 60 bodies in addition to the 100 inside the morgue.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Half of the student body at Dartmouth College will be back on campus by Jan. 18, but most undergraduate classes will continue to be taught remotely. In an online community conversation last week, Provost Joseph Helble said confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Grafton County are 10 times higher than they were in October. If the disease begins to accelerate, and we find that we are getting increasing caseloads that reach the point where they are difficult to manage, we are going to have to very carefully assess our plans, Helble said. Given the lengthy rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, Helble said, a return to regular operations is unlikely this spring. In the meantime, college officials are expanding wellness offerings and winter activities, including ice skating rinks on the campus green.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRockaway: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday toured what's being called a vaccine megasite at a former Sears store in Morris County where health officials hope to vaccinate more than 2,000 people per day in coming weeks and months. Several first responders received the vaccine Friday, including Thomas Lyons, an EMT with the Pequannock Township fire and rescue squad. It's been a long 10 months, Lyons said. After months of dealing with sick patients and people who are struggling to breathe, it's a relief to know that I can go forward and do my job safely. It's great that we've gotten to the point where we can vaccinate health care workers and first responders. Now I'm looking forward to getting to the point when my 80-year-old mother can get vaccinated, too. Murphy announced Wednesday that police and firefighters would be eligible for the vaccine. Health care workers and patients in long-term care facilities continue to be given highest priority to get the vaccine. Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the goal is to finish vaccinating health care workers and essential workers – more than 3 million people in all – by May. Ultimately, the state's goal is to vaccinate 70% of the population, or about 4.7 million people, within six months.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state is moving ahead with COVID-19 vaccine distribution, expanding eligibility Friday to people 75 and older as well as residents with underlying medical conditions that place them at greater risk. The expanded list under what is known as Phase 1B of the distribution plan also includes front-line essential workers who can't work remotely and other vulnerable populations such as the homeless and those in correctional facilities or residential treatment centers. Shots also are still being given to health care workers, first responders, and staff and residents at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Health Secretary Dr. Tracie Collins called the vaccination effort critical, saying she was pleased to move to the next stage. State officials said last week that New Mexico is among the leading states when it comes to vaccination rates. They estimated that between 62,000 to 68,500 vaccines had been administered in New Mexico from a supply of more than 106,000 doses. Updated numbers were expected Monday.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Faced with mounting criticism over the slow pace of the coronavirus vaccine rollout, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday that, starting this week, the state will allow a much wider swath of the public to get inoculated, including anyone age 75 or older. The governor warned that the supply of vaccines available to people other than health care workers and nursing home patients would be very limited at first. New York has used roughly half of the 900,000 doses received so far, but Cuomo claimed it hasn't received nearly enough to vaccinate all health care workers. Cuomo said a beefed-up statewide distribution network will include more than 1,000 pharmacies, doctors' networks and county health departments. The 3.2 million New Yorkers newly eligible for the vaccine under the 1B designation include teachers, first responders, firefighters, public transit workers and police. There are 1.4 million people 75 or older who will be eligible. Caution, caution, caution, because the supply is a major problem, Cuomo said. You'll wind up having 3,000 distribution points in a couple of weeks, but none of them will have nearly enough vaccine.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Residents of neighboring states are able to come into North Carolina to get a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the state's Department of Health and Human Services, even though demand has greatly outpaced supply during its sluggish start to administering doses to hospital workers and people 75 years or older. The lack of strict residency requirements makes it possible for somebody from South Carolina or another neighboring state in that profession or age group to get doses that the federal government has allocated for North Carolina residents. A provider cannot refuse to vaccinate someone that presents for vaccination if they fall into the open prioritization phase and do not have a vaccine contradiction, so a resident of another state could be vaccinated here if they fall into the appropriate open prioritization phase, the department said in a statement to the Associated Press. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week ranked North Carolina as the sixth slowest in the country per capita in administering doses it has received from the federal government. The state is still working to vaccinate some hospital workers and started inoculating people 75 and up in several counties last week.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford was in quarantine Friday with his family after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus, and he will not be able to fulfill his role of presiding over the Senate as the 2021 legislative session is getting underway. Sanford's spokesman, Mike Nowatzki, told the Bismarck Tribune that Sanford's wife is asymptomatic and that Sanford was expected to get tested Friday. Republican Sen. Randy Burckhard of Minot temporarily presided over the Senate on Friday, the session's second day. Nowatzki said Sanford was not showing any symptoms of the virus and is expected to return around the end of January. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner of Dickinson said senators haven't been around Sanford or in meetings with him. Sanford attended a joint legislative session Tuesday when Gov. Doug Burgum presented his State of the State address. Nowatzki said Burgum was not a close contact of Sanford, and Sanford wore a mask the whole time and was socially distanced while seated in the chambers. The Legislature adopted a mask mandate last month, requiring everyone in legislative spaces to wear a face mask or shield.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 12.6% as 56,304 cases were reported. Ohio ranked No. 23 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. The share of Ohio test results that came back positive was 19% in the latest week, compared with 18.3% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows. Even so, cases fell in 12 counties, with the best declines in Ashland, Hancock and Butler counties. Across the state, 582 people were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Saturday. In the week before that, 541 people were reported dead. A total of 770,977 people in Ohio have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and 9,599 people have died from the disease, Johns Hopkins University data shows.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge has extended a temporary restraining order allowing bars and restaurants across the state to stay open past an 11 p.m. curfew issued in November by Gov. Kevin Stitt in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. District Judge Susan Stallings heard arguments in the case Friday and extended the Dec. 29 order while she considers ruling in the lawsuit by bar owners who argue the governor doesn't have legal authority to impose the curfew, according to court records. Attorneys for the governor say state law gives Stitt broad and flexible authority needed to combat the spread of the virus. On Saturday, Oklahoma had the sixth-most new cases per capita in the nation with 1,218.16 per 100,000 residents, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The state health department on Saturday reported 324,875 total cases and 2,738 deaths since the pandemic began, increases of 4,289 cases and 35 deaths from Friday. Oklahoma's positivity rate of 26.3% is up from 14.5% on Dec. 25, and the seven-day rolling average of new cases has increased from 2,970.4 per day to 4,235.7, according to the Johns Hopkins data.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Hundreds of people received COVID-19 vaccines Friday at the Oregon State Fairgrounds in a mass vaccination that the doctor in charge called the most meaningful work of my career. This week, the operation will be stepped up with the Oregon National Guard having been called up by Gov. Kate Brown to support the mission in Salem. The goal is to vaccinate 250 people per hour, vaccinating thousands of Oregonians, Brown announced during a Zoom call with reporters. On Friday, Dr. Ralph Yates, chief medical officer for Salem Health Hospital and regional care system, looked with satisfaction as people received their shots at 24 tables set up in the cavernous, cinder-block main fairgrounds building. In terms of mass vaccinations (in Oregon) I think we're it, Yates said. This can be replicated easily. There is space in the building, almost the size of a Costco, to triple the vaccination stations when National Guard medics and other troops arrive as early as Tuesday. Those eligible to receive the vaccination are in the top-priority category set by the Oregon Health Authority, which includes hospitals, health care providers and residents at long-term care facilities; emergency medical service providers; and other first responders.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state on Friday released an updated coronavirus vaccine plan that makes more people eligible for shots in the initial phases of the rollout. Health care workers and nursing home residents remain at the front of the line, followed by people 75 years and older and essential workers such as police officers, grocery store clerks and teachers. With COVID-19 continuing to rage throughout Pennsylvania, health officials cautioned the state is still months away from having enough doses of the two approved vaccines to inoculate the general public. I know it is difficult to ask, but we must have patience, Dr. Rachel Levine, the state health secretary, said Friday. It will take several months before this vaccine is available for everyone. To date, the federal government has allocated to Pennsylvania more than 827,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. More than 235,000 shots have been given, though Levine said the actual number is certain to be higher because reporting by hospitals and pharmacies lags by one to three days.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state's coronavirus response will not be affected by Gov. Gina Raimondo's imminent departure to join President-elect Joe Biden's Cabinet, Lt. Gov. Daniel McKee promised Friday. In his first public statement since Raimondo was named Biden's pick for commerce secretary, McKee said he's committed to retaining many of the top officials and experts Raimondo has tapped to lead the state's pandemic response. He also said he plans to meet with the outgoing governor's team this weekend to start transition planning. The two Democrats have had a strained relationship throughout the pandemic, which has hit the tiny state particularly hard. The 69-year-old former Cumberland mayor would serve the remaining two years of Raimondo's term. He has also said he plans to run for governor outright in 2022. Raimondo, who Biden formally introduced as his latest Cabinet pick Friday, said she expects to continue running the state until she's officially confirmed by the U.S. Senate. McKee stressed that the pandemic response would be his top priority upon taking office.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: As other states trim expenses and borrow money amid the economic fallout prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Henry McMaster is already looking to shore up the state's rainy day fund with $500 million for a future crisis. McMaster released his spending proposals for next year's budget Friday, less than a week before legislators will gather for the 2021 session Tuesday. The governor's so-called skinny budget, at roughly $9 billion, keeps agencies running without any cuts. South Carolina's relative economic stability was a function of careful budgeting, freezing new spending and keeping state businesses open throughout the pandemic, McMaster's office said. The state has also avoided dipping into its reserve fund for any pandemic-related purposes, using federal dollars instead. But the pandemic's effects still whittled down an expected $1.8 billion surplus into the millions. The governor's proposals include $123 million in grants for small businesses hit with revenue losses during the pandemic and $30 billion to expand broadband across across the state, two areas that federal pandemic relief monies have already touched in the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Determined to defy the coronavirus, the Legislature will convene for its 96th session Tuesday, when lawmakers will begin trying to settle a state budget flush with one-time money from federal coronavirus funds, as well as figure what to make of voter-initiated measures to legalize both medical and recreational marijuana. But the biggest challenge for lawmakers may be in carrying out their duties while trying to avoid virus infections. Chamber floors will feature plexiglass dividers; mask-wearing rules and rapid testing for lawmakers with COVID-19 symptoms are in the works; and committee meetings are expected to use remote participation. But all 105 lawmakers, in addition to a cast of staff, lobbyists and visitors, are expected in the Capitol at some point. The Legislature is trying to avoid a virus outbreak that cripples the session. That may be difficult. A handful of infections surfaced among lawmakers after they gathered for Gov. Kristi Noem's budget address last month, and the Statehouse is already notorious for breeding what's known as the Capitol crud, the hacking cough that seems to spread among lawmakers and lobbyists every year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Officials are launching a statewide online scheduling system in the coming days for COVID-19 vaccine appointments. The effort aims to prevent people from having to wait in line for hours, sometimes only to be turned away because there are no doses left, state Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said Friday. That's been an issue in Chattanooga, for instance, where there have been long lines of people waiting in their cars as Hamilton County opened vaccine eligibility for those 75 and older. Some counties already have been using an appointment-based system. Meanwhile, some larger counties are just starting to schedule vaccinations for people 75 and older. On Thursday, Tennessee reported more than 215,400 COVID-19 vaccinations had been administered so far in the state. That's about 3% of the state's population, compared to a 2% national rate reported by federal health officials. More than 4,500 people have received their second doses in Tennessee. The state ranks fourth in the country for new coronavirus cases per capita, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Health officials in Austin and Travis County announced Saturday plans to open space in the Austin Convention Center for COVID-19 patients as hospitalizations in Texas set a record high for the 13th consecutive day. State health officials reported 13,935 patients hospitalized statewide, 14 more than Friday. The Alternate Care Site in Austin was initially established during a summer surge of the coronavirus but has not yet taken patients, according to a statement from the Austin-Travis County Health Authority. Activating the Alternate Care Site means that we believe that it is inevitable that the health care system in Central Texas will exceed capacity and will soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. Jason Pickett, deputy medical director of the health authority. The site is for patients who do not need high-level or intensive care, according to the statement. Patients needing that level of care will remain at hospitals. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Texas has risen from 14,553.7 per day Dec. 25 to 20,396.8, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and the average positivity increased from 14.18% to 20.88%.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: New Gov. Spencer Cox unveiled a plan Friday to ramp up the state's COVID-19 vaccine distribution amid a post-holiday surge in new cases. The Republican governor said he will issue an executive order requiring facilities to allocate their doses the week they are received and have local health departments manage distribution, with an expectation of administering 50,000 doses a week. This virus does not sleep, Cox said at his first COVID-19 media briefing as governor. This virus does not take weekends off. And neither should we. The state's 50,000 teachers and in-person school staff will be eligible to receive the vaccine as of Monday, Cox said. School districts will be expected to prioritize people over 65 or with underlying health conditions. Republican state leaders have been pushing the online-only Salt Lake City school district to return to in-person learning. Following the governor's announcement, Senate President Stuart Adams called on the district to stop making excuses and open in-person learning immediately now that vaccines will be available. Meanwhile, new COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and intensive care beds are nearly full. In the past week, Utah's positivity average has increased from 26.8% to 32.7%, according to state data.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state ranks second in the nation in the pace of receiving and administering COVID-19 vaccines per 100,000 people, Human Services Agency Secretary Mike Smith said Friday. As of Thursday night, 21,000 Vermonters had been vaccinated, he said during the state's biweekly briefing on the coronavirus. However we need to keep accelerating our pace of vaccinations, even as supplies remain uneven and often disappointing, Smith said. The state has now included about 4,500 first responders – such as police and firefighters – among the first group to receive the vaccine, he said. Primarily because we discovered that often these Vermonters are responding to accident scenes and 911 medical calls. They are administering aid or helping to get individuals ready for transport even before EMS arrives. They are directly involved in patient care, he said. The next group to be vaccinated will be Vermonters aged 75 and older, followed by 70 and up and then 65 and older. The three groups make up 125,000 people, and it will likely take until the spring to vaccinate them with the current allocation of doses, Smith said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Some local health departments will begin offering COVID-19 vaccines this week for limited portions of the general public as the state begins to move into its second phase of vaccine distribution. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release Friday that 11 local health districts expect to begin gradually adding vaccination opportunities for people who fall into Phase 1b of the state's distribution plan – a group that includes people over age 75, incarcerated people and certain workers. All of the state is expected to move to Phase 1b before the end of January, the news release said. The 1b category also covers people living in correctional facilities, homeless shelters or migrant labor camps, as well as front-line essential workers. The state defines that group as people in jobs critical to the functioning of society who are at substantially higher risk of exposure to the virus. Included are police, child care workers and teachers, grocery store workers, and mail carriers. Alena Yarmosky, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ralph Northam, said elected officials would also be included in 1b. Elected officials are essential to the functioning of government, and many are required to regularly interact with the public as part of their job, she wrote in an email.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Washington State Department of Health announced Friday that all eight regions in the state's new COVID-19 recovery plan will remain in the first phase until at least Jan. 18. Gov. Jay Inslee announced the regional economic reopening plan Tuesday, focusing efforts on reopening regions rather than individual counties. We know that all people in Washington want to move forward as quickly as possible with respect to COVID-19. However, these metrics show that we are just not ready to do so now, Dr. Umair A. Shah, Washington's secretary of health, said in a news release. We have made progress but need to continue to work together to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 across our state. The new guidelines require regions meet four metrics – tied to regional case rates, hospital admission rates, ICU occupancy rates and test positivity rates – in order to move to the next phase, at which point indoor restaurant dining and fitness centers can open at 25% capacity, sports competitions can resume with limited spectators, and wedding and funeral ceremonies can increase their number of guests.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKeyser: The Mineral County Health Department reported late last week that the number of active coronavirus cases in the county had taken a steep downturn in just 24 hours. On Thursday, the number of positives was reported as 529, but by Friday's posting by the health department, that number had gone down by a whopping 351 to a total of only 178 positives in the county. At the same time, the number of people who had recovered from the virus went from 1,567 on Thursday to 1,929 on Friday, an increase of 362. The number of deaths of county residents due to COVID-19-related illness remained steady at 69. The drop in numbers came as the health department and various other entities have worked to administer the vaccine to health care workers, nursing home residents and employees, and Mineral County School employees who are age 50 and older.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A state committee looking into COVID-19 shots says it might open vaccinations to people 70 and older and limited groups of essential workers once most health care workers and nursing home residents are immunized. Members of a state vaccine committee agreed on slight departures from federal guidelines, which call for moving next to ages 75 and older and more types of essential workers. However, some disagreed on whether to add group home residents and prison and jail inmates, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. A vaccine distribution subcommittee that advises the state Department of Health Services may vote Tuesday on a plan for phase 1b, the next stage of vaccination. The subcommittee discussed broadening the elderly group to 70 and older but limiting essential workers. If just first responders, educators and corrections workers were included, phase 1b would be about 750,000 people. Workers such as those in public transit, grocery stores and agriculture would add 115,000. Group home residents and inmates would add 100,000. As of now, Wisconsin is getting about 70,000 doses of vaccine a week from the federal government.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Health officials have reported that the exterior doors of the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department were vandalized with fake blood, a few days after a protest was held at the state Capitol against public health orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Department Executive Director Kathy Emmons said the fake blood, commonly used on Halloween, was splattered on the front and side doors Thursday, likely around 5:30 a.m., The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Local health and law enforcement officials believe the motivation is tied to opposition to health orders intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. About 250 residents gathered at the Capitol last Monday to protest the orders and burn masks. My assumption is that it's probably in part based on Monday, when people were becoming escalated, Emmons said. I don't know that it was necessarily about us, so much as somebody wanting to act out in a really destructive way. Cheyenne police spokesperson Alex Farkas said the case is under investigation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Tom Nichols\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nDonald Trump is impeached. He has now set two records: He is the first president to be impeached twice, and the first president to shatter the unbroken American history of the peaceful transfer of power. He has shown no remorse for his actions and he should be removed from office, even if it is 10 minutes before noon on Jan. 20, if that is all that is available.\n\nThe president's supporters, however, now plead for understanding and inclusion, for lowering the temperature, for moving on. In speech after speech Wednesday on the floor of the House, the same Republicans who had no objections to the president's incitement to insurrection now have deep concerns about parliamentary process, the rule of law and national unity.\n\nThis is moral charlatanism and I say to hell with it.\n\nIt is almost impossible to comprehend the sheer moral poverty of the people calling now for unity. Elected Republicans now admit they fear for their physical safety from their own constituents, but instead of thunderous defenses of the Constitution, we have soft mewling from people like Sen. Marco Rubio and his Bible-Verse-A-Day tweets, or the head-spinning duplicity of Sen. Lindsey Graham, who within days of saying count me out of any further sedition was jollying it up with the president on Air Force One.\n\nWeapons-grade chutzpah\n\nThe gold medal for hypocrisy should probably go to Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal, who demanded that Biden show some grace, that he call on Democrats to stand down, and that he practice the healing he and Kamala Harris promised during the campaign. Why won't he? Strassel whined.\n\nWhat Trump's defenders lack in honesty, self-awareness or patriotism, they certainly make up for with pure, weapons-grade chutzpah. (I would rather use a word referring to a common substance found on ranches that Ronald Reagan once described as one with deep roots in our rich agricultural and farming tradition, but this is a family newspaper.)\n\nIt would be easier and less stressful simply to forget about Trump's enablers and sycophants in this moment. Perhaps that is the best course of action, to allow the market and public opinion to determine the future of oleaginous courtiers like Strassel and the many others trying to shift the blame and move out of the cloud of Trump's seditious stink.\n\nBut what should we do among ourselves as ordinary citizens? A decent, functioning democracy requires an explicit commitment to constitutional principles. We have had enough violence and rancor among us, and we need no further confrontations in the ranks of the American family. We have a new president coming, and we owe him a chance to govern. (This, by the way, is exactly what I said four years ago when President Trump was elected.)\n\nThis is also, however, a time for moral clarity. The distance Trump created between American citizens cannot be bridged by bad-faith negotiation or indiscriminate forgiveness. There is no space for mutual reconciliation between sedition and loyalty. The people who have supported Trump need to come to terms with what they've done and with what they've allowed to happen — or it will happen again.\n\nRemove Trump now:Trump doesn't deserve post-presidential benefits. Remove him and ensure he won't get them.\n\nMost Trump voters are as appalled as anyone else at the violence at the Capitol, but only 31% of Republicans hold Trump responsible for what happened on Jan. 6. Fortunately, House GOP conference chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming is among them, along with nine other Republicans who voted with the 232-197 House majority to impeach, but she and they are now in the minority of their own party. Republicans might be shocked by what Trump instigated at the Capitol — but they are not so disturbed that they wouldn't vote for him again. Over90% of Trump's voters would put him right back in the Oval Office for four years.\n\nAverage Trump voters do not share the guilt of the rioters. They did not come to Washington, they did not plot against the government, and they did not kill Officer Brian Sicknick. But they were warned, over and over, that Trump hates the Constitution and the restrictions of the rule of law. They were warned, over and over, that Trump would stop at nothing to stay in power. And yet they cheered him on, handing him tens of millions of votes and refusing to hold him accountable for his repeated attacks on the American system of government.\n\nThese voters are not my enemies. But until they can admit that they made a dreadful mistake, until they can admit that but for one man — the one they voted to keep in the White House — none of this would have happened, their calls for unity and understanding mean nothing to me.\n\nUnity begins with repentance\n\nThis is about patriotism, not politics. Trump's partisans do not need to support Joe Biden or his policies. They do not need to start voting for Democrats (although some of them might consider voting against the seditionists from their districts). They don't need to change their minds about taxes or political correctness or foreign policy. They don't need to become more liberal or more multicultural.\n\nBut if they care about unity, then they need to demonstrate to the majority of their fellow citizens that they are able say just a handful of words with true commitment and meaning. As someone who opposed Trump from the moment he announced his candidacy, it would be emotionally gratifying to me to hear Trump's supporters say you were right — as precious few of them have — but those are not the words I have in mind.\n\nBoot Trump:We're not safe while Trump is president. Remove him now to protect us and our future.\n\nRather, unity must begin with a recitation of a far more important acknowledgement:\n\nI solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\n\nTrump's partisans will bristle and say that they always believed in those important words, but I am done exerting the effort to believe them. After Jan. 6, there is no way to utter that oath while continuing to support Donald Trump and the rebellion he encouraged against the government of the United States.\n\nUnity begins with repentance, and Republicans should get started. Supporting Trump's removal from office and instituting his permanent exile from American politics are the necessary first steps.\n\nTom Nichols, a senior adviser to The Lincoln Project and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is the author of Our Own Worst Enemy, coming in August.

Jessica Guynn\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Google says it has appointed former White House economist Caroline Atkinson as its global public policy chief.\n\nThe appointment comes as the world's most powerful Internet company faces escalating regulatory headaches in every public arena from privacy to antitrust, particularly in the European Union.\n\nCaroline's an internationally respected diplomat and adviser, and we're delighted to have such a thoughtful leader heading our global public policy team, Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, said in a statement.\n\nWith the backlash against U.S. tech companies in Europe, BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis applauded the hire of Atkinson, a former International Monetary Fund official who has dual United Kingdom and U.S. nationality.\n\nGovernment regulatory concerns are one of the top risks to Google and if not handled correctly could result in overhead, expense and management distraction, Gillis said. It's hard to do business when you are constantly under a regulator's eye. It's an important role.\n\nAtkinson has been President Obama's representative at the G7 and G20 summits and coordinated U.S. policy on global economics.\n\nShe replaces Rachel Whetstone, who before Google worked as an adviser to U.K. prime minister David Cameron. Whetstone joined Uber as senior vice president of policy and communications last May.
BOSTON — Three top administrators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology knew about donations from Jeffrey Epstein to support an MIT lab as early as 2013, according to a new report, and approved his money even though they were aware of his sex crimes.\n\nA new internal report released Friday by MIT found significant errors in judgment in accepting $850,000 in donations from Epstein from 2002 through 2017. The donations included 10 payments overall and nine after the wealthy financier's 2008 sex crime conviction in Florida.\n\nThe report found most of the post-conviction donations, totaling $525,000, were made to support the work of MIT's embattled Media Lab, led by former director Joi Ito, while $225,000 went to Seth Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering and engineering systems and physics.\n\nMore:MIT Media Lab chief out after 'deeply disturbing' link to Jeffrey Epstein\n\nBut despite accepting Epstein's donations by marking them down as anonymous gifts, the report said the administrators did not violate the law or MIT policy.\n\nSince MIT had no policy or processes for handling controversial donors in place at the time, the decision to accept Epstein's post-conviction donations cannot be judged to be a policy violation, the 61-page report reads. But it is clear that the decision was the result of collective and significant errors in judgment that resulted in serious damage to the MIT community. \n\nThe report, led by the Boston-based law firm Goodwin Procter, concluded that the post-2008 conviction donations to MIT were driven by Ito or Lloyd, not the administration.\n\nLloyd, a tenured professor, was put on paid administrative leave by the university Friday. Ito resigned as head of the lab in September after The New Yorker first reported on the lab donations, prompting MIT to open an investigation into what it called deeply disturbing links between the lab and Epstein.\n\nInvestigators cleared MIT's central administration of wrongdoing and said MIT President Rafael Reif was not aware of Epstein's donations, nor was he aware MIT was accepting donations from a sex offender and accused pedophile.\n\nBut the firm said three administrators — Vice President and General Counsel Gregory Morgan, Vice President for Resource Development Jeffrey Newton, and Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz — knew about the donations in 2013. That year, the investigation found, the three employees created a new framework under which all subsequent Epstein donations to MIT were ultimately approved and accepted.\n\nThe report found these administrators were not seeking personal gain but instead were trying to balance the competing objectives of obtaining funding for Media Lab programs, while denying Epstein any personal benefit from his association with MIT. Morgan and Newton are retired from the university, the New York Times reported, while MIT announced last month that Ruiz would step down for a career outside of academia.\n\nBy insisting that such donations remain anonymous, they also were attempting to protect MIT's reputation, the report says. Regardless of their intent, these administrators were aware of the risk that the donations might become public, but did not adequately consider the potential damage accepting donations from a convicted sex offender could cause to the MIT community.\n\nEpstein died Aug. 10 in a New York federal jail cell in what authorities determined was a suicide. It came as he was facing new federal sex trafficking charges.\n\nMore:Prison 'inadvertently' deleted surveillance video outside cell during Jeffrey Epstein's first suicide attempt, feds say\n\nEpstein visited professors on MIT's campus at least nine times between 2013 and 2017, according to the report, but investigators found no evidence that anyone in MIT's central administration was aware of any of the trips.\n\nThe $850,000 donation figure does not include $60,000 that Epstein gave to Lloyd around 2005 to 2006 that was deposited into the professor's personal bank account, the report says.\n\nThe report claims Lloyd purposefully failed to inform MIT that Epstein was the source behind two separate $50,000 donations made in 2012. It says he later solicited a $125,000 donation from Epstein that was made in 2017.\n\nIto, who also taught at MIT, resigned hours after a September article in The New Yorker detailed how his lab accepted gifts from Epstein despite being listed as disqualified in MIT's official donor database. The article said the lab listed Epstein's contributions as anonymous and avoided disclosing to the school the full extent of his involvement.\n\nIto disclosed that he had received $1.2 million from Epstein for investment funds Ito controlled in addition to the $525,000 lab donation.\n\nThrough his wealth, Epstein developed connections at elite universities, including MIT and Harvard University. He gave nearly $9 million to Harvard over the in donations. After initially saying they had no plans to return the money to Epstein, Harvard in September announced the university is reviewing his donations.\n\nReach Joey Garrison and on Twitter @joeygarrison.
Major League Baseball teams, informed Monday by Commissioner Rob Manfred to prepare for an on-time start of the 2021 season, received health and safety guidelines that stated teams could also permit fans to attend games, perhaps as early as spring training in February.\n\nNo fans attended games last season until the National League Championship Series and World Series at Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas, but memos distributed to teams Monday allow for the possibility that spring-training tickets could be sold in small groups of pods, providing they are seated at least six feet from one another, according to a memo obtained by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nFans still will not be permitted to attend spring-training team workouts away from the ballpark.\n\nRegular-season tickets also are expected to be sold in pods again with seating at least six feet apart, and reduced capacity in suites, just as they did during the NLCS and World Series when about 11,500 fans were permitted into the ballpark.\n\nMLB currently has no plans to mandate the testing of fans for COVID-19, a proof of vaccination or even temperature checks before entering ballparks, permitting clubs to make their own policy. The memo suggests that the benefits of temperature checks for fans may be outweighed by the disadvantages, such as false readings and close contact between the screeners and fans.\n\nHALL OF FAME CASE:Andy Pettitte's candidacy exemplifies the quandary of the modern ballot\n\nPLACE YOUR BETS:Nationals announce plans for sportsbook, wagering inside ballpark\n\nMLB FREE AGENTS:Ranking the 81 best players in the 2020-2021 class\n\nMass testing of this kind is not practical with the existing rapid testing options,'' the memo reads, and testing is of limited ability when done days in advance of an event. Clubs retain discretion in this area and may choose to require fans -- or a subset of fans, such as suite holders -- to test, but barring any major advancement in testing technology, the commissioner's office will not mandate any form of testing for fans.''\n\nYet, all fans aged two or older will be required to wear a mask covering their mouth and nose during games, except when eating or drinking at their seats. MLB is also recommending that only medical bags and diaper bags be permitted into the ballpark.\n\nThere still will be a buffer zone between the field of play and fans, but the 20-foot buffer zone that was implemented in Arlington will be reduced to six feet, except for the dugout and the bullpen. The buffer zone around the dugout must be at least 12 feet, while the bullpen must be at least six feet providing there is at least 13 feet of vertical distance between the bullpen floor and fans.\n\nThe buffer zones will likely eliminate selling tickets in the first three rows of the ballpark unless there is at least a 6 ½-foot plexiglass installed between the fans and the field.\n\nThere will be no restrictions on the closing of stadium roofs, but MLB is encouraging teams with retractable roofs to play with the roof open.\n\nIt's also unlikely that extended dugouts and bullpens will be required this season, but indoor spacing in the clubhouses, as required a year ago, will remain.\n\nCertainly, circumstances can change the policies, but with one month before the start of spring training, there's now a chance that at least a limited number of fans will not only be permitted to attend games during the season, but also spring training.\n\nThe Office of the Commissioner understands the need for clubs to plan for next season,'' the memo reads, but MLB's policies ultimately will depend on the public health situation in the United States, which is difficult to predict this far in advance of the season. In particular, the current uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 vaccine production and distribution rates is preventing our experts from making predictions about the spring and summer with specificity. As such, MLB's guidance on fan attendance may change in the coming weeks as circumstances change, and may also be modified later as the season progresses and conditions improve. ...\n\nChanges in government orders, particularly at the federal level, may necessitate changes to MLB's policies.''\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale
Stephen Legomsky\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOur asylum laws have some gaping holes. These gaps endanger many groups, but none more so than women and girls who are fleeing domestic violence, honor killings, mass rape in wartime, gang rape by criminal gangs, and other gender-related violence. Congress must explicitly recognize gender-based persecution as a potential asylum ground.\n\nAsylum requires a well-founded fear of being persecuted. But not just any persecution will do. The persecution has to occur for one of five specific reasons — your race, your religion, your nationality, your political opinion, or what the law calls your particular social group. Gender is notably missing from this list.\n\nThat omission is not surprising. U.S. asylum laws, like those of most other western countries, track the language of an international refugee convention that was adopted in 1951. Gender-related violence was simply not on the public radar at that time.\n\nBut it is now 2019. The historical excuse will no longer wash. With women's marches, the MeToo movement, the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process and women's stunning midterm electoral successes, gender-related violence is now part of our national consciousness.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nAs a Syrian refugee in US, I watched my country collapse. But there is a path to hope.\n\nRefugees at US-Mexico border are treated like criminals\n\nBring more refugees to America. They'll fill vacant jobs and boost our economy.\n\nWithout specific congressional recognition of gender-based persecution, women and girls fleeing the most horrific violence imaginable have had to argue that they will be persecuted because of their particular social group. Today that is easier said than done. The nation's highest administrative tribunal that decides asylum claims — the Justice Department's Board of Immigration Appeals — has been adding more and more roadblocks to asylum claims that are based on particular social group.\n\nThis was not always the case. In 1985, the board defined particular social group as one in which membership is immutable. Gender, of course, meets that definition.\n\nThe immutability test makes perfect sense. If you will be persecuted only because of an innocuous characteristic that you can easily change, then you don't need asylum. But if that characteristic cannot be changed, you have no other practical way to protect yourself. The immutability test thus allows asylum for those who need it and withholds it from those who don't.\n\nJustice constraints are harmful, irrational\n\nBut the board could not leave well enough alone. Along the way it invented two additional requirements. One is social distinction. If you claim persecution because of your membership in a particular social group, you must now prove that your home society describes that class of individuals as a group. Second, you must now prove what the board calls particularity. By this it means you must prove that your home society can figure out whether hypothetical other individuals are members of the group.\n\nThere are only four problems with those requirements: The board has no convincing legal authority to impose them. No one really understands what they mean. They are nearly impossible to prove. And they make no policy sense: why should the U.S. decision whether to grant asylum to someone depend on whether her home society thinks of the particular class as a group, or on whether the home society can tell which other individuals belong to that group?\n\nLast June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions made this bad situation worse. Overruling board precedent, he announced that, henceforth, anyone fleeing domestic violence (or, for that matter anyone fleeing gang violence) will generally be unable to prove either social distinction or particularity and therefore should be denied asylum. Although a federal court has blocked that decision for now, the Supreme Court will likely determine its ultimate fate.\n\nBut the problems go beyond that specific case. First, the artificial constraints that the board has imposed for all claims based on particular social group are both harmful and irrational. Second, it is only because gender is not on Congress's list of specifically protected grounds that women and girls have had to fit their claims into particular social group in the first place.\n\nWomen would still prove need for asylum\n\nWhat arguments could possibly be made for protecting people from racial or religious persecution but not from gender persecution?\n\nPerhaps the fear is that domestic violence is too endemic, that allowing asylum would open the floodgates. We need not worry, for a woman or girl fleeing domestic violence has multiple legal burdens that minimize the numbers: She must prove that her fear is both genuine and well-founded, that the harm she fears is severe, that her government is unable or unwilling to protect her, that no place anywhere in her country would be safe, and — even if gender is added to the list — that the persecution will be inflicted because of her gender. These are all high bars, and proof requires meticulous, persuasive documentation. Canada has recognized domestic violence asylum claims since the 1990s, and no floodgates have opened.\n\nThe U.S. cannot singlehandedly eradicate all violence against women and girls — even here at home. But we can at least avoid being an accomplice. When women and girls arrive at our shores asking only that they not be beaten, raped or murdered, delivering them to their tormentors is not an option. Congress should restore the original meaning of particular social group, and it should recognize that gender, like race and religion, belongs in the list of specifically protected grounds.\n\nStephen Legomsky is a professor emeritus at the Washington University School of Law, the principal author of Immigration and Refugee Law and Policy, and the former Chief Counsel of US Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama Administration.
David Hammer\n\nWWL-TV, New Orleans\n\nDENHAM SPRINGS, La. — Kemberley Corbitt walks through her gutted home, looks at the 7-foot water line on the only interior wall still standing in the 2,000-square-foot home and tries to fathom what to do with an $87,000 check she finally received from her insurance company, six months after the August flood.\n\nThe settlement is about average for the 30,000-plus claims filed so far in the Great Flood of 2016, which FEMA calls the largest inland flooding disaster in the 50 years that the federal government has been paying private flood insurance claims. More than a dozen people died in the disaster.\n\nMultiple contractors have estimated it will cost about $140,000 to make repairs to Corbitt's house, and that doesn't even count what could be another $110,000 or more to elevate the home to bring it up to local code requirements.\n\nFlood victims voice concerns over Red Cross\n\nMy husband and I worked extremely hard to pay for that almost $3,000-a-year flood insurance while supporting our children, while paying this (mortgage) note, she said. We didn't plan on a flood. But you have insurance because insurance insures that you will be taken care of. That's why you pay for it. And that's not what happened.\n\nAfter paying those large premiums to get more than $200,000 in flood coverage, Corbitt can't understand why she has to fight so hard for an adequate payout. After all, the money isn't coming out of the flood insurers' pockets: The federal government reimburses them for all claims payments and for all their expenses, such as paying adjusters, engineers and lawyers. In addition, the National Flood Insurance Program, run by FEMA, tacks on as much as 30% for profit.\n\nBut Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon says FEMA has become miserly in paying flood claims because the enormous damages caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy left the NFIP fund $25 billion in the red. The program is set to expire this year, and policy analysts expect a major fight in Congress over whether to renew a program that's so far underwater.\n\nThe NFIP hasn't been renewed since 2012, before Hurricane Sandy yielded allegations of systematic underpayments and even fraud.\n\nInvestigations by The New York Times and CBS News' 60 Minutes in the wake of that storm exposed altered engineering reports and other documents that insurance companies were using to deny structural damage or to argue that pre-existing soil conditions or earth movement caused the loss, rather than the floodwaters. That helped lead to federal fraud investigations, the indictment and conviction of an engineering company in New York and the reopening of more than 144,000 closed Sandy flood claims.\n\nIt's a sad state of affairs indeed, from a corrupt industry point-of-view, as well as a politicized government entity, Donelon said.\n\nGeorge Kasimos of Toms River, N.J., the founder of a grassroots group called Stop FEMA Now, saw these problems up close after Sandy. His home flooded and the insurance company and FEMA only offered him $80,000. It took four years, but he finally won a $246,000 final settlement.\n\nThe outspoken Big George kept fighting for other policyholders, too, serving as their representative on a task force formed by U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Robert Menendez and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nAnd Kasimos drove an RV down to Louisiana last month to hold a series of town hall meetings and share painful flood insurance lessons with the latest bewildered victims.\n\nHe was joined by Jeff Coolidge, a former FEMA contractor who said he was ordered to limit payments to a certain level when he served as an adjuster on Sandy claims.\n\nI played a part in it, Coolidge said. For 20 years, you know, I lowballed everybody. That was my job. And I truly apologize for that.\n\nKasimos, a real-estate broker in New Jersey, said Louisiana victims should be getting $150 per square foot for a fully gutted, flooded home. Instead, Corbitt has been offered just $30 per square foot.\n\n'Birthday boy' brings 363 pizzas to La. flood victims\n\nCorbitt carried $197,000 in coverage for the structure and $26,000 more for contents. The local authorities deemed her home 67% ruined by the flood, but the adjuster for Pilot Flood Management said Corbitt only suffered $60,000 in damage to her home, not including contents. She believes the adjuster nickel-and-dimed her on dozens of individual items. Pilot Flood Management did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFrank Weber's 87-year-old mother, Carolyn, is only getting $46 per square foot, or about $54,000 for damage to her structure. Now, both Weber and Corbitt say they're ready for a long fight with FEMA and their insurers, hoping they can learn from Kasimos' experiences.\n\nThe head of the government program is promising better service and quicker payouts than Sandy victims saw.\n\nSandy made it clear that we had lost focus on our customer. And what we have done now is change that, NFIP Director Roy Wright said, pointing to a record $300 million in advance flood insurance payments approved by FEMA in the first 30 days after the Great Flood of 2016.\n\nWright, who took over the NFIP in 2015 after the intense criticism about Sandy, said he agrees with watchdogs like the Government Accountability Office and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman who say FEMA needs to exert more control over the insurance companies that administer the program on the government's behalf.\n\nWright promised tougher oversight and a more hands-on role for FEMA staff in reviewing claims and doing their own inspections of random homes.\n\nI, personally, am assuring that policyholders are going to get every dollar that they're entitled to under their policy, he said.\n\nFollow David Hammer on Twitter: @davidhammerWWL
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump and other lawmakers warned Wednesday that the partial government shutdown could last a long time as a White House meeting ended with little progress on a deal over Trump's proposed border wall.\n\nDemocrats who take control of the House of Representatives when the new Congress is sworn in Thursday said they would continue to push their own plan to reopen parts of the government, even though Trump rejected it because of a lack of wall funding.\n\nWe have given the Republicans a chance to take yes for an answer, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said after the White House hosted a border security meeting in the Situation Room.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who attended the meeting, said Trump asked lawmakers to come back Friday to discuss other ways to end the shutdown.\n\nIt doesn't have to last much longer at all, McCarthy said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., struck a less optimistic note: I don't think any particular progress was made at the White House session.\n\nWe're hopeful that somehow in the coming days and weeks, we'll be able to reach an agreement, McConnell said.\n\nHours before the White House session, Trump said he stands behind his demand for more than $5 billion in wall funding, way more than Democrats are willing to approve.\n\nWalls work, Trump said during a meeting of his Cabinet, adding that the shutdown will last as long as it takes to get sufficient funding for a border barrier.\n\nIt could be a long time, and it could be quickly, he said.\n\nTrump later tweeted that he was ready and willing to work out a deal that includes border security.\n\nTrump also rejected a plan floated by some of his own advisers shortly after the shutdown began, one that would provide some $2.5 billion in border security spending, including wall funding.\n\nAs the partial government shutdown passed its 12th day, congressional officials described the White House meeting as little more than an informational session on border security, the issue at the heart of the budget impasse that created the shutdown.\n\nDemocrats said the wall sends the wrong message for a country that has thrived on immigration. Trump said that if a wall is immoral, someone should do something about the one that surrounds the Vatican.\n\nPelosi said the plan that the Democratic House intends to pass includes elements that congressional Republicans have endorsed.\n\nThe measure includes full-year funding for shuttered departments except for the Department of Homeland Security, which handles immigration and border security. It calls for temporary funding of the DHS through Feb. 8 as Trump and Congress negotiate a long-term plan, though many Democrats oppose any federal funding for the wall.\n\nWe're asking the president to open up government, Pelosi said. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?\n\nTrump argued that walls have historically been the best way to prevent illegal border crossings, telling his Cabinet, The wheel, the wall, some things never get old.\n\nHe accused Democrats of playing politics with an eye toward the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nMore:Donald Trump rejects Democratic funding plan, wishes Happy New Year to 'haters'\n\nMore:Garbage, feces, other bad behavior take toll on national parks during shutdown\n\nMore:Government shutdown hits small businesses, federal workers\n\nPelosi attended the White House briefing with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and other lawmakers, including Republicans McConnell and McCarthy.\n\nThe last time the Democratic leaders were at the White House, Trump argued with them on camera about the wall and said he would be willing to shut down the government over the issue.\n\nCameras were not allowed into Wednesday's meeting, which was more sedate.\n\nAnother Democratic attendee, incoming House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, said most of the conferees believe shutting down government is a stupid public policy.\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday, Trump claimed Mexico is paying for the Wall through a new trade deal, though the agreement has yet to be approved by Congress. Citing his budget demand, Trump said $5.6 billion in wall funding endorsed by the outgoing Republican House is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!\n\nDuring his Cabinet meeting, Trump claimed there are 30 million to 35 million people in the USA illegally. A report from the Pew Research Center put the number of unauthorized immigrants at 10.7 million in 2016.\n\n\n\nTrump discussed – but did not specifically endorse – a proposal in which Democrats would support wall funding in exchange for new legal status for Dreamers, the children of undocumented parents whose fate is uncertain after Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nOn the table in front of the president was an unusual artifact: a poster of him with the phrase Sanctions Are Coming, a play on the tagline of the television program Game of Thrones. The poster is a reference to Trump's decision to end the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\nThe partial shutdown began at midnight Dec. 21 when a government funding plan expired. Trump refused to endorse replacement plans because, in his view, they did not include sufficient funds for the wall and border security. A previous deal included $1.6 billion for border fencing, less than the $5 billion Trump demanded.
Credit: Nectar Sleep Nectar's foam mattress is our top pick for its comfort—which strikes a balance between firm and plush.\n\nBest Overall Nectar Nectar is the best mattress we've tested. It checks a lot of boxes for many shoppers, with its excellent balance of firmness to plushness and its middle-tier price. The first thing our tester noticed upon lugging the box up the two flights of stairs to her apartment was how light it felt compared to other boxed mattresses. At 65 pounds, it's only a few pounds lighter than most, but that can make all the difference for moving and opening a memory foam mattress. Nectar also offers white-glove delivery that starts at $149. Like most foam mattresses, it emits a weird packaged smell at first, despite the site claiming you shouldn't notice any odors, but that dissipated after about 12 hours and was never an issue for our tester, her partner, or their cat. The wine glass test, which evaluates motion transfer, proved to be one of our most important and insightful tests. When our tester's partner thrashed around and kicked his legs on the bed, the wine glass hardly even wobbled, and never came close to tipping over, meaning you aren't likely to get jostled awake if you share this bed with a restless sleeper, or feel bad about getting up to pee at 2 a.m, and then slinking back to bed. Additionally, though our tester tends to sleep hot, she had no issues with the Nectar mattress. After sleeping on the mattress for 30 days, our tester didn't want to give it up and took her time arranging to have it hauled away—and her partner, who formerly swore by the Purple mattress, admitted that this was the most comfortable mattress he's slept on so far. But if you don't get as attached to it as they did, Nectar offers a 365-day trial period, one of the longest windows of all the mattress-in-a-box retailers. Mattress materials: Three layers of foam: From the top, a one-inch fast-recovery gel memory foam, then a three-inch memory foam layer with medical-grade cooling, and beneath, a high-density base foam layer for support. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off, two to three days after placing an order. A queen-size mattress arrives in a box measuring 44 inches by 16 inches by 16 inches and weighing about 65 pounds. Trial period: 365 nights. Return protocol: Nectar helps you coordinate donation or local disposal. Pros Balances firm and plush\n\nLighter weight\n\nLong trial period Cons Produced odor for first 12 hours after opening Buy now at Nectar\n\n$699.00 from Amazon\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar We think everyone will love the Leesa Hybrid, and that it's worth every penny.\n\nBest Upgrade Leesa Hybrid We think it's worth investing as much as is feasible in your budget in your mattress—after all, you spend up to a third of your life on it. The Nectar offers top-notch support at a middle-of-the-road price but, based on our testing, it's hard to beat the Leesa Hybrid, if you can afford to spend the cash. The mattress's top two layers are foam, which provide softness and give, and allow it to contour to the body. As a hybrid, the foam sits atop pocket springs, which are coils that are individually wrapped in quilted fabric, giving the bed a sturdy yet buoyant base. This provides adaptable support for all sleep positions, without leaving a stomach sleeper unsupported or a side sleeper's shoulder or hip aching the next morning. The bed is a crowd-pleaser that's amazing to sleep on in any position. For consumers, the Leesa Hybrid's construction and support aren't visible. What our tester felt was the responsiveness of its inner workings when she plopped down on the mattress. On a superficial level, though, she noticed and appreciated the super-soft and aesthetically pleasing cover (a.k.a., its ticking). The cover doesn't have a huge bearing on functionality, but the devil's in the details, and that's another place where the Leesa Hybrid Mattress shines. The Leesa Hybrid mattress only had a couple of downsides. It retained heat in our lab testing, a consideration for people who sleep hot. That said, our tester considers herself a hot sleeper, yet she didn't find herself switching sides of the bed in hopes of finding a cool spot (like flipping the pillow over to get the cool side). In addition, the Leesa Hybrid had a noticeable odor when it was first opened that lasted several days. The mattress is CertiPUR-certified, so the smell, though annoying, isn't caused by certain harmful flame retardants, and the bed meets indoor air-quality requirements for certain types of pollutants. In addition, moving the mattress once it's expanded is a task due to its heftier-than-most, 115-pound weight. Leesa's 100-night guarantee, along with its responsive customer service, make this mattress a worry-free investment. If you don't vibe with the Leesa as well as our tester did, you may send it back for a full refund—though we doubt you'll want to part with it. Mattress materials: Two layers of foam a top comfort layer designed with holes for breathability, and a regular memory foam layer that provides contouring. The foam layers sit above a pocket-spring base. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off.

It is among the least expensive we've tested but it stands out as a favorite for its ability to provide comfort, without compromising on firmness or feeling too hard. In both our lab-based and at-home tests, we found that the mattress mitigates movement well—even a tossing-and-turning partner didn't rouse our tester. Tuft & Needle's excellent, prompt, friendly customer service is a perk as well. The mattress is encased in a cheap-feeling cover that's designed to be breathable. It bunches up a bit beneath tight-fitting sheets, but not distractingly so—and as it's the best practice to use a mattress protector anyway, we don't see this as a big concern. At this intersection of price and quality, it's hard to find a better pick. Mattress materials: Two layers of foam: on top, a soft three-inch layer infused with cooling gel and graphite, and beneath, a firm seven-inch layer for support. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off. A queen-size arrives in a box measuring 44 inches by 16 inches by 16 inches box and weighing about 72 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights.

I joined the team in 2020, so earlier versions of this guide to mattresses pre-date my time at Reviewed. Several testers helped develop and contributed to this comprehensive list of mattresses, including writer Sara Hendricks and former editors Jessica Teich and Samantha Gordon.\n\nWe all have an extra-special place in our hearts for naps, sleeping in on weekends, and all things sleep-related. To keep up with changing attitudes towards and consumer preferences in mattresses, our testing methods have evolved over time so that we can provide you with the information you need to pick the mattress that's right for your life and sleep style.\n\nThe Tests\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Jessica Teich\n\nWe test mattresses the same way you might: We sleep on them for at least 30 nights to see how they hold up. Unlike you, though, we also subjected some of these mattresses to a series of standardized tests into our state-of-the-art testing labs in Cambridge, Mass. Between the at-home testing and the lab testing, we gather data related the following attributes:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nComfort: Perhaps the most important part of a mattress is the comfort it provides. Of course, comfort is subjective and differs from person to person. Instead of assessing how just one tester felt on the bed, testers considered how supported their body felt throughout the night, and in different sleep positions. Testers were mindful of their own sleep habits, even considering whether or not they found themselves rolling around at night to find a cooler spot on the bed.\n\nMotion transfer and bounciness: We asked our testers to have another person (or sometimes a pet) join them on the mattress to see how noticeable the movement caused by a bedmate might be. If you're a light sleeper, sleeping on a mattress that does nothing to insulate you from a tossing and turning bed partner isn't going to do your sleep quality any favors. For most of the mattresses, we double-checked our assessment of the mattress's motion transfer by placing a water-filled wine glass or a Newton's cradle (that famous desk toy with the ball bearings suspended on strings) on one side of the bed, and asking our testers to climb onto the other side and move around a bit. If their movements were enough to spill water from the wine glass or make the balls in the Newton's cradle clack together, then we could confirm that that mattress would not be a good pick for a light sleeper.\n\nUnsurprisingly, motion transfer is closely related to bounciness. In some cases, we gauged a mattress's bounciness by jumping up and down on the mattress like small children with energy to burn. In the lab, though, the bounciness test is much more sedate. The tester makes a video recording of dropping a bowling ball onto the center of the mattress from about waist height; after checking the video, we determined the bounciness by noting how much air (if any) the bowling ball got on the first bounce.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEdge support: Testers assessed the support provided by the edge of the bed by determining whether the mattress edges sloped beneath their weight while they were lying down along it or sitting down on it. While this may not matter to some sleepers, when a mattress is crowded with a partner or a pet, too-little edge support can mean the difference between staying aloft or falling off the bed. If the mattress edges provide too little support, it could also make it difficult for you to put your shoes on in the morning, or complete any other task that is often done while sitting on the mattress corners or edges.\n\nFor the mattresses that were tested in our labs, we placed a bowling ball on the edges and corners of the mattress. If the bowling ball stays in place and doesn't roll away, then we conclude there's enough support at mattress edges for you to sleep on without having to worry about falling out of bed in the middle of the night.\n\nHeat retention: One of the more recent hot-button issues in mattresses is heat retention. If a mattress cannot vent or disperse the heat you give off quickly enough, you might be in for a warmer sleeping experience than you were expecting. While this is ideal for those of us who sleep cold, people who sleep warm can end up sweating and miserable in the middle of the night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn our earlier tests, we relied on our testers' subjective responses to heat retention. In more recent iterations of our mattress testing, we started measuring it in our labs. First, we place temperature sensors on the mattress, cover the mattress with a heated blanket, and turn it on a high setting for an hour. Then, we turn the heated blanket on and off every fifteen minutes. In order to see if a mattress retains heat, we check the temperature spikes over time. If a mattress vents the heat from the heated blanket efficiently, then the temperature peaks should not rise over time (in fact, with cooling mattresses, those peaks should go down over time). For mattresses that retain heat, though, we'd expect to see those temperature values go up over time. By looking at the temperature, it's easy to see whether a given mattress will keep you (too) warm or leave you cool.\n\nSupport: While you know your body's needs best, we can give you a rough idea of the amount of support a mattress provides, whether we test it in someone's home or in the lab. For at-home testing, our testers lie on their backs on the mattress and check for any gaps between their lower back and the top of the mattress. If the gaps are present, then it is unlikely that the mattress will be able to provide you with adequate back support.\n\nFuture lab tests will confirm the at-home testing by placing weight plates on either end of a barbell, placing the barbell on the mattress, and seeing how much the mattress attempts to fill in the gap between the two weights.\n\nMemory: Some people want the memory-foam experience where their mattress perfectly conforms to the contours of their body. Typically, memory foam retains the imprint of a person's body for a longer period of time than a standard coil-constructed mattress. To verify that a memory foam mattress lives up to its name, we place 150 pounds of weight onto the mattress, leave it overnight, and then remove the weight. If the mattress springs back instantaneously (or didn't seem to change shape at all under the weight), then the mattress has very little memory. However, if we can actually see the mattress returning to its original shape in real time, then the mattress has some degree of memory and shape retention.\n\nMoving and unboxing: Mattresses-in-a-box are a beast to unpack and to move once they're open to their full size. We asked testers to describe how difficult it was to remove the mattress from its packaging, as well as how feasible they thought it would be for someone to move that mattress by themselves once fully expanded.\n\nOdor: Foam mattresses aren't known for smelling like daisies, especially when they first are sprung from their packaging. The packaging and manufacturing processes cause chemicals to become trapped within the mattress; these smelly chemicals are released into the air once the plastic around the mattress is cut open. Testers noted the smell of the mattress when they first opened it, and again 24 hours later (the minimum time it's recommended you let a mattress off-gas before sleeping on it).\n\nCustomer experience: We asked testers to answer questions related to the experience of ordering and receiving the mattress itself. What was the delivery process like? How easy is it to install the mattress? How long are the trial period and the warranty period? How seamless is the return process?\n\nBecause the requirements for a comfortable mattress can vary so much from person to person, some of the aforementioned tests are opportunities to gather data about a mattress, rather than grade it objectively. For example, some people may prefer bouncy mattresses over stiff mattresses, or vice versa. In this case, we don't penalize a mattress for being bouncy (or stiff); we passively collect this data so as to provide you with the information you need to determine whether a specific mattress is right for you.\n\nWhat Should You Know About Mattresses\n\nLet's face it: Mattresses are expensive. And everyone needs a bed, so you don't have many options other than coughing up the cash. What's more, most mattresses last you a decade—and you don't want to be stuck sleeping on a bed you find uncomfortable for 10 years. You want to be sure you're getting your money's worth, and a mattress you'll love for years to come. But where do you even begin?\n\nFirst: You need to do your research. Seeing as you're already here, you're headed in the right direction! But also read expert and buyer reviews—and a lot of them. Given how much time you spend in bed, and the impact that quality sleep has on our waking hours, it's critical you choose what's best for you. A bad night's sleep can be a literal pain in the neck or back that impacts your mood, memory, and productivity the next day (or even for months on end!). As comfort is subjective and personal, we recommend researching multiple products to get a holistic look at your options. Keep your own preferences in mind: For instance, we might not have liked the comparatively large 14.5-inch height of the otherwise comfortable Saatva, but that might be exactly what you're looking for to fit your ultra-low bed frame.\n\nOne of the best parts of the online mattress industry is that most bed-in-a-box companies offer a trial period so that you can literally sleep on it. That said, it's important to take each company's return policy into account. Some companies make it super-easy by retrieving the mattress free of cost, but others require you to coordinate the return, donation, or disposal of the mattress in order to receive a full refund.\n\nWhat To Consider When Buying a Mattress in a Box\n\nCan you try the mattress in a store before you buy? While Purple and Tuft & Needle are online-only retailers, Casper has a handful of brick-and-mortar stores where you can feel the mattresses in person—just like a traditional mattress store. Other companies partner with specific retailers. Leesa, for example, teamed up with West Elm and Pottery Barn, so you can buy the mattress straight from these vendors and visit some of their physical locations to test it out.\n\nWhat level of firmness do you want? Mattresses range from extra firm, almost like sleeping on a carpeted floor (or a slab of rock, depending on your preferences), to soft and squishy, like a cloud (or quicksand). Finding the right firmness for you is essential to getting a good night's rest. If you're not sure what you want, you can always visit a mattress showroom to get a sense of your preferences before buying online.\n\nWhat fabrication are you looking for? Boxed mattresses come in a myriad of materials. You can choose among memory foam, traditional coiled springs, hybrid mattresses (which combine foam and coils), or something off the beaten path, such as Purple's unique polymer. Each type has benefits and drawbacks. Memory foam, for example, contours well to your body under the pressure of your weight, but can feel too enveloping to some people and retain heat. Coils can provide more support, but will also feel bouncier and may transfer more motion, say, from a restless partner.\n\nDo you want more edge support? If you're an active sleeper, or your bed is home to a party of more than one, edge support can help prevent you, a partner, the kids, and even pets from rolling overboard, which can be an issue with some memory foam mattresses. Or if you like to sit on the edge of the bed as you put on shoes or socks, you might not want to feel the mattress sloping down or collapsing underneath you. Coil and some hybrid mattresses have an encasement around the bed to help provide support around the edges.\n\nDoes the mattress require a box spring or a foundation? Many newer mattresses work fine without a box spring (a fabric-covered wood frame that contains springs to increase bed buoyancy and boosts up the mattress for additional height), as long as you have a platform bed or adequate slats to provide support and/or the height you'd like your bed to be. Just be sure to check the mattress specifications before it shows up at your door. If you do need a base, these companies sell them to match their mattresses.\n\nDoes the mattress require special accessories? Some mattresses, such as the extra-thick Saatva, may not work well with standard sheets or bed frames. That might mean you need to replace your favorite sheets with a deep-pocket set or, if your bed frame isn't compatible, new furniture, which can get expensive.\n\nDo you have (or plan to get) an adjustable base? If you have or are hoping to get a motorized adjustable base, you'll want to buy a mattress that is compatible. Some mattresses aren't designed to fold up and using them with a motorized adjustable could damage the mattress and potentially break the base.\n\nOther Mattresses in a Box We Tested\n\nAmerisleep AS3 The key word for this mattress is firm. It has some give without losing all bounciness, but if you're used to a soft, memory foam-type mattress, the Amerisleep may feel a little dense. Our tester tried the Amerisleep right after the super-squishy Allswell, and though she generally prefers firm mattresses, it took a few nights to get used to the Amerisleep's comparable lack of give. In the beginning, there were nights our tester woke up with tension in her lower back, though this didn't happen frequently enough for her to know whether this was due to the mattress itself or poor posture when hunched over her desk during the day. But after this breaking-in (or getting-used-to) period, the mattress felt great. It has a sturdy core and a supple upper layer, so lying on it makes the sleeper feel cradled but not coddled. It retained heat, albeit a minimal amount, in our tester's experience and in our lab testing. Even so, our tester found it comfortable, maybe thanks to the mattress's BioPur foam topper, which has open cells that increase breathability, according to Amerisleep. Our tester thinks this feature likely made it feel comfortable, even when she snuggled up with blankets in a stuffy apartment. Finally, there's at least one thing that any prospective Amerisleep buyers think of as a positive: Because it's so firm, it's really easy to make the bed. Its sturdy edges make it so that bottom sheets snap easily over one side, then slide over to the other with very little tugging—something that isn't quite as vital as sleeping on it every night, but an important consideration if you change your sheets often. Overall, it's a great mattress, especially for those who sleep hot and favor firm beds. Mattress materials: Foam mattress with three layers of foam. Delivery and packaging: Arrives in a box measuring 45 inches by 19 inches 19 inches, with a boxed queen size weighing just under 95 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: If you want to return your Amerisleep mattress, email customer service within 100 days of purchase to set up a return. They will send someone to pick it up and issue a refund once it is received. Pros Sturdy core with a soft upper layer\n\nFirm and supportive\n\nDoesn't sag Cons May be too firm for some sleepers\n\nSlight heat retention Buy now at Amerisleep\n\n$1,044.07 from Amazon\n\n$905.89 from Walmart\n\nThe Chill Mattress from Cocoon by Sealy The all-foam Chill Mattress—a boxed mattress offering from Cocoon by Sealy, an offshoot of the well-known mattress brand—has a medium-firm feel with a tiny bit of bounce. Its three layers of foam, which include a support layer, comfort foam, and memory foam, are topped with a polyester and cotton cover that purports to have cooling properties. Our tester—usually a back or side sleeper—found that the foam's top layer conformed to her body with enough support from the firmer layer below to prevent potential uncomfortable pressure in areas like the hips. Because there's some sinking into the foam, the mattress traps a bit of body heat, but the cooling top layer seemed to offset anything that might cause intense night sweats. Lab tests show it retained minimal, but not zero, heat—but our tester, who tends to sleep hot, thought the mattress felt cozy, not cloying and thinks this isn't a deal-breaker. Our tester found the mattress comfortable and supportive when she slept on her side, but sometimes woke up with some discomfort in her lower back, which indicates it isn't quite as supportive as it could be for that sleeping position. For some reason, she also woke up on her stomach a few times while testing the mattress (even though she almost never sleeps on her stomach), and thought it felt comfortable like this, so it's probably a fine option for stomach sleepers, too. Overall, the Chill Mattress from Cocoon by Sealy should be a great choice for someone who wants a medium-firm mattress with some cooling properties at a reasonable price, starting at $730 for a twin—our tester falls right into that category and was sad to send it back. People who want a very soft or very firm mattress may be disappointed, as might someone who sleeps on their back all the time. But for what it promises to do—stay cool and provide cozy support—the Chill comes through. Mattress materials: Foam mattress with three layers of foam —support layer, comfort foam, and memory foam—and cooling cloth cover. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off, arrives in a cardboard box that weighs about 75 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: Contact Cocoon by Sealy and the company will arrange for the mattress to be picked up and donated to a local agency—no need to box the bed or even break a sweat. Pros Medium-firmness will have broad appeal\n\nConforms to body without overheating Cons Not very supportive of lower back Buy now at Cocoon\n\nPuffy Lux The Puffy Lux is a great mattress, but it isn't for everyone. For better and worse, the Lux's standout attribute is its softness. Our tester, a hybrid side and stomach sleeper, found herself looking forward to sleeping on it each night. The mattress's surface is responsive and has a nice amount of immediate give—it doesn't take time to gradually contour to your form like some foams, which also means you dodge the quicksand effect. The mattress perfectly cradled our tester without making her feel as though she was sinking in too deeply, and she loved that sensation while sleeping and lying on it in every sleep position—back, side, and stomach. The Puffy's cushiony surface that cradles, however, is a double-edged sword. Though our tester loved it, she thinks some will find it too soft. Folks who have larger frames—especially those who prefer catching zzz's prone or supine, both positions that require more support for the back—may find the mattress isn't firm enough to maintain spinal alignment for back or stomach sleeping, which could even lead to back strain. The mattress is made with Puffy's Cooling Cloud foam material, which is a bit of a misnomer, as it's just designed to keep your temperature neutral, not actually cool you. Our tester felt the temperature neutral claim held in her experience sleeping on the bed. The mattress never retained heat, nor did it actively cool in our tester's experience and lab results. The Lux is made with four layers of foam. Despite containing so much foam, the mattress is surprisingly lightweight and our tester had no difficulty maneuvering the unfurled queen size bed through her apartment alone, making it a great option for anyone who relocates frequently. Mattress materials: Four layers of foam—two layers of Puffy's Cloud foam atop a piece of climate-comfort foam, which all sits on a supportive (also foam) base layer. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off. The Puffy comes in a box that measures 44 inches by 16 inches by 16 inches, and weighs 59 pounds. Trial period: 101 nights Return protocol: Mattresses must be purchased directly from Puffy, not a third party retailer, to be eligible for returns. To make a return, just email Puffy and they'll take it from there—pick-up and all.

The gel material results in an undeniably comfortable surface that hugs the body without feeling like quicksand. It also absorbs movement extremely well, as evidenced by our tester's wine-glass test: When her partner rolled and flopped around on his side of the bed, the filled wine glass balanced on her side hardly registered the motion. The extreme squish and stretch of the top polymer layer makes it seem like the mattress wouldn't offer much support, but it's quite the opposite. It cradles the body regardless of preferred sleep position. This was the first mattress our tester tested, and she'd been dealing with the quintessential I'm not 25 anymore and work at a desk all day lower back pain. It wasn't long after she started sleeping on the Purple that her pain diminished, and that's a big reason why she continued using a Purple mattress, buying herself one after the test period. Nonetheless, some may find the mattress is too soft to provide enough support night after night. Purple also has no competition when it comes to delivery. The others, excluding the Saatva, arrive in massive boxes that are awkward and near-impossible to haul around, especially up stairs. Purple's mattresses arrive wrapped in plastic tubing that has cloth straps stitched right in. There's so much less waste, and the included cutting tool slices right through the bag, so there's no struggle to tug a huge foam cylinder out of a big clumsy box. Plus, of all the vendors we tested, Purple is the only one that sells a split king, which works with a two-sided adjustable frame. Mattress materials: Three layers: On top is a two-inch hyper-elastic polymer in a grid design that feels similar to silicone. In the middle is a 3.5-inch layer of mid-density comfort foam, and on the bottom is a four-inch layer of high-density support foam. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off. The queen arrives in a 60-inch long, 16-inch diameter plastic tube with fabric handles and weighs about 110 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: Purple will send you a return label and then a customer service rep will help you through the process.

Our tester felt the mattress stood out temperature wise—it was consistently cool, even on hot summer nights, and she never woke up overbaked. Lab testing confirmed that it's among the coolest mattresses we've tested. It was also just comfortable. It's not the same comfort offered by the Leesa and other top picks, but it gives sleepers a cozy feel that our tester enjoyed. The Avocado Green Mattress is a hybrid, meaning its construction incorporates springs and foam. It has hundreds of coils sandwiched between two layers of latex, which is known for being cooler than memory foam and its springy with a responsive surface, meaning it quickly responds to pressure or weight. Latex doesn't yield the sinking, molding, or cradling sensation you get from memory foam, rather the surface has some plushness, but little give or tendency to compact beneath body weight. Our tester felt the springiness of this mattress might be too much for some, but that it's a great option for people who prefer the feeling of coils, and don't want to completely sacrifice plushness. The mattress didn't beat our top picks because it isn't as versatile in terms of the sleep positions it accommodates. Side and back sleepers will enjoy it, but our tester found that her lumbar spine was unsupported when she slept on her stomach for more than one consecutive night, making the mattress less than ideal for people who prefer stomach sleeping. Our tester also noticed the mattress she received was two inches short of a standard queen in width and length, coming in at 78 inches by 58 inches. For our tester, who is just accompanied by her cat each night, it wasn't a problem. However, anyone who is joined by a partner, kids, or large pets, this might be an issue. When our tester asked customer service about the size discrepancy, the representative said it was something Avocado heard about often, and suggested jumping on the bed to encourage it to expand to its full size, which seemed questionable, at best. Mattress materials: The Avocado Green Mattress is made with two layers of organic latex rubber foam that sandwich pocketed coils, and it's covered in organic fabric. Delivery and packaging: Avocado's delivery takes longer than many mattress-in-a-box companies because the products are handmade. Our tester's mattress took just over three weeks to arrive at her door. Trial period: 365 nights. Return protocol: Avocado requires customers submit photos of the mattress condition. Once it's verified, they coordinate with a local charity to pick up the mattress for donation. Pros Cool\n\nComfortable\n\nEco-conscious Cons Bad for stomach sleepers\n\nMay be too springy for some\n\nHard to move Buy now at Avocado Mattress\n\nDreamCloud Standard The DreamCloud mattress is firm and supportive, and works well for most sleep positions. Our tester, who generally has a strong aversion to back sleeping, often woke up in the morning facing the ceiling, despite falling asleep on her stomach or side. Even then, she never noticed the typical discomfort that she feels when she lies on her back. She found the mattress's firm surface makes it well-suited to stomach sleeping as well. That said, people who prefer a softer surface sensation, and side sleepers with this preference in particular, will likely find a softer bed more comfortable. This mattress also isn't prone to any heat retention—our tester always woke feeling cool and comfortable, and lab tests corroborated her experience. But even so, the mattress has some issues. There's normally a puffing-up process when you free a mattress in a box from its shipping confines. However, with the DreamCloud, the corners lagged behind the middle, puffing up like some peculiarly-shaped baked-good in the oven. What's more, the foot of the bed didn't rise to its full height until about three weeks into our at-home testing, just before it was schlepped back to the lab for additional tests. While the sagging foot wasn't a bother for our 5-foot-9-inch tester—admittedly, she's tall but has also been waking up diagonal as of late—it could leave taller folks' calves and feet unsupported, albeit temporarily. Most mattresses take a few days to fully air out—the DreamCloud, however, was another beast entirely. Our tester didn't realize how much it smelled until it was on her bed frame for the first night of sleeping, after it had already aired out for 24 hours in a decently ventilated room. It reeked. The bed smelled so bad that she couldn't sleep with her head off her pillow. If her nose so much as passed the pillow's perimeter, the mattress's noxious odor would waft up into her face. And it didn't smell for just a couple of days—she noticed the smell every night for over two weeks. Mattress materials: A soft cashmere cover followed by two layers of foam atop a platform of individually wrapped springs, followed by a base layer to support the ones above. Delivery and packaging: The mattress arrives in a box that measures 43 inches by 18.5 inches by 18.5 inches. It weighs 85 pounds, and even comes with a Trial period: 365 nights Return protocol: DreamCloud asks that you donate the mattress to a local charity or organization. Once you've contacted them, they will aid you in finding a recipient, but if you incur a cost moving the mattress, it's on you. Pros Firm and supportive\n\nComfortable for different sleep positions\n\nCool overnight Cons Bad odor for weeks\n\nMay be too firm for some\n\nSlow to take shape after unwrapping Buy now at DreamCloud\n\nHelix Midnight Before ordering a Helix mattress, potential buyers take a brief survey on their website that uses height, weight, usual sleeping position, and preferred mattress firmness to determine their ideal mattress. Our tester sleeps on her side and prefers a medium-to-firm mattress, as such, her results yielded the Helix Midnight, a 12-inch mattress with medium support and a hybrid foam-spring composition. This also happens to be the brand's best-selling mattress. Overall, our tester slept really well on the Helix Midnight. It has a nice medium-firm feel with some give when she lay down on it, but a distinctive sensation of deeper support at its core. The tester has always been a side sleeper, and on her old spring-filled mattress, she would sometimes wake up with a sore, crooked-feeling back and aches in her hips where the springs had dug into them. On the Midnight, however, it felt as though she was aligned sleeping on her side, and when she woke up, the familiar, piercing hip pain her old mattress caused was no more. She also felt comfortable in other positions on the mattress. In addition, our tester tends to sleep hot (and lacks air conditioning), so she was pleased that the mattress didn't retain too much body heat, even when she sweat at night. All in all, it's a great mattress at a decent price, particularly for side sleepers. That said, our tester had some difficulties with its delivery. The box that was dropped off outside her door had no handles, and it was heavy at about 70 pounds, so she had to enlist two of her roommates to help her hoist it up the stairs to her bedroom. There was also a strong chemical smell on the mattress that stuck around after she unwrapped it, but that dissipated a little bit each day and went away fully in about a week. Mattress materials: The Helix Midnight mattress is constructed from memory foam, polyfoam, wrapped coils, and hard foam called Duradense foam at the base. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off. The queen arrived in a rectangular cardboard box measuring 48 inches by 16 inches by 16 inches. It weighs about 70 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: Helix's removal partners come to your house to take away an unwanted mattress to donate or recycle it. Pros Great for side-sleepers\n\nSupportive core helps align back and hips while resting Cons May be too hot for some sleepers\n\nStrong chemical smell after unwrapping $995.00 from Helix\n\nTempur-Pedic Tempur-Cloud The Tempur-Cloud is a fine mattress. Our tester didn't think it was the best mattress or the worst mattress. It was just fine. In keeping with Tempur-Pedic's emblematic foam mattresses formula, this one is entirely foam. The top layer offers little immediate give—unlike plushy foams—instead slowly molding to our tester's body. This makes it comfortable, but also prevents the quicksand effect that plagues some foam mattresses. Our tester didn't have many complaints, but she also didn't have anything to rave about. On the plus side, the Tempur-Cloud had little noticeable mattress odor after opening and didn't require an air-out period like most other mattresses in a box. It was also easier to move, weighing just 60 pounds and coming in a canvas bag that was well-designed with moving in mind. As for sleeping, the Tempur-Cloud is a mixed bag. When our tester laid on her side, she found the firm surface did not irritate common pressure points (on the hips and shoulders). On the negative, when she slept on her stomach (her preferred position for drifting off) she found the Cloud to be uncomfortable, causing strain on her lower back. One of the biggest downsides in our tester's experience was temperature. Tempur-Pedic claims the Tempur-Cloud is covered in a fabric that provides airflow and breathability, but our tester found that it felt as though the mattress sucked in body heat and held onto it. Lab results showed it retained a noticeable amount of heat. Her hot take? Hot sleepers steer clear. Mattress materials: Foam, foam, and more foam. The Tempur-Cloud is composed of a base layer of foam to provide support, topped with two layers of tempur material, which is a unique foam designed and made by Tempur-Pedic. The foam is topped with a fabric cover. Delivery and packaging: Front door drop-off one to two weeks after you place an order. The mattress arrives in a cylindrical canvas bag with fabric handles measuring 43 inches long by 15 inches in diameter. It weighs about 60 pounds. Trial period: 90 nights. Return protocol: Tempur-Pedic will coordinate mattress removal and give you a refund. Pros Little motion transfer\n\nFirmly supportive Cons Not great for hot sleepers\n\nTop foam surface offers little immediate give Buy now at Tempur-Pedic\n\nSaatva When our tester first lay down on the Saatva mattress in Luxury Firm, she thought she'd been transported to a suite at a high-end resort. It didn't hurt that she did nothing more than hold open doors to let the delivery guys in and lead them to her waiting bed frame. She was surprised that it didn't perform better on our tests. The reason? It's inconveniently large and one of the worst mattresses at absorbing movement. The Premier Luxury model we tested measured 14.5 inches thick, nearly double the thickness of most mattresses (it also comes in a more standard Custom Slim 11.5-inch thickness). The added bulk made it nearly impossible for our tester's regular sheets to stay put. The tester is a pretty tall lady at 5-foot-10, but due to the mattress' thickness, she found herself almost hopping into bed every night. The added bed height felt luxurious in that where's my royal stepping stool, you peasant? kind of way, but it may not be ideal for people who are shorter, unless they have a lower mattress frame. The height could also prove challenging for people with chronic pain, injuries, or restricted movement. More annoyingly, the Saatva mattress was terrible at absorbing movement. When we conducted the wine glass test, this was one of the two mattresses that threatened to tip the glass and send the water flying. That said, the thinner, 11.5-inch option (which Saatva claims feels identical) could work for people who sleep alone or so deeply that a partner or pet's midnight fidgets won't stir them. Mattress materials: Recycled steel rod coils, eco-friendly pillow-top foam, natural flame retardant barrier, and organic cotton cover. Delivery and packaging: White-glove delivery service. The mattress is brought inside and placed on the bed frame for you. No heavy-lifting on your part. Trial period: 120 nights. Return protocol: Saatva offers white-glove removal if you are not satisfied with your mattress, but you will be charged $99 for the service. There's no apparent option to handle the donation yourself for a full refund like some other companies offer. Pros Multiple firmness levels to choose from\n\nComfortable Cons May be too hot for some sleepers\n\nPoor movement absorption $1,099.00 from Saatva\n\nAllswell Supreme Setting up the Allswell was pretty simple, as far as boxed mattresses go. Our tester had to drag it up two flights of stairs, which few people would find enjoyable, but it was still possible for one woman to do on her own. Allswell provided clear instructions on how to unbox it that made it easy enough to place on a bed frame. Once the mattress was unpacked, it gave off a pungent odor, but this dissipated after a few days. Sleeping on the Allswell Supreme initially felt like a treat. It has a soft enough upper layer that our tester didn't think an additional mattress pad was necessary (though your mileage may vary based on your own preferences), but the core was sturdy enough that it still felt supportive throughout the night. The mattress has coils at the base that are topped with two layers of memory foam, plus a plush quilted top, which help it absorb movement—if someone is tossing and turning on the other side of the bed, you don't really feel it (unless your blanket gets stolen). Our tester also sleeps hot, and didn't find that the mattress retained too much heat. But the Allswell Supreme has one major issue: Its edge support. Our tester tends to sleep on one side of the bed, and often sits on the same side to put on shoes while getting ready in the morning. After a few months, a faint depression formed on this side that never fully re-plumped up, giving the mattress a slightly lopsided look and feel. This was easy to deal with by rolling over to the other side to sleep—which felt as comfortable as ever—but it was concerning that there was such a visible impact after a relatively short time of use. Mattress materials: Coiled base topped with two layers of foam and a quilted enclosure. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off. The shipping box for a Queen measures 43 inches long by 18.5 inches by 18.5 inches and weighs 96 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: To return a mattress, you initiate a return on Allswell's site and someone from the company will call you within two days to arrange a pickup. You should get a refund in seven to 10 days. Pros Soft top layer\n\nSupportive core\n\nAbsorbs movement well Cons Poor edge support\n\nMattress sags over time Buy now at Allswell\n\n$599.00 from Sam's Club\n\nSimmons Firm Hybrid The Simmons Firm Hybrid is a budget mattress, and it feels like one. It's from a legacy mattress brand and, as a hybrid, it's made of memory foam and coils. It arrives in a cardboard box adorned with cool, funky colors, and it was easy for our tester to move it up two flights of stairs and unbox it. After unwrapping, not only did it have no odor, it didn't seem to need the usual expansion time—if needed, it could be made up and slept on fresh out of the box. Unfortunately, our tester could feel the springs beneath the thin memory foam topping—not so much that it was the dominant sensation of the mattress or prevented sleep, but enough that there was a sense of lumpiness throughout the night. After a few weeks of testing, our tester noticed some strain in her lower back due to the sagginess of its springs. On the plus side, our home test and lab results show it doesn't retain much heat, so it could be a good option for some hot sleepers. Overall, the Simmons Firm Hybrid is a decent buy. If your main concerns are cost and ease of unboxing, or you need a mattress for a short period of time—say, you're living somewhere for a year or less—or you're looking for something for your guest bedroom or kid who's a low-maintenance sleeper, it's worth considering.. But if you're looking for something that's supportive and will last you for a decade, look elsewhere. Mattress materials: Foam, coils, and memory foam. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop off, arrives in a cardboard box that weighs about 66 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: Email help@simmons.com before your 100-night trial is up to start your return process. You must provide proof of purchase and a law tag to receive a refund. Pros Inexpensive\n\nNo odor when unboxed\n\nDoesn't retain too much heat Cons Can feel springs through mattress\n\nNot very supportive Buy now at Simmons\n\nZinus The Zinus Green Tea mattress, which we tested in the 12-inch thickness, is a soft mattress with minimal support but a super-affordable price. It's different from some other mattresses on this list, because it's available on Amazon and, at under $350 for a 12-inch thick Queen-size mattress, it's a lot cheaper than most mattresses out there. It is also widely beloved, with nearly 40,000 reviews and an overall 4.2-star rating. Zinus' mattress foam, called BioFoam, is made with green tea extract, castor seed oil, and charcoal. Zinus says these natural components are used to prevent the typical chemical-y smelling scent of a mattress in a box, but when our tester unboxed it, it had the same pungent smell we've come to expect. (It dissipated in about 24 hours, though.) When our tester laid down on the Zinus, the first thing she noticed could be a plus or a minus, depending on personal preferences: It's extremely soft. The mattress is composed of different kinds of foam, so it molds to pressure and weight, creating what felt to our tester like a divot underneath the body. In some ways, this is good—it has a nesting effect, so it's cozy—but she tends to sleep hot, and found that the Zinus retained body heat more than other mattresses she's tested (namely, the Helix). It also made it difficult to get out of bed in the morning because her 130-pound body had sunk so deep into the mattress. Still, she slept pretty well each night, despite not loving soft mattresses and occasionally feeling more overnight heat than she preferred. And the Zinus has its fans (apart from all those Amazon shoppers), one of whom is another Reviewed staff member: Anna Lane, our parenting editor. She loves Zinus mattresses so much that she has one in every bedroom of her house. I initially bought one for my son because I found that it was the most reasonably priced, not-super-toxic mattress, she says. I didn't have high hopes for comfort because of the price point, but once we tried it out, both my husband and I agreed that it was super-comfortable. Then we bought two more: one for us and one for our daughter. Bottom line: It's not for everyone. But buyers seeking a short queen size that measures 70 inches long, versus the regular 80 (a few people are), who like soft mattresses (some people do), and who prefer to save money (many people do), the Zinus is a solid option. Mattress materials: Foam: Three inches of memory foam, two inches of comfort foam, seven inches of high-density base support foam. Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off. The 12-inch thick queen size arrives in a rectangular cardboard box. It weighs about 60 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: Zinus instructs purchasers to contact customer service for instructions on returning decompressed (i.e., open) mattresses. These may prove a hassle to return if purchased anywhere other than Zinus's site, if Amazon reviewers' experiences are accurate. Pros Affordable\n\nShort queen size available\n\nOdor dissipates quickly after opening Cons Lacks support\n\nDifficult to get up from Buy now at Zinus\n\n$340.74 from Amazon\n\n$435.27 from Walmart\n\nCasper Casper is perhaps the most ubiquitous mattress in a box, but for our tester, its beautiful aesthetic was overshadowed by how unsupportive she found it. The luxe design aims to target zones like the shoulders and hips, and the mattress is encased in a high-quality zippered cover that fits snug around the mattress. However, the mattress feels spongy and that lack of firmness (and therefore, increased resistance) makes it difficult to move around and get in and out of bed. Our tester felt a lot of movement from her partner and pet moving around on the bed, which was confirmed by her wine-glass test. When she balanced a filled wine glass on one side and kicked around on the other, the wine glass nearly toppled over. Worse, the mattress's edges buckled beneath average weight and pressure. Is it a bad mattress? No. Are there better options for the price? Yes. Mattress materials: A 10-inch thick mattress with four layers of foam: a breathable open-cell foam on top, followed by a layer of high-density foam, then a layer of zoned transition foam (meant to support different areas of the body appropriately), and a durable support foam on the bottom. Delivery: Front-door drop-off. The queen-sized Casper box measures 42 inches by 17 inches by 17 inches and weighs about 90 pounds. Trial period: 100 nights. Return protocol: Casper arranges a pickup through a local charity or recycling partner and refunds you in full for any associated costs. Pros Breathable, open-cell top layer Cons May not offer enough support for some people\n\nProne to motion transfer\n\nDifficult to move on and get up from $1,199.00 from Amazon\n\nLayla Layla sets itself apart from the other mattresses we tested with a couple unusual features. Namely, it has two sleep surfaces, depending which side of the mattress is facing up: One that's firm, while the other is soft. It's a cool concept for buyers who aren't sure of their preferences, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. First off, the soft side is so soft that our tester felt she sank in too far. And the 'firm' side really isn't all that firm, considering it's resting on a whole bunch of ultra-soft memory foam. It's more like this mattress has a soft side and a too-soft side. Aside from never quite getting used to how soft the soft side was, our tester didn't experience any ill effects to her sleep. The memory foam on both sides is infused with copper, which claims to help keep you cooler and has antimicrobial properties. But our tester woke up dripping in sweat the first two nights, (though she noted she'd just had oral surgery, which could have influenced her reaction). After that, she seemed to settle in to the mattress and didn't have any further issues with overheating, but she didn't notice feeling cooler than usual, either. Mattress materials: Four layers: A three-inch, copper-infused memory foam (soft side topper), two-inch support foam with air flow, 4.5-inch base support foam, and one-inch copper-infused memory foam (firm side topper). Delivery and packaging: Front-door drop-off. The queen-size Layla box is 45 inches by 19 inches by 19 inches and weighs about 80 pounds. Trial period: 120 nights. Return protocol: Layla offers a few different options, including coordinating pickup by a local charity, and will give you a full refund.

Jillian Bearden and Rachel McKinnon have much in common as cyclists, Olympic hopefuls and transgender women — and much in conflict as opposite poles of an intractable argument over how to balance what's fair with what's right.\n\nBearden agrees with the International Olympic Committee that naturally occurring testosterone gives transgender women an unfair advantage in competition against cisgender women, meaning women who were born female, while McKinnon believes subjecting trans women to testosterone blocking violates their human rights.\n\nBearden sees trans women who compete with unlimited levels of natural testosterone as dopers and cheaters while McKinnon says looking at the issue that way only furthers the oppression of transgender people.\n\nAnd never the twain shall meet.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports spoke with the antagonists, both of whom say they are fighting for fairness. Bearden sees it as fairness for all competitors while McKinnon frames it as fairness for transgender athletes. All of this comes in the wake of updated IOC guidelines in 2015 that require women who transition from men to block certain amounts of natural testosterone.\n\nThe issue is important now because governing bodies such as USA Cycling, USA Track and Field, USA Fencing and US Lacrosse are crafting, or have recently crafted, policies that more or less mirror these IOC guidelines. And it all comes at a time that Ashland Johnson, director of education and research for the Human Rights Campaign, calls the dawn of a trans movement in sports.\n\nThe dispute between Bearden and McKinnon is personal as well as intellectual. They've never competed against one another — Bearden is at the highest pro level — but Bearden says she asked McKinnon to leave her cycling team last spring because of their visceral disagreements. McKinnon then formed her own team and members of each cycling club mostly share the orthodoxies of their respective leaders.\n\nI've proven how powerful testosterone is from when I competed as a male, Bearden says. That doesn't mean specifically that the more testosterone you have the stronger you are, but the hormone provides a certain stamina that continues to charge you. It gives you that edge of pushing power.\n\nMcKinnon says whether other competitors believe transgender women have an unfair advantage is irrelevant because she says there is no way to measure if such advantages even exist.\n\nThis is bigger than sports and it's about human rights, McKinnon says. By catering to cisgender people's views, that furthers transgender people's oppression. When it comes to extending rights to a minority population, why would we ask the majority? I bet a lot of white people were pissed off when we desegregated sports racially and allowed black people. But they had to deal with it.\n\nThe IOC has long struggled with issues of gender. It instituted gender testing decades ago when men, in rare cases, were suspected of competing as women. At first the testing was of the crude, pull-down-your-pants variety. Later that morphed into chromosomal testing with a cheek swab. And in 1999, the IOC ended compulsory gender testing.\n\nBut guidelines adopted in 2004 effectively said trans women had to undergo sex reassignment surgery. New guidelines in 2015 threw out the surgery requirement but said trans women needed to test below a specified level of testosterone for more than one year before they could compete, down from two years.\n\nBearden thinks the new guidelines make sense. McKinnon thinks they are manifestly discriminatory.\n\nAll this comes at a time when President Trump wants to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, a move condemned by generals and many in Congress. The Department of Defense is tasked to develop an implementation plan by March. That will come just weeks after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.\n\nNo transgender athlete has competed publicly in the Olympics, but advocates believe that will change in coming years. Caitlyn Jenner — who won the decathlon gold medal as Bruce Jenner at the 1976 Montreal Summer Games — told USA TODAY Sports last summer that she believes a transgender Olympian will undoubtedly step into the worldwide spotlight by the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games.\n\nBearden and McKinnon plan to try to qualify for those Games. Bearden is a pro-level cyclist and founder of the Trans National Women's Cycling Team; she has a reasonable chance to make the U.S. Olympic cycling team for 2020. McKinnon, an assistant professor of philosophy at the College of Charleston, is a category-1 elite-level road cyclist and founder of Foxy Moxy Racing. She is a less likely Olympic qualifier who hopes to make the Canadian Olympic cycling team for her native country.\n\nTia Thompson hopes to make the U.S. Olympic volleyball team in 2020. She is a transgender woman who waited three years to get approval from USA Volleyball to compete as a woman earlier this year.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign's Johnson, who recently conducted awareness training for U.S. Olympic Committee coaches and administrators, says governing bodies are moving away from old stereotypes and moving toward gender decisions based on science, inclusion and fairness.\n\nThere's the rub: How to reconcile science (blocking testosterone) with human rights (competing as you are).\n\nBearden transitioned in 2015 and she has been a scientific test subject for the IOC by providing before-and-after performance data that she says proves the power of testosterone. She understands that pressing for human rights always sounds like the right thing to do, but she believes in this instance it would actually hinder a transgender sports movement that's only just begun.\n\nTwo years ago, no transgender woman (cyclist) was out (publicly) racing, Bearden says. No one would dare come out of the shadows. Now, because we've laid the appropriate groundwork, we have our foot in the door (with the IOC) to where we can compete as our true selves.\n\nQuite frankly, it makes me feel good racing with 50 other women who know that I've passed a USA Cycling policy because I've submitted my (testosterone) levels. It stops the questioning, the bullying. I can stand on the podium and feel comfortable. Without a policy, for a lot of women who don't know me, they'd be, like, what the (expletive)? And I get that.\n\nUnder IOC and USOC guidelines, Olympic-caliber transgender women are required to keep their testosterone below a certain level — 10 nanomoles per liter — before competing, and must present a doctor's note showing testosterone levels are below that required threshold. Natural testosterone in transgender women is tested with the same methodology as unnatural testosterone created by doping is measured in cisgender men and women.\n\nMcKinnon, who teaches a class on ethics and inclusion at Charleston, cites the Olympic charter in saying that sport is a human right.\n\nWe cannot have a woman legally recognized as a trans woman in society, McKinnon says, and not be recognized that way in sports. … Focusing on performance advantage is largely irrelevant because this is a rights issue. We shouldn't be worried about trans people taking over the Olympics. We should be worried about their fairness and human rights instead.\n\nBearden makes a distinction between discriminatory bathroom bills and what she sees as rule-makers doing their best to promote equality and inclusion.\n\nHaving your rights violated is very different than a sport you sign yourself up for, she says. You have to comply with certain rules. I don't feel that's discriminatory. I don't think (guidelines) infringe on anyone's rights. I feel like (testosterone blocking) is necessary to achieve fairness. There are so many rules in sports, and complying with these rules allows us to ride with cisgender women because it's fairest to them.\n\nBearden lives in Colorado Springs, home of the USOC. She believes compromise can lead to good solutions. McKinnon, originally from Victoria, British Columbia, believes she has an uncompromising call to justice.\n\nBoth women want transgender people to thrive — in athletics and in society — and both have received death threats for their trouble. Last August, when Bearden became the first trans woman to race with a pro peloton in the U.S., the Daily Wire (a self-styled commentary site for conservatives) ran a story under the headline: Man Who Thinks He's a Woman Crushing Women's Cycling.\n\nMcKinnon says testosterone testing is insensitive to transgender athletes who are uncomfortable outing themselves. She points out some athletes are at an in-between place in terms of their gender. Scottie Pendleton, who rides for McKinnon's Foxy Moxy team, identifies as gender nonconforming and goes by the pronouns of they and them.\n\nI race in the men's field, but I identify as more of a woman than a man, Pendleton says. There are a lot of misconceptions out there about gender and it's unknown how diverse the transgender community is. We've culturally defined gender as these two very specific things and that you have to be one or the other. Transgender breaks that barrier.\n\nPendleton says there is limited research to show that natural testosterone can enhance sports performance metrics. It comes down to: What does fairness in sports actually mean? I think any time you exclude anybody because they are different — regardless of how or why they are different — you're discriminating.\n\nJohnson, of the Human Rights Campaign, says: All athletes, regardless of gender, should be subject to the same testing standards, and a policy shouldn't single out a trans competitor. But at the same time, I don't necessarily see (the IOC's guidelines) as an anti-trans policy because there have been unfair advantages linked to testosterone.\n\nChris Mosier became the first transgender man to compete in the Duathlon World Championships in 2016 and is now sponsored by Nike. His success was key in prompting the IOC to come up with its adjusted guidelines two years ago.\n\nI was not perceived to be a threat to anybody, Mosier says. No one expected me to be competitive. But there is an assumption that trans women will dominate in sports.\n\nThe adjusted guidelines said that athletes who transition from female to male, such as Mosier, are eligible to compete without restriction. Those guidelines also said that athletes who transition from male to female can compete with one year of hormone therapy to block testosterone and keep it at the specified threshold.\n\nMcKinnon says the IOC's testosterone cutoff of 10 nanomales per liter is arbitrary and there's no right way to measure it. She says some cisgender women have testosterone levels over the threshold and some cisgender men have levels below it.\n\nSo you can be a really tall cyclist and that's fine? McKinnon says. There are so many natural advantages someone could have physically that there is not a good argument for why singling out testosterone solves the problem.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport is considering a case on the fairness of testosterone levels for intersex athletes — individuals who are female but develop some male characteristics, including high levels of testosterone. In 2014, the court suspended a testosterone rule of the IAAF, world governing body for track and field, citing a lack of scientific evidence about the degree of the advantage that women with high levels of testosterone have over their counterparts with normal levels.\n\nThere were no regulations in place at the 2016 Olympic Rio Games and the same situation will apply to the upcoming 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Winter Games, IOC spokesperson Emmanuelle Moreau told USA TODAY Sports by email. The court case is still ongoing and we have no timeline as to when it will be completed.\n\nAuthor Roger Pielke, in his book The Edge: The War against Cheating and Corruption in the Cutthroat World of Elite Sports Performance, wrote: The role of naturally occurring testosterone in athletic performance is scientifically interesting, but it is inherently no more relevant to athletics policy than any other naturally occurring characteristic of the human athlete, man or woman.\n\nJoanna Harper, chief medical physicist of radiation oncology at Providence Portland (Ore.) Medical Center, has been an adviser to the IOC. She spoke before the Court of Arbitration in the intersex case and later put together a study in the Journal of Sporting Cultures and Identities in which she collected data from herself and seven other transgender runners who had transitioned and undergone hormone therapy. It found all of them were significantly slower in performance as females.\n\nBearden also saw her times and performances decline drastically as a result of her hormone replacement therapy in 2015. A decade's worth of elite-level bike racing as a man faded once she transitioned to female and began the therapy.\n\nPeople toss the word 'fair' around all the time, Harper says. The fact of the matter is every athlete has advantages and disadvantages. But sporting bodies need to craft divisions that are equitable and meaningful. We let left-handed baseball players pitch when they might have some form of an advantage. On the other hand, we do not allow 200-pound boxers to fight 130-pound boxers.\n\nWe allow advantages, but we do not and should not allow overwhelming advantages. There's a way to do that without stepping on anyone's human rights.
The litigious drama between Vince McMahon and ex-XFL commissioner Oliver Luck continued this week as McMahon filed a countersuit to Luck's lawsuit against the entertainment magnate from April.\n\nIn his countersuit, filed Thursday in Connecticut federal court and obtained by USA TODAY Sports on Friday, the wrestling and entertainment magnate claims Luck defied his orders when it came to hiring league personnel and said the former commissioner essentially abandoned his duties when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the league to suspend play in mid-March, five weeks into its first season.\n\nLuck sued McMahon in April for wrongful termination, one week after McMahon fired him with cause. Luck's contract called for a $5 million annual salary and a yearly $2 million bonus through June 30, 2023, and Luck has said he is owed the $23.8 million remainin, on top of other damages and attorney fees.\n\nIn the countersuit, McMahon argues Luck did not heed his direction when it came to the signing of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Callaway by the Tampa Bay Vipers. McMahon said he emphasized to Luck that the XFL player pool must include quality football players with good character.\n\nApparently, Callaway did not meet McMahon's threshold for good character. In November 2019, the ex-Cleveland Browns receiver been suspended 10 games by the NFL for violating the substance-abuse policy. He'd previously been suspended for the 2017 season for facing third-degree felony charges of credit card fraud.\n\nCallaway eventually injured his knee before the season started, resulting in the league paying him worker's compensation and leaving the XFL unable to terminate him without paying the original signing bonus that exceeded $120,000.\n\nLuck knowingly and deliberately deceived me – repeatedly – throughout the Callaway situation, which made me question whether I could continue to trust Luck to be the commissioner and CEO of the XFL, McMahon wrote in the suit, indicating that the WWE CEO had considered moving on from Luck prior to April.\n\nMcMahon's countersuit seeks $572,792.10 from Luck to cover Callaway's contract, the worker's compensation owed to him and Luck's personal compensation from March 14 to April 9.\n\nIt's another lame attempt by Mr. McMahon's attorneys to deflect attention from the fact that Mr. McMahon continues to refuse to pay the $24 million that he owes Oliver Luck, counsel for Luck wrote in an email to The Athletic.\n\nThe countersuit lays out other instances of Luck pursuing players with previous blemishes on their record, naming former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Martavis Bryant (who had been suspended for the 2016 NFL season for also violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy) and a player referred to as Player A, who had been banned from the university where his XFL team was practicing due to a sexual assault charge.\n\nFormer XFL president Jeffrey Pollack and Vipers coach Marc Trestman filed separate declarations confirming McMahon's account of events.\n\nJohnny Manziel was sticking point for McMahon\n\nThe pursuit of former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel also caused a rift between Luck and McMahon. After learning of reports that the XFL would consider signing Manziel, McMahon texted Luck How long R U going to play this game Oliver? U know there is NO CHANCE IN HELL for Manziel to play for us. I will not change my mind. So what's Ur plan??\n\nAdmitting it was a headlines ploy, Luck responded: Vince – we have no intention of signing him, none whatsoever. We're just milking the story to stay in the news. I'm happy to categorically rule him out but both Jeffrey and I think it is worthwhile to milk it until the showcases are finished (July 12). At that point we can say he doesn't fit into our plans.\n\nMcMahon also accused Luck of leaving the league's Connecticut headquarters on March 13 and returning to his home in Indiana. After that date, Luck and McMahon had no direct contact, according to the countersuit, and McMahon claims Luck missed several league operations meetings.\n\nLuck's actions during the crisis caused by the COVID pandemic certainly did not meet my expectations for a Commissioner and chief executive of a sports league charged with devoting substantially all of his business time to the performance of his duties to the XFL at a time of existential threat, McMahon wrote.\n\nLuck, a former NFL quarterback who also was West Virginia's athletic director, is the father of former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck.\n\nThe XFL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April and the league was purchased for $15 million by a group led by Dany Garcia ex-husband Dwayne The Rock Johnson. The league plans to return to play in 2022.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.
WASHINGTON – Senate Democrats are growing impatient for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, as the impasse continues over sending the articles of impeachment from the Democratic House to the Republican-led Senate.\n\nWe're ready, willing and able, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a former state attorney general. I'm ready to go to court and try this case.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has delayed sending the two articles, which accuse Trump of abuse of power and obstruction Congress, until she learns more about how the Senate trial will be conducted.\n\nA big sticking point between the two sides is whether witnesses will be allowed to testify during the Senate trial. Democrats have argued the trial should include witnesses who didn't testify during the House inquiry. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced Tuesday he has the votes to begin the trial without making a decision on witnesses. But McConnell said he won't hold the vote until the Senate receives the articles.\n\nMcConnell said the trial rules would be modeled on those for former President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999. House managers, who serve as prosecutors, and White House lawyers, who serve as defense lawyers, would give opening statements. Then senators would submit questions to each side through Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside. After those steps, senators could vote on witnesses.\n\nMcConnell::GOP will move on without Democrats to set rules for Senate impeachment trial of Trump\n\nPelosi declined to comment Wednesday when reporters asked about sending the articles to the Senate. But she told fellow House Democrats in a letter Tuesday that McConnell should publish the rules the Senate will follow in the trial. She has argued she needs to know the rules in order to decide who and how many managers she should appoint to prosecute the case.\n\nIt is important that he immediately publish this resolution, so that, as I have said before, we can see the arena in which we will be participating, appoint managers and transmit the articles to the Senate, Pelosi said.\n\nBut McConnell said Pelosi is waiting in order to gain an advantage in the trial.\n\nSupposedly the explanation for this shameless game-playing is that Speaker Pelosi wanted leverage – leverage to reach into the Senate and dictate our trial proceedings to us, McConnell said Wednesday. Now I've made clear from the beginning that no such leverage exists. It is nonexistent. And yesterday we made clear it will never exist.\n\nBlumenthal said now that Pelosi knows the plan, she should transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate – even if she doesn't have the text of the rules.\n\nShe knows what the plan is and she will have to make a judgement, Blumenthal said.\n\nBlumenthal:Some GOP 'have very severe misgivings' about McConnell impeachment strategy\n\nHe joined a growing list of Senate Democrats, including Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who have made similar comments that it's time for the Senate to receive the articles.\n\nI think if we're going to do it, we should do it, said Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who added that she didn't understand what could be gained by a delay.\n\nMurphy said the best leverage to gaining witnesses and documents in the trial was a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n\nPelosi's going to make her own decision, but I think that at this point, our best leverage to get witnesses and document production is inside the confines of the trial, Murphy said.\n\nMcConnell's announcement defused demands from Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York that senators should vote before the trial starts on whether to hear testimony from witnesses. One of the potential witnesses, former national security adviser John Bolton, said Monday he would testify if subpoenaed.\n\nThe House accused Trump of abusing the power of his office by asking Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, withholding a White House meeting and $391 million in military aid. The House also accused Trump of obstructing Congress by directing aides and agencies to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony, although some officials did testify. The House approved the two articles of impeachment on Dec. 18.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans have argued he had the authority to set foreign policy and was justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine. Trump has said he expects to be exonerated in the Senate trial.
AP\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The University of Minnesota's athletic director suspended basketball standout Reggie Lynch from team competition on Friday due to an alleged violation of the school's sexual misconduct policy after a second woman accused him of assault.\n\nThe most recent accusation came last fall from a woman who said the Gophers center assaulted her on April 28, 2016, in his dorm room at Roy Wilkins Hall, according to documents from the university's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action office.\n\nIts investigation found Lynch, the 2016-17 Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, should be suspended and banned from campus until Aug. 1, 2020.\n\nHe has appealed the punishment, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. That allows the 23-year-old Lynch to remain enrolled in school and practicing and training with the Gophers until the process is completed.\n\nAthletic Director Mark Coyle defended his decision to allow Lynch to remain a member of the team, which he did not do at the end of the 2016 season for the 10 football players investigated for sexual misconduct by the EOAA. In that case, the football team threatened to boycott the bowl game before backing off. Four of those players were exonerated upon appeal.\n\nPeople should trust the procedures that we have in place, Coyle said Friday at a news conference at Williams Arena. We have procedures that have been reviewed by outside agencies. We have procedures that people have focused on and worked on to a fault. Those procedures include providing due process for everybody involved.\n\nCoyle declined to answer almost every question from reporters about the situation, citing federal and state student privacy laws.\n\nMinneapolis police are not investigating the alleged assault, police spokesman Scott Seroka said.\n\nLynch's attorney, Lee Hutton, didn't respond to a phone and email messages from The Associated Press, and messages left at numbers believed to belong to Lynch's parents also weren't returned.\n\nThis is the second EOAA investigation into allegations of sexual assault by Lynch, who is in his final year of college eligibility. He was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman in a campus apartment building on May 8, 2016, and suspended from the team during that offseason.\n\nAfter the Hennepin County Attorney chose not to charge him and the EOAA investigation cleared him, he was reinstated in time for the 2016-17 season. The EOAA investigation concluded it was more likely than not that Lynch reasonably believed the sex was consensual.\n\nLynch transferred to Minnesota after playing his first two years at Illinois State and sitting out the 2015-2016 season per the NCAA's transfer rule. Lynch, whose uncle, Kevin Lynch, was a star for the Gophers from 1988-91, played at Edina High School in the Twin Cities area.\n\nWe do a lot of background, head coach Richard Pitino said, and we never saw any red flags.\n\nThe Gophers (13-3, 2-1 Big Ten) host Indiana on Saturday. Having lost another key post player, Eric Curry, to a preseason knee injury, they'll have trouble replacing their starting center on the court. He's averaging 10 points, eight rebounds and four blocks per game. The 6-foot-10 Lynch set the single-season record at Minnesota in 2016-17 with 114 blocks.\n\nPitino has had plenty of off-the-court trouble to deal with involving his program over five years with the Gophers. Three players, including current starting guards Nate Mason and Dupree McBrayer, were suspended late in the 2015-16 season for their involvement in a sex video posted briefly on the social media accounts of another player, Kevin Dorsey. Mason and McBrayer were reinstated in the offseason, and Dorsey transferred.\n\nI believe in what we're doing on and off the court, Pitino said. We do our very best to educate.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college basketball coverage: http://www.collegebasketball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25
Associated Press\n\nFor most NFL teams, the process of figuring out how to get better starts this week.\n\nAnd every club — even the one that winds up winning the Super Bowl next month — will try to make upgrades during the offseason via free agency, the draft or trades.\n\nTeams are self-evaluating right now, said Ted Sundquist, the former general manager of the Denver Broncos, letting the owner know, 'This is where we think we're at. This is the direction that we're going to go. This is where we think we need to improve in order to get to the playoffs next year.' You have a firm understanding, having come out of Week 17, where your holes are.\n\nSome teams need more help than others, of course. And some moves will work out better than others.\n\nSometimes, the chips just fall the way they do, Sundquist said, and your plan just gets blown up.\n\nWhat's known is that there will be change.\n\nWhen you finish the season in the National Football League, you're probably dreaming if you think you're going to have the same exact roster back as you had a year ago, Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. We're going to have a draft with new players. We're going to have free agents. We're going to lose some of our free agents.\n\nReporters from The Associated Press who cover the NFL look at what each team's most pressing needs are:\n\n___\n\nNFC EAST:\n\nCOWBOYS : DE, CB — Suspensions and injuries cast doubt over whether Randy Gregory and DeMarcus Lawrence are long-term answers as pass rushers. CBs Morris Claiborne and Brandon Carr might not be back, so Dallas could revisit 2012, when it signed Carr in free agency and moved up in the draft to take Claiborne.\n\nGIANTS : OL, QB — The running game has been bad for years and the offensive line could use plenty of help, especially at tackle. Eli Manning just turned 36, so it's time to find a real QB of the future.\n\nREDSKINS : DL, LB — Didn't do much last offseason to upgrade their defensive line, which needs a run-stopper or two; only eight teams allowed more rushing yards. A starting linebacker, plus depth there, is also a must.\n\nEAGLES : WR, CB — A topflight wideout, particularly a deep threat, is the most pressing need, because Philadelphia only had one with 500 yards receiving. A starting cornerback is another priority.\n\n___\n\nNFC SOUTH:\n\nFALCONS : DT — Atlanta's biggest remaining hole is the interior defensive line, where Jonathan Babineaux is 35.\n\nBUCCANEERS : RB, WR — Running back became a priority when Doug Martin was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Also needed: a receiver to take attention off Mike Evans.\n\nSAINTS : DE, CB, LB — Need another edge rusher to make teams pay for using multiple blockers on DE Cameron Jordan. New Orleans struggled with CB depth, while an upgrade over journeyman MLB Craig Robertson would help a struggling defense, too.\n\nPANTHERS : WR, OL — Cam Newton's numbers went from MVP-worthy to mediocre and part of the problem was a lack of help. Carolina had just one receiver among the top 50 in catches. Offensive tackle is an area of need, with Michael Oher's uncertain future and Mike Remmers' inconsistent play.\n\n___\n\nNFC NORTH:\n\nPACKERS : CB, OLB, RB — After a series of injuries at cornerback, stunting the development of Damarious Randall and Quinten Rollins, Green Bay needs someone at that position, along with help for the pass rush. Also must figure out a plan at running back.\n\nLIONS : OL, LB — Detroit must do a better job of protecting QB Matthew Stafford and improving the running game, so a veteran to join an offensive line that started two rookies in 2016 would be a good start. Could replace oft-injured LB DeAndre Levy.\n\nVIKINGS : OL — The line failed to protect QB Sam Bradford at times and largely was responsible for the league's worst rushing offense (75.3 yards per game, 3.2 per carry). Left guard Alex Boone and center Joe Berger are probably the only keepers.\n\nBEARS : QB — Whether or not Jay Cutler stays, Chicago clearly needs its quarterback of the future.\n\n___\n\nNFC WEST:\n\nSEAHAWKS : OL, RB — Despite an overhaul last offseason, offensive line is still an issue. Wouldn't hurt to add a running back to ease Thomas Rawls' load.\n\nCARDINALS : CB, OL — The most glaring need is a DB to play opposite Patrick Peterson. Arizona needs help along the interior and depth for its offensive line.\n\nRAMS : OL, WR — To help Jared Goff and Todd Gurley, improvement is needed along the mediocre line and throughout an unimpressive receiving corps.\n\n49ERS : QB — San Francisco has plenty of needs, but none more important than quarterback after neither Blaine Gabbert nor Colin Kaepernick impressed this season. The only other QB on the roster is journeyman Christian Ponder, so the Niners might add a couple.\n\n___\n\nAFC EAST:\n\nPATRIOTS : DE — After trading Chandler Jones in the offseason, then Jamie Collins in October, and with Chris Long a free agent, New England likely will want young talent to replenish the front seven.\n\nDOLPHINS : LB — Kiko Alonso was solid when healthy, but Miami could use at least two linebackers after having trouble stopping the run and defending short passes over the middle. Plus, injuries exposed a lack of depth.\n\nBILLS : WR, S, QB — Big holes at receiver, where Buffalo needs someone opposite Sammy Watkins, and safety, where Aaron Williams' neck injury created problems. QB has been unsettled since Jim Kelly retired two decades ago.\n\nJETS : QB, CB, S — A roster overhaul starts at quarterback, where Ryan Fitzpatrick was a bust, Geno Smith got hurt, Bryce Petty was uninspiring before getting hurt, and Christian Hackenberg is a real project. With Darrelle Revis a shell of his shutdown self, New York's secondary could end up with four new starters.\n\n___\n\nAFC SOUTH:\n\nTEXANS : OT, QB — LT Derek Newton tore both patellar tendons on one play in October and it's unlikely he'll be ready for the start of next season, while Duane Brown is an unrestricted free agent after next season. Houston could draft a QB after Brock Osweiler's poor season.\n\nTITANS : CB, WR — Cornerback is a glaring need, with Jason McCourty finishing up his eighth season and Perrish Cox gone. Tennessee could use a speedy wide receiver to stretch the field.\n\nCOLTS : Pass rusher, CB — Indianapolis needs someone to chase down QBs, thanks to Robert Mathis' retirement and Trent Cole's contract expiring. Adding a cornerback to start opposite Vontae Davis also would help.\n\nJAGUARS : OL — Made strides along their offensive line, going from allowing 71 sacks in 2014, to 51 in 2015, to 34 this season. But if QB Blake Bortles is going to develop further, he needs more protection, so Jacksonville should add at least one tackle and maybe two interior linemen.\n\n___\n\nAFC NORTH:\n\nSTEELERS : LB — James Harrison is 38 and isn't going to play forever. Pittsburgh needs to develop a consistent pass rusher opposite Bud Dupree. Lawrence Timmons is set to become a free agent and former first-round pick Jarvis Jones not in the team's 2017 plans.\n\nRAVENS : CB — A season-ending injury to Jimmy Smith left the Ravens with journeyman Shareece Wright and rookie Tavon Young at the corners for the final three weeks.\n\nBENGALS : OL, DE — Only six teams allowed more sacks. Cincinnati expected first-round pick Cedric Ogbuehi to move into the right tackle spot, but he struggled, had his role reduced, and was benched. The defense is old, and the line struggled to generate pressure at times.\n\nBROWNS : QB — Robert Griffin III got hurt in the opener, missed 11 games, returned, showed rust, then got hurt again. After skipping the chance to draft a top college quarterback last year, Cleveland must get it right with one of its two top-10 picks.\n\n___\n\nAFC WEST:\n\nCHIEFS : LB, WR — Derrick Johnson ruptured his Achilles tendon; he already was in the twilight of his career. So finding a middle linebacker is crucial. And Kansas City's seemingly endless search for offensive help means it'll eye a wideout to support Jeremy Maclin and Tyreek Hill.\n\nRAIDERS : LB — Oakland could use a more dominant inside linebacker than Perry Riley Jr. or Malcolm Smith to complement edge rushers Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin.\n\nBRONCOS : OL — Denver must refurbish its line for the second consecutive offseason. Two free agents, Russell Okung and Donald Stephenson, didn't fare well. Guards Max Garcia and Ty Sambrailo regressed. Center Matt Paradis was bothered all season by bad hips.\n\nCHARGERS : Owner — It won't happen, but fans have been clamoring for it as Dean Spanos appears to be leaning toward moving the team to Los Angeles. The Chargers missed the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons — and were the only team to lose to the 1-15 Browns.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Genaro Armas, Bob Baum, Greg Beacham, Tim Booth, Dave Campbell, Tom Canavan, Schuyler Dixon, Josh Dubow, David Ginsburg, Fred Goodall, Will Graves, Kyle Hightower, Joe Kay, Larry Lage, Mark Long, Rob Maaddi, Michael Marot, Brett Martel, Charles Odum, Steve Reed, Kristie Rieken, Andrew Seligman, David Skretta, Arnie Stapleton, Teresa M.

Shefali Luthra\n\nThe 19th\n\nThis story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\n\nCarly Evans never missed her weekly appointment with her therapist. She called it her maintenance – it kept everything in her life running smoothly.\n\nThat changed in September, when Evans, a high school English and drama teacher and mother of three, found herself juggling an impossible burden: educating students in a pandemic while stewarding her own family through the crisis.\n\nI wish I could say 'I'm handling it so well and am on it every day,' she said. I'm not.\n\nEvans' district in Sudbury, Massachusetts, has been operating since September on a hybrid model of teaching, so she splits her time between working on campus and remotely from home. Her two youngest children, who are in second and third grade, need adult supervision with their own online schooling, a responsibility she splits with her mother, who lives with the family. (Evans' husband, also a teacher, has to show up in-person for his job at a private school.)\n\nEvans, 42, keeps a color-coded daily schedule to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. But, of course, things do. And top of the list? Taking care of herself.\n\nSince September, Evans said, she has canceled more therapist appointments than she has kept. With everything going on, she said, it's that much harder to justify giving myself that hour every week.\n\nShe isn't sleeping. Before the pandemic, she suffered migraines every few months and called in sick on those days. Now, she has one a week, an increase she attributes to stress. She makes herself work through the pain – there aren't enough substitute teachers to go around, and already, she said, I have so little time with her students. She's exhausted, she said, but she has to keep going.\n\nYou power through and do what you've got to do, she said. I keep telling my own children this is temporary. It doesn't feel like it, but it is.\n\nSince summer, experts have warned that the mental health of the nation's teachers – a category dominated 3-1 by women – could suffer when school resumed. That prediction appears to be bearing out. Many say their psychological well-being is suffering in ways they've hardly ever experienced.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, about three-fourths of the 100 largest school districts opted for complete remote learning, an October study found, and a little over a quarter of all districts began the year with a hybrid approach. But as COVID-19 case counts climb, districts across the country have ricocheted from remote to in-person to hybrid models, and many that started with even a semblance of in-person learning have fallen back to remote education.\n\nBetween the unpredictability, the isolation and the newfound challenges in reaching their students – who mental health experts worry are also struggling – what little mental health support is extended to teachers feels like nowhere near enough.\n\nI spend all day staring at a screen and kind of generating enthusiasm into the void that Zoom is, and I end the day so tired, and so done, and so frustrated, said Emma Wohl, a middle school teacher in Washington state whose district has been fully remote this year. The moments of joy I used to have are so much more rare.\n\nLast August, the National Education Association, a major teachers union, found that 28% of educators said the pandemic made them more likely to leave teaching. A study from Louisiana tracked early childhood educators' mental health last spring, finding that rates of depression almost doubled, with more than a third of those educators indicating depressive symptoms. In a survey from August to September by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the vast majority of teachers reported working longer hours, and only a quarter said their school offered adequate support for mental health.\n\nStill, there is little data tracking depression or anxiety among teachers, especially over the past few months, meaning there's no clear picture of just how educators are faring. Experts say all signs point to a crisis on par with the kind of trauma experienced after national disasters.\n\nI saw that kind of level of strain and stress because of natural disasters creating havoc. I saw it after 9/11 in New York City. You see it after crises, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, describing what she has heard from members of her union. The only time we've seen it on a sustained level like this is obviously when you had a war.\n\nResearch shows that high stress can trigger symptoms of anxiety and depression. Already, women were at greater risk for both conditions. As of the end of November, about 48% of all women exhibited symptoms of one such condition, an increase of 8 percentage points from this April and above what is normally seen, according to data collected by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 37% of men reported the same.\n\nTeachers have reached out to me and said, 'For the first time in my life I have to see a therapist,' said Amy Bintliff, an assistant teaching professor at UCLA, who has been trying to track teacher mental health since the pandemic began.\n\nBut therapists covered by teachers' insurance plans may not have evening hours, and they don't necessarily have the time – or spare money – for weekly appointments.\n\nThere are access issues to mental health services, Bintliff said.\n\nIt's a theme that has emerged repeatedly since March, said Laura Wangsness Willemsen and Elisheva Cohen, two researchers who have been tracking teachers since the coronavirus pandemic began, focusing on a cohort of elementary school teachers in Minnesota. Their research didn't initially focus on mental health, they said, until teachers kept bringing up the topic on their own.\n\nThe level of stress isn't sustainable, they said. Teachers have been operating in crisis mode since spring. By now, any surge of energy that fueled them through the pandemic's initial months has been depleted.\n\nWe see a deeper exhaustion going into the school year, and that hasn't resolved, Wangsness Willemsen said.\n\nThe sources of stress and fatigue are complex. Many teachers have had to switch back and forth between in-person and online learning, often with only a few days' notice.\n\nEvans said she has heard as late as Saturday that a recent student exposure to COVID-19 means her Monday lesson is switching from in-person to virtual. She used to plan her lessons out a month in advance but now gives herself only a week at a time. It's simply not worth the chance that she may have to change things at the last minute.\n\nTeaching from home is also a fundamentally different exercise, one that is simultaneously more invasive but also lonelier. Students on Zoom lessons often have their cameras off and microphones muted, making it harder to engage or connect with them. Normally, teachers can rely on their colleagues for consistent emotional support in quick lunch room chats. That sort of spontaneous support isn't an option right now.\n\nThe challenges are greater for mothers. Research has shown that in many families, moms are more often the ones supervising a child's virtual education. Teachers experience that dynamic two times over – instructing their students virtually while also working as the primary parent to ensure that their own children don't fall behind in their own distance learning.\n\nEvery mom I know is holding all of the weight, said Erin Herda, a middle school ethnic studies teacher and mother of two in Washington state. I'm still the one monitoring all (my daughter's) online dance classes and then having to throw tantrums to get other people to do chores. That definitely impacts my mental health, and my children's, when I have to throw tantrums.\n\nHerda's younger daughter, who is 8, frequently comes to her for help with assignments – often while Herda is in the middle of a Zoom session with her own students. We've had to learn how to work with accepting those moments, and just say this is what it means to be working from home, she said.\n\nAnd all the while, many teachers carry the knowledge that their students – who often rely on in-person school for meals or for social support – are struggling, too. Research has shown that teachers' mental health declines when their students are doing poorly.\n\nDistricts and teachers unions have put forth benefits and programs meant to help support teachers' psychological well-being. American Federation of Teachers launched a trauma benefit this year, which includes counseling for teachers who have experienced events including infection by contagious disease or major disaster. There are mental health webinars, wellness town halls and even online yoga.\n\nIn practice, though, it's all scratching at the surface. The trauma benefit has been used by some teachers, Weingarten said, but not as much as she had hoped, which she attributes to stigma against recognizing mental health problems and a lack of awareness that the resource exists.\n\nFor teachers who are stretched thin, those kinds of offerings provide little recourse. They require time and energy, which are in short supply.\n\nI don't want to go to a webinar to think about my mental health, Wohl said. In my (school) building, people try to organize a get-together after school, but it's over Zoom, and I'm done with Zoom for the day.\n\nOther resources that might once have been available, and that could have provided some relief – calling in sick, for instance, if a teacher is feeling physically ill or needs a mental health day – are no longer tenable, teachers said.\n\nIn many districts, there simply aren't enough substitute teachers to meet the need. Substitutes are typically retired teachers, and for districts using any hybrid or in-person model, the risk of coronavirus exposure poses a heightened threat. And especially in a pandemic that is straining everyone's mental health, teachers said, the chance to actually see one's students is too precious to abandon.\n\nThese kids, they only get to come so much of the time, and they want to see me. They don't want to see a sub, Evans said.\n\nFor schools that are remote, getting a substitute set up for online learning poses its own set of logistical challenges – getting a Zoom, transferring it over, making sure the substitute is comfortable navigating online learning software. For many, that burden factors in when determining whether to call in sick.\n\nHerda took one day off in October, and it was more stress than imaginable, she said. Her district still hasn't developed a clear system for arranging substitute teachers over video chat. So she had to alert human resources, tech support and her principal a week in advance of her absence. And still, she was fielding questions from the school on her supposed day away.\n\nWith that in mind, she said, the idea of taking a day off for mental health is difficult to conceive.\n\nI don't feel confident there's any measures in place that would help make sure my students have anything guaranteed to help them, that would take the pressure off of me, she said. It would still rely on me doing all of the work even if I was very sick.\n\nMeanwhile, federal support has lagged. Outlining his own health agenda, President-elect Joe Biden vowed to make it safe for schools to reopen by the end of his first 100 days in office – assuming Congress and state and local governments took measures to support school teachers and to curb the coronavirus spread.\n\nBut those are tremendous assumptions and promise a safe return to the classroom only when the school year has almost ended. News of a vaccine could offer some hope that, even if things are bad now, they will eventually improve. A top CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, has recommended that teachers be part of the next wave of Americans vaccinated, meaning they could be immunized by some time in February.\n\nBut for many, it feels too far away to really make a difference, especially as winter looms.\n\nIt's like that trauma response where you cannot look forward. You just live day to day, Herda said. That's the way I'm making it through.
U.S. officials Tuesday formally named Russia as the likely source of a massive, ongoing cyber attack that has compromised key government and private sector systems across the country.\n\nA joint statement issued by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence and National Security Agency characterized the hacking campaign as likely Russian in origin and responsible for perhaps all of the recently discovered compromises of public and private networks.\n\nAt this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence gathering effort, officials said in an acknowledgment that the attack is continuing weeks after the breach was made public. We are taking all necessary steps to understand the full scope of this campaign and respond accordingly.\n\nThe public attribution to Russia is the most definitive accounting yet after separate statements last month by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-Attorney General William Barr who both pointed to the Kremlin. Barr left the administration Dec. 23.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, meanwhile, has sought to downplay the breach while suggesting that China was to blame for the attack. Trump has accused the news media of inflating the seriousness of the hacks and has repeatedly deflected blame from Russia, undermining his own administration's warning last month that the attacks posed a grave risk to government networks and the private sector.\n\nPompeo: Russia 'pretty clearly' behind cyberattack on US, but Trump casts doubts and downplays threat\n\nCyber attack:Private sector, infrastructure, all levels of government at risk\n\nAlthough federal authorities have so far traced the attack's launch back to March, it remains unclear just how long operatives have been lurking in some of the government's most critical agencies – including the departments of State, Homeland Security, Treasury and Commerce – and what may have been lost or compromised.\n\nThe U.S. has said the hackers employed sophisticated tactics not seen in past intrusions, complicating efforts to eliminate the threat.\n\nThe attackers penetrated federal computer systems through a popular piece of server software offered through a company called SolarWinds.\n\nThe threat apparently came from the same cyberespionage campaign that has afflicted cybersecurity firm FireEye, foreign governments and major corporations.\n\nThe system is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations globally, including most Fortune 500 companies and multiple U.S. federal agencies, which are now scrambling to patch their networks.\n\nOf the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of SolarWinds' Orion products, a much smaller number has been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems, federal officials said in the Tuesday statement. We have so far identified fewer than 10 U.S. government agencies that fall into this category, and are working to identify the non-government entities who also may be impacted.\n\nThis is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate, the officials said.\n\nThe Russian government did not immediately respond.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said the administration's statement was slow in coming.\n\nIt's unfortunate that it has taken over three weeks after the revelation of an intrusion this significant for this Administration to finally issue a tentative attribution, Warner said. I would hope that we will begin to see something more definitive, along with a more public pronouncement of U.S. policy towards indiscriminate supply chain infiltrations of this sort in the future.\n\nWe need to make clear to Russia that any misuse of compromised networks to produce destructive or harmful effects is unacceptable and will prompt an appropriately strong response, he said.
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI director James Comey and other losers at the bureau tried to do a number on your President.\n\nHe called Comey a total sleaze and crooked cop. The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and the New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. My firing of James Comey was a great day for America, he tweeted.\n\nComey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\n\nThe newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a witch hunt.\n\nCNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.\n\nBoth news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.\n\nAlthough the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.\n\nWow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!\n\nIn a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in complete turmoil at the time because of Comey's poor leadership and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nMy firing of James Comey was a great day for America, Trump tweeted. He was a Crooked Cop...........who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats...\n\nHe singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.\n\nLyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President, he tweeted. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!\n\nTrump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague he was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.\n\nAddressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President.\n\nHe repeated his long held contention that getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.\n\nLater Saturday, Trump blasted the New York Times article in a telephone interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro,\n\nI think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked, he said. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing.\n\nSanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.\n\nThis is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.\n\nThe obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nTrump insisted last year that he didn't fire FBI Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including a key interview with NBC News.\n\nI was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it, he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.\n\nNot that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\n\nThe FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election in order to help Trump.
Greg Toppo\n\nUSATODAY\n\nIsrael's Cabinet voted Sunday to allow non-Orthodox Jewish prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, a move that for the first time would officially recognize the rights of Conservative, Reform and other Jewish denominations to hold organized prayer at the site.\n\nThe new policy, at one of Judaism's holiest sites, would create a space for egalitarian prayer and mixed-gender ceremonies for non-Orthodox Jews. Men and women would be able to pray side-by-side next to an existing area run by ultra-Orthodox rabbis that is now split into prayer sections for men and women.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed the plan in an attempt to please American Jews, a key source of support for Israel, the Associated Press reported.\n\nNetanyahu supported the change despite stiff opposition by ultra-Orthodox and religious nationalist elements. More liberal Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism are dominant in the USA.\n\nJewish activists secretly pray at Muslim holy site\n\nI know this is a sensitive topic, but I think it is an appropriate solution, a creative solution, Netanyahu said at the start of Sunday's Cabinet meeting.\n\nJerry Silverman, president of the Jewish Federations of North America, an umbrella organization representing hundreds of Jewish groups, said, The Jewish state has always held a promise that it is for all Jewish people, and the Wall is such an amazingly spiritual and inspirational place.\n\nRabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the New York-based Union of Reform Judaism, toldThe New York Times that the decision was obviously the result of years and years of advocacy and agitation.\n\nHe added, It is about the legitimacy of the Judaism we practice here.\n\nThe plan was drafted by former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, head of the Jewish Agency for Israel, and outgoing Cabinet Secretary Avichai Mandelblit, The Washington Post reported.\n\nA remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple complex, the Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews may pray. The site is administered by ultra-Orthodox rabbinic authorities who have a monopoly over religious affairs in Israel.\n\nA leading women's prayer group, Women of the Wall, caused controversy for years by holding monthly non-Orthodox prayers at the site. Police arrested women carrying Torah scrolls and wearing religious articles traditionally reserved for men, practices ultra-Orthodox Jews oppose and consider a provocation.\n\nThe $9 million initiative will build a permanent mixed-gender prayer area where a temporary platform is today. It will also create a new entrance to the area so both Orthodox and non-Orthodox prayer areas will be given equal prominence. The new area will be managed by a committee including representatives of the Reform and Conservative movements.\n\nIt stands to open the floodgates of women's rights in the public sphere in Israel … and opens the floodgates for Jewish pluralism in Israel, said Shira Pruce of Women of the Wall. This is unprecedented change.\n\nShmuel Rabinowitz, the Rabbi of the Western Wall, said in a statement that he received news of the decision with a heavy heart and a sigh of relief.\n\nEver since the fringe and vociferous group of Women of the Wall started its mass-media activity, he said, the sacred place went from being a unifying site to one of incessant quarrels.\n\nFollow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo
AP\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — Ben Roethlisberger wasn't being cruel or unnecessarily harsh. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback had just seen enough — or not enough, to be accurate — out of wide receiver Martavis Bryant that he felt it was time to speak up.\n\nTwo weeks and two largely listless performances on the eve of the playoffs isn't what Roethlisberger wanted to see out of the remarkably talented if still occasionally inconsistent Bryant. So Roethlisberger issued what he called a challenge during his radio show on Tuesday, saying it was time for Bryant to toughen up.\n\nThere was no edge in Roethlisberger's voice as he repeated it in so many words on Wednesday as the Steelers (10-6) prepare for a trip to Cincinnati on Saturday night in the wild-card round.\n\nI just felt like we need him, Roethlisberger said. I love that guy like a little brother and just wanted him to know we needed him to step up.\n\nSomething that — when it happens — gives Pittsburgh arguably the best trio of receivers in the NFL in Bryant, All-Pro Antonio Brown and Markus Wheaton. Brown is the record-setting road-runner and perennial Pro Bowler. Wheaton is the versatile everyman and Bryant is perhaps the most athletically gifted of the bunch. His 6-foot-3 frame and seemingly effortless speed make him a matchup nightmare for opponents.\n\nThey do, anyway, when Bryant is engaged and on the field. He spent most of last Sunday's win over Cleveland on the sideline with what coach Mike Tomlin called a minor neck injury but could also have doubled as a momentary benching after Bryant — who was slowed all week by an illness — was beat out by Browns defensive back Jordan Poyer for a Roethlisberger pass in the first quarter.\n\nOftentimes, when young guys don't get an opportunity to practice, they lack a little detail in play, Tomlin said.\n\nDetails that Bryant understands he should have ironed out nearing the end of his occasionally brilliant second season.\n\nI'm still balling, Bryant said. You have your ups and you have your downs. It's about how you bounce back. I'm going to be ready to go.\n\nGood thing, because the Steelers need him with the running game almost certainly limited. DeAngelo Williams sat out practice on Wednesday to undergo treatment on his injured right foot, leaving the running game in the largely inexperienced hands of Fitzgerald Toussaint and Jordan Todman.\n\nTo win in Cincinnati for the 15th time in 18 tries, Pittsburgh will have to do it on Roethlisberger's right arm, one that has developed a fondness for chucking it deep to Bryant and letting Bryant — lovingly referred to as an alien by some — be Bryant.\n\nBryant was a supernova when thrust into the starting lineup in Week 7 as a rookie. He scored eight times in 10 games, including a 94-yard sprint against the Bengals that helped kickstart Pittsburgh's run to the AFC North title. He missed the first five games of this season — four while serving a suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy and another after getting nicked up when he returned to practice — only to make another dazzling entrance. He caught a pair of second-half touchdowns from Landry Jones to ignite a rally against Arizona on Oct. 18 and went over 100 yards in romps over Cleveland and Indianapolis.\n\nAll of which made his lethargic play of late all the more frustrating to Roethlisberger, who communicated frequently with Bryant during the receiver's suspension.\n\nRoethlisberger called Bryant after calling him out over the air, a conversation Bryant insisted would remain between he and his quarterback. Not that it matters. Consider the message received.\n\nWhat he said was good for me, Bryant said. I needed that. I'm glad he did it. And like I said, I'll be ready to go come Saturday.\n\nNot that he has much of a choice.\n\nAnytime it's coming from (Roethlisberger), you understand he's only saying it because it's in your best interest, linebacker Arthur Moats said. He understands what kind of player Martavis is and what he's capable of doing. When he says something like that, it's nothing against him personally. It's 'We need you out there so make sure you bring it.'\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL
John Hogan\n\nWZZM-TV, Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, Mich.\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — The former manager of a Norton Shores, Mich., credit union who embezzled more than $1.9 million, using the money on vehicles and cruises, was sentenced to 6 ½ years in prison Monday.\n\nThe sentencing judge said Kathryn Sue Simmerman's actions had an immense toll on her victims.\n\nIt was a very serious offense with apparently not much respect for the law,'' s@caraid U.S. District Judge Robert Holmes Bell. What I get here are cruises, pickup trucks, boats — all kinds of things that are not necessary.''\n\nSimmerman, who joined Shoreline Federal Credit Union in 1986, made a tearful apology for what she conceded was a betrayal of her co-workers and the 4,100 member Muskegon County, Mich., credit union.\n\nFeds: Woman stuffed $1.9 million in purse over 15 years\n\nI stole a lot of money and I knew it was wrong,'' she said through tears. I want to apologize to my parents, family and friends. I made a terrible example for my children and grandchildren.\n\nI'm heartbroken over all the friendships I've lost,'' Simmerman said. I will forever work to make amendments for my actions.''\n\nIn addition to her prison term, Bell ordered her to make full restitution of the money she took.\n\nThe 55-year-old mother of two was turned over to U.S.marshals after Monday's nearly two-hour sentencing hearing in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids.\n\nShoreline employees and board members, several of whom attended Monday's sentencing, feel an overwhelming sense of betrayal,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Clay Stiffler during the hearing.\n\nEmbezzling priest gets 27 months: 'It's .. my destiny'\n\nSimmerman, who was promoted to branch manager in 2006, entered the vault 433 times and stuffed bundles of cash into her purse before other workers arrived. She then asked employees to deposit the cash to credit union accounts controlled by her family.\n\nSimmerman's sentence is about a year less than what federal prosecutors were seeking in a case that garnered national attention because of the scope and length of the losses.\n\nHer defense team argued Monday that her manner was not sophisticated, but conceded the amount she was able to squirrel away was jaw-dropping.''\n\nIt started small, it kept going on and on for ... years,'' said defense attorney Donald A. Davis. Ms. Simmerman realized she wasn't going to pay it back. What she spent it on was family members and herself. It allowed her and her family to live a life that she couldn't have otherwise lived.''\n\nSimmerman is a kind and decent woman'' who has no criminal background, Davis said. She is and will remain publicly humiliated until the day she dies.''\n\nSimmerman pleaded guilty in August to embezzlement from a credit union, which is punishable by up to 30 years in prison. In exchange for her plea, federal prosecutors agreed not to file charges against her husband and sons. Sentencing guidelines for Simmerman recommended a term of between 6 ½ and 8 years.\n\nEx-JPMorgan adviser charged in $20M fraud\n\nHer criminal behavior substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness'' of Shoreline, causing the credit union's net worth ratio to drop below 2%, taking it to the brink of insolvency, Stiffler said.\n\nMore than $1.2 million of the embezzled funds was covered by the credit union's insurance policy. They know they're going to be made whole. It was not in jeopardy,'' Davis said in asking for a sentence within guidelines.\n\nSimmerman cooked the books to reflect a comfortable net worth ratio of 12.5%, when in reality it was less than 2%, the government said.\n\nHer 2014 take was $319,000, court records show. She was able to pocket $23,000 in 2015 before auditors on Feb. 20 reported the embezzlement to Norton Shores police. Simmerman was fired from the credit union a week later.\n\nThe amount pilfered represents 86% of the earnings the small, single-branch credit union retained over its existence, Stiffler said.\n\nThe credit union, established in 1953, serves about 4,100 employees and retirees from about 18 Muskegon County companies. Its members are designated as low-income.\n\nFollow John Hogan on Twitter: @JohnHoganWZZM
Andrew Joseph\n\nCross-sport trolling is apparently a thing, and we're glad because the Dallas Stars and Nashville Predators' social teams pulled it off perfectly.\n\nLast week, the NBA sent a memo to its teams about social media conduct. The league wanted its brand accounts to stop mocking other teams, which led to the Hawks and Kings becoming best friends.\n\nBut something didn't feel right. This is sports, and there will always be a winner and a loser. The Dallas Stars recognized that with this amazing tweet.\n\nNicely done, Stars. That's how it should be.\n\nThe Predators were also in the spirit of trolling the NBA.\n\nSports!
How am I doing?\n\nIt's a question most of us have likely asked ourselves, especially during the pandemic, which has distressed us, upended us, disconnected us. Maybe you asked it when two bad days turned into four, or when you lost something, or someone, and the grief never abated. Maybe you asked it when melancholy edged toward hopelessness, when you grew tired of treading water, when you inhabited the same body but no longer felt like the same self.\n\nPeople are often told to check in with others when they notice someone struggling. Just reach out we say. But what about reaching in? Mental health experts say everyone should perform regular mental health checks to assess their own well-being. There's a process for determining if you are OK, and it's not unlike what you would do if you were concerned about someone you love.\n\nIt's sort of in some way shifting this mindset of what questions would I ask my friend if I was worried about them and then using that on yourself, said Vaile Wright, senior director of health care innovation at the American Psychological Association.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with Wright and Lynn Bufka, senior director for practice transformation and quality at the American Psychological Association, on how to perform a mental health check.\n\nFind someplace quiet\n\nIt can be hard to listen to what our brains are telling us when we're working, caring for others or distracted. Wright says to do a mental health check, you need quiet.\n\nWe're so used to multi-tasking that we don't really give ourselves space to sit down and reflect, she said. Scheduling that time for yourself is going to be an important component.\n\nStart with the big picture question\n\nAn important measure of well-being is whether you're able to function in daily life.\n\nOne of the biggest indicators is whether the person is really having trouble doing their day-to-day life, Bufka said. Are you able to fulfill your role as a mom, a teacher, a spouse, a daughter?\n\nIf you're really struggling in domains that you previously weren't, that's a sign things are off track.\n\nLook at your feelings and behaviors\n\nNo one's baseline normal is the same, so experts say it's important to look for changes in your mood. Questions you can ask yourself:\n\nHow have my behaviors changed?\n\nHow have my feelings changed?\n\nDo I still find joy in the things that once brought me joy?\n\nAm I being irritable or snapping at people?\n\nAm I really down more than I usually am?\n\nDo I find that I'm catastrophizing more than I usually do?\n\nAm I avoiding people?\n\nAlso consider the duration of your symptoms. Everyone has bad days. But experts say from a diagnostic point of view, if you're feeling down for longer than two weeks, that's cause for concern and may mean its time to seek professional help.\n\nLook at your body\n\nOur bodies try and communicate when our brains are not well. Mental health and physical health are inextricably linked. You should ask yourself:\n\nHow am I sleeping?\n\nAm I eating well?\n\nAm I grinding my teeth?\n\nDo I feel muscle tension in my neck or shoulders?\n\nAm I being active the way I usually am?\n\nDon't wait until things are bad\n\nIn a perfect world, people would do these check-ins even when they weren't struggling. It's much easier to prevent a crisis then it is to climb out of one.\n\nThe way in which we see a physical doctor even when we're feeling OK, just to make sure that everything's still going right, is kind of how we need to be approaching our emotional wellbeing as well, Wright said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time day or night, or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line also provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.\n\nThe American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has resources to help if you need to find support for yourself or a loved one.
Bloomberg, editorial: Monday's market gyrations highlight one of the biggest worries investors have this year: What would a slump in China mean for the rest of the world? ... China's leaders are trying to engineer an unprecedented transition to a consumer-driven economy — a shift that will require them to abandon an investment-centric model that has produced rapid growth but also engendered huge debts and excess capacity. One possible outcome is a slowdown that weighs on the global economy for years to come. A scarier possibility is a more virulent financial contagion, as markets panic over losses suffered by the many foreign banks and investors that have piled into China in recent years.\n\nSouth China Morning Post, Hong Kong, editorial: China's regulators exert a firm control over many things, but the stock market is not one of them. The first day of trading in the new year was labelled 'Black Monday,' thanks in no small part to the newly launched circuit breaker, which halted trading in Shenzhen and Shanghai shortly after midday. The disruption has been an embarrassing hiccup. ... Coupled with news of another contraction in the country's manufacturing sector, the ripple effect was felt by markets around the world. The fiasco is a good example of why Beijing needs to allow market forces to work rather than tightening control.\n\nUnited States falls behind on gender parity: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nJoe Zhang, Financial Times: President Xi Jinping ... has begun touting the virtues of supply-side reform. This looks like a sure sign that Beijing has had its fill of stock market tinkering and is turning instead to a watered-down version of Reaganomics. The new policy has two major elements. The first involves making it easier for business to operate by eliminating tedious bureaucracy. The second entails giving the private sector a bigger role in public works projects, which ... have been dominated by notoriously corrupt state-controlled firms. These are good ideas as far as they go. But the government is showing no sense of urgency, and even if it did, such limited measures are not nearly enough. Tax cuts and privatization should also be on the agenda.\n\nMichael Hiltzik, Los Angeles Times: Storm clouds have been gathering over stock prices for six months or more. ...

WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would not run for an open Senate seat in Kansas, despite McConnell's repeated entreaties, according to a source close to the GOP leader.\n\nMcConnell spoke with Pompeo Monday, where he indicated he will not be running for Senate, confirmed the source, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the conversation. Leader McConnell believes Secretary Pompeo is doing an incredible job as Secretary of State and is exactly where the country needs him to be right now.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post first reported the news.\n\nPompeo had been toying with a Senate bid for months, courting GOP donors and highlighting his longstanding ties to Kansas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump even seemed to confirm the possibility in November, when he told Fox & Friends that Pompeo – a former House member – might consider a return to electoral politics if he feels another Republican cannot win the open Senate seat in Kansas in 2020.\n\nIf he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that, Trump said. Mike would win easily in Kansas. Great state. And it's a Trump state. He'd win easily.\n\nIt's not clear why Pompeo ruled out a bid now but his decision comes just days after the U.S. killed a top Iranian military leader, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force. The killing has exacerbated U.S. tensions with Iran, whose leaders have threatened to retaliate, and stoked fears of another Middle East war.\n\nPompeo has spent hours since last week's airstrike trying to rally and reassure rattled U.S. allies, and he spent Sunday appearing on all five network news shows justifying Trump's surprise decision.\n\nMore:What you need to know about the escalating situation with Iran\n\nMcConnell had been pressing Pompeo to run for the seat now held by GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, who is retiring.\n\nPompeo took the helm of the State Department in April of 2018, and he has been one of Trump's staunchest defenders amid a series of foreign policy crises – from Afghanistan to North Korea to Syria.\n\nOn Ukraine, Pompeo has come under intense fire amid allegations that he knew about — and approved of — the efforts to pressure Ukraine's president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, as well as a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nConfirmation hearing for attorney general nominee Barr\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will hear Tuesday from William Barr, President Donald Trump's attorney general nominee. Barr, who served as the attorney general under President George H. W. Bush, has been a major critic of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. If confirmed to succeed the ousted Jeff Sessions, Barr would have full authority over Mueller's inquiry. On Monday, Barr released written testimony to the committee stating his pledge to allow Mueller to complete his work. Along with the Russia investigation, other points expected to be brought up during the hearing include criminal justice overhaul and immigration policy.\n\nRep. King faces disapproval vote over racial comments\n\nDemocrats in control of the House of Representatives have scheduled a Tuesday vote on a resolution of disapproval of Rep. Steve King over the Iowa Republican's comments on white supremacy. The decision to hold a vote came on Monday night, just as GOP leadership also decided not to give committee assignments to King, who has been in Congress since 2003. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? King said in an interview with the New York Times last week.\n\n10 years ago, 155 survived the 'Miracle on the Hudson'\n\nThe sky was cold but clear a decade ago Tuesday when Flight 1549 took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport with 155 passengers and crew. What a view of the Hudson today, pilot Chesley Sully Sullenberger remarked to co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles. Less than a minute later, the plane collided with a flock of geese, knocking out both engines. Sullenberger took the controls and somehow brought the plane down in one piece onto the surface of the Hudson River. For Sullenberger, the Miracle on the Hudson brought instant fame and eventually a Hollywood film starring Tom Hanks. For the passengers, it led many to re-examine their lives. Everything that I could think about was the things I was going to miss, said Tripp Harris, 47. That fundamentally shifted my priorities.\n\nFord and Volkswagen expected to make major announcement\n\nFord and Volkswagen plan an announcement Tuesday during the Detroit auto show regarding a possible alliance. The carmakers have been talking since June about several joint projects and joint development of a range of commercial vehicles. Ford and VW sources have said in recent months that talks are proceeding as hoped. The companies also have said any partnership won't be a merger or include equity stakes. News of a potential announcement won praise from industry analysts, and some have said the alliance could result in more jobs.\n\nThat was fast: Serena wins 49-minute Melbourne match\n\nSerena Williams appears to be a woman on a mission at the Australian Open, which could be a good thing in her quest to earn a 24th Grand Slam title. Making her first appearance at the Down Under Grand Slam since she won the title while in her first trimester of pregnancy in 2017, Williams flew past fellow mom, Tatjana Maria of Germany, 6-0, 6-2 in 49 minutes. That was one of the best matches of my career, the 16th-seeded Williams said.
The U.S. military began the process of withdrawing its troops from Syria following a drawdown ordered by President Donald Trump, a military official said Friday.\n\nCol. Sean Ryan, a spokesman for the U.S.-coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, declined to discuss specific operational details of the pullout such as timings and troop movements, but said in an email the withdrawal was underway.\n\nAbout 2,000 U.S. troops are in Syria.\n\nThe military has moved some cargo from Syria already, according to a U.S. Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Trump's order is for a complete withdrawal of troops and their equipment.\n\nThe troops in Syria have weapons, communication equipment and vehicles that will need to be moved. Planning is underway to identify facilities that can handle the equipment, the official said. No troops have left yet.\n\nIt could take months to complete the withdrawal.\n\nThe development comes as White House national security adviser John Bolton appeared to contradict Trump's order when he said the withdrawal would not be immediate, it would not happen before ISIS is fully defeated and it would be contingent on a pledge by Turkey not to attack the U.S.'s Kurdish military allies in Syria.\n\nNone of Bolton's conditions have been met.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan refused to meet with Bolton during his visit to Turkey this week and described his conditions for the U.S. troop drawdown as a grave mistake. Turkey considers some members of a Syrian-Kurdish Arab coalition fighting ISIS alongside U.S. troops to be terrorists and has applauded Trump's decision.\n\nTurkey has amassed thousands of troops along its border with Syria and has long threatened to unilaterally attack Kurdish militias who it claims has ties to separatist groups who have carried out assassinations and bombings against the Turkish government for decades. The U.S. withdrawal from the area could embolden Ankara.\n\nI have some concerns, my greatest concern…probably is the Kurds and… just how defenseless we are going to leave them, newly elected Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D, told Stars and Stripes, an American military newspaper.\n\nOn Monday, Bolton said Trump would not allow Turkey to kill the Kurds.\n\nTrump announced the withdrawal about three weeks ago on Dec. 19. A day later, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis released a resignation letter in which he indicated that he no longer agreed with the president's thinking on military operations.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ISIS is far from obliterated. The Washington-based think tank estimates 20,000 to 30,000 Islamic State militants may still be in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that monitors the Syria conflict via a network of activists on the ground, said the U.S. withdrawal began Thursday night. It said a convoy of about 10 armored vehicles, in addition to some trucks, pulled out from a military base in Syria's northeastern town of Rmelan into Iraq.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has been fighting ISIS in the Middle East since 2014 and Mattis said before leaving his job that declaring victory and leaving Syria would be a mistake.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been defending Trump's order this week while on a tour of the Middle East where he has been rebuking former President Barack Obama's policies for the region. In a speech in Cairo, he said Trump made the right decision to bring our troops home from Syria and the U.S. is committed to the complete dismantling of the ISIS threat and the ongoing fight against radical Islamism.\n\nBut Pompeo also caused confusion about Washington's Syria policy. He said in his speech in Cairo that Obama was wrong to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq.\n\nWhen America retreats, chaos follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. And when we partner with enemies, they advance, Pompeo said.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, U.S. troops started pulling out of Syria.\n\nMore:Trump admin's backtracking on Syria leaves foreign policy in a better place\n\nMore:'The age of self-inflicted American shame is over,' Pompeo declares
New Jersey police pursuits killed at least 55 people in the past decade and injured more than 2,500. Nearly half the people injured were bystanders and cops.\n\nNew Jersey ranks second in the nation behind Louisiana for the percentage of African Americans killed during police pursuits since 2009, an Asbury Park Press and USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey investigation found. New Jersey leads the nation over the last 20 years.\n\nNewark police car chases killed black residents at a higher rate than any other city in the country, the last decade of federal fatal crash data shows. Thirteen people were killed in Newark pursuits, nine were not in the car police were chasing. One was a three-year-old boy. All were black.\n\nMost chases in the last two years didn't arrest a suspect. Even when cops catch a fleeing driver, they're most frequently charged with drug possession. People fleeing the police are rarely robbers or wanted killers, the Network found after reviewing more than 66,000 state arrest records on people fleeing from cops.\n\nDig Deeper: NJ police chases are killing innocent people. Here's how to make them safer.\n\nNew Jersey's written policy has acknowledged for decades that most chases start with traffic violations. The rules say cops aren't allowed to chase cars for motor vehicle offenses, with one important and broad exception: Police can chase if an officer feels the vehicle is being operated so as to pose an immediate threat to the safety of another person.\n\nIt can happen to anybody. Pizza delivery driver killed by motorcyclist fleeing cop Eric Larson was killed on his way home from work, leaving his fianceé to raise two daughters alone. Andrew Ford, @AndrewFordNews\n\nThat one-sentence exception allows cops to engage in dangerous, high-speed chases that start with even the smallest traffic infraction, like an illegal right on red. Traffic violations prompted at least 23 fatal pursuits, law enforcement records show.\n\nI think that it is ridiculous that police are allowed to chase people for violations that are trivial in the grand scheme of things, said Taylor Bromberg, whose fiancé, Eric Larson, was killed in Jackson by a motorcycle fleeing police after the motorcyclist failed to stop when turning right at a red light.\n\nTo understand New Jersey police pursuits, the Network reviewed more than 5,000 pages of police chase summary reports to compile 10 years of data on the state's 466 municipal police departments.\n\nThe Network also analyzed more than four million New Jersey state court arrest records, 1.3 million fatal crash records from the federal government and state data on police pursuits. The Network conducted dozens of interviews that included law enforcement experts, police, lawmakers and people affected by the aftermath of police chases.\n\nNew Jersey state Sen. Ron Rice, D-Essex, whose district includes Newark, called for a legislative hearing to investigate police pursuits after he reviewed the Network's key findings.\n\nIt appears to me there's a lot more harm done than good right now, Rice said.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said his office needed time to review the data presented by the Network.\n\nI have not shied away from enforcing the pursuit policy, he said, noting that was a reason he took over The Palisades Interstate Parkway Police Department in 2017 when he served as Bergen County prosecutor.\n\nHe spoke to a reporter about pursuits at a press conference Dec. 4, where he announced a series of police accountability reforms, some of which address problems previously highlighted by the Network. He pointed to those reforms when asked about pursuits.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Attorney General Gurbir S.

Tanya Breen, Tanya Breen\n\nThat's why we have the IA (internal affairs) process and we've made the guidelines more robust, he said, ...any time there's a violation of a pursuit policy or any other (attorney general) guideline, that the IA process is used to address that misconduct or to review that conduct. By the same token, our Office of Public Integrity is there to hold those accountable who might violate those policies in a criminal way too.\n\nGrewal's office later issued a statement pointing to the Office of Policing Policy, a branch of the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability, which was tasked with reviewing attorney general directives and ensuring compliance.\n\nPolice pursuits have been something that law enforcement struggled with for a long time — you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't, said Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose. But you take into consideration, an officer that follows the guidelines, and the officers that do the job, it's the behavior of the person that they're pursuing that's creating that type of environment.\n\nThe president of the state's largest police union declined to comment on pursuits when presented with the Network's key findings.\n\nWhen he was Milwaukee police chief, Edward Flynn saw a spike in police car chase deaths. To curb the deaths, in 2010 he limited the reasons his officers could go on chases.\n\nAll the data indicates that it's never worth it, almost never, Flynn, said about police pursuits. He's a former Jersey City officer with law enforcement experience in several states.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of when police pursuits are appropriate, and for how long and at what level of risk, our moral obligation is to limit that potential for a bad outcome, Flynn said. And if that means limiting our officers' willingness to be brave on the public behalf, sometimes we have to do that.\n\nPursuits hurt cops\n\nShow caption Hide caption A heavily damaged Millville police cruiser rests near Broad and 3rd streets on Sunday morning, hours after a crash in which Officer Christopher Reeves was...

Traffic violations ain't worth it. You'll get the guy again. Let it go, she said. We need to change the way our policing is done.\n\nCops rarely chase killers\n\nThirty-nine years later, John Whetsel still vividly recalled the day he was dispatched to a crash scene in Oklahoma City.\n\nA police officer chased a fleeing motorcyclist up to 100 m.p.h. in a residential area, Whetsel said. The motorcycle crashed into a family's car.\n\nAfter 15 minutes at the scene, Whetsel realized: it was his family.\n\nHis wife and daughter were killed.\n\nIt's a painful personal story from early in his career that Whetsel now uses in training programs. He's a former Oklahoma police chief and sheriff who serves as the chair of the traffic safety committee of the National Sheriff's Association.\n\nJohn Whetsel, whose wife and daughter were killed by a motorcyclist fleeing police I do think that you have to have the ability to pursue to arrest criminals.

What would be worth killing an innocent civilian?\n\nHe feels some car chases are worth that risk.\n\nI do think that you have to have the ability to pursue to arrest criminals, Whetsel said.\n\nIn June, police chased a Willingboro man suspected of killing his ex-girlfriend's grandmother and brother through several counties. He was captured by Camden County police.\n\nIn November, Absecon police chased four men later charged in connection to a shooting at a Pleasantville High School football game.\n\nBut these chases represent a tiny fraction of the incidents in which people are fleeing New Jersey police, court records show. Out of 66,816 people accused of eluding police in the past four decades, 174 faced both a murder charge and an eluding charge. Seven were charged with murder prior to being accused of fleeing the cops.\n\nMore people were killed in pursuits in that time — federal data shows at least 201 dead in New Jersey.\n\nLeading the nation for racial disparity\n\nUmar King Provided by Thyson Halley\n\nUmar King, 33, was waiting at a bus stop after work.

Friend recalls Umar King, who was killed by a fleeing driver King gave up his time to teach sign language to his community. Kevin R. Wexler and Andrew Ford, Asbury Park Press\n\nLooking just at the cars police are choosing to chase, New Jersey still leads the nation for racial disparity in police pursuits.\n\nIn the last 20 years, New Jersey police pursuits took the lives of 38 people who were riding in the car police were chasing, the data shows. Twenty-three of them were black. Six were white.\n\nThat's a larger disparity than any other state.\n\nSet aside passengers who were killed and the gap remains.\n\nTwelve of the fleeing drivers were black, five were white.\n\nThat's a larger disparity than any other state.\n\nIt suggests there's a kind of devaluing of the lives of people of color in those communities, without — I don't think — broad public conversation from the police department saying: listen folks, this is for your own safety, Alex Shalom, senior supervising attorney for the ACLU in New Jersey, said of the Network's findings.\n\nI don't think there would be buy-in in those communities for policies of the widespread use of police chases if people knew that which you reveal in these data, he added. Which is that most folks are not going to be arrested. When they are arresting people, it's seldom for violent crimes. That suggests that police should be thinking through wholesale changes to the way they conduct chases and frankly whether they're conducting them at all in many instances.\n\nNew Jersey's top rank for racial disparity in police chase deaths doesn't appear to be explained by the time of day of chases, crime rates, population demographics or density.\n\nNewark provided figures that show in 2019, the victims and suspects of murders, aggravated assaults and robberies were usually black people. Murder victims and suspects were black more than 90 percent of the time.\n\nIn 49 states, including New Jersey, most pursuit deaths happened before 6 a.m. or after 6 p.m. — overnight hours when it might be hard to judge the race of a fleeing driver. New Jersey's share of overnight pursuit deaths is lower than most states.\n\nNew Jersey's police pursuit deaths cluster in cities like Newark, which has a large black population and a higher crime rate than the state. But compared to other cities since 2009, Newark leads the nation, with a pursuit death racial disparity bigger than Atlanta, Birmingham, Cleveland or Detroit, cities with higher violent crime rates and a larger percentage of black residents.\n\nFive ways to address deadly police chases Read more\n\nNewark is densely populated, but there's little mathematic correlation between density and racial disparity in police chase deaths, a sample of 100 cities shows.\n\nSetting aside cities where all the people killed were black, there appears to be some correlation between cities with large black populations and disparity in the police pursuit deaths, the 100-city sample shows.\n\nBut Newark isn't the city with the greatest proportion of black residents.\n\nSo why does Newark lead the nation for racial disparity in police pursuits?\n\nFormer Milwaukee chief Edward Flynn and Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose urged a reporter to consider the demographics of the victims of crime.\n\nNewark provided figures that show in 2019, the victims and suspects of murders, aggravated assaults and robberies were usually black people, who make up just under half the city's population.\n\nThe standard forms New Jersey police use to track pursuits don't record the race of a suspect, making it difficult to know if there's a racial disparity in the pursuits that don't end with a death.\n\nMurder victims were 92 percent black people and 97 percent of murder suspects were black. At least 60 percent of aggravated assault victims and suspects were black. Robbery victims were more evenly split — 40 percent black to 37 percent white. Robbery suspects were black 70 percent of the time.\n\nNewark isn't the only city where crime disproportionately involves black people.\n\nData provided by Atlanta Police Department — a city with a proportion of black residents two percentage points greater than Newark— shows a rate similar to Newark for black murder victims (87 percent) and suspects (94 percent) and a higher percentage of black people involved in aggravated assaults in 2019. Atlanta aggravated assault victims were 87 percent black, and 94 percent of the people arrested for assault were black.\n\nAtlanta's violent crime numbers are similar to Detroit, a city with a black population 28 percentage points greater than Newark. More than 90 percent of the victims and perpetrators of aggravated assault and murder were black in 2019, data provided by Detroit shows.\n\nYet those cities with comparable 2019 crime demographics and more black residents have a lower rate for killing black people in police car chases since 2009: Atlanta at 86 percent and Detroit at 78 percent compared to Newark's 100 percent.\n\nAt least four of Newark's deaths took place in the city's South Ward, one as recently as 2018. South Ward Councilman John Sharpe James said he wasn't aware of the city's pursuit death racial disparity and called the police chase deaths random and rare.\n\nAs a police officer, you can't control every scenario, every situation, he said.\n\nThe standard forms New Jersey police use to track pursuits don't record the race of a suspect, making it difficult to know if there's a racial disparity in the pursuits that don't end with a death.\n\nMembers of the Newark Police Division do not arrest for race, Ambrose said in an emailed statement. We make arrests to equally protect the citizens of Newark, without consideration of the race of the perpetrator.\n\nData compiled by the Network shows that on top of a huge racial disparity in pursuit deaths, Newark's chases in the last decade are among the least effective in the state: just under half the pursuits ended with arrests, about 40 percent caused crashes and about 18 percent caused injuries.\n\nA 10-year look at police pursuits does not paint an accurate picture of our policies over the last few years, when we changed strategies to protect the public, Ambrose said in the statement.\n\nNewark's policy on pursuits was last updated in 2017, adding restrictions on the reasons officers can chase cars — no chasing stolen cars and no chasing people just because they fled from police.\n\nNewark cops initiated many fewer pursuits in 2017 and 2018 compared to years before. There were fewer crashes and injuries, but still at least three deaths.\n\nThe pursuits also became less effective, ending with more crashed cars than arrested suspects.\n\nLet's also be mindful that every pursuit begins with actions of the suspect to evade police, putting the public at immediate risk, whether we pursue or not, Ambrose said in the statement.\n\nKilled before his daughter's eyes\n\nFamily photo featuring James Walsh, who was killed by a suspect fleeing police.

He's scheduled to be released from prison in February.\n\nErin called Bradley a coward at his sentencing nine years ago.\n\nNow she forgives him.\n\nHe was my age when he killed my dad, I can't even begin to think of what was going through his head besides fear and panic, she said in an online message. It is what it is, and I hope he finds the support and peace he needs once he gets out.\n\nErin said she doesn't blame the cops for what happened to her father. But she does think New Jersey can do more to limit pursuits and keep bystanders safe.\n\nI definitely don't think minor traffic violations need to be ending in a high-speed police pursuit, she said.\n\nNew Jersey policy has gaps\n\nNew Jersey is among a handful of states with rules for police pursuits and New Jersey's guidelines are the most detailed, according to a 50-state review by undergraduate researchers from The College of New Jersey working in cooperation with the Network. Authorities in two states didn't confirm the student's findings but don't appear to have a statewide policy on pursuits.\n\nThe New Jersey guidelines obligate a cop to consider 10 factors while racing after a fleeing suspect — like chances of success, whether the suspect is known and can be captured later, how much risk is involved, and the officer's driving skills.\n\nOnce the chase is on, cops are supposed to radio in details like the reason for the chase, the direction, speed and information about the fleeing vehicle.\n\nSupervisors play a huge role in pursuits, said Joseph Blaettler, former Union City deputy chief. And that's part of the reason why cops, as soon as they get into a pursuit, they have to call it out. The supervisor has to monitor the pursuit.\n\nBut that doesn't always happen. Jackson Patrolman Cherrick Daniels, involved in the pursuit that ended with the death of motorcyclist Anthony Griffin and pizza delivery driver Eric Larson, didn't call in the pursuit until after the crash, his police report shows. That means a supervisor didn't have a chance to weigh whether the chase was a good idea.\n\nWhen a police car crashes in a pursuit, New Jersey's policy calls for departments to review whether the collision could have been prevented and make a copy of that report available to their county prosecutor's office.\n\nNone of the 21 prosecutor's offices produced these records in response to a Network request, saying they couldn't be easily located and in one case denying access to a report as a confidential internal affairs record. Police cars were involved in more than 1,300 crashes since 2009, records from each town show.\n\nPolice internal investigations are closely guarded secrets in New Jersey, making it difficult to know whether a department took action against a cop involved in a chase.\n\nThis year, the state attorney general was tasked with investigating police-involved deaths and his office announced an investigation related to a police pursuit in August. A spokesman for the office said in December the investigation is ongoing.\n\nRaw video: Fatal crash after Bernards township police chase car for suspended registration A 19-year-old passenger was killed in Bernards Township in Somerset County in 2015 after he was thrown from a car in a crash.

Andrew Ford, @AndrewFordNews\n\nFamilies aren't finding help in court\n\nLawsuits claiming police misconduct have cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in recent years, the Network found. But these claims appear to yield little for people hurt in police car chases or their loved ones.\n\nData from the largest municipal insurer in the state, which covers at least 240 towns, show they closed 30 cases related to police chases in the last five years, 15 of which cost nothing, the remainder cost a total of $116,088, including the town's attorney fees.\n\nTo win a lawsuit filed against the cops, the law requires an aggrieved relative to show that police engaged in willful misconduct, which means an officer knowingly violated a superior's command or a specific standing order.\n\nIt's easy to show wrongdoing in court when an officer used excessive force against a citizen.\n\nBut it's hard to convince a judge or jury of a police officer's liability when a bystander was injured by a bad guy racing away from police, according to Gregg L. Zeff, a Mount Laurel attorney who has sued cops and defended them.\n\nIt's so hard to prove a claim of wrongdoing when the eluding driver is the injured person that Zeff said he's reviewed such cases, but he hasn't taken one.\n\nEven if I thought that what was done was wrong, it's just too hard to persuade people in a case like that, he said.\n\n'It can happen to anybody'\n\nTaylor Bromberg, 26, visited the grave of her fiancé Eric Larson with her daughters, Adriana Nicole, 5, and Mikayla Grace, 2.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court was deeply divided Wednesday over Ohio's method of purging voters who fail to vote or return warning notices, but it appeared the court's conservative majority may uphold the controversial practice.\n\nThe decision, to be rendered by June, will hinge on which action is seen as the cause — noting voting over six years, or not returning the notice. But the debate at times reflected the justices' — and the country's — deeper feelings about voting rights.\n\nPeople have a right not to vote if they choose, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued passionately, noting that minorities and the homeless face the greatest barriers in getting to the polls.\n\nBut Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote opponents of Ohio's process may need, said states want to protect the voter roll by removing people who have died or moved away.\n\nAfter more than an hour's debate, neither side had a clear majority, largely because Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas — likely to be on Ohio's side — remained silent. Justice Stephen Breyer, alone among the court's four liberals, appeared conflicted.\n\nWhen Paul Smith, the lawyer for voting rights groups opposing Ohio, said state election officials' method of sending notices to people who haven't voted tells you almost nothing because 70% are not returned, Breyer shot back, What are they supposed to do?\n\nEvery year, Breyer noted, some residents move or die. That used to be a big problem — voting dead people, he said.\n\nOhio, often a bellwether in national elections, has removed thousands of people who don't vote for two years, don't return warning notices, and then don't vote for another four years. The state was sued after the 2015 elections, when those who had not voted since Barack Obama's dramatic victory in 2008 discovered they no longer were registered.\n\nUnder federal laws enacted in 1993 and 2002, states cannot remove voters from registration lists because of their failure to vote. But they can do so if voters don't respond to confirmation notices.\n\nThe question for the Supreme Court to resolve is whether a failure to vote can be the initial trigger leading to removal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in 2016 said no, resulting in the votes of 7,515 Ohioans being restored.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Chief Justice John Roberts said the state can use the failure to vote as a trigger, providing the follow-up notice helps the state determine if a voter has moved. He even wondered aloud if not voting is a constitutional right; a voting requirement, he said, could boost low turnout levels.\n\nThe case is the latest in a series of battles against some states' efforts to restrict voting rights and combat alleged voter fraud. Most of the states supporting Ohio have Republican governors or legislatures; most of those opposed are governed by Democrats.\n\nThe voting rights debate also is playing out on a national level. President Trump last week disbanded a commission he had created to investigate voter fraud after many states refused to provide information about voters. But he continued to call for voter identification laws as a means to combat alleged fraud.\n\nThe Supreme Court has heard a bevy of voting rights cases since its controversial 2013 decision striking down a key section of the Voting Rights Act, which had forced mostly Southern states to clear changes in election laws with federal officials.\n\nLast term, the justices nixed the excessive use of race in redistricting by legislatures in North Carolina and Virginia. This term, it faces cases from Wisconsin and Maryland challenging what opponents claim were election maps drawn by state legislators for purely partisan gain. Another case is pending from Texas.\n\nSeveral other states that use the failure to vote as a trigger in efforts to cleanse their registration rolls could be affected by the high court's decision in the Ohio case, including Georgia, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia. But according to the League of Women Voters, no other state ... has a practice as ham-handed and draconian as Ohio's.\n\nMost of the people who are purged have not moved, Smith argued in court Wednesday. Noting the low return rate on mailed warnings, he said, you're going to vastly over-purge people. That's precisely what Ohio does.\n\nBut U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco — whose office changed sides in the case after Trump was elected — said Ohio has a right to streamline over-inflated and bloated voter registration rolls.\n\nBy the end, even conservative justices who seemed inclined to support Ohio acknowledged it was a close call.\n\nAs a policy matter, Justice Samuel Alito said, there are strong arguments on both sides.\n\nMore:Supreme Court to rule on state efforts to purge voters\n\nMore:Political maps under fire as Supreme Court case on tailor-made districts looms\n\nMore:Supreme Court faces blockbuster term -- and Trump
Christina Jedra\n\nThe (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — The Sept. 24 fire in a Canby Park rowhome will go down in Wilmington as one of the most traumatic events in city history. The tragedy ultimately took the lives of three firefighters and injured four more, leaving the department and community reeling.\n\nIn the days that followed, city officials realized they had another very serious problem, said Mayor Mike Purzycki.\n\nBecause of a decision made in the 1980s, Wilmington had no insurance to cover workers' compensation costs. Now, the city has to pay an estimated $9 million or more out of pocket to cover health care costs for firefighters injured in the blaze, Purzycki told The News Journal.\n\nOfficials have no idea how high costs could go. The city is still receiving hospital bills old and new, Purzycki said. Firefighter Brad Speakman, who spent 41 days in the burn unit at Chester-Crozer Medical Center, requires continued care and may need skin grafts and plastic surgery.\n\nIt's a horrific disaster and tragedy for these families, Purzycki said. We'll work through the finances.\n\nThe workers' compensation coverage the city owes is different from the life insurance policies covering the firefighters who died. The firefighters who lost their lives are covered. The cost for treating the injured could equal about 7% of the city's entire $154 million budget.\n\nIt's hard to imagine we won't have a deficit, Purzycki said.\n\nThe city has insurance policies that cover lawsuits brought by employees and residents, damage to city-owned properties and even for fire department boats. Yet it has no outside policy to guard against the possible costs of health care for public safety personnel injured on the job.\n\nThis has apparently been the case for decades. The city has been self-insured since the late 1980s, according to the mayor's office.\n\nThere's the risk manager, the finance department, the auditor, the human resources director. Who's supposed to be in charge of this? asked City Councilwoman Loretta Walsh, chair of the public safety committee. How did it slip through so many fingers?\n\nNow the new mayor is faced with a challenge.\n\nWhen you're trying to put together a financial plan for the city and all a sudden you find yourself with a $7 to $9 million liability, it's unsettling, Purzycki said. It certainly wasn't something we anticipated.\n\nFirefighters Ardythe Hope and Speakman were both critically injured the blaze. The fire –– which police allege was intentionally set by Beatriz Fana-Ruiz, an intoxicated and unstable resident, according to police –– burned over 70 percent of Hope's body and over 30 percent of Speakman's body. Hope succumbed to her injuries weeks later.\n\nThree other injured firefighters, John Crawthray, Terrance Tate and Peter Cramer, were treated at Christiana Care Medical Center. The city is absorbing the cost of each individual's fire-related health care. Capt. Christopher Leach and Lt. Jerry Fickes died fighting the rowhome fire.\n\nUnder the 2008 Workers Compensation Reform Law, Delaware and participating out-of-state hospitals treating workers' compensation injuries may only charge up to 80% of their usual charges, said John Rago, Purzycki's deputy chief of staff for policy and communications.\n\nBut Delaware has no facilities to treat serious burn victims, and Crozer-Chester Medical Center, where Hope and Speakman were treated, does not participate in the discount program.\n\nThe city hired a third-party consultant, PMA Management Corp., to negotiate the price down with Crozer-Chester, Rago said. The consultant secured a 15% discount on the initial hospital bill for a total of $3,470,867.22 on Nov. 14 and a 22.5% discount on the second payment of $2,671,951.99 on Dec. 18, Rago said. Recent specialist bills, due at the end of this month, will be discounted 32%, Rago said.\n\n2 firefighters killed in Delaware blaze\n\nPMA is entitled to 35% any cost savings they negotiate, Rago said, but due to this extraordinary situation and the exorbitant bills, they have limited their charges to $10,000 per invoice.\n\nThe mayor said his office is trying to find out who established the workers'comp plan and when.\n\nWhat we have to understand is the thinking that went into not having any protection at all for potential liability like this, Purzycki said. We may find this was a decision made 30 years ago and no one ever changed it. We still have a lot of questions.\n\nPurzycki has been advised that catastrophic loss coverage, a workers'comp umbrella policy, would cost about $350,000 to $400,000 a year. The Canby Park fire was the first fatal fire in the city in almost two decades. Because of the rarity of such severe fires in Wilmington, Purzycki said, it's possible that the city took a chance by forgoing coverage for the injured.\n\nWe'd never had anything like that happen before so even though we might have a large expense this year, on an ongoing basis, we would've come out ahead, he said.\n\nBiden to families of firefighters: 'Our hearts go out to you'\n\nWithout conducting an analysis of its claims history and insurance rates in the past, city officials couldn't say this week whether they would have saved more money with or without insurance.\n\nCity Auditor Earl Jeter said his office conducted an audit of risk management for the first time in 2016 but did not review workers'compensation. He said the huge amount of money the city is paying could inspire another review.\n\nThat's something that we might be thinking about in the near future, he said.\n\nAl Greto, founder of the Delaware and Pennsylvania law firm GretoLaw, said it's not necessarily a bad idea to forgo insurance. He said he would expect an actuary to investigate the city's claims history and the costs of insurance before making that decision.\n\nInsurance companies are in the business of collecting more premiums than paying out claims,' he said. Maybe the city is cutting out the middleman and this time the numbers didn't work out, but over time, they could.\n\nDouglas S. Kerr, the risk manager for Baltimore, Md., said Wilmington's choice not to insure is one made by many municipalities. Baltimore is 100% self-insured, he said.\n\nWe looked at the marketplace to determine if insurance was the right way to go, he said. We felt it better off being self-insured.\n\nPhiladelphia's Risk Manager, Barry Scott, said the same. Philly is self-insured, he said, and the city is prepared to absorb worker's compensation costs if claims arise.\n\nIt's a matter of weighing the risks and the costs, he said.\n\nThe city's risk management committee is comprised of the administrative assistant to the mayor, the city solicitor, the finance director, the city treasurer and two City Council members, according to the city code. The group is supposed to review the risk management program at least annually, the code states.\n\nPurzycki said he is looking forward. He is considering obtaining high-deductible insurance coverage for worker's compensation expenses and other cost-containment measures.\n\nWe're not trying to blame anybody, he said. We're going department by department and reviewing every policy, every procedure, every expectation. We're reimagining the way the city works.\n\nThe city has already paid about $6 million of the bills from cash on hand, Purzycki said, but when the fiscal year ends in June, officials will have to reconcile the costs.\n\nThe mayor said he isn't prepared to comment on whether he will raise taxes until he establishes a comprehensive spending and funding plan.\n\nIt doesn't help my 2018 budget, Purzycki said. It's very likely we'll have a liability to carry forward.
Scott Jennings\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nI have spent the past 20 or so New Years' Eves glued to the SyFy channel's Twilight Zone marathon. My wife and I love the writing, the plots and picking out famous actors in their one-off roles for the classic television series.\n\nMaybe I'll write an episode of my own, complete with a Rod Serling-worthy opening monologue: The year is 2017. Donald Trump is inaugurated as president of the United States, and mass amnesia has washed over America. Half the country can no longer remember anything that happened before Jan. 20. The former president, Barack Obama, is literally sitting right there. Yet, his own party cannot remember one thing about his eight years …\n\nObama memory hole\n\nIt is one of the strangest phenomena of the Trump era — the memory-holing of Obama's executive powers. Democrats continuously act as though they've just fallen off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump does anything.\n\nTrump's illegal immigration policies are draconian! He's deporting too many, they screamed, forgetting that … Obama deported more. A lot more. And, you know those cages on the southern border? Obama built them, not Trump.\n\nTrump's defying congressional subpoenas! No president has ever stonewalled Congress, they screamed, forgetting that Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for … defying subpoenas related to the Fast and Furious gun operation scandal. There were at least eight other times when Obama's administration defied congressional oversight, even preventing people from testifying (sound familiar?).\n\nMore from Scott Jennings:Which 2020 Democrat can beat Donald Trump? Don't bet on Biden, Warren or Sanders.\n\nWhen Trump announced his America First policy during his inaugural, Democrats apparently took it as literally as one can.\n\nNow, they howl over Trump's latest outrage: The airstrike that killed Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani, the general who was in Iraq fomenting attacks against the U.S. Embassy and, evidently, plotting future hits on American targets.\n\nWashington Democrats whined about Trump authorizing a drone strike without their notification or consent. This, after Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.\n\nObama's drone strikes\n\nWhen Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2009, he had authorized more drone strikes than George W. Bush had approved during his entire presidency. By his third year in office, Obama had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned (at) Guantanamo Bay, Newsweek reported.\n\nObama practically invented modern push-button warfare, for goodness' sake! Eventually, the American people will have to choose between partisan disingenuousness or rank stupidity to explain Democratic reaction to Trump's perfectly precedented decisions.\n\nOn Iran, Trump made a bold choice and sent a strong message that we aren't going to take the regime's provocations and hostility anymore. Obama sent them pallets of cash. Trump sent an MQ-9 Reaper.\n\nAnyone who knows how this will all shake out is lying. They don't. But the commander in chief took out the world's most notorious terrorist, one with plenty of American blood on his hands. Trump is the good guy here, not the terrorist.\n\nYet, Democrats couldn't wait to pounce. How many statements included perfunctory yeah, Soleimani was a bad guy, but …  construction before hammering Trump?\n\nHere's a pro tip: If your statement has a but in the middle (I'm looking at you, Elizabeth Warren), just eliminate the throat-clearing, political pablum that came before it and say what you really mean. We get it: Iranian Guy Bad, Orange Man Worse.\n\nThis attitude will cost Democrats in the upcoming election. Not just on foreign policy, but across the board (they speak of the economy as though we are in another Great Depression). They just can't give Trump an inch no matter how safe or prosperous the world is, thanks at least in part to the president's decisions.\n\nIt hasn't always been this way. After the death of Osama bin Laden, Republicans praised Obama's decision to get him.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney declared, 'The administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.' New York's former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, 'I admire the courage of the president.' And Donald J. Trump declared, 'I want to personally congratulate President Obama,'  according to The New York Times.\n\nBut no such allowance is given to President Trump when he kills a terrorist. As commentator Guy Benson tweeted, The U.S. auto industry is alive, and (Abu Bakr) Baghdadi/Soleimani are dead, referencing the Islamic State leader Trump had killed a few months ago and recalling Obama's reelection slogan.\n\nOr, as Rod Serling might say, Democrats will soon wake up from their amnesia to an old lesson: Past is prologue. And it's a Shakespearean seminar most acutely taken … in The Twilight Zone.\n\nScott Jennings is a Republican adviser, CNN political contributor and partner at RunSwitch Public Relations.

Jennifer Jacobs\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nDES MOINES — Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were forced to watch each other's TV advertisements and react to them during a live Iowa town hall meeting broadcast nationally on CNN Monday night.\n\nIt was enough to make Sanders leap out of his seat.\n\nThis calls for a standing-up response, he told the Iowans in the audience at Drake University, as he began pacing and punctuating the air with hand gestures.\n\nClinton's TV ad flashes through scenes of proud moments and crises during her career as a New York U.S. senator, first lady and U.S. secretary of state, as a narrator says: The presidency is the toughest job in the world, and she's the one leader who has what it takes to get every part of the job done.\n\nLearn how caucuses work in under a minute\n\nThat's become a central argument as the Democratic candidates enter the final week before the Iowa caucuses begin at 7 p.m. next Monday: Sanders says he has the better vision; Clinton says she is better prepared to be president.\n\nThe race is too close to call. She has 46% support, and he has 45% in the polling averages tallied by RealClearPolitics.com. Sanders said on the campaign trail in Iowa earlier Monday he thinks a high turnout will virtually ensure him a win, but right now it is a nip-and-tuck race.\n\nAt the forum after watching Clinton's This House ad, Sanders, a Vermont U.S. senator, cited times he thinks he had more foresight in decision-making than Clinton: He voted against the Iraq war, but she voted for it; he led the effort against Wall Street deregulation, but see where Clinton was on that; he decided from the start the Keystone Pipeline was a dumb idea, but she took a long time reaching the same conclusion; he quickly objected to the Pacific trade deal, but she took much longer to come on board.\n\nSanders to release health records\n\nExperience is important, but judgment is also, Sanders said. In other words, yes, I do think I have the background and the judgment to take this very, very difficult job of being president of the United States.\n\nNational party rules limiting the number of debates forbade the three Democratic candidates from appearing at the same time and engaging directly.\n\nAfter Clinton took the stage later with a little skip and a jump, she was shown Sanders' America television ad.\n\nSet to a Simon and Garfunkel song, the ad shows throngs of people going wild for Sanders. At the end, it features the liberal rock star with a pleased smile on his face as he looks out at the revolution he inspired.\n\nAsked to react to it, Clinton said: I think that's great. I think that's fabulous. I loved it.\n\nShe added: You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.\n\nAnd more poetry is a good thing, she said.\n\nBut, she added, I believe I am the better person to be the Democratic nominee and to be the president.\n\nClinton repeatedly mentioned President Obama and his faith in her abilities.\n\nMedia horde descends on Iowa for caucuses\n\nPeople here in Iowa remember we ran a really hard race against each other, she said, referring to the 2008 presidential race that she lost to Obama.\n\nObama asked her to be his secretary of state because he trusted her judgment, she said. A great working relationship turned into a real friendship as we worked side by side for those four years.\n\nShe, too, abandoned her seat opposite forum host Chris Cuomo of CNN to passionately describe how she's a proven fighter. At one point, she thrust a fist into the air.\n\nAsked to respond to Sanders' criticism about her Iraq war vote, Clinton answered: I have a much longer history than one vote, which I've said was a mistake.\n\nSeeing purple: Iowa town in a political dead heat\n\nClinton said she has laid out a plan to defeat the Islamic State, and she's very proud of her record as a whole, which includes pushing for gay rights and Internet freedom.\n\nClinton gave a shout-out to popular former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, who was sitting in the audience at Sheslow Auditorium and has endorsed Clinton.\n\nThe third candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, was asked about The Des Moines Register's endorsement of Clinton. The editorial board opined that O'Malley would be better suited as a Cabinet secretary.\n\nHis answer was that the country faces challenges.\n\nWe need a candidate who can actually pull us together. I'm not a divider, said O'Malley, who also chose to stand up as he spoke.\n\n'Three Tickets' podcast: Catch up on history of Iowa Caucuses\n\nHe stressed his Democratic upbringing, saying his story is not one of a Democratic conversion, a reference to Sanders, who has previously run as an independent, not a Democrat.\n\nO'Malley, who is severely behind the two front-runners in the polls, urged Iowa Democrats to shift the dynamics on caucus night. I've seen you do it before.\n\nHold strong at your caucus, he said.\n\nJoi Latson, an Iowa State University student, asked O'Malley a question during the forum about introducing controversial zero-tolerance policing to Baltimore when he was mayor there. O'Malley talked about his support for police accountability efforts and drug treatment. But Latson thought he dodged her question.\n\nPresidential candidates, one week from Iowa caucuses, join Sunday talk shows\n\nHe kind of talked around it and everything, Latson said. She plans to caucus for Sanders, partly because he does support the feminist values that are important to me.\n\nDrake University freshman Elena Hildebrandt, 18, said O'Malley made a more energetic appearance than she'd seen in debates.\n\nAfter waffling between supporting Sanders or Clinton, she's backing Clinton.\n\nHer experience was the reason I decided to go with her. Mostly foreign policy, but also the amount of work she did as a senator, Hildebrandt said.\n\nAnders Rosborough, a 30-year-old Des Moines resident, complimented all three candidates, but said he's supporting Sanders because of his common-sense ideas to help the country's middle class.\n\nContributing: Grant Rodgers, The Des Moines Register.

AP\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — There was a time when Chris Long didn't think this opportunity would ever come.\n\nA time when words like playoffs and Super Bowl seemed like unattainable unicorns that the 31-year-old Patriots defensive lineman might never touch. Eight years in the NFL spent on underperforming teams, and having seasons potholed by injuries have that effect.\n\nSo when the veteran was asked this week whether the chance to earn a ring was on his mind when he signed with the Patriots this offseason, he didn't doesn't hesitate to answer.\n\nIt's the whole reason I came here, he said. Everybody wants to win. That's the bottom line. When you're making a decision as an older player of where you want to be, you want to be in situations like this with opportunities like this. We've earned the opportunity...Whatever we do with it, that's up to us.\n\nNext week's Super Bowl matchup with Atlanta will also be a chance for him to match the Super Bowl ring won by his father, Hall of Famer Howie Long, who won a title with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984.\n\nThe elder Long will have a unique vantage point to watch his son as an analyst for Fox, which has the broadcast rights for the game. But Chris said it shouldn't affect him.\n\nNot a ton. It just means he's there, he said. We'll see each other. But we're not big on the sentimental stuff.\n\nWhile Howie Long was an integral part of the Raiders' defense, Chris has embraced being a role player on a New England defense that's really void of any big names.\n\nWith 35 tackles, four sacks and fumble recovery, he is having his best year since 2013 when he recorded 40 tackles and 8 1/2 sacks.\n\nHe also helped steady a New England defense that started the season without linebacker Rob Ninkovich, who was serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancing substances.\n\nNinkovich returned in October, but it only slightly diminished Long's role.\n\nThe pair has since become fast friends. The buddy system, it turns out, can been invaluable in New England's demanding environment.\n\nHe's older like me, Long said about the 32-year-old Ninkovich. He's played here a long time so he's helped me understand the intricacies of the scheme, the different things that you're going to be asked to do. ...It helps a lot.\n\nNinkovich said they bonded easily.\n\nThis league isn't easy year in and year out, just the grind of it and everything that you have to fight through, he said. So to see him come here and really just jump right into the system and the Patriot Way, and get to playoff game, and get to an AFC championship and now to a Super Bowl — I'm just very happy for him.\n\nIt's also helped that Long's the healthiest he's been in three seasons.\n\nSelected second overall in the 2008 draft, Long appeared in 16 games each of his first six seasons in the league.\n\nThat changed in 2014 when he missed all but six games following left ankle surgery. He returned in 2015, but a right knee injury caused him to miss a total of four games.\n\nAt age 30, it looked like Long's opportunities would be finite entering free agency. But a call from Bill Belichick just a few weeks shy of his 31st birthday changed everything.\n\nThe Patriots had just traded edge rusher Chandler Jones and were in the market for a capable replacement.\n\nWith teams possibly scared away because of Long injury issues, New England was able to sign him to a bargain one-year, $2.3 million deal.\n\nBut Long saw it as maybe his last chance to make a meaningful postseason run.\n\nFor me, playing in an AFC championship was, on a scale from 1 to 10, a 12 for me. So I'm already in the extra numbers, he said. It's all far beyond anything that I've done before. So, I feel like I'll be all right.\n\nDefensive coordinator Matt Patricia said Long's willingness to rotate between both linebacker and end has made him an asset.\n\nI think he has enjoyed the process and...has been a guy that's out there working really hard every day to get better and play hard for his teammates, Patricia said. And that's all you can really ask for.\n\nLong said he's planning to take in every morsel of football he has left this season.\n\nAny player that's been through ups and downs, and everybody in this league has— injuries, whatever, he said. Things can change quickly, and luckily I never gave up on it.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower
WASHINGTON – The killing of powerful Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani prompted fears of violence and chaos across the Middle East as national security experts warned it could galvanize Iran's proxy forces against the United States and put a target on Americans across the globe.\n\nAlready, Iran has threatened revenge, world leaders have expressed alarm, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been working the State Department phone lines to reassure and rally unnerved American allies. Soleimani led Iran's elite military force and was the country's second most influential figure.\n\nThe entire world will need to be on high alert for months or, more likely, years, said Jon Alterman, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an expert on global security.\n\nIran will respond by forcing itself to the forefront of U.S. foreign policy considerations for years to come and drawing the United States into precisely the sort of shadowy battles the Pentagon has been trying to escape for more than a decade, Alterman said in a CSIS analysis posted Friday.\n\n'I want to have peace.':How Trump went from a vow to avoid conflict to an order to kill Iran general\n\nPompeo insisted the U.S. airstrike would make Americans safer, reduce Iran's influence across the Middle East and lessen tensions.\n\nBut that view was not widely shared as policymakers in the U.S. and across the world came to grips with the Trump administration's surprise decision to launch the strike, which killed Soleimani on Iraqi soil. The attack came after a months-long tit-for-tat escalation between the U.S. and Iran, with the latest episode unfolding earlier this week at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad when pro-Iranian protesters stormed the compound.\n\nNow, despite President Donald Trump's promise to pull back from far-flung military engagements, he has ordered another 3,000 American soldiers to the Middle East. Many fear they will be drawn further into costly and hard-to-win conflicts across the region.\n\nI fear we've lit a fire without an extinguisher on hand, said Benjamin Friedman, policy director for Defense Priorities, which advocates restraint in U.S. military policy.\n\nWhether Thursday's attack will lead to a full-blown war with Iran, or a shadow conflict waged by Iran's proxy forces, is not clear.\n\nTrump talks about ending the endless wars and leaving the Middle East. In reality, he may have just started another endless and unwinnable war and ensured that America will remain trapped in the Middle East for decades to come, said Trita Parsi, an Iran specialist and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, which advocates diplomacy over military engagement.\n\nBut Parsi said proxy forces Soleimani nurtured into lethal militias from Syria to Iraq may pose the biggest risk for the U.S. Those groups aren't always under Tehran's direct control, so even if both Washington and Tehran seek de-escalation, they may not be able to ensure that others don't add fuel to the fire, Parsi said.\n\nQasem Soleimani:The Pentagon had tracked Iranian general for years before he was killed\n\nIran saw Soleimani as 'untouchable'\n\nMark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute that supports a hardline on Iran, said he would never discount the possibility of war, but Iran is more likely to opt for a less dramatic, if still forceful, response.\n\nThey do not want to confront the United States military, he said. And Iran's leaders are reeling from Thursday's attacks, shocked by Trump's willingness to authorize such a bold operation.\n\nThey thought Soleimani was untouchable and he operated in that kind of brazen way, he said.\n\nSoleimani's playbook, Dubowitz noted, had been to use its proxy militias and radical cells to inflict as much damage as they can on U.S. interests and allies, without leaving too many fingerprints.\n\nHow we got here:Qasem Soleimani's killing is the latest in Iran-US tensions\n\n'First and foremost': Threats to Americans in Iraq\n\nDubowitz and others said Iraq is likely to bear the brunt of the revenge Iran vowed. The Iranians already have militia groups there, and Iran wields political influence there as well. Some Iraqi leaders are already clamoring for U.S. accountability – and the end of America's military presence in Iraq – in the wake of Thursday's attack, which occurred at Baghdad's airport.\n\nThe smartest play for them is not to kill Americans but to drive us out of Iraq, Dubowitz said. I think that would be the fulfillment of Soleimani's lifelong ambition.\n\nBut others said Americans in Iraq, and elsewhere in the region, will almost certainly be targeted and drawn into the violence. Friedman noted the U.S. strikes killed not only Soleimani, but also Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi who served as the deputy commander of an Iran-backed militia organization known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\nHe's a high-ranking guy in Iraq who has a lot of well-armed people who reported to him, Friedman said.\n\nHe and others said American troops and diplomats stationed in Iraq are now extremely vulnerable to attacks from Iranian-backed militia groups operating there.\n\nFirst and foremost this involves threats to the American Embassy in Baghdad, to American military personnel in Iraq, and civilians in Iraq, Thomas Warrick, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and a former counter-terrorism official with the Department of Homeland Security, said during a conference call on Friday.\n\nThat's why the State Department issued an alert Friday advising all American citizens to leave Iraq immediately, Warrick said.\n\nHe said Iran is likely to retaliate against the U.S. but not with a military strike.\n\nIt would not surprise me if Iran was trying to carry out cyber-attacks against US targets right now, Warrick said. He added that while Iran's ability to carry out quick, large-scale military attacks is limited, the country's cyber capabilities have increased enormously over the past decade.\n\nUS protests:Protests planned across US to condemn Trump administration actions in Iraq, Iran\n\nPompeo: World is a 'much safer place'\n\nKirsten Fontenrose, who was Trump's national security adviser for Gulf affairs until November 2018, said that while Pompeo and others may be touting the possibility of de-escalation, no one inside the White House believes that's the path Iran will choose.\n\nShe said there's likely a scramble inside the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House right now on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, the White House will be working on a package of intelligence it can share with U.S. allies to demonstrate what Pompeo called the imminent threat that Soleimani posed to American assets and personnel.\n\nAt the State Department, Pompeo has already been calling U.S. allies in the Middle East and Europe. Fontenrose said he's likely trying to gauge their willingness to help the U.S. with any possible retaliation from Iran and exchange intelligence about Iran's possible next move.\n\nThese are going to be tough conversations, she noted.\n\nIran's ambassador to UN:'The response for a military action is military action'\n\nAt the Pentagon, Defense officials will be reviewing and drafting contingency plans for possible Iranian attacks, with the hope of trying to get in front of that and be ready for it.\n\nPompeo told CNN on Friday that the U.S. was already bracing for Iranian blowback.\n\nWe've anticipated a wide range of possible responses and we have done our level best under the direct guidance of the president to prepare for all of those possibilities, Pompeo said.\n\nPompeo said Soleimani was actively plotting in the region to take actions – a big action, as he described it – that would have put dozens, if not hundreds, of American lives at risk.\n\nHe declined to be more specific or disclose the intelligence information that suggested such an imminent attack. The world's a much safer place today, Pompeo said. I can assure you that Americans in the region are much safer today after the demise of Qasem Soleimani.
Florida's child welfare chief announced Tuesday that in response to a USA TODAY investigation, the Florida Department of Children and Families will establish specialized teams to investigate child abuse allegations against foster parents and to review the agency's decisions in those cases.\n\nIn a meeting with the Florida Senate's Children, Families and Elder Affairs Committee in Tallahassee, DCF Secretary Chad Poppell confirmed USA TODAY's findings and said his department assessed its handling of the heartbreaking cases of child sexual abuse at the hands of foster parents that the series brought to light.\n\nI won't belabor the point, the quality of the work was poor. We did a bad job, Poppell said, adding that a quality assurance team has since analyzed DCF's choices at every step in the process. Each one of those (cases) may have a dozen decision points along the way. The overall review indicated in those cases, roughly half the time on all those decisions, we made the wrong one.\n\nUSA TODAY's two-part investigation, published in October and December, revealed that after Florida lawmakers rewrote the state's child welfare rules in 2014 to make it easier to seize children from their parents, thousands of kids flooded the foster care system. Faced with a shortage of foster parents, DCF sent some children to live in unsafe homes where they were physically and sexually abused.\n\nThe series also highlighted how DCF blames mothers who are battered by an intimate partner and takes away their children. Some of the mothers believe their children were abused in foster care. Poppell indicated that a quality assurance team is reviewing the agency's actions in the mothers' cases.\n\nMore:Florida took thousands of kids from families, then failed to keep them safe.\n\nMore:Florida blames mothers when men batter them – then takes away their children\n\nIn the fiscal year 2019-20, there were 92 children with allegations of sexual abuse involving foster parents, Poppell said, yet only six were verified – even though 70% of the allegations were made by credible sources, a group that includes professionals such as teachers, physicians and law enforcement personnel.\n\nTo prevent future missteps, DCF will expand its Crisis Incident Rapid Response Team, originally established to investigate child deaths, to evaluate the agency's work in cases that involve accusations of sexual abuse against foster parents, Poppell said. Experts will review those cases, offer corrective feedback and provide a recommendation on whether a child should be returned to a home where abuse was alleged.\n\nThe department also will establish a Special Investigation Unit to look into all allegations of child maltreatment in foster and group homes and by staffers at DCF and its contracted agencies.\n\nPoppell told lawmakers there are a million great things that happen in the system every day, but noted that the newspaper investigation prompted the department to revisit some of its policies.\n\nI think the article highlighted this appropriately, and we need to respond, he said.\n\nFollowing the publication of USA TODAY's investigation, Sen. Lauren Book, a Democrat from Plantation and the committee chair, wrote Poppell to express her alarm that children were subjected to abuse that could have been avoided.\n\nThe USA TODAY investigative series will serve as a blueprint for me to follow in examining these issues, Book wrote.\n\nHer letter suggested a zero-tolerance policy for placing children in homes where abuse has been credibly alleged or suspected and asked that the state race at 'breakneck' speed to follow up with children who had spent time with foster parents suspected of abuse.\n\nI just want to make it clear – young children when they disclose abuse, they don't lie, Book said at Tuesday's meeting. These are pieces of information that they cannot make up unless they've had to live through or endure (them).\n\nPoppell's presentation confirmed that when Florida changed its approach to child welfare, the agency's investigations into biological families became more intensive, took longer to complete and absolutely resulted in an increase of kids in foster care.\n\nThe goal wasn't to get more children in care, it was obviously to make sure children were safer, Poppell said.\n\nYet by 2017, the state needed space for 6,000 more foster kids, USA TODAY's investigation found. Foster care agencies crammed kids into overcrowded homes and sent nearly 200 to foster parents previously accused of abusing or neglecting the kids in their care. DCF also failed to address biological parents' lack of access to drug treatment, mental health care, or domestic violence services – the root problems driving child removals.\n\nThe number of children removed from their parents each month has fallen back down to pre-2014 levels but remains higher than the national average, Poppell said. Abuse of children in foster care has been in decline since 2007, and Florida's numbers are below the federal target.\n\nBut department officials should be more in tune with what's happening to kids in the agency's care, he said. DCF shouldn't be finding out about these things in the newspaper.

AP\n\nTOKYO (AP) — Board members at the club that will host the 2020 Olympic golf tournament failed to make a decision about changing their policy of excluding women as full members.\n\nThe Kasumigaseki Country Club came under scrutiny recently when the International Olympic Committee inquired about the club's membership practice. The issue surfaced in mid-January when Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike urged Kasumigaseki to admit women as full members.\n\nThe club's board of directors convened a meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday to discuss the issue but didn't reach any conclusions.\n\nAll 15 board members have to agree to change the club's by-laws. Kiichi Kimura, the chairman of the board, expressed bewilderment at the predicament.\n\nWe discussed how we should respond after we ask our members how they feel, Kimura said. It's extremely annoying the situation has evolved into what it is so quickly. Right now, we're confused.\n\nFounded in 1929 as a private club funded by about 300 wealthy men, Kasumigaseki is one of the oldest and most prestigious clubs in the country and has hosted more top level tournaments than any other Japanese course.\n\nTo join Kasumigaseki, an applicant needs to obtain a reference from a current member and pay 8 million yen ($70,800) to become a regular member first, then pay additional 4 million yen ($35,400) to be a full member.\n\nThe club does not allow women to become full members or play on Sundays. Only full members can play any day of the week.
AP\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina guard Sindarius Thornwell is ready for a week like few others in his college career.\n\nHe knows if the 24th-ranked Gamecocks can make it through No. 19 Florida at home on Wednesday night and at No. 5 Kentucky on Saturday, it should go a long way in determining if they can challenge for the top of the Southeastern Conference and gain their first NCAA Tournament berth since 2004.\n\nThere's a lot of motivation right now, Thornwell said. We understand it's a big week and we've got a big opportunity ahead of us. We'll be more focused and more prepared than ever.\n\nEspecially with the chance to take early control of the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThe Gamecocks (14-3, 4-0 SEC) are among three teams undefeated in league play with Kentucky (15-2) and Florida (14-3) the others, both 5-0.\n\nI think the guys will be excited, Gamecocks coach Frank Martin said.\n\nIt's been a season of runs for South Carolina centered about Thornwell's presence on the court.\n\nThe Gamecocks opened 7-0 including wins over ranked opponents in Michigan and Syracuse to enter the rankings. But when Thornwell, their 6-foot-5 senior, was suspended on Dec. 4 for an undisclosed violation of athletic department policy, South Carolina showed cracks in its cohesiveness.\n\nThe Gamecocks went 3-3 without Thornwell — the losses coming to NCAA Tournament hopefuls Seton Hall, Clemson and Memphis — and lacked a steadying hand to pull them through in difficult situations.\n\nBut Thornwell was reinstated before league play began earlier this month and has revitalized the team. He has led South Carolina in scoring (16.8 points) and rebounding (7.8) in their four SEC wins along with having 17 of the team's 40 steals so far in conference play.\n\nMartin said playing hard has been a hallmark of his team much of the season and does not expect his players to approach the Gators and Wildcats much differently than they have the rest of their schedule.\n\nYou don't play as hard as we do without being excited for every game, Martin said.\n\nThornwell and the Gamecocks carry the motivation of last year's NCAA near miss. South Carolina finished with a program best 24 wins in the regular season and went 11-7 in SEC play, just its fourth season of double-digit league wins in 25 conference seasons.\n\nBut South Carolina was edged out of the field of 68, even getting an inadvertent text from an NCAA staffer about its inclusion before it was corrected and disappointment set in.\n\nWe don't want to feel that way again, Thornwell says.\n\nSouth Carolina's surge is built on defense. The Gamecocks lead the SEC in points allowed (59.2 points per game) this season and Thornwell, last year's SEC defensive player of the year, leads in steals during conference play.\n\nThornwell said mastering Martin's defensive concepts is a task in itself that does not always come easily. It used to be that when the man you're guarding passed the ball, Thornwell said, you could get a few moments of rest and re-engage once your guy got back into the play or a shot went up. Under Martin, the Gamecocks must stay in line pressuring their man and defending hard without the ball in sight.\n\nIt's like re-learning basketball, Thornwell said.\n\nMartin won't have much to say to pump up his team this week.

Adam Shell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve breaks from its two-day meeting today at 2 p.m. ET, one Wall Street pro is hoping the Fed's policy statement walks back Jan. 6 comments from Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer suggesting that four interest rate hikes this year from the U.S. central bank was still in the ballpark.\n\nFour rate hikes may simply be too aggressive given the rough start to 2016.\n\nIndeed, with the U.S. stock market off to one of its worst starts in history, oil prices wildly volatile, China fears still reverberating and growth worries on the rise, Wall Street is seriously second-guessing whether now really is the right time for the Fed to hike rates at the pace it has hinted at since mid-December when it raised short-term rates for the first time since 2006.\n\nFed likely to keep rate-hike options open\n\nPhil Orlando, chief investment strategist at Federated Investors, says there is now a zero chance the Fed will tighten four times in 2016. He and the rest of Wall Street expect no change in short-term rates, currently pegged at 0.25% to 0.50%, today.\n\nHe believes Wednesday's policy statement from the Fed is the time to let markets know they acknowledge the fresh headwinds and that they will adjust policy accordingly.\n\nWe believe (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen has to use the policy statement to try to reset expectations on Fischer's comments, which were bearish for markets, Orlando told USA TODAY.\n\nOrlando says the Yellen-led Fed, as it did last fall when it opted not to hike rates due to international turbulence and market volatility, should send a similar message today, and state it would be inappropriate for the Fed to be aggressive in raising rates until the outlook improves, he adds.\n\nI believe the Fed will take a more cautious, dovish, data-dependent approach to the rate cycle for the course of the year, Orlando says.

Do we need another version of this? Is there a reason for it to exist?\n\nThose are the questions that come to mind whenever yet another reboot, remake or revival comes along in TV or film. Is this new crack at something old bringing anything to the table that we haven't seen before? Is it doing justice to a story that may have already been told perfectly well? Is it saying anything about the time we live in now?\n\nFreeform's new Gen Z version of 1990s touchstone Party of Five (premiering Wednesday, 10 EST/PST, ★★½ out of four) aims, at least, to find a story that the original series couldn't have told. It's focused on immigration policy, a popular subject among talking heads on cable news and the president on Twitter.\n\nThe new series, created by original writers Christopher Keyser and Amy Lippman, alters the script – in which five kids were orphaned – and instead makes its quintet of whippersnappers fend for themselves after their parents are deported to Mexico.\n\nThis switch is the series' big hook, and at times Party feels absolutely vital, with smart writing and affecting performances to back up its weighty premise. But at other times, the series lacks depth and nuance in expanding its story beyond deportation, and the writers struggle to make the characters more than stereotypes.\n\nMore:Winter TV preview: 10 excellent new shows that will keep you warm and happy\n\nThe Acosta family lives in Los Angeles where parents Javier (Bruno Bichir) and Gloria (Fernanda Urrejola) run a neighborhood Mexican restaurant. They have, as you might expect, five kids: Eldest son Emilio (Brandon Larracuente), 24, is trying to make it as a musician; 16-year-old twins Beto (Niko Guardado) and Lucia (Emily Tosta) are a contrast, one a struggling student, the other a star pupil; seventh grader Valentina (Elle Paris Legaspi) is precocious math whiz; and baby Rafa, not even old enough yet to walk or speak.\n\nTheir lives are chugging along just fine until ICE comes calling to the restaurant one day. The parents are taken into custody, and weeks of hearings and all the lawyers the kids can buy can't stop the deportation.\n\nParty aims to show the effect of immigration policy, and it doesn't pull any emotional punches. The show tackles an issue not often discussed in popular culture, which gives the new series just enough novelty to stand apart from the original, which aired on Fox from 1994-2000. With the parents only a Skype video chat away, the Acosta kids' situation is vastly different than the Salingers', and the parents provide new story potential. .\n\nBut while it's successful at showing the pain and trauma the children and their parents face, its portrayal of the hot-button immigration issue feels painfully generic. DACA, the now-threatened Obama-era program offering relief from deportation and allowing beneficiaries to work in the U.S. legally with a SSN, is name-checked constantly without being fully explained, and immigration law terms are thrown around, but none of it is grounded.\n\nThe four oldest Acosta kids also feel more like stock personalities than well-formed characters, at least in the first three episodes made available for review. They are defined by their deportation plight, but don't have much dimension beyond that. Lucia is a good girl who rebels in response to her parents' deportation, Emilio is the dashing artist and Valentina the too-cute little genius. But the circumstances surrounding the kids are often far more interesting than the characters.\n\nThere is potential for Party to deepen and grow in subsequent episodes, but the series might not have enough material to sustain itself. Party might have a reason to exist, but it needs a reason to keep going, too.
Amanda L. Tyler\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nEditor's note: This column originally ran in January when the Supreme Court agreed to review President Trump's travel ban. The court heard arguments on the case Wednesday.\n\nFighting to reinstate its travel ban, the Trump administration told the Supreme Court that the lower courts blocking it had overridden the president's judgments on sensitive matters of national security and foreign relations, and severely restricted the ability of this and future presidents to protect the nation.\n\nThe argument that the judiciary should defer to the executive branch on matters of national security is not a new one, and it has a long track record of success.\n\nNonetheless, now that the court has agreed to review the latest version of the ban, that argument should give the court pause. An earlier episode in U.S. history suggests why.\n\nIn February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. In the months that followed, military regulations imposed curfews on Japanese Americans in the western United States, required their evacuation, and ultimately mandated their detention in relocation centers.\n\nThese policies led to the involuntary detention of more than 120,000 persons of Japanese ancestry — including at least 70,000 U.S. citizens — for an average stay of three years.\n\nMore:The 9/11 memorial is a powerful antidote to Trump and his vision for America\n\nMore:Asians were 'refuse and dregs' in the 1880s. Is that how Trump sees Africans?\n\nSince then, presidents and Congress have made apologies and declared that we have a collective responsibility to ensure that history never repeats itself. Meanwhile, government studies concluded that there was no factual basis for the fears of widespread disloyalty cited as justification for the policies. But everyone knew that then, and legal advisers were counseling the president that many of the proposed policies were unconstitutional.\n\nIndeed, at the time of World War II, although the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on equal protection had not evolved to where it applied to the federal government, there were separate — and widely acknowledged — constitutional problems with the internment that many recognized. Specifically, Attorney General Francis Biddle and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, both Harvard-trained lawyers, counseled that the detention of U.S. citizens would clearly violate the Constitution's Suspension Clause.\n\nThat clause guarantees that the privilege of the writ ofhabeas corpus may not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. The habeas privilege had long been understood to mean that in the absence of a valid suspension, the government could not detain citizens and others arguably protected by domestic law without filing criminal charges. President Lincoln even believed that a suspension was necessary to detain Confederate soldiers who waged war against the Union.\n\nRoosevelt nonetheless issued 9066 and in it granted the military, in the words of one senior War Department official, carte blanche to do what it wanted. When legal challenges to the military regulations eventually spilled into the courts, the Supreme Court deferred extensively to executive branch assertions that such policies were necessary for national security. First, the court upheld the military's curfew and exclusion regulations in the Hirabayashi and Korematsu cases, and even called into question the ability of Japanese Americans to assimilate into American society.\n\nThen, when a direct challenge to the internment came before the court in Ex parte Endo, the court did rule against the government — but its opinion did not even discuss the important constitutional issues at stake. Instead, it narrowly interpreted the relevant military regulations in a way that misunderstood those issues. The court then held up its decision until after the 1944 election and tipped off the White House so that it could pre-empt the decision by announcing the closing of the camps.\n\nMore:Despite Trump's bigotry, America needs more African immigrants\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nWhat happened during World War II suggests that judicial deference to the executive on national security matters — even in wartime — can be very dangerous. It likewise counsels that internal checks within the political branches can fail when concerns over national security may overrun constitutional considerations. After all, in sanctioning and later defending the military policies directed at Japanese Americans, government actors ignored the legal advice of key advisers within the executive branch as well as the recognition of many prominent officials — including no less than FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover — that the factual basis for the military regulations that followed under 9066 was dubious.\n\nMore generally, the lessons of World War II raise fundamental questions about the judicial role in a constitutional democracy. By deferring to the government in the Hirabayashi and Korematsu cases, the court announced decisions that we now routinely teach to law students as the embarrassments that they are. But none of the decisions has been overruled, leaving as their larger and inescapable legacy a historical precedent sanctioning racial and ethnic discrimination among our ranks, gutting the Suspension Clause, and upholding a policy of mass incarceration under military auspices.\n\nThese events should prove a cautionary tale. As the Supreme Court reviews the latest iteration of the travel ban, it bears remembering that its deference to the executive during World War II and unwillingness to confront the constitutional problems raised by the Japanese-American internment led the court down a path that we now view as anything but its finest hour.\n\nPerhaps it is times like these that Alexander Hamilton had in mind when he anticipated that on occasion we will need an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution.\n\nAmanda L.

Catherine Lucey\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWASHINGTON – Ivanka Trump is set to launch a White House effort aimed at women's global economic empowerment in early 2019.\n\nA formal launch for the initiative was planned for next week but has been postponed amid uncertainty about the government shutdown, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe original plan for the event included remarks from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and officials from a host of government agencies, financial organizations and private businesses, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Walmart and Bank of America.\n\nThe initiative, which is backed by the State Department and the National Security Council, seeks to align government agencies behind the mission of supporting women's economic development around the world. It will also include private-sector investment.\n\nMore:Uber employees' feelings about the company revealed in leaked worker survey\n\nMore:As 2018 winds down, here are some of USA TODAY's favorite video games of the year\n\nMore:Mega Millions New Year's Day jackpot jumps to $425M\n\nFirst daughter Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser who has made supporting women in business part of her portfolio, led the policy process over the past year and a half.\n\nI look forward to continuing to work with the interagency and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to advance women's access to vocational training, fuel female entrepreneurship and lift legal and social barriers that restrict our full and free economic participation, Ivanka Trump said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nBolton said in a statement that the initiative directly supports President Trump's National Security Strategy.\n\nIvanka Trump previously led an effort to launch a World Bank fund to help drive women's entrepreneurship. She recently advocated for the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, which has passed Congress. That legislation bolsters efforts focused on women by the United States Agency for International Development.
AP\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Linebacker D'Qwell Jackson became the first cost-cutting loss of the Indianapolis Colts' offseason.\n\nHe probably won't be the last.\n\nNew general manager Chris Ballard made his first significant move Thursday, releasing the 33-year-old defensive signal-caller as the Colts attempt to rebuild their struggling defense.\n\nD'Qwell is a consummate professional, coach Chuck Pagano said in a release issued by team officials. The way he approaches the game is second to none. His leadership and mentorship provided a valuable example for the younger players on this team. We are grateful for all of his contributions to the organization and wish him the best.\n\nJackson was a three-year starter for the Colts and had one year remaining on the four-year contract he signed in 2014.\n\nHe led the team in tackles in each of his first two seasons and finished second last season despite being suspended the final four games for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing substance policy.\n\nBut releasing Jackson will save Indy $5.5 million under the salary cap and will allow to either bring in a younger player with more upside or go with two players, Edwin Jackson and Antonio Morrison, who filled in after Jackson was suspended.\n\nIt's a decision that could be a precursor of what's to come.\n\nFranchise sacks leader Robert Mathis already has announced his retirement. Linebackers Trent Cole and Erik Walden and safety Mike Adams, all in their 30s, could become free agents next month. And if Ballard releases oft-injured defensive lineman Art Jones and cornerback Patrick Robinson, the Colts could clear another $7.6 million.\n\nIf all of those moves occur, Ballard would have an opportunity to turn one of the league's older defenses into one of the younger ones virtually overnight.\n\nWhen Ballard was introduced to local reporters on Jan. 30, he made it clear that's where he intends to focus initially.\n\nDefense wins championships, he said. That definitely is a priority and that's probably why I have such respect for Chuck because he is a defensive head coach.\n\nJackson was Cleveland's second-round draft pick in 2006 and played seven seasons with the Browns before joining the Colts.\n\nHe leaves the Colts with career totals of 1,219 tackles, 19 1/2 sacks, seven interceptions, 13 fumble recoveries and one touchdown.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
AP\n\nHONOLULU (AP) — Patton Kizzire took longer than expected to reach the PGA Tour, but he figures every step was a learning experience. That includes his first victory, which came at Mayakoba, his six-hole playoff win at the Sony Open last year and even one of the more embarrassing moments last year.\n\nHe played with Tiger Woods for the first time. Kizzire was so nervous on the opening tee shot at the Honda Classic that he hooked it into a palmetto bush and had to go back to the tee. He had rounds of 74-78 to miss the cut.\n\nRight there at the top, he said Tuesday. At the time, I don't realize how good it is for me, but things that get me so excited I can hardly even perform and what makes me better. That was one of them. ... As painful as they are, those help.\n\nHe had been a fan of Woods for as long as he could remember, and appreciated that he was the biggest star in golf by some margin.\n\nWatching on TV was one thing. Being announced to him on the tee was different.\n\nI'll feel more comfortable next time I play with him, Kizzire said. I had a funny Instagram post after I played with him. It was like a first date with Tiger. I was pretty nervous, but soon I'll be farting in front of him.\n\nKAPALUA CHANGES\n\nThe Plantation course at Kapalua might look the same when Xander Schauffele returns next year to defend his title.\n\nBut it probably won't play the same.\n\nKapalua is shutting down the course next month for Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw to begin a restoration project that will include a new surface, new greens, bunkers, pretty much everything from tee-to-green.\n\nEvery single item on the golf course will be touched, said Alex Nakajima, general manager for golf and tennis at Kapalua.\n\nCoore was delighted to hear the grass Kapalua chose is Celebration Bermuda, which he said was key to making the Plantation course play how it's intended — fast. The last several years, the course has played soft. Previously, the 4-iron Gary Woodland hit into the 18th green would not have stopped rolling until it was on the green. Coore recalls telling one resort guest years ago to hit a club he normally hits 150 yards to the seventh green, even though he had 250 yards. It rolled to the green.\n\nMark Rolfing, a TV golf analyst who has lived at Kapalua from the start, summed it up best.\n\nFor the average player, the course has become much harder, he said. For the best players in the world, the course has become much easier.\n\nWork is expected to be finished about two months before the Sentry Tournament of Champions starts.\n\nWORLD RANKING\n\nUnder the revamped scoring system at the Tour Championship this year, the top player in the FedEx Cup starts the tournament at 10-under par, with the second player at 8 under and on down until the last five players in the 30-man field starts at even.\n\nSo the winner of the Tour Championship — and the FedEx Cup — might not have the best score that week.\n\nOne problem is what to do about world ranking points because of the staggered start.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan says he can imagine the Tour Championship getting ranking points. If I imagine it in general, I think it will, he said.\n\nThe tour already has presented a proposal to the Official World Golf Ranking board, and a decision could come as early as April.\n\nOne scenario that makes the most sense is to keep score where everyone starts even, like a regular tournament, and award points accordingly.\n\nTHE DROP\n\nMore than leaving the flagstick in for putts on the green, the one new rule that got plenty of chatter in the first tournament of the year was the knee-length drop.\n\nA bit absurd, Bryson DeChambeau said.\n\nThe question is how much attention it gets in a month.\n\nThe reason for the change from shoulder length was to get the ball in play. The original proposal was to drop it an inch above the ground, which was changed to eliminate any questions whether the ball was dropped or placed. Some rules experts felt it was important to retain a randomness of the drop.\n\nThe trouble at Kapalua was how it looked, with players at times looking like ballerinas trying to make sure the drop was level to their knees.\n\nI think the optics will become more comfortable over time, said Thomas Pagel, senior managing director of governance for the USGA. Think about what it was like at first when we went to shoulder height instead of dropping it over the back.\n\nUPHILL WALK\n\nFor the first time since 1999 at Kapalua, players had to walk the steep hill to the fourth fairway at the Sentry Tournament of Champions. Previously, they were given rides in carts to the crest of the hill.\n\nWhy the change?\n\nFor starters, it has to do with a tour policy of only one person in a cart for insurance reasons. That's why the tour has four- and six-seat carts handy whenever there is a playoff. Mostly, however, it was because there were not enough carts to go around.\n\nMost of the carts were used for the long shuttle between the ninth green and the 10th tee, not so much for players and caddies but the players' friends and relatives who wanted rides, along with the walking scorer, standard-bearer and other support staff.\n\nAmazingly, no one pulled a hamstring.\n\nEqually amazing is why the players were given rides up the hill in the first place. It was in 2000, and described by one PGA Tour executive as a pace of play issue (with a 30-man field), and the same year the PGA Tour was fighting a federal lawsuit by Casey Martin by saying that walking was an integral aspect of golf.\n\nJUSTIN STAYS PUT\n\nDustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka are among those playing in Abu Dhabi next week, just like Rickie Fowler, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods have in previous years. It's a strong field, with appearance money as the main attraction. That's the reward for great golf.\n\nIt's just not appealing yet to Justin Thomas.\n\nSince cracking the top 10 in the world, Thomas has played only one time overseas except for PGA Tour-sanctioned events. The exception was the French Open last summer at Le Golf National, site of the Ryder Cup in the fall.\n\nI didn't get a dime to go to France last year, Thomas said. It worked in the schedule because I didn't want to take three weeks off. And it would have been a big deal to win a European Tour event, something I haven't done. I knew it was going to be a good field. World ranking points, there would be a fair amount. And it was an opportunity to go to France and check out the golf course.\n\nThomas said he has received plenty of offers to go elsewhere. He just hasn't found the money to fit with his goals.\n\nIt's nice to get a good check, he said. But I don't go to tournaments to get a check. The most important thing for me is to make sure I'm ready and fresh to win tournaments.\n\nDIVOTS\n\nRod Spittle and college golf coach Herb Page have been selected for induction into the Canadian Hall of Fame. ... The Web.com Tour added another event to its schedule with the Dormie Network Classic, to be held April 25-28 at Briggs Ranch Golf Club in San Antonio. ... The PGA Tour has expanded its agreement with Twitter to distribute 140 hours of live competition from PGA Tour Live. The agreement allows the first 60 to 90 minutes from morning hours of all four rounds on PGA Tour Live.\n\nSTAT OF THE WEEK\n\nSeven of the top 10 players in the world ranking are in their 20s.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\nIt does reflect on my career how this goes. — Padraig Harrington, a three-time major champion on being chosen Ryder Cup captain for Europe.
Dan Caplinger\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nOver the weekend, headlines abounded about how the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) and S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) had their worst-ever start to a year last week. In the face of near-hysteria, many investors could use some perspective to put last week's drop into broader context. Below, you'll find a list of 11 simple reasons not to panic about the stock market's losses.\n\n1. In the long run, a 6% drop is just a blip. The decline the stock market suffered last week, seen in the context of its longer-term performance since 2007, barely registers.\n\n2. Declines like this happen all the time. On average throughout history, 10% declines in the markets have happened about every 11 months. Yet the stock market has continued its inexorable march upward over the decades.\n\n3. Markets recover — often quickly. The same panicked reactions happened last August, when a similar event in China sent U.S. stocks down more than 10%. By November, the S&P had recovered back to where it had traded before the drop. You won't always see such a kneejerk reaction, but historically, even the largest market crashes have eventually given way to new all-time records for the Dow and S&P.\n\n4. Falling markets make future gains more likely. Overall, based on stock market history, the odds that the S&P 500 will be lower five years from now are about 20%, or one out of five. After even just a 5% drop, the odds of losing money decline, making it a better time to invest rather than a worse time.\n\n5. The market's best days have historically followed substantial drops. In 2015, both the Dow's best day and the S&P 500's best day came in the aftermath of the August decline. Those who panic-sold after the declines missed out — and likely didn't manage to get their money back into the market until after stocks had recovered even further.\n\n6. Calendar-driven thinking is irrational. One big reason why the market's drop is getting so much attention is that it's coming at the beginning of the year. It's another example of how too great a focus on annual performance can distort investor perception. The fundamental prospects for companies aren't tied to the calendar year, so your expectations about stock-price movements shouldn't be either.\n\n7. The market first hit this level in May 2014. Even after the decline, the stock market has only given up gains from about a year and a half. From 2009 to mid-2014, the S&P 500 nearly tripled. Overall, markets typically haven't tripled even over seven-year periods.\n\n8. The best-performing stocks have routinely undergone big losses along the way. Look at the top-returning stocks over the past decade, and you'll find plenty of times when shares traded well below their best levels. To get truly large returns, you have to be willing to wait through large pullbacks.\n\n9. In the long run, stock returns go positive. There's been no 20-year period in which stocks have lost money. That's true even when you consider the impact of inflation on stock market returns.\n\n10. You don't have to time the market to be a successful investor. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging let you ease into the market, taking advantage of downturns to buy more shares on the cheap while also letting you get even better bargains in the future if the market keeps falling.\n\n11. There are stocks that you've wanted to buy for a long time. For years, investors have watched share prices go through the roof, making them too nervous to buy. Now, those shares are on sale. What are you waiting for?\n\nIt's easy to panic when the stock market goes down, especially when you see headlines everywhere telling you that you should. The best way to win at long-term investing is to embrace the counterarguments to that way of thinking. A long-term approach will serve you well as long as you have the time horizon and the discipline to stick it out.\n\nSPONSOR CONTENT: How 1 Man Made 100 Times His Money After Age 50\n\nSounds too good to be true, right?

USA TODAY Sports\n\nColorado Rockies shortstop Jose Reyes will stand trial in Hawaii on charges he abused his wife, the New York Daily News reported.\n\nReyes, 32, faces a likely suspension from Major League Baseball under its new domestic violence policy. His trial date is set for April 4 - the same day the Rockies open the 2016 season at Arizona - although it is possible Reyes and Maui County prosecutors reach a pre-trial agreement.\n\nIt's also possible MLB hands down punishment before then. The league enacted a domestic violence policy in September that stipulates it can punish players even in the absence of a criminal conviction. Reyes and New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman - who was investigated for an October fight with his girlfriend in Florida - are expected to be the first players disciplined under the new policy.\n\nReyes was arrested on Oct. 31 at a resort in Maui and charged with abuse of a family and/or household member. The Maui County police report alleged that Reyes and his wife, Katherine Ramirez, were involved in an argument that turned physical and resulted in injuries. Mrs. Reyes was treated by medics at the scene and later transported to the Maui Memorial Medical Center for further treatment.
Des Moines Register\n\nDES MOINES — CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, CNN political correspondent Abby Phillip and Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel will moderate Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines.\n\nIt will be the final debate before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, when the first votes are cast in the presidential nominating race. The debate, from 9 to 11 p.m. EST, will be held on the Drake University campus in Des Moines.\n\nFive candidates have qualified for the debate so far: former Vice President Joe Biden; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Other candidates have until the end of the day Friday to meet the donor and polling threshold requirements to qualify.\n\nCNN is hosting the debate in partnership with the Register, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n2020 candidates on the issues:Here's where they stand on climate change, gun violence, immigration and more\n\nAbout the moderators\n\nPfannenstiel joined the Register five years ago as a Statehouse reporter and was promoted to chief politics reporter in 2018. In the 2016 caucus cycle, she covered the campaigns of then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and businessman Donald Trump.\n\nIn the 2020 cycle, Pfannenstiel has broken national news and has authored an ongoing series, Three Counties, that explores how the counties of Clinton, Johnson and Polk may be key to winning Iowa, the nomination and, ultimately, the presidency.\n\nBrianne is a smart, diligent reporter who digs deeply into the players, issues and culture that shape Iowa's political landscape, said Register executive editor Carol Hunter. Her work as moderator will be informed not only by her knowledge of the caucus process but also by the perspectives of the hundreds of Iowans she has interviewed on the caucus trail in the past year.\n\nBefore coming to Iowa, Pfannenstiel covered politics and policy in Kansas and Missouri for five years. A Kansas native, she earned a journalism degree from the University of Kansas and lives in Des Moines.\n\nBlitzer, who has worked for CNN for 30 years, is the network's lead political anchor and the anchor of The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. In the last presidential campaign cycle, he served as moderator for Republican debates in Nevada and Texas and a Democratic debate in New York.\n\nBlitzer began his career with the Reuters News Agency. Known for his Middle East expertise, he was the Washington, D.C., correspondent for the Jerusalem Post for 15 years. He has interviewed notable world figures from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to former South African President Nelson Mandela and seven U.S. presidents. He has a history degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo and a master's in international relations from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nPhillip, who is based in Washington, D.C., when not on the campaign trail, joined the network in 2017 and served as White House correspondent through 2019. Phillip previously was a national political reporter for the Washington Post, covering the Trump White House, and reported on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. She also was a digital reporter for politics for ABC News and covered the Obama White House for Politico. Phillip has a degree in government from Harvard University.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the Iowa Democratic Party also are partnering on the debate. The DNC is handling tickets. Those interested in attending are asked to register their interest through a form on the DNC website. Applicants are advised that due to extreme interest and limited capacity the vast majority of requests are not able to be accommodated.\n\nThe DNC also has cautioned that the debate date could be moved if there is a conflict with the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.
Linda Burbank\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQuestion: Last summer, I traveled to Florida with my daughter and we rented a car from Avis. During the trip, we drove from Destin to Crestview, and crossed the Mid-Bay Bridge. We knew it had a $4 toll, and we paid it in cash, handing the money to an attendant rather than using an automated machine.\n\nAs we drove on, we saw a second sign further down that stated a second toll of $2 would be due. We gathered money to pay, but as we drove on we saw a sign saying something about using a SunPass or using a toll by plate. I was unsure what that meant. We kept waiting to see a toll plaza or some other kind of toll machine, but we never saw a way to pay the toll.\n\nA few weeks later, I got my credit card bill and noticed a charge from Avis for $13.85. I called Avis, and the representative told me it was a charge for a toll by plate in Florida. I explained that I had been ready to pay the toll but couldn't find anywhere to pay. Avis said they couldn't help me. I called the Florida department for toll roads and they said they couldn't do anything either.\n\nI didn't hear anything about this when I initially rented the car from Avis. Something is wrong when a $2 toll ends up costing $13.85. Can you do anything to help me?\n\n— Denise Kraemer, Tulsa\n\nAnswer: Kraemer was understandably irritated by the add-on toll payment fees to her rental bill, weeks after she returned the car. She's not alone: The Florida Attorney General's office has logged 192 toll-related complaints since January 2016.\n\nWe are addressing the bulk of these through ongoing negotiations with several major rental car companies that do business in Florida to ensure that the companies provide sufficient disclosures regarding the administrative fees they charge related to cashless tolls and give clear and complete information regarding cashless tolls, says Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nIn the meantime, visitors need to be aware that the Sunshine State uses cashless tolls — and protect themselves from what many say are excessive fees charged by rental companies for paying those tolls.\n\nDon't let the toll road slow you down\n\nFlorida has more than 700 miles of toll roads, more than any other state. Many stretches use electronic tolling, with drivers paying those tolls either via a toll-by-plate system, which reads cars' license plates and sends a monthly bill to registered owners in the mail, or by pinging transponders installed in the vehicles and deducting tolls from their accounts.\n\nAll-electronic tolling first went into effect on Florida's Turnpike in February 2011, when the southern 47 miles of the Turnpike Mainline in Miami was converted to a cashless system, according to Chad Huff of Florida's Turnpike Enterprise, a unit of the Florida Department of Transportation. Florida's Turnpike administers most, but not all, of the state's toll roads.\n\nAll-electronic tolling isn't exclusive to Florida; drivers encounter cashless roads and bridges across the U.S., including in California, Colorado, and New York, as well as countries around the world. The system certainly has its benefits: Cashless toll roads are faster and safer, since drivers don't get stuck in toll-plaza backups or need to fumble for change, raising the risk of accidents. In Florida, ever-increasing miles of road will use all-electronic tolling, as existing highways are retrofit to remove toll plazas. A decade ago, the Florida Department of Transportation mandated that all new toll roads must utilize cashless tolling.\n\nBut complaints crop up when visitors are caught unawares, blithely cruising down parkways with their toll payments in hand and baffled when there's no one to hand it to. These renters end up paying a premium. It's not usually the tolls themselves that garner consumer outrage — often individual tolls are less than $1 — but extra fees rental agencies slap on top of those tolls.\n\nKraemer incurred a $2 toll on the Spence Parkway, an 11-mile stretch of highway that connects to the Mid-Bay Bridge in the Florida Panhandle, but is tolled separately from the bridge itself. The tolls are collected by the Mid-Bay Bridge Authority. While the bridge itself still has booths where you can pay tolls in cash, the Spence Parkway does not; it's been all-electronic since 2015. Its open-road, all-electronic tolling means drivers can pay without stopping or even slowing down.\n\nKraemer could have paid the toll herself had she purchased a SunPass transponder beforehand. SunPass is the state's most widely used prepaid tolling program. For a short-term visitor like Kraemer, the SunPass mini sticker transponder is the cheapest and easiest option. The mini sticker is $4.99 and can be purchased online or at one of almost 5,000 retail locations including CVS, Walgreens and Publix. You must load it with $10 minimum for tolls. After your trip, you can close your account and request a refund check by mail from SunPass. The sticker goes on your rental car's windshield, and you remove it when returning the car. It's not reusable; it'll be destroyed when you peel it off. Repeat visitors might invest in portable SunPass transponder, which costs $19.99, plus $10 for the account minimum balance. As an incentive, SunPass customers pay lower tolls than cash customers, if cash is even an option.\n\nWithout a SunPass, Kraemer's rental car was charged a toll by plate, meaning the camera system on the Spence Parkway photographed her license plate and sent the bill to Avis. Like other rental car companies, Avis also has its own transponders in some cars in its fleet as well.\n\nKraemer ended up repaying Avis for that $2 Spence Parkway toll, plus an additional $3.95 per day for three days on top of that. Avis' policy allows for that daily charge with a monthly cap of $19.75 per month, plus toll charges, of course.\n\nThe same daily fees and monthly maximums are in place at Budget, National, Alamo and Enterprise. Payless rings in with a slightly lower daily fee of $2.95, with the same monthly fee cap. Hertz tacks on a little more, charging $4.95 per day, or a maximum of $24.75 per month.\n\nWith these rental car companies, drivers don't need to decide at the counter if they're going to use the company's toll-payment system. Once they trigger a toll, they're automatically opted-in for the rest of their rental, according to Avis representative Alice Pereira — and like Kraemer, they're charged a daily free from that point on regardless of whether they actually use additional toll roads.\n\nOpting in at the counter may not be such a bargain, either. At Dollar and Thrifty, drivers also have to buy the toll-payment option for their entire rentals, not just for days they need it. Dollar and Thrifty charge $10.49 per day, capped at $52.49 per week, for their all-inclusive tolling with PlatePass, which includes the actual tolls. That would have cost Kraemer quite a bit more than she paid Avis for her one jaunt down the parkway.\n\nIf you skip the daily fee but end up triggering a toll charge, the penalties are considerably higher. Dollar and Thrifty will hit you with an administrative fee of $15 per toll, up to $90 total, as well as the actual toll costs, according to representative Lauren Luster. Similarly, Fox charges $8.99 per day, with a maximum of $134.85 per 15-day rental, and it likewise pops travelers with a $15 per-toll infraction fee, up to $90 per rental agreement.\n\nRental car companies are required to disclose their toll-collection fees. But renters can miss the details; Kraemer said she had no idea about Avis' fees until she got her credit card statement. I sent her complaint to Avis. A company representative reached out to her and agreed to remove the $11.85 in fees from her bill, so she ended up paying for just the $2 toll.\n\nHow can you avoid trouble?\n\n• Plan your route to avoid tolls. Before you leave home, read up on whether you'll encounter all-electronic toll roads or bridges as part of your destination planning. On the road, you can direct Google Maps and other navigation programs to avoid toll roads, and see if alternate routes are feasible or ridiculous. Sometimes, though, it's just not possible to avoid tolls.\n\n• Figure out what your rental car company charges, since fees vary widely. The local toll authority's website might provide you with a comparative synopsis of the leading rental car companies' procedures and fees — information you might use to either pick your rental or plan your toll strategy.\n\n• If it's compatible, use your own transponder from home. Many states are moving towards interoperability. In Florida, motorists from Georgia and North Carolina can use their home state's tolling transponders, and other states will follow as necessary equipment is installed, according to Huff. Not all transponders will work: For now, the E-ZPass, accepted in 16 states across the Midwest and Northeast, cannot be used in Florida.\n\n• Buy your own transponder. Florida's SunPass makes it easy to buy before your trip, doesn't require a transponder deposit, and will refund your unused balance when you close your account. If you use your own, check to see if your rental has a transponder already installed, and switch it off.\n\n• Opt in to your rental car company's toll-payment system. This is the most expensive choice, but it is also the simplest. Find out if you need to opt in ahead of time to avoid hefty administrative fees.\n\nDo you have a travel consumer issue you'd like Traveler's Aide to pursue?

WASHINGTON —FBI Director Christopher Wray outlined a series of proposed reforms Friday aimed at bolstering public confidence in sensitive surveillance operations in wake of a damning report that revealed flaws in how the bureau handled wiretap applications for a former Trump campaign aide.\n\nIn a filing ordered by the chief judge of the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Wray pledged that the bureau would overhaul its training program for agents and lawyers to ensure that information used to support future surveillance applications is complete and properly vetted.\n\nThe plan comes more than a month after the Justice Department's inspector general identified 17 inaccuracies in requests to wiretap former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page in 2016 and 2017. The surveillance of Page, whom the FBI believed was conspiring with the Russian government, was conducted as the FBI investigated Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe FBI has the utmost respect for this court, and deeply regrets the errors and omissions identified by the (inspector general), Wray wrote, adding that the Justice watchdog's report described conduct that is unacceptable and unrepresentative of the FBI as an institution.\n\nTrump's response:Trump claims DOJ inspector general report shows 'attempted overthrow' of the government\n\nWray described the surveillance authority provided by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is approved by the court, as an indispensable tool in national security investigations.\n\nIn recognition of our duty of candor to the court and our responsibilities to the American people, the FBI is committed to working with the court and (Justice Department) to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the FISA process, Wray wrote.\n\nThe centerpiece of the training regimen, as outlined in the FBI filing, is the proposed creation of a case study based on the inspector general's findings in the Page surveillance applications. Wray ordered that the training program be created by April 30 and is requiring that all agents and lawyers who staff FISA complete the training by June 30.\n\nI am determined that operational personnel understand, holistically, what occurred during the activities reflected in the (inspector general's) report, and that, in addition, personnel working on FISA applications understand the importance of rigor during each and every phase of the application process, the director wrote.\n\nAfter the inspector general's report was released, Judge Rosemary Collyer, chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that considers the sensitive wiretap applications, rebuked the FBI and asserted it had misled the court when seeking permission to wiretap Page.\n\nThe frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable, Judge Rosemary Collyer wrote.\n\nSearing IG report: FBI wiretap of Trump campaign aide was riddled with errors, but Russia probe was legally justified, IG report finds\n\nWiretap trouble: A new blow to the FBI: Watchdog report details dysfunction, missteps in wiretap of Trump aide\n\nIn its filing, the FBI was required to show the court how it would adhere to the rules governing requests for surveillance allowed under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The law, enacted in 1978, outlines procedures investigators must follow when they ask judges for permission to conduct electronic surveillance of people suspected of acting as foreign agents.\n\nAlthough the inspector general debunked claims by President Donald Trump that the Russia investigation was motivated by political bias, it revealed a dysfunctional system in which a team of investigators, handpicked to conduct one of the FBI's most sensitive investigations, committed basic and fundamental errors.\n\nThe FBI sought four court-ordered wiretaps of Page. Each application contained multiple errors, according to Inspector General Michael Howoritz's report.\n\nAmong the most common were omissions of important information, including some that contradicted investigators' suspicions that Page was acting as a foreign agent.\n\nDuring Senate testimony last month, Horowitz said the surveillance of Page continued even as investigators gathered new evidence that weakened the assessment of Page's activities..\n\nHorowitz's report concluded that investigators overstated the reliability of a former British intelligence officer whose information they used to justify the surveillance warrants. Agents described Christopher Steele as someone whose information had been corroborated and used in criminal proceedings. Horowitz's report said that wasn't true.\n\nInvestigators also didn't provide documentation to back up some of their assertions to justify the wiretap warrants. In some cases, the documents showed their claims were wrong. One supervisor said he didn't necessarily review full documents to make sure they supported what the agents claimed, according to the report.\n\nHorowitz referred a former FBI attorney to prosecutors for possible criminal investigation for altering an email from a liaison at another government agency. The email confirmed Page had been a source of information for the other agency, but the FBI attorney changed it to say the opposite.\n\nThat covered up a piece of information that would have undercut the FBI's justification to wiretap Page.\n\nThis, Collyer wrote in her order, gave rise to serious concerns about the accuracy and completeness of any surveillance warrant applications involving that attorney.\n\nContributing: Kristine Phillips
Joe Biden\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nEvery four years, American democracy is rekindled in Iowa, as neighbors come together in libraries, union halls, churches, and cafeterias, and set our nation on a path to picking the next president. That duty has always been sacred to Iowans — but it's a far graver responsibility this time around than it has ever been before.\n\nIt's no secret just how much damage President Donald Trump has done to our communities. He has repeatedly tried to snatch away our health care — and return us to the days when you could be denied care for having a pre-existing condition. His reckless, unnecessary trade war and Big Oil ethanol waivers have decimated Iowa farmers and producers — evaporating livelihoods and exacerbating a tragic spike in farm bankruptcies. And his chief legislative victory — a tax cut that largely benefited the wealthiest Americans — was little more than a slap in the face to working people.\n\nBut worse, somehow, than his policy failures has been the damage he's done to the soul of our nation. He fans the flames of hate groups at home. He embraces murderous dictators abroad. He rips children from their mothers' arms at our border. He pressures foreign nations to interfere in our elections. Every day, his endless spigot of unhinged lies, thoughtless cruelties, and petty complaints embarrasses his office and degrades our national character. Is it any wonder that the once-unimaginable sight of allied world leaders mocking and laughing at the American president has now become routine?\n\nPete Buttigieg: Iowa is hungry for action — as is the whole nation\n\nSome of my opponents in the Democratic primary will tell you that Donald Trump isn't the issue — they'll say that our focus should be on what the country will look like after he leaves office. With all due respect, they are looking past the crisis staring us in the face: What happens if he wins again?\n\nWe can't afford four more years\n\nOur country is strong; we can withstand four years of Trump. But if we give him a second term, there is no telling how much more damage he will do to our core values, our standing in the world, or the character of our nation.\n\nImagine four more years of unchecked corruption and naked grift. Four more years of broadsides against our democracy, our free press, and the very concept of truth. Four more years of fawning deference to Vladimir Putin abroad — and to the NRA here at home.\n\nThat doesn't have to be our fate. In less than a month, Iowans can say enough, and take the first step toward beating Donald Trump and restoring the soul of our nation.\n\nJohn Delaney: On health care, bold vision with pragmatism is what America needs\n\nRestoring our soul means creating policies that reflect our shared values. That means ensuring that health care is a right for all — not just the wealthy — by giving every American the choice to either stick with a private plan or choose an affordable, quality Medicare-like public option. It means revitalizing the basic middle class bargain for all Americans, so that no one has to leave their hometown — be it Manhattan or Mason City, L.A. or Elkader — to find opportunity. It means banning assault weapons and limiting magazine clips, so that every parent can look their kids in the eye and tell them, You will be safe at school. Most of all, it means treating every person with dignity.\n\nI know how seriously you take your responsibility as caucusgoers, and I believe you'll choose a candidate who can build a broad, diverse coalition to unify this nation around our common values — someone who understands that our country is made strong by the ideals and dignity of our people.\n\nWe don't have to give in to Donald Trump's dark, petty, angry vision of America. We can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be. We can restore the defining American promise — that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve. And, in doing so, we can restore the soul of our nation. I hope you'll join me in that fight today — and that you'll caucus for me on Feb. 3.\n\nJoe Biden, who was vice president from 2009 to 2017, is a Democratic candidate for president.

Nick McCarvel\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE — On court for nearly five hours Tuesday in 90-degree heat, Jeremy Chardy, a Frenchman seeded No. 30, played 66 games, finally overcoming Ernests Gulbis 13-11 in a fifth set that itself took nearly two hours.\n\nTwo days later he lost in straight sets to world No. 74 Andrey Kuznetsov.\n\nIt is not easy, Chardy said after his loss. Yesterday I was really tired and today it was still really tough. I was not so good. I was feeling pain everywhere in my body. I tried my best and gave 100 percent, but it wasn't enough. I was fit to play a long match like this, but after it's not easy to recover.\n\nOf tennis' four major tournaments, the U.S. Open is the only one to have adopted a deciding-set tiebreak: At the French Open, Wimbledon and here at the Australian Open, players are asked to play out the final set (for the women the third, and for the men the fifth in singles), known as an advantage set.\n\nFive takeaways from Day 4 at Australian Open\n\nNo tiebreaks. Last man — or woman — standing wins.\n\nToday when I heard the chair umpire announce, 'No tiebreak in the third set,' I'm just thinking and hoping that I'm not in that position, said Ana Ivanovic, the former world No. 1 and 2008 finalist.\n\nBut tennis is split: There are traditionalists who believe that playing it out in an advantage set is how it should always be, and that a tiebreak to decide a close three- or five-set match comes down to a few points or luck after a hard fought match.\n\nOthers see the tiebreak as just that: A chance to separate the loser from the winner.\n\nA tiebreak to decide it all is more exciting, says Justin Gimelstob, a former player who coaches American No. 1 John Isner and commentates on Tennis Channel.\n\nYou have the drama with the score going on and on and on, but to have that finish line a tiebreak provides. It's a drama that is even more built up than a score that goes into the teens. The damage that is done to the players involved in those matches, it can hurt them in the next match for sure.\n\nChardy demonstrated how tough it can be to recover, and recent Grand Slams show the challenge of winning after surviving an advantage set. USA TODAY Sports analyzed men's and women's singles draws from the last five years at the three Grand Slams that use advantage sets.\n\nOverall, players who won a match in an extended fifth (men's) or third (women's) set lost in the next round 65% of the time, or in 74 out of 115 matches. At the Australian Open, where conditions can be the most difficult in long matches, players lost 29 of those 39 matches, or nearly 75%.\n\nYet Craig Tiley, tournament director of the Australian Open, said there has been no discussion of changing this rule.\n\nThe feedback we get from the fans is that they like it, Tiley said, referring to evaluations done by fans who attended the event on-site. They like the opportunity to watch more tennis and real battles, fights of attrition to the end, like who is going to collapse or break first.\n\nNovak Djokovic denies report he deliberately lost in 2007\n\nFormer top-10 player Alicia Molik, an Australian, agrees with the policy of her home Slam.\n\nIt's part of the game. It's like playing in 40-degree weather in Australia, you just have to suck it up, she said. I love the fact that tennis is such a mental game. The player with the strongest mental fortitude often wins in those situations when it's win by two games. You get paid very well to do it and you should be conditioned enough to withstand that type of situation. You might be rusty the next day, but I don't have any sympathy.\n\nAmerican doubles player Eric Butorac, the ATP Player Council president, would like to do away with playing out a deciding set – and even move the men towards playing two out of three sets at the majors\n\nTo draw to the bigger audience, watch an NFL, NBA or hockey game and these things last two to three hours, Butorac noted. I don't think we need to play for four or five hours.\n\nWary of a TV audience and digital world with plenty of choices for entertainment, Butorac said he feels as though tennis' product can be too slow moving and time consuming for the casual sports fan.\n\nI absolutely think we should have a tiebreaker in the deciding set, he said. But it's not for [the Player Council] to say. We can try to lobby the tournaments, but all the Grand Slams are their own entities.\n\nLet's get the casual sports fans into tennis, he added. Shorter is better, but that's my opinion.\n\nAnd even though the Australian Open bills itself as a rebel with a cause, as Tiley explains it, he said the tournament would likely consider playing lets on serves or shortening the time allowed between points before it would implement deciding-set tiebreaks.\n\nIn September, the International Tennis Federation voted to discontinue the use of advantage sets played out in the decider for Davis Cup matches beginning in 2016. A statement on the Davis Cup website said the competition follows the lead of the U.S. Open.\n\nThe U.S. Open, in its own right, is happy to be the outcast among the Grand Slams. Deciding-set tiebreaks were introduced in 1975 at the U.S. Open.\n\nThe tournaments recognize we each have the right to do our own thing, said Gordon Smith, the U.S. Tennis Association's executive director. We respect them. And we like the scoring system we have in place.\n\nWould Chardy still be in the tournament if he hadn't been extended to 13-11 in the fifth against Gulbis? That's impossible to answer. But if the players banded together on the issue, Tiley said the Australian Open would certainly listen.\n\nWe have a balance between the respect of tradition and the desire to be innovative and challenging the status quo, he said. If the playing group came to us as a whole lot asking for a change, we would change it.\n\nPHOTOS: Best of the Australian Open
China is open to a reunified Korean Peninsula — even if it is aligned with the West — as long as it is peaceful and does not threaten national security, China's ambassador to Washington told USA TODAY's editorial board Tuesday.\n\nAmbassador Cui Tiankai commented as North and South Korea this month began talking to each other, reducing tensions inflamed by an increased tempo of the North's nuclear and missile tests, and by President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's trading threats and insults.\n\nCui said China would support reunification if it is the will of the Korean people. As long as it's peaceful, it's independent (and) by the Korean people, China will support it, he said.\n\nMore:South Korea's 'Peace Olympics' overture to North Korea provokes backlash\n\nMore:In bid to save manufacturing jobs, Trump signs tariffs on washing machines, solar cells\n\nEven a Western-aligned Korean Peninsula?\n\nI think it's up to the Korean people, whether they are divided or unified, to adopt an independent foreign policy of their own, Cui replied. They know where their best interests lie.\n\nCui described China's principles for resolving the conflict on the Korean Peninsula, which has been divided since the end of World War II and where Chinese and U.S. troops fought on opposite sides during the Korean War that ended in 1953.\n\nChina wants a denuclearization of the entire Korean Peninsula, no armed conflict or chaos on its borders, and for any reunification to happen through diplomacy, Cui said.\n\nOn Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. would back such an outcome.\n\nWe support – if it arrives at that peacefully – we support reunification of the Korean peninsula, Nauert told USA TODAY.\n\nNorth Korea, which agreed this month to send a delegation of athletes, performers and officials to the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, has said it is developing a nuclear weapon that can reach Washington, D.C., in order to deter an American threat. China, which handles 80% to 90% of the North's trade, has signed on to numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions intended to limit the flow of goods and funds to the nation's illicit weapons programs.\n\nWhenever we find any company or individual violating these sanctions, we will take legal action against them, Cui said.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies during the Korean War are considering increasing maritime interdiction of ships going to and from North Korea after the U.S. in December, sought unsuccessfully to blacklist 10 ships it said were involved in transferring oil and coal to the North on the high seas, in violation of U.N. sanctions.\n\nThe Treasury Department published photographs of ships apparently transferring oil to North Korean tankers in the Yellow Sea between China and South Korea. One of the ships, Lighthouse Winmore, which South Korean authorities seized in November, had a Chinese crew, was owned by a company based in Hong Kong whose director lives in Guangzhou, China, was leased by someone in Taiwan, and was registered in the Marshall Islands, a U.S. protectorate, according to The New York Times.\n\nCui denied China has anything to do with those ships.\n\nWe have done our own investigation. I don't think that these ships carry the Chinese flag, Cui said. In other words, these ships do not belong to China. But as long as such activities are taking place in the areas under our jurisdictions we'll take action against them.\n\nThe Trump administration listed China and Russia as global rivals in its national security strategy last month, but Cui disagreed.\n\nChina has no interest in seeking world domination, he said. I don't think any country can really dominate the world. We need the cooperation of all the members of the international community.
Mike Leach jaunted off to his vacation home in Key West, Fla., last weekend, shortly after his Washington State football team suffered a 42-17 loss in the Holiday Bowl against Michigan State.\n\nIt was the first time he's been back since Hurricane Irma blasted the Florida Keys in September. His house survived without much trouble, unlike the house next door, which got smashed by a fallen tree.\n\nMore:Alabama meets Georgia in College Football Playoff final: Mirror images, striking differences\n\nMore:Georgia fans driving up ticket prices for College Football Playoff national title game\n\nAs he surveyed the damage in the neighborhood, college football's most unconventional mind reflected on this and other recent topics that have made the news recently, including his controversial secrecy about player injuries and that video of him cooling down his coffee.\n\nLeach spoke about them by phone with USA TODAY Sports, pausing only momentarily to order dinner at a local eatery — a Key Limeade to drink and a grilled fish sandwich with cocktail sauce instead of tartar sauce.\n\nInjury secrecy\n\nWashington State's star quarterback, Luke Falk, played most of the season with a broken bone in his non-throwing wrist and couldn't play in the Holiday Bowl because it hadn't healed enough from recent surgery. But none of that was known outside the Cougars program until after the season. It was kept secret by Leach, whose policy is to never talk about player injuries.\n\nOther coaches are more open about player injuries, knowing there's interest from fans, ticket buyers and viewers about which players aren't able to play and why not. By contrast, Leach hates talking about them and doesn't want injury stories in the news media to gain traction for his team as an excuse to play less than its best.\n\nI don't want to empower poor and inept and lazy journalists with story material, Leach said. They just want to talk about scores and injuries. What comes out of these stories is, 'So and so is injured. So his team has all these excuses to lose, because the whole thing is riding on X-number of injured players. So therefore they can't win.'\n\nI don't want that mentality floating around our team in any way shape, form or fashion, Leach said. Then, the other thing is, whatever weaknesses or vulnerabilities that we have as a team, I can't possibly fathom why I would have any interest in revealing that to my opponent.\n\nThe coffee video\n\nHe's seen the video of himself that went viral last week — the one that captures him intently cooling down his coffee at the pre-game press conference. While MSU coach Mark Dantonio is speaking at the podium, Leach is seated next to him blowing on his hot drink.\n\nBut he doesn't get why that was such a big media sensation.\n\nNext time we have a press conference, I would be more than happy to go up there, get a hot cup of coffee and cool it off for them, he said. That's a courtesy I'm willing to provide, and I'd be happy to do that. But the fact they found me blowing on my coffee more fascinating than the questions that they ask I find kind of telling.\n\nLosing Falk and next year\n\nIn August, Leach entered his sixth season at WSU believing this was his best team ever at WSU. The Cougars finished 9-4 with a third straight bowl appearance. But they lose Falk, the team's starter for most of the past three years.\n\nI think we can be better, Leach said, noting his returning players at receiver and other positions.\n\nThe heir apparent at quarterback is rising junior Tyler Hilinksi, who started in Falk's place in the Holiday Bowl and completed 39 of his 50 passes for 272 yards.\n\nI think he's really good, Leach said. I think he's got great potential, and I'm excited to see how he plays with 100% of the reps.\n\nThis year's team started with six straight wins and ended with two straight losses.\n\nI don't think our team or coaches are completely happy with it. However, the thing that I think we've got to recognize is we exceeded nearly everybody's expectations except our own and by a significant margin.\n\nEnd-of-year blues\n\nAfter being revived by Leach, the WSU football program is now getting pushed by growing expectations. For example, Leach has a combined record of 2-8 in bowl games and Apple Cup games against Washington. Asked what to do about that, Leach replied, A starting point would be to play a lot worse teams.\n\nHis point is that those are among his toughest foes all year. And before Leach arrived, the Cougars hadn't been to a bowl game since 2003.\n\nWe've gone to (three) straight bowls. We'll go to a bowl again next year, and we'll do it for a longer period of time than has ever been done in the history of the school. I don't know how you can attempt to diminish what we've accomplished with something like that.\n\nThat Tennessee thing\n\nLeach recently agreed to a five-year, $20 million contract extension at WSU after being a candidate for the open job at Tennessee. He declined to expound on what happened with Tennessee.\n\nI really can't. Most of it is water under the bridge now.\n\nPac-12 Conference weakness\n\nThe Pac-12 was 1-8 in bowl games this season and has won only one College Football Playoff game since the Playoff started four years ago.\n\nI think our conference has beaten each other up, Leach said. I also think the bottom of our conference is tougher (than others).\n\nThe hurricane\n\nThe Leaches got lucky with Hurricane Irma. As he walked the neighborhood recently, he saw all kinds of damage. Wow. That whole house is crumpled. It looks like something out of Dr. Seuss.\n\nHis house was mostly spared. The fishtail palms that provided him some privacy blew down, but that's about it. They're sort of a junky plant in a way. There are things I don't like about them, but they really covered the back deck.\n\nIt was still good to be back for a while before he hits the recruiting trail soon. The fish specials at the nearby restaurant are an added treat.\n\nWahoo is my favorite fish now, he said. They didn't have wahoo. It'll be mahi mahi. Their fries are homemade here. It's all real good.
USA TODAY\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nPresident Donald Trump justifies rejecting the Democrats' plan to end the government shutdown because it doesn't include funding for a border wall between the United States and Mexico — which he argues is vital to control illegal immigration and to keep us safe. Illegal immigration, border smuggling and the occasional border crossing of a dangerous criminal, however, are moving targets that require more modern, flexible and effective solutions such as cameras, radar, sensors, drones, trained personnel and the universal use of E-Verify — a verification process that electronically documents eligibility to work in the United States.\n\nRelated column:9 facts you should know about the border\n\nIf Trump rejects an amended Democratic bill that addresses these elements, it would publicly expose him as an egomaniac who is demanding a Trump Wall as a permanent monument to himself. Such a bill would most certainly pass in the Senate, if brought to a vote.\n\nArthur Pitchenik; Miami\n\nA wall would encourage legal immigration\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe southern border wall between the United States and Mexico is needed to protect U.S. citizens in the future. Many have valid reasons for wanting to come to the USA, but we can't continue to have everybody in the world come in illegally — not following the proper channels.\n\nThe analogy I give is of the man on the corner selling drugs because he has five small children and needs rent money, food etc. He is arrested by a police officer who listens to the man's story. The officer has empathy for his dilemma, but explains that what he is doing is illegal and that it cannot be tolerated.\n\nDHS secretary:We face a humanitarian and security crisis\n\nThe same situation applies to people coming into the United States. The reason for them wanting to come might be for good reason, but it must be done legally, through the proper channels available, regardless of the reason these migrants might have to come here in the first place.\n\nRobert Pallone; Annapolis, Md.\n\nIt doesn't matter if Trump lies\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe news media and political pundits missed the point when they focused exclusively on the likelihood that President Donald Trump would lie in his Tuesday address to the nation on the alleged border crisis.\n\nTalker:Donald Trump's credibility put to the test, yet again\n\nThis is not simply a public policy or ethical issue — it's also a rhetorical issue. Trump understands marketing and the ability to repackage his policies and manufacture a crisis in order to win. He believes — and it is possible he may be right — that the prime-time speech and subsequent visit to the southern border could result in a slight shift in public opinion and congressional sentiment on the wall. If that happens, it won't matter how much he lied or the apparent lack of a valid grounding for his proposed border policy. What will matter is how convincing Trump's message was. This is a pivotal moment for our country. How sad it is that all of this boils down to winning and losing, rather than the nation's best interest.\n\nRichard Cherwitz; Austin\n\nRep. Tlaib should take a mature stand\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nThe profanity-laced comments from Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — who made history as one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress — are regrettable.\n\nPartisan politics and personal animosities aside, members of Congress are expected to adhere to the highest decorum of the office and the House. Although there is no censorship, one has to be very careful with the choice of the words used. Tlaib said, We're going to impeach the mother-----r. This unparliamentary language is beyond the pale and is an unacceptable approach.\n\nRelated column:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib are honest Democrats\n\nI hope Tlaib, who already has made history, takes on a responsible position as a first-time member of Congress by taking the mantle of a matured stand, devoid of any expletives and derogatory language. How true: When they go low, as Michelle Obama famously said in a rousing 2016 speech amid a brutal election cycle, we go high!\n\nAtul M. Karnik; Woodside, N.Y.\n\nImpeach Trump already\n\nThroughout history we have had political leaders who could clearly be described as constructive or destructive. Constructive leaders try to bring a nation together, support democracy, promote the common good, and work for peace and justice. Destructive leaders divide the nation, exhibit bigotry and racism, work to enhance the power and wealth of a segment of society, and often exhibit strong nationalistic tendencies.\n\nIn my opinion, President Donald Trump is an American version of a destructive leader. His bigotry, lying and nationalism are apparent.\n\nEx-GOP congressman to Democrats:Gear up to impeach Trump. It's your duty.\n\nUnfortunately, destructive leaders are often supported by people who believe that they will receive something positive from the person they support. In Trump's case, Republican politicians, evangelical Christians and misled citizens are his supporters.\n\nWhat should be done? You don't let a destructive leader linger in power to do more harm. You recognize a person for who he is and take necessary steps to remove him from office before he does more damage. Trump has already done a lot of damage. How much more damage he could do if left in power for two more years is anyone's guess, but I don't want to find out.\n\nI support Trump's impeachment as soon as possible.\n\nDavid Atwood; Houston\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY, email letters@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.
The stunning Democratic wins in Georgia's two Senate runoff races have been touted as a game-changer that gives the party control of both Congress and the presidency, paving the way for Joe Biden to push through his sweeping plan to dig the economy out of the punishing COVID-19 downturn.\n\nIt's not hyperbole, President-elect Biden told Georgia voters before Tuesday's election. You can change America.\n\nOn second thought, perhaps hyperbole is precisely what that is.\n\nWith razor-thin majorities in the Senate, as well as in the House, analysts say Biden and Democratic lawmakers will still face a tough slog passing Biden's bold tax and spending plans. In the end, Congress is likely to approve just a slice of the proposals, experts say.\n\nBut a third big stimulus check for U.S. households is now more likely with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., replacing Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, as majority leader.\n\nI think the odds of agreement on (Biden's entire) program are quite low and even getting a scaled-down plan through will be a high hurdle, says Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy analyst at Stifel.\n\nThe biggest obstacle is that Republicans can block any bill in the Senate with 40 votes. Control of the upper chamber will be split between the two parties, with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans. Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie, officially giving Democrats control of the Senate but leaving them far short of the 60 votes needed to power legislation through.\n\nThere is a remedy. A process known as reconciliation allows the Senate to pass a tax and spending bill with a simple majority, but only once a year. That means Democratic leaders would still have to corral the party's centrists and hold on to progressives who may reject any legislation that waters down their priorities.\n\nThis all has got to be done with Democratic votes, Gardner says. Can you do this by keeping all Democrats – no defections? I'm very skeptical.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Democratic victories in Georgia aren't meaningful. Congress can still pass limited measures that provide a modest boost to the economy. With Democrats controlling the Senate, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, expects the economy to grow an average 3.7% a year and create 12.5 million jobs during Biden's four-year term. That compares with 3.5% growth and 11.6 million jobs under a Republican Senate, Zandi says.\n\nShow me the money:When will the extra $300 in unemployment benefits start? These states are already paying the bonus\n\nAnd holding a Senate majority means Democrats would chair Senate committees and set the agenda, and Schumer could help confirm Biden's Cabinet and other nominees, Gardner says.\n\nBiden also can accomplish major economic initiatives through executive actions, without Congress's approval. For example, he's expected to largely reverse President Donald Trump's crackdown on both legal and illegal immigration, adding more consumers and workers to a U.S. economy that needs both. And he's likely to rally U.S. allies to confront China on trade issues, eventually removing many of the tariffs unilaterally imposed by Trump, Zandi says. That would eliminate a tax on American shoppers.\n\nHere's a rundown on what a narrowly Democratic Congress could approve:\n\nAnother COVID-19 relief package\n\nCongress recently passed a $908 billion relief package that extended unemployment benefits to 14 million Americans through mid-March, and provided more aid to struggling small businesses and financially stressed states and cities. The federal government is also sending another stimulus check – this time, for $600 – to most people.\n\nTrump, Democrats and some Republicans favor $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans. A Democratic-controlled Senate led by Schumer could mean quick passage of such a proposal, Gardner says, with a second $1,400 check going to individuals early this year.\n\nBut Gardner doesn't expect a second sweeping relief bill that further extends jobless benefits and provides additional aid to distressed states and cities for at least six months. Such a measure would not garner 60 votes, he says. And in six months, the assistance likely wouldn't be needed because a COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be widely available, providing a major lift the economy.\n\nZandi is more optimistic. He believes that under Schumer's leadership, Congress will pass a $600 billion relief package that includes more jobless benefits, rental assistance and more aid to small businesses.\n\nLonger-term spending\n\nBiden is proposing $7.3 trillion in new spending over 10 years, including upgrading the nation's roads, bridges and highways; building a clean energy economy; investing in research and development to bolster manufacturing; ensuring the government and its contractors buy American products; providing tuition-free community college; ensuring access to affordable child care and universal preschool; and providing aid for Americans to buy or rent homes.\n\nWith the narrowest of majorities in the Senate, Democrats will need to use reconciliation to pass the initiatives and centrists are likely to oppose many of them, Gardner says.\n\nThe bigger the bill, the harder it gets to swallow, he says. I think it's got to be more tailored.\n\nIn the end, Gardner predicts, Congress will pass legislation to upgrade the nation's crumbling roads, bridges, highways, ports and rural broadband networks.\n\nEverybody (lawmakers) likes big building (projects) in their districts, he says.\n\nZandi projects a $1.5 trillion spending blueprint – about half infrastructure upgrades, and the rest a variety of social programs, such as housing, healthcare and childcare.\n\nTaxes\n\nTo help pay for his proposed outlays, Biden plans to raise taxes by about $4 trillion over the next decade. He proposes eliminating loopholes for people earning more than $400,000; subjecting incomes above $400,000 to the 12.4% Social Security payroll tax; and phasing out itemized deductions at incomes of $400,000.\n\nHe also wants to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, and tax capital gains and dividends at ordinary rates for incomes above $1 million.\n\nNew soft drink flavor:Mountain Dew Major Melon: Watermelon is soda's first new flavor in more than a decade\n\nZandi believes a reconciliation bill will raise the corporate tax rate to 28% and tax the wealthy at higher rates.\n\nBut Gardner reckons Democrats will have to compromise and raise the corporate rate to 24%, a middle ground that will be opposed by progressives. Ultimately, he predicts, the reconciliation bill will raise taxes only on wealthy Americans in exchange for a Republican demand to make the 2017 Trump-led tax cuts – which are slated to expire in 2025 – permanent for those earning less than $400,000.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nBiden supports a Democratic proposal in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15. But with just a slim Senate majority, Democrats would not be able to garner the 60 votes to overcome Republican opposition, Gardner says.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has less than two weeks left in office, but his response to and role in Wednesday's violent storming of the U.S. Capitol has unleashed a new round of calls for his removal – even from within his own party.\n\nAmong the tools being touted: impeachment (again), invoking the 25th Amendment and even charges of insurrection or sedition.\n\nThere is real cause for alarm here, said Deepak Gupta, a Harvard University lecturer and attorney who specializes in constitutional law. For the next couple of weeks, this unhinged person is formally, legally the commander of the armed forces, and there's really no telling what he might do.\n\nRepublican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a military veteran and Trump critic, called the president unfit and unwell on Thursday and endorsed invoking the 25th Amendment to transfer power to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nI think yesterday it became clear that the president is unmoored from reality and from his oath, Kinzinger told MSNBC Thursday. He said he hasn't ruled out impeachment.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Katherine Clark, the assistant House speaker, said Friday if Vice President Mike Pence and a majority of the Cabinet do not agree to remove Trump from office via the 25th Amendment, the House will move forward with impeachment proceedings as early as mid-next week.\n\n'Betrayal of his office':Calls for Trump's removal grow as even former allies begin to back away\n\nBut while there are seemingly many options and growing momentum for ousting Trump – and, critics say, many reasons for doing so – Gupta and others say most would be a stretch to pull off, particularly since he is headed for the exits anyway.\n\nI think we've got to hold our breath for the next 20 days, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, another prominent Trump critic, told reporters on Wednesday evening after the Capitol had been secured.\n\nTrump's allies dismissed the fresh chatter as nonsense and rejected allegations that Trump's rhetoric helped stoke Wednesday's attack on Congress. After the House and Senate formalized President-elect Joe Biden's win in the Nov. 3 election early Thursday, Trump called for a smooth transition of power, in a jarring message shift.\n\nAt a news conference earlier Thursday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he did not support removing Trump and dismissed impeachment as political talk.\n\nI'm hopeful the worst is behind us and we can transfer power on January 20th, he said.\n\nBut lawmakers in both parties say Trump incited the mob violence that unfolded at the Capitol, in which pro-Trump rioters breached security, ransacked the building and nearly derailed the Electoral College count to formalize Biden's win.\n\nIt was an explicit use of violence to coerce a political outcome that Trump and his supporters failed to achieve through the democratic process, said Michel Paradis, an adjunct professor at Columbia University law school and a senior attorney for the Department of Defense.\n\nTrump has repeatedly sought to undermine the 2020 election results with false claims of election fraud and on Wednesday, he encouraged his supporters to stop the steal in a speech before they marched to the Capitol.\n\nOn Friday, former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Trump should resign immediately.\n\nI wish he would just do what Nixon did and step down, Powell told NBC.\n\nPowell said impeachment – a step House Democrats are preparing for as early as next week – is too time consuming.\n\nSomebody ought to go up there and tell him, 'It's over. Plane's waiting for you. You're out.\n\nHouse Democrats aren't banking on that.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi Thursday called Trump a very dangerous person who should not continue in office. The California Democrat said the president's Cabinet members should remove Trump from power, and she threatened impeachment if they do not act quickly.\n\nThe 25th Amendment:How the 25th Amendment would be used to end Trump presidency\n\nMeanwhile, the head of one of the country's most powerful business lobbies accused Trump of inciting Wednesday's violence in an attempt to retain power and said Pence should consider triggering the 25th amendment to the Constitution to preserve democracy.\n\nThis is sedition and should be treated as such, said Jay Timmons, the president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nBut is it realistic to think Trump will be ousted before the Jan. 20 inauguration of his successor?\n\nHere's a rundown of the avenues for removal – and a reality check on their possible use:\n\n25th Amendment\n\nThe amendment, ratified in 1967, created a legal mechanism for designating a head of state when the president is disabled or dead. It also formalized the historical practice for the vice president to permanently take over if the president dies or resigns, and gives the president and Congress shared power to replace a vice president.\n\nUnder the amendment, the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet could declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. If the president disputes that determination, two-thirds of both the House and the Senate must vote to put the vice president in charge.\n\nOn Thursday, Pelosi and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, called on Pence and Trump's top advisers to invoke the clause.\n\nWhat happened at the U.S. Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president, Schumer said in a statement Thursday morning. This president should not hold office one day longer.\n\nProsecutor:Actions by 'all actors,' including Trump, may be under scrutiny following violence at the\n\nBut Gupta said the 25th Amendment was not really designed to oust a sitting president, even one who lawmakers believe is unfit to hold the office.\n\nOne of the defects of the 25th Amendment is it relies on the president's closest political allies – his people – to invoke it, he noted. Its drafters did not see it as a tool to remove a president who seems intent on undermining an election or holding onto power.\n\nWhat they had in mind was situations in which the president becomes incapacitated for medical reasons, he said.\n\nBut Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, said Trump's singular focus on overturning the election – and his refusal to do his day job – is justification enough for invoking either the 25th Amendment or impeachment proceedings.\n\nIt's a dereliction of duty and responsibility that would suggest a president who is not dealing with the fundamental problems of the country, Ornstein said during a briefing hosted by a task force on election crises.\n\n'Unfathomable':Capitol Police security breakdown prompts calls for chief's resignation\n\nImpeachment\n\nOver the last 24 hours, a growing number of Democrats drafted or endorsed articles of impeachment to remove Trump from office. Both Pelosi and Schumer raised that option as a backup if Trump's advisers refuse to take the 25th Amendment route.\n\nThe president's conduct in inciting the criminal activity (that occurred during Wednesday's riot) undoubtedly ... qualifies as a high crime and misdemeanor, Ned Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University, said in referring to the two triggers for impeachment proceedings.\n\nFoley noted that impeachment would also bar Trump from holding public office again, presumably a benefit to critics who think he is unfit and fear he will run again in 2024. But impeachment is a lengthy and politically fraught process.\n\nCongress is no longer in session, and lawmakers are unlikely to embrace a return for such charged proceedings, no matter how much they are worried about the president's potential to cause additional chaos in the coming days.\n\nInauguration Day 2021:What now? Capitol riots, Trump supporter threats prompt safety concerns\n\nEven Trump's most ardent foes said it's far-fetched to think the narrowly divided House would reconvene to impeach Trump and the Senate, currently controlled by Republicans, would then follow through to convict him.\n\nHe certainly deserves it, Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat, told reporters. After what happened yesterday, he should be removed from office. But I don't believe there's a stomach for it on the Republican side and there's very little time left.\n\nCharges of sedition or insurrection\n\nIn the wake of Wednesday's violence, several legal experts and Trump critics raised the prospect that Trump could be charged with seditious conspiracy or inciting insurrection.\n\nFoley said there's little question in his view that rioters at the Capitol engaged in criminal activity and that Trump incited them. But, he said, it's not clear if Trump himself could realistically be charged in connection with that deadly attack.\n\nPlus, he noted, Department of Justice policy generally holds that a sitting president is immune from criminal charges while in office.\n\nAfter leaving office he's subject potentially to criminal liability, Foley said. But sedition is a complicated crime and ... it has a kind of ugly use in American history for political opponents, so I think we would want to be careful about going down that road.\n\nGupta said Trump could potentially be ousted under a provision of the 14th Amendment that bars individuals who engage in insurrection against the Constitution of the United States from holding office.\n\nBut there isn't much precedent for invoking that, he said, and it could face a tough legal path.\n\n'Betrayal of his office':Calls for Trump's removal grow as even former allies begin to back away\n\nFoley said the best option for those who want Trump out before his term ends is the path of least resistance: let him play golf – a lot of golf.\n\nIf the idea is that perhaps President Trump will essentially check out of the functioning as president – and even more than he has in the past – you could see that potentially as ... an informal way to try to just get through the next two weeks, he said.\n\nIf Trump just went to Florida and played golf and didn't get any briefings, Foley said, it could fall to Pence or the White House chief of staff to informally take the reins for the executive branch until Jan. 20 without invoking a messy formal process to strip him of his powers.\n\nBut, he and others conceded, that's not likely either.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu and William Cummings.
WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday announced new White House staff members who will serve under Susan Rice, the director of his Domestic Policy Council, charging them with coordinating with federal agencies to help implement his early domestic policy agenda.\n\nThe hires include four deputy directors of the Domestic Policy Council, a special assistant and a deputy assistant. Focus areas include racial justice and equity, immigration, health care, veterans affairs and economic mobility.\n\nMore:Trump impeachment sets up politically perilous Senate trial, possibly threatening Joe Biden's agenda\n\nIn a surprise move, Biden last month named Rice – a former ambassador to the United Nations and then as his national security adviser under President Barack Obama – to lead domestic policy efforts. Rice was under consideration as Biden's vice president pick before he picked Sen.

If the House impeachment of President Donald Trump seems faster this time, it is basically the difference between a week and a year.\n\nHouse Democrats began investigating Trump across six committees after regaining control of the chamber in January 2019. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared a formal impeachment inquiry in September 2019. The House impeached Trump that December and the Senate acquitted Trump in February 2020.\n\nWednesday's impeachment was sparked by the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol that left five people dead. House Democrats charge Trump with inciting the insurrection and voted a week later to impeach Trump.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who has participated all four modern impeachment investigations, said there was no need for the extensive review of the facts and uncovering of evidence required in previous cases.\n\nWhat happened this time was in plain view, said Lofgren, who was a Judiciary Committee staffer investigating President Richard Nixon and a House member for the impeachments of Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. He incited a right-wing mob of insurrections to come and overturn constitutional government a week ago. You don't need a long investigation to find that out.\n\nThe pace became a flashpoint because Trump's term ends Jan. 20. Impeachment is a tool to remove a president, but could also serve to block Trump from holding future office, if the Senate convicts him and votes to bar him.\n\nRep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Rules Committee, said a committee should have held an investigation, to call witnesses and gather other evidence. That process would have provided Trump due process to challenge the evidence.\n\nThe House is moving forward erratically with a truncated process that does not comport with modern practice and it will give members no time to contemplate the serious course of action before us, Cole said.\n\nDespite Trump's inappropriate and reckless words, Cole said, The presidency itself deserves due process in the impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said there was no rush to judgment. He said a majority of Democrats voted against multiple attempts from rank-and-file lawmakers to impeach Trump. But he said the violence demanded a quick response.\n\nIs there little time left? Yes, Hoyer said. But it is never too late to do the right thing.\n\nTrump's previous impeachment took much longer.\n\nHouse Democrats mounted wide-ranging investigations into Trump and his businesses in early 2019. One path of inquiry followed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election.\n\nMueller's report was released publicly in April 2019. The report found no evidence that Trump's campaign conspired with Russia and made no judgment about whether the president obstructed the investigation.\n\nPelosi said impeachment was not yet in the cards.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee voted in May 2019 to urge the House to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to testify about the Mueller report. Lawmakers said the report could serve as the foundation for impeachment.\n\nIn August, the committee filed a lawsuit to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nThe tide turned after the White House released the transcript of a July 2019 call between Trump and the president of Ukraine. The transcript revealed Trump urging an investigation of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats argued the call was worthy of impeachment and Trump said the call was justified.\n\nPelosi declared a formal impeachment investigation on Sept. 24, 2019.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee led the investigation because of its foreign-policy implications. The panel collected confidential testimony from government officials for weeks and then held public hearings in November 2019.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee then voted Dec. 13, 2019, on two articles of impeachment against Trump based on the Intelligence Committee's report. The House voted to impeach Trump Dec. 18 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nPelosi delayed sending the articles to the Senate until Jan. 15, in an effort to build pressure for the Senate to have witnesses at the trial. But the Senate voted not to call witnesses and to hear arguments from House Democrats and Trump's lawyers.\n\nA majority of the Senate voted Feb. 5, 2020, to acquit Trump – far shy of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah was the only Republican to join Democrats in voting to convict on one article.
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLike previous government shutdowns, the current one — which enters its 13th day on Thursday — has had less impact than you might expect. About two-thirds of government spending is for benefits such as Medicare and Social Security, which are unaffected by shutdowns. Also unaffected are the jobs of federal workers considered essential.\n\nLessening the impact even further, Congress did manage to pass a measure financing the Pentagon, the Department of Health and Human Services and several other large agencies.\n\nNone of this should obscure the fact that this shutdown is both destructive and inane, perhaps more so because Congress, President Donald Trump and even much of the American public seem inured to these periodic events.\n\nThe shutdown is affecting a number of loan programs from the Small Business Administration and other agencies. (Initially, it prevented the issuance of federal flood insurance policies, which are necessary for mortgages in many parts of the country, but the government has apparently found a workaround.) Smithsonian museums are shuttered, and national parks are a mess.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:Sensible border security justifies government shutdown\n\nThe proximate cause of the shutdown is a dispute over funding for Trump's border wall, the one Mexico was supposed to pay for.\n\nPhysical barriers (though not concrete walls) are an important component of border security in certain places along the 2,000-mile border. But much of today's illegal immigration problem involves people who overstay their visas or who wish to be apprehended so they can apply for asylum or refugee status. Trump seemed to comprehend this when he initially signaled he would compromise. But he beat a hasty retreat when he started coming under attack from hard-line conservative pundits and power brokers.\n\nTrump has been seeking $5 billion for the wall; Democrats have been offering $1.3 billion for border security. A deal in this case would not be difficult to envision, as the numbers involved are dwarfed by the $3.8 trillion budget.\n\nIdeally, in return for the Democrats meeting him partway on border security, Trump would agree to end his policy of threatening Dreamers — young adults who were brought here illegally as children — with deportation once their court protection ends.\n\nThis fight over border funding, however, has larger overtones that might stand in the way of a quick resolution. Wednesday's meeting at the White House with congressional leaders ended with no signs of progress.\n\nDemocrats, who take control of the House on Thursday, are happy to finally be in the position of being able to say no to Trump and want to display that power to their rank-and-file voters. They plan to offer a measure funding the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8 and the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has spent his first two years catering to his base and ignoring or insulting just about everyone else. He does not appear inclined to change that now.\n\nThis leaves much of the country wondering when this desultory fight over a relatively small matter will come to an end. From the looks of things, the answer is: not very soon.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.

Our contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, and for 2015 and 2016, the contribution limits are $5,500 for IRAs and $18,000 for 401(k)s (with an extra $1,000 and $6,000 allowed, respectively, for those 50 and older). Thus, if your taxable income is $60,000 and you contribute $10,000 to these accounts, your taxable income is reduced, to $50,000.\n\nIf you're in the 25% tax bracket and you avoid paying $10,000 in taxes in 2016, you save $2,500! If you're able to be more aggressive, and contribute $20,000 to these accounts, you can save a whopping $5,000. Better still, your contributions will go to work for you, and will, ideally, grow over time. Most of us need retirement savings accounts to draw on in retirement, so using IRAs and 401(k)s is a smart thing to do.\n\nIt's not a no-brainer thing to do, though. There are a few more considerations. For one thing, understand that traditional IRAs and 401(k)s let you save tax dollars up front, but you do get taxed eventually -- when you withdraw your money, typically in retirement. At that time, the money is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is often lower in retirement than when you're working.\n\nSo also consider the Roth IRA and the Roth 401(k), which accept post-tax money (i.e., they don't reduce your taxable income for the year of contribution) but are designed to ultimately let you withdraw your money in retirement tax-free. Opt for them and in 2016 you can set yourself up to save thousands in future years.\n\nSean Williams: As we dive headfirst into 2016, one of the smartest money moves you can make, which may be able to save you thousands, is to take advantage of 0% interest, or low-interest, credit cards while you have the opportunity to do so in order to pay down whatever credit card debts you may owe.\n\nAccording to a recent NerdWallet report, the average U.S. household carries a whopping $15,355 in credit card debt; and based on the latest weekly reading from CreditCards.com, the average APR paid on a credit card is 15.07%. These figures imply that the average household is on track to pay in excess of $2,300 this year in credit card interest. Understandably, what you pay will depend on your credit history, credit score, and other variables, but this is money that can be put to better use.\n\nWhile I'm not a huge fan of suggesting that heavily indebted people open a new credit account, I believe opening an account with an extended special offer of 0% APR (say 12 or 18 months), and transferring your interest-bearing balances to your new account, could help save you thousands in 2016. Instead of paying $2,300-plus in interest, you can take that money and apply it, dollar-for-dollar, toward your debt. Historically low lending rates have allowed credit card providers to offer these extended periods of 0% APR, but as lending rates rise you may find these offers to be fewer and far between. Consumers who have this option available probably won't want to sit on this idea for too long, otherwise those special APR deals may disappear.\n\nJordan Wathen: The single smartest thing I think anyone can do is review their spending on recurring expenses at least once each year.\n\nWhile we remember the $15 bag of popcorn we bought at the movies, it's very easy to forget about routine charges for things like auto and home insurance, club and gym memberships, and bills for cell phones and cable. The best part about shaving even a very small amount from a monthly expenditure is that the savings are recurring, month after month and year after year. Cutting $25 off a cable bill isn't just a small, $25 victory, it's a $300 annual triumph.\n\nTake the time in 2016 to look at every single recurring expense with a fine-tooth comb. Shop around for big purchases, particularly things like insurance, cable, and cell phone services. I'd be surprised if the average person couldn't identify at least $1,000 in waste, particularly if they haven't shopped around for major recurring purchases in several years.\n\nDan Caplinger: One of the biggest financial obligations you'll ever carry in your lifetime is the mortgage on your home, and taking advantage of low interest rates on a mortgage loan will definitely save you thousands of dollars over the decades you spend paying it off. Yet even though interest rates have been extremely low for years, some homeowners still haven't taken advantage of the opportunity to refinance their mortgages. The result is monthly payments that are hundreds of dollars higher than they need to be or missing out on the chance to replace an outstanding 30-year mortgage with a new 15-year loan.\n\nTo be fair, there are good reasons why some homeowners haven't refinanced their mortgages. Some haven't been able to refinance, as they've worked to get out of negative equity situations in which they were underwater on their mortgage loans. Others haven't been aware that they might qualify for special government programs designed to help struggling homeowners find refinancing options that otherwise might not be available to them. Regardless of the reason, though, now is a great time to look and see whether you can save on your mortgage. With rates likely to rise now that the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary policy, you might not get a better chance than you have now to save money on a refi.\n\nMatt Frankel: While it may not be the most immediate way to save money, one of the best things you can do over the long term is to work on maximizing your credit score.\n\nIn fact, most of the other money-saving suggestions mentioned here depend on your credit to some extent. As Dan said, refinancing your mortgage can be a great idea, but to get the best interest rate, you'll need a high credit score. And if you have bad credit, Sean's suggestion of using a 0% APR credit card offer to your advantage may not even be an option for you. Finally, good credit can help reduce some of your other expenses like Jordan mentioned, such as insurance premiums and deposits on utilities and cell phones.\n\nAside from obvious solutions such as paying all of your bills on time, there are plenty of other ways you can boost your credit. Just to name a few, here are a couple you may not know.\n\n30% of your FICO score is based on amounts owed, which emphasizes your debtrelative to your credit limits. So, by using Sean's suggestion of opening a new card, you could improve your debt utilization and potentially boost your score, assuming you don't make any new charges.\n\n10% of your score is based on your credit mix -- that is, the variety of credit accounts you have. So, if you have an auto loan but no mortgage or credit cards, it could actually hurt your score. Having several types of accounts is a good thing, even if you don't use your credit card(s) much.\n\nThe point is that there are plenty of things you can do to improve your credit, and doing so can save you tons of money in the long run.\n\nSPONSOR CONTENT: Forget Social Security! 11 Steps for Retiring Early\n\nMillions of Americans have nothing saved for retirement.

That was who he was. Quote icon\n\nThe city prosecutor position was one of his first jobs after graduating from the University of Arizona College of Law in 1972. He stayed only four months before moving to the Pima County Attorney's Office, where he almost didn't get hired because the chief deputy county attorney, James Howard, said he thought Roll was too bashful and quiet to be a trial lawyer.\n\nHoward was wrong. In his seven years in the office, Roll prosecuted more jury trials than anyone in the office and won almost all of them.\n\nIn 1980, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tucson and made a name for himself leading organized crime and drug prosecutions, and his ambition and attention to detail made him a natural for white collar crimes and complex finance cases.\n\nSeven years later, the retirement of Judge Ben Birdsall, one of Roll's mentors, created an opening on the Arizona Court of Appeals, and Roll was one of three names submitted to Gov. Evan Mecham for consideration.\n\nMecham called Roll's home on a Saturday morning, but Roll was at Mass so Mecham asked Roll's wife, Maureen, to take a message. She said she would, but only if it was good news, otherwise, Mecham would have to call back later and tell Roll himself. The governor didn't need to make a second call.\n\nRoll served four years on the Court of Appeals, which included temporary assignments on both the Pima County Superior Court bench and the Arizona Supreme Court. He was nominated to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 and unanimously confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHigh-profile cases\n\nAs a prosecutor Roll put a lot of bad guys in jail, and as a judge he did the same.\n\nAs an acting Arizona Supreme Court justice he authored an opinion upholding the 2,975-year prison sentence of a child molester, and as a federal judge he threw the book at a man and sentenced him to the maximum 10 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend in the face, even though she testified it was an accident and begged Roll for leniency.\n\nJust a few weeks later, Roll, a lifelong Catholic, even put a priest in jail — for embezzling $400,000. He did, however, show his merciful side. Even though the man faced 60 years in prison, Roll gave him six months after receiving hundreds of letters from parishioners who said the priest had used the money to help them buy food and pay rent and medical bills.\n\nHe denied bail for a Border Patrol agent who'd been accused of shooting a suspected border-crosser in the back, saying the fact that the agent had moved the body and delayed reporting the incident indicated he'd tried to conceal the crime. In another high-profile case, he granted bail for one of six suspected members of the Irish Republican Army accused of trying to purchase detonators and a shoulder-fired Stinger missile in Tucson, even though, as a foreign national, prosecutors considered him a flight risk.\n\nGabby Giffords shooting: Who was shot, and how they changed How a mass shooting at a suburban Tucson shopping center on Jan. 8, 2011, changed their lives forever. Thomas Hawthorne, The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nRoll ruled against ranchers who wanted to graze cattle on public lands and declared that the U.S. government had failed to protect critical habitat for the endangered jaguar, which heartened environmentalists. But he infuriated those same environmentalists when he allowed construction of a National Weather Service radar tower to proceed in the mountains southeast of Tucson.\n\nRoll ruled that two children who were conceived from their father's frozen sperm after his death were not allowed to receive his Social Security benefits, a decision that was overturned, but in another case, he hammered the Tucson Unified School District for failing to provide adequate accommodations for a disabled boy. He pointed out that administrators had spent 10 times more in attorney fees than they would have if they had just done the right thing in the first place.\n\nNot everyone who crossed paths with Roll revered him. After the controversial acquittal of the Border Patrol agent charged with fatally shooting an immigrant in the back, the mother of the victim said she believed Roll had been biased in favor of law enforcement at the trial.\n\nCritics also assailed rulings in cases in which he allowed Border Patrol agents to engage in limited racial profiling and to drop in to a border merchant's business without a warrant. Both rulings were eventually overturned.\n\n'Pretty hard to change his mind'\n\nLongtime Tucson attorney Erik O'Dowd, who now lives near Santa Barbara, California, said he felt he didn't get a fair shake from Roll in a financial fraud trial. He said he believed Roll had harbored ill feelings for him stemming from their encounter a decade earlier.\n\nRoll had been a deputy Pima County attorney in the early 1980s, assisting in the prosecution of a high-profile case involving allegations of extreme physical abuse and neglect at an internationally known boarding school on the outskirts of Tucson.\n\nO'Dowd was representing one of the two employees who, along with the school director, were charged in the case.\n\nIt was a slugfest. Their witnesses were kids and disaffected employees, O'Dowd recalled. His client was a teacher and part-time nurse at the school, and I fought really hard because if she was convicted of anything, that would be the end of her career.\n\nThe director was convicted, but O'Dowd's client was acquitted.\n\nI learned this about John, he said, Prosecutors can have a cocktail with their fellow lawyers after a heated day in the courtroom or not. He was a 'not.'\n\nErik O'Dowd, Tucson attorney I learned this about John. Prosecutors can have a cocktail with their fellow lawyers after a heated day in the courtroom or not. He was a not. Quote icon\n\nA decade later, O'Dowd was representing plaintiffs in a class-action suit against retailer Circle K in a case that had bounced among several District Court judges before being assigned to Roll.\n\nIn state courts, attorneys can ask for a different judge without stating a reason, but in federal court, they must prove actual bias or conflict of interest.\n\nThe fact is, I didn't have any proof of factual bias, O'Dowd said. I didn't like him, and he didn't like me at all, both ways, but I couldn't get rid of him.\n\nAlmost from the start, virtually every procedural and evidentiary ruling went against O'Dowd.\n\nAfter we adjourned, I went out in the hallway, and standing there was someone who had been in the audience. He comes up to me and he says, 'That judge hates you, doesn't he?' O'Dowd recounted. That's how palpable it was.\n\nFred Kay, a longtime Tucson federal public defender, argued both against Roll, when he was a prosecutor, and before him, when he was a judge.\n\nHe said Roll was a prosecutor's prosecutor, and a prosecutor's dream as a judge.\n\nKay described Roll as pretty hardcore.\n\nI don't think he could have ever done defense work, Kay said. He was a real kind of law-and-order guy and very serious about what he was doing.\n\nKay remembered watching Roll as the jury came into the courtroom with a verdict in a case they'd argued against each other.\n\nI glanced over at him, Kay said. He was sitting at the table with his hands clasped very tightly. And he was he was looking down with his eyes closed. It was like he was trying to squeeze a guilty verdict out of this jury.\n\nKay's client was acquitted, but he doesn't remember Roll having any particular reaction.\n\nHe said while he never observed any outright bias on Roll's part on the bench, it was clear his experience as a prosecutor informed both his judicial philosophy as well as his temperament.\n\nI think he tried to be very fair, but I think if there was any discretion, it was generally in favor of the prosecution because he believed that people that were charged with things need to be pulled up and pay the price, Kay said.\n\nYou could discuss things with him, but it was pretty hard to change his mind, Kay said. He sort of had blinders on once he decided what the case was all about.\n\nMichael Piccarreta, Tucson attorney John called balls and strikes. Calls went one way and calls went the other way. He did not have an impact on the outcome. Quote icon\n\nMichael Piccarreta, one of Tucson's most prominent defense attorneys, also argued both against and before Roll.\n\nHe said he didn't mind that Roll approached cases from the point of view as a prosecutor, and in fact appreciated it.\n\nIt was interesting because we're sort of different personalities. He was sort of a conservative prosecutor, and I'm sort of a progressive defense lawyer, but we got along because he played it straight, Piccarreta said. He was not a bully, which you see too often these days with prosecutors. He was just a lawyer handling a case, and I was a lawyer on the other side.\n\nPiccarretta was the defense attorney who represented Michael Elmer, the border agent accused of shooting the immigrant in the back. Elmer was initially tried and acquitted in state court, then retried on civil rights violations in federal court.\n\nThough the victim's mother was critical of Roll, Piccarreta said Roll went by the book.\n\nIt was a relatively long trial, and John called balls and strikes. Calls went one way and calls went the other way. He did not have an impact on the outcome. The judge is the umpire and not the coach.\n\nEven so, Roll received death threats when Elmer was acquitted a second time. Elmer was subsequently charged in an unrelated, non-fatal shooting case. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time he had already served.\n\nDecisions and threats\n\nIt was not the only time Roll would be threatened. Two years before his death, Roll presided over a case in which 16 immigrants who were in the country illegally claimed they were detained at gunpoint, kicked, beaten and threatened with dogs by a rancher named Roger Barnett after crossing his land near the border.\n\nThe case erupted as anti-immigrant fervor was just beginning to grip the nation, and Barnett was hailed as the vigilante rancher by right-wing cable TV personalities Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs. Barnett sought to have the case dismissed on the grounds that non-U.S. citizens had no right to sue over civil rights violations because they had no civil rights.\n\nA mourner holds a program from the memorial service for Judge John M. Roll. Getty Images\n\nRoll rejected the argument and allowed the case to move forward to a jury. It was one of the first times in history that individuals who were in the country illegally were allowed to sue someone over civil rights violations.\n\nArmed federal marshals were assigned to Roll's courtroom because of threats that ensued from the talk-radio-fueled frenzy around the case, and Roll and his family were assigned 24-hour security for a month.\n\nFederal marshals accompanied him everywhere, from his morning swims to his daily mass attendance, prompting one, who was Catholic, to quip that he'd been to Mass more times in 30 days than he had in 30 years.\n\nIt becomes very uncomfortable to live under that situation, said Zapata, one of Roll's close colleagues on the bench. You're living with the U.S. Marshals. They're at your house. You're living with them escorting you to and from wherever you want to go. It limits your movement, and it reinforces the fact that you are in danger and your family is in danger.\n\nZapata, who keeps a framed copy of Roll's funeral program on his desk adorned with a small American flag, recalled another high-profile case Roll had ruled on years earlier.\n\nThis one involved a challenge to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act by former Graham County Sheriff and Second Amendment activist Richard Mack, who claimed that a provision of the law that required local law enforcement agencies to conduct background checks was unconstitutional.\n\nRoll agreed and struck down that provision of the law. He was later reversed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which was in turn reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, allowing Roll's ruling to stand.\n\nHe made that decision based strictly on the law and what was Constitutional, Zapata said. But in the end it was a terrible irony that he ended up being killed by a kid who tried to buy a gun at one place and they told him no, and he went to another place and got the gun that he ended up taking out to the Congress on Your Corner.\n\nAt the Safeway\n\nWhen Roll arrived at the Safeway that morning to thank Giffords, there was already a long line, and he thought about leaving and coming back when the crowd thinned out.\n\nBut he ran into an old friend from his undergraduate days at the University of Arizona, Ron Barber, who was Giffords' chief of staff and would later succeed her in office after she was forced to step down because of her injuries from the shooting.\n\nRoll and Barber first met passing out literature for the campus Democrats.\n\nIt was a secret that Roll, a die-hard conservative, rarely admitted to, but he was a fan of John F. Kennedy. He also admired Robert F. Kennedy's work as his brother's attorney general — it was one of the things that had propelled him to law school..\n\nBarber and Roll had lost touch after college, but they reconnected when Giffords was elected. Barber said that despite the years and their diverging political paths, Roll was just as committed to human dignity as he was in college.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords talks with then-Rep. Ron Barber before the dedication of the John M. Roll U.S. Courthouse in Yuma on April 24, 2014. David Wallace/The Republic\n\nBarber got to witness an example of that up close.\n\nNot long after a Giffords was elected, a conservative Texas congressman came to Tucson for the city's famed gem and mineral show and scheduled a meeting with Roll, Giffords and others so he could claim the trip was for official business, Barber said.\n\nAs this meeting went along, this guy was just talking in such a disparaging way about people who were undocumented, Barber recalled. At one point the congressman said we need to get this clutter off the border, meaning people who are coming here for refuge or work.\n\nBarber said he could see Roll getting more and more upset.\n\nHe said, 'Congressman, in our court the people you are talking about are defendants, not clutter. That's not language we use in my court.' That shut the congressman up right away, Barber said.\n\nThough he was very conservative in his political beliefs, he was really strong on the issue of due process and people who deserve to be treated with respect no matter what their issue was.\n\nBarber was standing next to Giffords at the Safeway on the day of the shooting when he spotted Roll in the crowd. He walked over and asked if he was there to see Giffords.\n\nHe said, 'Yeah, but there's a long line. I won't bother her now, I'll come back later,' Barber said.\n\nHe still struggles with what happened next.\n\nI said no, 'no, John, I know that as soon as she's done talking to these constituents she'll want to talk with you,' Barber said. He walked around the table and stood right beside me, and within a second of that, that's when the shooter shot Gabby. We were both watching, and then he turned the gun on me and John.\n\nLaw-enforcement authorities converge on the scene of the deadly shooting near Tucson in January 2011. U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was injured. The Republic\n\nA store surveillance video appears to show Roll pushing Barber out of the way and then lying on top of him as if to protect him.\n\nWhen you see the video, that's what it looks like for sure, said Barber, who suffered gunshot wounds to his face and groin.\n\nA news story about the video came out about a week after the shooting, and Roll's wife called Barber.\n\nMaureen called me, and she was really upset, not about the article but about the impact it might have on me, Barber said. In the middle of all this emotion, that she was so kind in the midst of having just lost her husband three or four days earlier, that's the kind of family they that they are.\n\nIt was not her only act of compassion.\n\nWhen it came time to sentence the man who killed her husband and five other people, she did not want him to receive the death penalty, but instead wanted him placed where he could not harm anyone else.\n\nFaith and strength\n\nIn the days after her husband's death, Maureen Roll was besieged with interview requests, including one from a national reporter who called her home at 6 a.m.\n\nShe has never granted an interview, but she responded to a personal letter from an Arizona Republic reporter via e-mail, apologizing for not writing a formal letter.\n\nI understand that you believe his story got lost amid the horrible headlines in the days after his death, she wrote. But a lack of attention to his life is not how my family and I felt then or now. There is always something to remind us of this tragedy. I am well aware that it will all come up again this January 8th.\n\nRoll said her husband would not have wanted to be in the spotlight.\n\nThe idea of you writing a story about him and not about all those who were killed and injured would have made him very uncomfortable, she said.\n\nCandles surround portraits of federal judge John Roll and U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at a memorial following the Jan. 8, 2011, mass shooting. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nRoll said she received more than a thousand cards, letters and gifts after her husband's death, including one from President Barack Obama as well as several from people who said Roll had changed their lives by sending them to prison. She answered each one personally.\n\nShe and Roll were high-school sweethearts, and friends described them as not only joined at the hip, but at the heart.\n\n(She also held him to account. Zapata, the judge and colleague, recalled how Roll once bought a new golf shirt and proudly showed it off to Maureen. She said, 'Let me get this straight,' Zapata recalled. 'You guys are sneaking off to play golf wearing shirts with the U.S. District Court logo on them?')\n\nWhile Roll was an early riser, his wife was not, so he would bring her coffee in bed which she would drink while he read scriptures to prepare for the day.\n\nI believe his faith gave him strength in life and as a judge, Maureen Roll wrote, adding that his devotion began at an early age.\n\nThat faith made him gravitate toward other men of faith, like Chief Judge Snow and fellow District Court Judge James Teilborg, with whom Roll talked with almost daily.\n\nHe was Catholic and I'm Protestant, but when you get past the faith traditions, we were clearly Bible oriented, Bible-believing Christians, Teilborg said.\n\nNeither of Roll's parents graduated from high school, but both were devout Catholics. Though they didn't have much money, they sent their children to parochial schools.\n\nAccording to a profile in a Federal Bar Association magazine, Roll's father had worked with Gulf Oil in Pittsburgh, where Roll was born. The family moved to Tucson when Roll was in elementary school, hoping the warm dry climate would help his mother's severe rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHis father worked as a maintenance man and a carpenter in Tucson and never was able to find a job that paid as well as the one he left in Pittsburgh, but the sacrifice he made for his wife's help left an impression on Roll.\n\nEsther McCarthy Roll died at age 51, when Roll was a freshman in high school.\n\nHer sense of humor, bravery in coping with her medical condition, and convictions forever shaped his life, the article says. John remembers her emphasis on doing what is right even if popular opinion is to the contrary, and the God-given dignity of every human being.\n\nShow caption Hide caption A bust of the late Judge John Roll is in the lobby of the John M.

Roll was among six people who died in front of the Tucson grocery store after stopping by to greet Rep. Gabby Giffords on Jan. 8, 2011. Charlie Leight/The Republic\n\nThat was reflected in a letter to the editor Roll wrote to the Tucson Citizen when he was 18, calling for a more humane immigration policy.\n\nWhen we reject potential citizens on the illogical basis of nationality, he wrote, we are rejecting the principles upon which America was founded.\n\nRoll would later legally change his middle name to McCarthy, her maiden name, in her honor.\n\nMaureen Roll said she didn't know what triggered her husband's devotion to conservative ideals, especially after he had skipped school to see John F. Kennedy when he campaigned in Tucson.\n\nSeveral friends said that while Roll admired Robert Kennedy, especially his crusade against organized crime and his emphasis on dignity for all, he may have felt the Republican party's stance on crime and civil unrest was more in tune with his personal sense of order, while the Democratic party position on other issues, like abortion, was out of step with his religious beliefs.\n\nMaureen and John Roll were married for 41 years and had three boys. John Roll relished weekend camping trips with the family to nearby Mount Lemmon, especially with his grandchildren, who knew him as Papa.\n\nAccording to The Federal Lawyer profile, Roll redoubled his commitment to his family after his youngest son became seriously ill as a child.\n\nRoll had been attending a seminar out of town when the boy was hospitalized in a pediatric intensive care unit with a high fever and uncontrolled seizures. By the time Roll got there a priest had already administered the sacrament of Last Rites to the child.\n\nThey boy recovered, but the episode left Roll shaken, and, according to the profile, he resolved to reprioritize his life.\n\nIt was a vow he kept, despite a personality that was not type A, but type triple A and despite a crushing workload that he was reluctant to share because it would put an extra burden on his colleagues, Maureen Roll said.\n\nThe boys and I always felt we were the top priority in his life, despite his life as the Chief Judge for Arizona, Maureen Roll wrote.\n\nAt this point, all my family and I have left are our personal memories of a wonderful husband, father, and papa. But, I can sum up much about John in a few words. As I said, he was a very humble man. He was kind and respectful to everyone he met. He was a brilliant and fair judge. He was a devout Catholic. He loved his family. He loved this country and what it stands for.\n\nSeveral years after Roll's death, a new federal courthouse was built in Yuma to help with the tidal wave of immigration cases in Arizona. It was one of the projects Roll and Giffords had worked on together and one of things that brought him to the Safeway parking lot that day.\n\nThe U.S. Senate, which had voted unanimously to confirm John McCarthy Roll in 1991, again unanimously voted to name the Yuma courthouse in his honor.\n\nDignitaries walk out of the John M. Roll U.S. Courthouse in Yuma, during the dedication ceremony on Thursday, April 24, 2014. David Wallace/The Republic\n\nThis year, another memorial, this one for all the victims of the Jan. 8 shooting, as well as the first responders who helped them, will be dedicated not far from the federal building in downtown Tucson.\n\nRoll's colleagues, the judges and magistrates of the Arizona district, contributed $50,000 toward a garden for the memorial, filled with desert plants that will attract hummingbirds, which Roll loved to watch every morning while he was having his breakfast.\n\nA nearby memorial wall contains stylized symbols representing the important things in the lives of everyone who was shot that day.\n\nRoll's life is summed up in seven symbols:\n\nA gavel, representing his role as chief judge.\n\nA Celtic cross, representing his faith.\n\nA quill and scroll, representing his love for the Constitution.\n\nA guitar, representing his love of music.\n\nAnd a swimmer, representing his favorite physical regimen.\n\nThe last two symbols are an image representing his family, which he loved more than anything, and a hummingbird.\n\nHis grandchildren said the hummingbird was a sign that Papa is in heaven.\n\nEvent marks 10-year anniversary of Giffords shooting Watch\n\nJohn D'Anna is a reporter on The Arizona Republic/azcentral.com storytelling team.

Iran has been rocked by its most significant anti-government protests since a disputed presidential election in 2009. Six days of unrest across the country have resulted in more than 20 deaths and hundreds of arrests.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the country's enemies of meddling in recent protest rallies. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called Tuesday for an emergency U.N. meeting to discuss the crisis.\n\nHere's what the protests are all about:\n\nIt's the economy, stupid?\n\nThe unrest started Thursday as a protest over Iran's beleaguered economy. Unemployment is high at 12% and the costs of basic necessities such as dairy products have been spiraling. The protests have since widened to a more general expression of anger over alleged government corruption and discontent with Iran's clerical rulers. There have been calls for Khamenei, the supreme leader, to step aside.\n\nWhere are the protests taking place?\n\nThe protests kicked off in the northeast city of Mashad when people took to the streets to convey their disappointment over President Hassan Rouhani's failure to deliver on promised economic prosperity after a nuclear deal with world powers. As news of the protests spread on social media through Telegram and WhatsApp — widely used in Iran — protests erupted in other cities, including Isfahan and the capital Tehran.\n\nHow has the government responded?\n\nSecurity services have used force and tear gas to disperse crowds. At least 21 people have died and 450 have been arrested nationwide, according to Iranian media. Tehran's Revolutionary Court warned Tuesday that arrested protesters could potentially face the death penalty when they come to trial. Authorities have also tried to slow, and in some cases, block access to the Internet and ban some international calls. At the same time, Rouhani struck a conciliatory tone and said protesters have a right to be heard as long as they do so according to the constitution.\n\nWithout naming a specific country or organization, Khamenei accused Iran's enemies on Tuesday of meddling in the recent protest rallies.\n\nMore:Iran's Supreme leader blames 'enemies' for meddling in protests\n\nMore:Trump backs Iran protesters, hits Obama for nuclear deal\n\nHow has the White House reacted?\n\nSince the protests started President Trump has taken to Twitter on multiple occasions to let Iran's government know that he is watching closely. He has also expressed solidarity with the protesters and their poor economic prospects. Yet Trump also tried to characterize the protests as a direct result of Iran's foreign policy in the Middle East. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism, he said in one tweet. On Tuesday, the administration called on Iran to stop blocking Instagram and other social media sites and encouraged Iranians to use special software to circumvent controls, such as virtual private networks, known as VPNs, said Undersecretary of State Steve Goldstein.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIran's security forces ultimately crushed the 2009 Green Movement, when millions marched in protest over the disputed re-election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. So far, the current scale of the protests is much smaller, and it is not clear how much public dissent Iran's government is willing to tolerate.\n\nTrump is considering imposing new sanctions on those responsible for the crackdown on protesters, presidential aide Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday. That comes as Trump faces a congressional deadline this month on whether to certify that Iran is meeting the terms of the 2015 nuclear accord with the U.S. and other nations.
DJ Jaffe\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn his inaugural address on Jan. 1, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, like other governors, announced that he will push for the legalization of recreational marijuana, but he said nothing about what he will do to mitigate the health risks. Before legislators legalize marijuana, they should require bold and direct warning labels to be placed on the packaging as is done with tobacco products. If the states fail to act, then the Food and Drug Administration should step in and require it.\n\nIn early 2017, after exhaustive review, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that there are significant health risks associated with using cannabis and cannabinoids. Yet none of the 33 states that have legalized medical marijuana, or the 10 states that have legalized recreational use, gives adequate warnings of those risks.\n\nThe situation is similar to when cigarettes first became extensively marketed. The health risks were known but not disclosed, leading to disease and lives being lost. In addition to appearing on the packaging, the warning labels should be displayed prominently wherever the product is sold, in advertising and in mandated public service announcements funded by the marijuana industry.\n\nRead more commentary:Marijuana legalization is working; most Americans are on board: Today's talker\n\nThe cannabis industry is creating jobs worth having\n\nDon't legalize recreational marijuana in my state. Marijuana is still a harmful mind-altering drug.\n\nThe academies, founded by Congress, comprise the country's leading researchers. They have become the nation's most reputable arbiters of the science that should guide policy. The findings of the report, The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids, were particularly disturbing for people prone to mental illness and those who have a mental illness.\n\nThe report found either substantial or moderate evidence of an association between cannabis use and the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses; increased symptoms of mania and hypomania in individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorders; increased risk for the development of depressive disorders; and increased incidence of suicidal ideation, attempts and completions.\n\nSchizophrenia and bipolar disorders are two of the most devastating neurobiological disorders and the ones that are often associated with homelessness and incarceration. If there is an association with using legalized marijuana, shouldn't the public be warned?\n\nLabels provide consumers info to avoid danger\n\nThe risks are not limited to mental impairments alone. The reviewers found substantial evidence of an association between cannabis smoking and worse respiratory symptoms, more frequent chronic bronchitis episodes, increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, and lower birth weight of the offspring of those who use cannabis and cannabinoids. For pediatric populations, there is moderate evidence of an association between cannabis use and increased risk of overdose injuries, including respiratory distress.\n\nIn the rush to legalize and decriminalize marijuana, these risks are largely being ignored. Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana. While both warn pregnant mothers not to use it, the only other significant warning on the packaging is that there may be health risks, a watered-down mealy mouthed warning that fails to give consumers the concrete information they need to avoid danger.\n\nWhile the National Academies found association, association is not the same as causality. Perhaps the increased risk of schizophrenia developing is because those who are prone to schizophrenia also are prone to use these products.\n\nBut until we know the chicken-or-egg answer, we should not follow the example of the tobacco regulation where the product was allowed to be marketed unencumbered by warnings, leading to more than 480,000 deaths a year, and subsequently the spending of millions of dollars re-educating consumers who had been misled in the first place.\n\nIf marijuana is to be legalized, let's get it right from Day One.\n\nDJ Jaffe, author of Insane Consequences: How the Mental Health Industry Fails the Mentally Ill, is executive director of Mental Illness Policy Org.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank will be patient as it weighs future interest rate hikes in light of low inflation, adding that policymakers will also take into account recent stock market volatility.\n\nPowell seemed to deliberately convey a more cautious approach to rate hikes this year than he did during a news conference last month after the Fed raised rates for a fourth time in 2018.\n\nWith muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said in a discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at the American Economic Association and Allied Social Science Association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The talk was moderated by New York Times reporter Neil Irwin.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, already up about 400 points after a booming jobs report, leaped another 400 points by early afternoon following Powell's remarks.\n\nPowell also said he would not resign if asked to do so by President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell for lifting rates and crimping the faster economic growth Trump has promised. Trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of firing Powell, news that further intensified a market sell-off last month.\n\nA president can dismiss a Fed board member only for cause, and it's unclear if he can remove a Fed chief who could continue to serve on the board. Experts, however, have said such a move would roil markets and jeopardize the Fed's independence.\n\nWhile Fed officials have been providing a generally upbeat view of the economy, Powell noted the market has plunged from its early fall peak because of fears of slowing global growth and the Trump administration's trade fight with China, among other factors.\n\nWe're listening carefully to that, and we're going to be taking that downside risk into account as Fed policymakers decide whether to raise interest rates, Powell said Friday.\n\nHe seemed to compare the Fed's flexible approach to early 2016, when the central bank forecast four rate hikes that year but wound up hiking just once amid a market sell-off, economic troubles abroad and a drop in oil prices.\n\nPowell's message was unmistakable, in our opinion, says economist Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase.\n\nPowell also said the Fed would be willing to pause its campaign to shrink the $3.5 trillion portfolio of bonds that it purchased during and after the Great Recession to lower long-term interest rates – presumably if the economy weakened significantly.\n\nWe said we'd be prepared to adjust the plan as appropriate to achieve our objectives of solid economic growth and stable inflation, Powell said. We wouldn't hesitate to change it.\n\nBy contrast, at his December news conference, Powell reiterated the Fed's view that the balance sheet reduction was on autopilot and the Fed was relying on its benchmark short-term interest rate to tweak the economy's temperature. His remarks further fueled investor concerns that Powell and the Fed were blithely moving forward with a campaign to tap the brakes on the economy despite scant evidence of inflation, market turbulence, slowing global growth and forecasts for weakening activity in the U.S.\n\nFed officials instead focused on the economy's recent performance, which has reflected healthy growth and unemployment that has dropped below 4 percent.\n\nLast month, Fed policymakers forecast two rate hikes in 2019, down from its previous estimate of three, but fed fund futures markets were pricing in just one move. Lately, markets have expected none.\n\nThe stock market punished the Fed by plummeting further after Powell's December news conference, hurting consumer and business confidence and raising the prospect that the dimmer outlook could itself hurt the economy.\n\nOn Friday, Powell seemed to be acknowledging that he and other Fed officials got the message, and markets responded in kind.\n\nWhen we get conflicting signals, policy is very much about risk management, Powell said.
Potentially huge news from the Japan Times: MLB confirmed that it is investigating Texas Rangers starter Yu Darvish to determine if he had any connection to the illegal gambling ring that got his brother Sho Darvish arrested by Osaka police in October.\n\nYu Darvish has not been accused of any wrongdoing by the Osaka police at this point, but MLB has confirmed that it is conducting a probe to find out if there is any link between the ace and the reason for his younger brother's arrest in October. We are aware of this situation and are looking into it, per our standard protocols, MLB's vice president for communications Michael Teevan wrote in a recent email to The Japan Times. (Sho Darvish) is alleged to have accepted some 1,850 wagers valued at ¥10,000 each on pro games in both North America and Japan. It is still unclear whether or not any of the bets were taken on games involving the Rangers.\n\nThere's nothing yet to suggest the pitching Darvish had anything to do with his younger brother's gambling activities, though it's worth noting that Sho Darvish's arrest came after an investigation lasting more than a year — suggesting he could have been betting on baseball games while Yu Darvish was an active big leaguer in 2014. The right-hander missed the entire 2015 season following Tommy John surgery.\n\nFamily can always complicate decisions, but it doesn't appear Darvish would have much to gain for participating. Even if Sho Darvish somehow won every single bet he accepted according to the allegations, he would have made less than $3 million total, a fraction of the $56 million Darvish will have earned from the Rangers by the time his contract expires. And Darvish denied any involvement in a statement Tuesday:\n\nYu Darvish releases a statement about the gambling inquiry, and any probes into his involvement with his brother. pic.twitter.com/aHLM30Qa9w — Mike Leslie (@MikeLeslieWFAA) January 19, 2016\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred's December decision to uphold Pete Rose's lifetime ban shows that Major League Baseball has no intentions of changing its zero-tolerance policy for gamblers, so if the league finds any evidence of Darvish's wrongdoing, it could prove devastating for both the Rangers and his promising career. The 29-year-old owns a career 3.27 ERA with an astonishing 680 strikeouts in 545 1/3 innings.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump touted his decision to order the killing of Qasem Soleimani at a campaign rally in Ohio on Thursday, describing the Iranian general as a sadistic mass murderer and signaling the confrontation will play into his reelection campaign.\n\nDays after a crisis with Iran threatened to upend his presidency and drag the U.S. into another Middle East war, Trump spoke at length about what he described as bold and decisive action to deliver American justice via a U.S. drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport that killed Soleimani last week.\n\nHe was looking very seriously at our embassies, Trump said. We stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.\n\nThe rally – Trump'sfirst of 2020 –provided the president a venue to explain the latest developments in the Middle East and the perilous relationship between the U.S. and Iran to his supporters. Trump's extensive remarks on Iran suggested he will use the strike on Soleimani to laud his foreign policy to voters inthis year's election.\n\nTrump touched on the Iranian response to Soleimani's death, saying the U.S. was ready to go if Iran's rocket attack inflicted additional damage or resulted in the death of U.S. soldiers stationed on the two Iraqi bases that were targeted. Trump said Iran hit us with 16 missiles but thathe decided to stand down after he saw the relatively minor impact, which he attributed to a pretty good warning system.\n\nSo we didn't do anything...Not that I wanted to, but we were ready he said. You have no idea.Lot of people got very lucky.\n\nWar powers:House votes to limit Trump's ability to wage war with Iran after Soleimani\n\nThe crowd roared as Trump discussed the strike and blasted Democrats for attempting to curb his ability to launch strikes against Iran. Trump's rally came hours after the Democratic-led House passed a resolution aimed at limiting his war powers. Democrats have criticized Trump for not consulting Congress on the Soleimani strike and have accused him of recklessness.\n\nWe got a call. We heard where he was, Trump said. And we had to make a decision. We didn't have time to call up Nancy [Pelosi], who is not operating with a full deck.\n\nIn the aftermath of the strike against Soleimani Republicans embraced the move and praised Trump for taking action against a country that has been widely perceived as a bad actor in the Middle East. But the president can't necessarily count on the issue unifying American voters ahead of the election.\n\nAmericans by more than 2-1 said the killing of Soleimani has made the United States less safe, a nationwide USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found Thursday. A majority of those surveyed, by 52%-34%, called Trump's behavior with Iran reckless.\n\nMore:Americans say Soleimani's killing made US less safe, Trump 'reckless' on Iran\n\nAmericans were divided on the wisdom of the drone strike at the Baghdad airport that killed Soleimani and others: 42% supported it, 33% opposed it; 25% said they didn't know what to think. Republicans were much more supportive than Democrats; independents were almost evenly split.\n\nWe seek friends, not enemies, Trump told the rally audience.\n\nBut, he added, if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril.\n\nMinutes after Trump took the stage his remarks were interrupted by protesters holding a banner that read: NO WAR.\n\nThe Toledo rally is one of three Trump has scheduled this month. The others are set for Wisconsin, a critical state for his reelection effort, and New Jersey. It was his first major political event since the confrontation with Iran escalated.\n\nTrump has raised Iran at virtually every political rally he has hosted since entering the White House in 2017. His remarks on one of Washington's most challenging foes in the Middle East have generally focused on the 2015 multi-national nuclear agreement that offered sanctions relief in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program.\n\nTrump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement in 2018, arguing it did not do enough to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nIran and the U.S. bothmoved Wednesday to deescalate the confrontation. Trump largely avoided saber-rattling during a nine-minute address to the nation and even suggested the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. Iranian leaders, including foreign minister Javad Zarif described the attack as self-defense.\n\nIran crash:Trump says he thinks 'something very terrible happened' to Ukraine jet\n\nTrump address:Trump, Tehran step back from war footing after Iran's attack in Iraq\n\nTrump faced a similar test in 2017 as his rhetoric over North Korea began to boil. Trump held an Arizona rally at the end of August just weeks after he threatened to rain fire and fury on North Korea. Trump raised the issue at that rally, though his remarks were overshadowed by his comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nWhat I said, that's not strong enough, Trump said, referring to his fire and fury tweet. Some people said it's too strong; it's not strong enough. But Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us. I respect that fact very much.\n\nThe rally in Ohio also comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is poised to send impeachment articles to the Senate, which will determine whether to remove Trump from office. Pelosi said Thursday that she would transmit those articles soon. The Republican-led Senate is expected to acquit Trump on the charges of abusing his power and obstructing the congressional probe into his interactions with Ukraine.\n\nTrump slammed Pelosi and other Democrats for pursuing the impeachment, arguing that the House speaker is not playing with a full deck.\n\nMore:Pelosi says she'll send Senate articles of impeachment against Trump 'soon'\n\nMore:Trump says environmental policy change would fix 'regulatory nightmare'\n\nTrump carried Ohio in the 2016 election with nearly 52% of the vote. By rallying in Toledo he can also draw from supporters in nearby Michigan, which he won narrowly.\n\nContributing: Susan Page, Nicholas Wu, Christal Hayes
WASHINGTON – William Taylor, who was top American diplomat in Ukraine and an impeachment inquiry witness, has departed his post as chargé d'affaires ad interim in the country.\n\nTaylor, a West Point graduate and long-time diplomat, testified twice in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, providing key testimony. Taylor succeeded ousted Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in June when she was unexpectedly removed from her position by the White House.\n\nThe embassy posted a farewell message on New Year's Eve from Taylor that reads he knew he would be serving in the position for a limited period of time.\n\nTaylor, who previously served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, emphasized the strong support the U.S. has for Ukraine that is bipartisan support, and declared that The time since June has been a great one, it's an exciting time to be in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine stated Thursday that Kristina Kvien has taken over Taylor's role. She was serving as deputy chief of mission at the embassy.\n\nPresidential election 2020: Marianne Williamson lays off entire campaign staff\n\nIn a video message posted Thursday, Kvien said that While the embassy's leadership is changing, our policy of strong support for Ukraine remains steady.\n\nOur embassy team will continue to partner closely with the Ukrainian government and civil society in support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and in support of reforms that will help Ukraine build its prosperous European future, she continued.\n\nTrump yanked Yovanovitch from her post in April, after his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, targeted her with what other diplomats described as a smear campaign.\n\nTaylor emphasized in his testimony that an irregular backchannel existed regarding policy in Ukraine, and said that after security assistance was held up, The irregular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy.\n\nTaylor told lawmakers that he had heard from a Ukraine official that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky did not want to be used as a pawn in the U.S. re-election campaign.\n\nHe also said it was crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\n\nThe inquiry built upon Trump's phone call on July 25 to Zelensky, when he urged the investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden while withholding nearly $400 million in congressioally-approved military aid.\n\nTrump was impeached in December by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nMore:Trump says he has been denied due process. But the Constitution does not afford him that.\n\nTaylor told lawmakers during the inquiry that the chargé d'affaires position is one he took with hesitancy. He was recruited by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to fill in.\n\nPompeo postponed an upcoming trip that included a stop in Ukraine to meet with President Zelensky in order to focus on the security situation in Iraq, the State Department announced Wednesday.\n\nThe visit was intended to address the U.S. commitment to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression and to support Zelensky's anti-corruption agenda, a senior State Department official told reporters Monday on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to nominate a new ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nContributing: William Cummings, Jeanine Santucci, Nicholas Wu
Leaders in major American cities ramped up security measures in the wake of a U.S.-ordered airstrike that killed Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani. New York City and Los Angeles officials announced they are monitoring for potential retaliation.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in statements late Thursday night and Friday that there are no known credible threats to the city but that the police department is increasing its presence. There will be more officers and more unpredictability, de Blasio said.\n\nThe finest police force in America is protecting New Yorkers, de Blasio said at a news conference Friday. Go on with your lives. Never be intimidated by the threat of terror, but be vigilant.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed late Thursday that President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani as a defensive action as the Iranian general planned attacks against American diplomats and service members. Iran warned that a harsh retaliation is waiting for the United States.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that there are no specific, credible threats against our homeland but that the DHS stands ready to confront and combat any and all threats facing our homeland.\n\nHow we got here:Qassem Soleimani's killing is the latest in Iran-US tensions\n\nSoleimani was the head of Iran's Quds Force and was involved in military and intelligence operations, including a two-day siege against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. His killing marked an escalation in the conflict between the United States and Iran and sparked fears about retaliation.\n\nThe National Iranian American Council's president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement Thursday that the U.S. move was profoundly reckless and called on leaders to halt the escalation spiral.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department tweeted that it is monitoring the events developing in Iran, but it said there is no credible threat in LA.\n\nThis Department is committed to ensuring the safety of our vibrant and diverse community, and we ask every Angeleno to say something if you see something, the LAPD said.\n\nThe Boston Police Department said it would increase patrols, and Chicago will increase security in airports. Both cities said they are not aware of any credible threats but urged residents and visitors to report anything suspicious.\n\nAs an added precautionary measure, we will have an increased security presence at our airports and have reached out to our public and private sector partners with reminders to stay vigilant after the holiday season, the Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications said in a statement.\n\nSome in the Iranian American community expressed concern that police departments may target and stigmatize them.\n\nRyan Costello, policy director for the National Iranian American Council, told USA TODAY that as tensions heightened between the United States and Iran, Iranian Americans have seen a corresponding threat to civil liberties.\n\nIran is perceived as a very bad actor, as a terrorist and so forth Costello said. And therefore, Iranian Americans are subject to increased suspicion, screening at airports, xenophobia.\n\nCostello said cities' concerns about being targeted by Iranian retaliation can be seen as alarmist.\n\nI think it reflects how poorly people in general understand the Iranian American community and Iran. Iran, it's a negative actor in the region and so forth. But a lot of their actions are confined to the region, Costello said.\n\nI'm worried that people are going to say, 'Oh, OK, because you're Iranian American, you're under suspicion,'  Costello said.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu, Deirdre Shesgreen, Tom Vanden Brook and Kim Hjelmgaard
Monte Shaw\n\nEvery four years, reporters from big-city news organizations flock to Iowa to cover our first-in-the-nation caucuses. And just as routinely, there are two types of stories filed by these reporters.\n\nThe first type claims that agriculture-and-renewable-fuel issues no longer carry the sway they once did in Iowa. The second type bemoans that Iowa has too much influence over national energy policy because of leverage from the caucuses.\n\nI must admit, it is most amusing when a reporter tries to make both of these irreconcilable points in the same story. Logically, both of these points cannot be true. But, the fact is, both of the points are false.\n\nTo the first point, recent polling by The Des Moines Register shows strong, bipartisan support among Iowa voters for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the law requiring oil companies to allow a small amount of biofuels to enter the marketplace.\n\nMore important, candidates know that ag and renewable fuels are important. According to America's Renewable Future, 12 of the 14 candidates running for president are ranked as good on the RFS. Even more striking, the candidates rated as bad for not supporting the RFS have spent an immense amount of time in Iowa touting alternative plans to boost higher ethanol blends.\n\nGet rid of ethanol mandate: Our view\n\nTo the second point, the rise of super PACs has provided the deep-pocketed oil industry a tool to reshape political and policy reality. Frankly, the Iowa caucuses provide the one and only time every four years when ag-and-biofuels supporters can stand toe-to-toe with petroleum.\n\nThough the Iowa caucuses might open the ears of presidential candidates, it is ultimately the facts that win over candidates. Facts like: Taxpayers have subsidized oil for over a century; artificial regulatory barriers block market access for renewable fuels; and, when given a choice, consumers prefer renewable fuels.\n\nIt's hard to say you don't want the government picking winners and losers when you are forced to confront the reality that current law favors oil. In context, the RFS is sound public policy that encourages market competition and gives consumers the chance to make their own fuel choice.\n\nMonte Shaw is executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.
William Petroski\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, said while campaigning in Iowa on Monday that he had no knowledge about a standoff in eastern Oregon where armed anti-government protesters have taken over a federal wildlife refuge.\n\nThe Oregon protest, which began Saturday night, has attracted national news headlines on radio, TV, newspapers and from Internet sources. But Kasich repeatedly told a reporter from The Des Moines Register on Monday that he didn't know anything about it. Then Kasich excused himself and headed outside to his vehicle.\n\nOregon militia takeover: How did we get here?\n\nKasich's profession of no knowledge about the situation was unexpected because presidential candidates who visit Iowa are routinely quizzed at length about current events and policy issues while on the campaign trail. His response to the question about the incident involving federal property in Oregon came just after he finished a campaign appearance before more than 100 people at a coffee shop in West Des Moines' historic Valley Junction business district. During his remarks to the audience, he talked at length about how he would respond in a tough manner against Islamic State terrorists if he were elected to the White House.\n\nHere is a transcript of the conversation between The Des Moines Register reporter and Kasich:\n\nReporter: What do you think about the situation in Oregon, that standoff there?\n\nKasich: What? I haven't heard about it.\n\nReporter: Where people took over federal land?\n\nKasich: No, I haven't heard about this. When did this come out?\n\nReporter: Yesterday.\n\nKasich: Yeah, I am not familiar with it. OK. I've got to get out of here.\n\nThe anti-government occupation is occurring at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The protesters are reportedly upset over looming prison sentences for local ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond.
MILWAUKEE – Tashonna Ward, a 25-year-old day care teacher from Milwaukee, died Jan. 2 while trying to find a doctor to help her.\n\nWard's family is seeking answers from Froedtert Hospital, where she spent more than two hours in the emergency department before she left to find quicker care and, later, collapsed. She had reported chest pain and tightness of breath.\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office has not determined the cause of death. Its report doesn't say whether Ward was admitted or seen by a doctor at Froedtert before she left.\n\nWard's family says she was kept in the waiting room and was not under any monitoring when she decided to leave.\n\nA spokesperson for Froedtert Hospital provided a statement: The family is in our thoughts and has our deepest sympathy. We cannot comment further at this time. Officials did not answer questions from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about the death or general emergency department procedures.\n\nDeadly deliveries:Hospitals know how to protect mothers. They just aren't doing it.\n\nWard's family said they are scheduled to meet with representatives from the hospital next week.\n\nHow can you triage someone with shortness of breath and chest pain and stick them in the lobby? said Ward's cousin, Andrea Ward. Froedtert needs to change their policy.\n\nWard began to have chest pain and trouble breathing while she was working that afternoon. Ward's sister drove her to Froedtert; they checked in at 4:58 p.m., according to the medical examiner's report.\n\nHospital staff checked her heartbeat with an electrocardiogram, which appeared normal, according to the report. A chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly: an enlarged heart.\n\nWard had heard this before – in March, when her baby died after the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby's neck, Ward was told she had developed an enlarged heart during the pregnancy, according to the medical examiner's report.\n\nThe report doesn't say whether Ward retained an enlarged heart since the pregnancy, or if she had a more recent flare-up. Cardiomegaly, which can be temporary or permanent, can put people at greater risk for blood clots, cardiac arrest and other heart problems.\n\nAfter the tests at Froedtert on Jan. 2, Ward's family said she was asked to stay in the waiting room until staff could provide further medical attention. The medical examiner's report does not indicate what happened after the tests.\n\nAt 5:45 p.m., Ward posted on Facebook, I really hope I'm not in this emergency room all night.\n\nAt 5:56 p.m., Ward's mother called to check in on her, according to Andrea Ward, who pieced together a timeline based on phone logs, texts and Facebook posts.\n\nTashonna Ward told her mom she'd been given tests, was waiting to see a doctor and had gone back to the front desk multiple times asking to be seen, Andrea Ward said.\n\nAt 6:35 p.m., she texted her family that she was still in the waiting room.\n\nAt 7:35 p.m., Tashonna Ward wrote on Facebook that she'd been told she might have to wait two to six hours to see a doctor.\n\nIdk what they can do about the emergency system at freodert (sic) but they damn sure need to do something, she wrote. I been here since 4:30 something for shortness of breath, and chest pains for them to just say it's a two to SIX hour wait to see a dr.\n\nFroedtert publishes current wait times at froedtert.com/wait-times.\n\nPast patients have spent an average of four hours and 44 minutes in Froedtert's emergency department before being admitted to the hospital, according to data from October 2017 to October 2018 compiled by ProPublica, though times vary widely based on the urgency of the condition and arrival time.\n\nAbout 3% of patients in that period left Froedtert's emergency department without being seen, according to the data.\n\nThe medical examiner's report does not indicate any wait time provided to Ward. It states that she left around 7:30 p.m. because she felt she had been waiting too long and had decided to go to an urgent care clinic. It had been about 2.5 hours since her arrival, according to the report.\n\nWard's sister, Brianna, picked her up and stopped at their mother's house to grab Ward's insurance card, Andrea Ward said.\n\nAt 8:39 p.m., Froedtert staff called Ward's cellphone and her sister picked up, according to the medical examiner's report. By that point, Ward had collapsed and was already in an ambulance on her way back to Froedtert. The report doesn't say why Froedtert staff made the phone call.\n\nThe ambulance arrived at 9:07 p.m., according to the report. At that point, Ward was unresponsive, the report states and was soon pronounced dead.\n\nAndrea Ward found out what happened from her cousin's mother, Yolanda.\n\nShe called me and said, 'My baby stopped breathing,'  Andrea said. And I zoomed over. And she was swearing and she said she was just at the freaking hospital and they kept her waiting.\n\nYolanda Ward referred an interview request to her niece, who is helping her manage the many tasks suddenly at hand.\n\nShe's very overwhelmed, Andrea Ward said. Too much stress. Her blood pressure has shot up. It's all too much.\n\nThe family members have many questions for the hospital. As news of Ward's death spread on Facebook, many people shared their own stories of waiting for hours in emergency rooms.\n\nI was so shocked to see the comments, Andrea Ward said. What that means is people don't know how to advocate for themselves.\n\nExperts in the field said the main question in the case is whether Tashonna Ward was seen by a doctor in the time she was at the emergency department.\n\nDelayed response:Dying patient was in ER for hours, officials say\n\nMartha Gulati, chief of cardiology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, reviewed the medical examiner's reports at the request of the Journal Sentinel.\n\nShe said patients with chest pain and trouble breathing – classic symptoms of heart problems – should generally be seen by a physician within minutes to determine the cause and consider treatment options.\n\nGulati, who studies heart problems in women, said Ward's story is far too common, as such symptoms are less likely to be taken seriously in women, especially younger women.\n\nSadly she chalks up to another statistic but she was somebody's sister, somebody's potential mother, somebody's daughter, Gulati said. We need to start listening to women and taking them seriously.\n\nHoward Mell, an emergency physician and spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said it's hard to judge the triage decisions of hospital staff without knowing what other patients the hospital may have been prioritizing at the time.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of times there are no beds and decisions have to get made as to who gets one of the few beds left and who can wait, Mell said. To a certain degree, part of triage is the art of the guess.\n\nMell said emergency department staffs across the country are contending with overcrowding, making difficult choices with not enough beds and staff, particularly during flu season.\n\nIt's not clear whether the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which can discipline hospitals for violations of emergency care requirements, will investigate the incident. A spokesperson said she could not comment as hospitals should not have notice of any possible inspection.\n\nAndrea Ward hopes to see changes made on behalf of her cousin, who she affectionately called Shonna.\n\nShe would always say, 'I'm Shonna because I'm sunshine,' Andrea said.\n\nShe was sunshine.\n\nFollow Rory Linnane on Twitter: @RoryLinnane.
Ellis Cose\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOn Jan. 12, 1920, social activist Roger Baldwin and his friends convened at a club on West 12th Street in lower Manhattan to reconfigure the National Civil Liberties Bureau. They had organized the NCLB to support conscientious objectors during World War I. They now had something significantly more ambitious in mind that they intended to name the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIn a story that Jan. 26 in The Washington Post, newly named ACLU Chairman Harry Ward said the organization would champion in the highest courts the civil liberty rights of persons and organizations. He mentioned free speech, a free press and peaceful assemblage as among the ACLU's principle concerns.\n\nThe ACLU's beginnings\n\nBaldwin knew daunting challenges lay ahead. We have got to take the risks of conflict with the authorities and even of mob violence. We can do nothing effective by sitting safely in New York, he wrote in a memo outlining his vision of the new organization. Baldwin went on to serve as the ACLU's executive director for 30 years.\n\nAt the time of the ACLU's birth, World War I had been over for more than year, but its impact was still being felt. In the summer of 1919, a wave of lynchings and race riots had swept the nation, driven largely by fears that blacks would demand more rights.\n\nAs author Cameron McWhirter described that period in Red Summer: The Summer of 1919 and the Awakening of Black America: Though no complete and accurate records on the months of violence were compiled, analysis of newspaper accounts, government documents, court records and NAACP files show at least 25 major riots and mob actions erupted and at least 52 black people were lynched. Many victims were burned to death. … In almost every case, white mobs — whether sailors on leave, immigrant slaughterhouse workers or southern farmers — initiated the violence.\n\nIt was also a year of labor unrest. Numerous strikes broke out, including among steelworkers and coal miners, as workers fought to make up income lost to wage freezes during the war.\n\nThe labor uprising was essentially crushed by corporate forces, whose operatives spread the word that unions were controlled by Bolsheviks. Such smears seemed credible to many citizens struggling to understand a wave of bombings (attributed to foreign radicals) targeting prominent Americans. Although no officials were killed in the attacks, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer was among those targeted. Palmer made it his mission to deport as many suspicious aliens as possible. His agents fanned out across the country and arrested thousands, often for no credible reason.\n\nACLU on border wall 'emergency':We'll see you in court, President Trump\n\nEven before the excesses of the postwar era, civil libertarians had grown alarmed. Just speaking out against the war or against the draft was enough to land you in prison, and criticizing an ally of the United States could result in hard time. In one bizarre case, Robert Goldstein, the producer of a silent film titled The Spirit of '76, drew a 10-year sentence because his movie — about the Revolutionary War — depicted the English in an unflattering light.\n\nThe potential for a court that fulfilled its constitutional mandate\n\nThe ACLU's creators felt the courts must be an essential protector of Americans' rights. Chief Justice John Roberts, in his year-end report last month on the federal judiciary, made much the same point as he paid homage to the Founders and the Constitution.\n\nRoberts also issued a warning: We have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside. In our age, when social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale, the public's need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital.\n\nBaldwin and his peers would not have argued with that, although they may have pointed out that America, even in the Founders' time, was notoriously bad at recognizing some basic American rights. And they would have quibbled with any suggestion that the government of their day, including the judiciary, was doing a good job of enforcing those rights.\n\nInstead, they would have argued that the judiciary had failed — not just in restraining executive overreach but also in preventing local governments, across the nation, from banning controversial speakers or otherwise trampling civil liberties.\n\nSenior counsel at the ACLU:At detention facilities, legal rights 'in name only'\n\nThe ACLU spearheaded a movement that radically extended the reach of the Bill of Rights — especially of the First Amendment. It helped America during World War II avoid the severe assault on speech that characterized government policy during World War I. That second war, nonetheless, saw other civil liberties missteps, including our government's decision to segregate more than 100,000 people in internment camps simply because of their ethnicity.\n\nThe battle over government's encroachment on rights has never ended. It was refought during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations over the limits of government surveillance and detention of suspected bad guys. And it is being refought now, with the ACLU and other organizations squaring off against an executive branch that seems unwilling to recognize scarcely any limits at all.\n\nFew organizations manage, on their 100th birthday, to remain as relevant as on the day of their birth. That the ACLU has pulled it off is a tribute to the vision of its founders. It is also a reminder that the rights Baldwin and his allies swore to protect never become completely immune to our leaders' worst impulses.\n\nEllis Cose, author of the forthcoming Democracy, If We Can Keep It: The ACLU's 100-Year Fight for Rights in America, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

David A. Andelman\n\nPerhaps the greatest present danger to America's security is the perception, if not the reality, of the United States choosing sides amidst renewed violence in the battle between Sunnis and Shiites in the heart of the Middle East.\n\nFor more than 1,400 years, Sunnis and Shiites have been at odds. The first armed clash between adherents of the two main branches of Islam took place in A.D. 680, in Karbala, still a major city in central Iraq. Through the years, Persians and Arabs (two very distinct peoples, languages and religions), now Iran and Saudi Arabia, have been at odds or in battle. As recently as 30 years ago, Iran and then-Sunni Iraq (backed by its neighboring Saudis) fought one of the longest wars in the 20th century — nearly eight years. Today, each side is engaged in proxy wars in Yemen and Syria. But only rarely has this hatred threatened to boil over as directly, viciously and widely as now appears possible.\n\nAcross the Middle East, Shiite and Sunni nations and deeply potent minorities in many of these countries are digging in for a battle that threatens to spread far beyond the region. In such an atmosphere, the U.S. must resist even the appearance of choosing sides.\n\nNot lost for a second on the players involved, however, is just that perception. For decades, we were seen as too close to the Sunni leaderships of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. While clearly Sunnis and Shiites will each back their own at all costs, many believed America would invariably back the Sunnis. No longer. Today, while large elements of popular Arab and Iranian opinion still see America as in the hip pocket of the Sunnis, the efforts to bring Iran to an agreement on a nuclear weapons moratorium and to the fight against the Islamic State terrorist group have shifted perceptions. Either perception is dangerous and wrong-headed.\n\nWhile Secretary of State John Kerry called his counterparts in Iran and Saudi Arabia this week to urge calm after the Saudis executed a leading Shiite cleric and mobs burned the Saudi Embassy in Tehran in retaliation. But Congress isn't helping matters by requiring a consular interview overseas for any citizen of 38 visa-exempt nations, including all of Western Europe, who has visited Shiite-dominated Iran, Iraq or Syria (or Sunni-dominated Sudan) since 2011. This move comes at the very moment Iran is hoping to lure vast numbers of businessmen when Western sanctions are lifted.\n\nCertainly, we have every reason for continuing to play the Saudi card. Saudi monarchs were for decades the most consistently friendly Arab leaders toward America. Iran, by contrast, since the ouster of the shah, has been one of America's most determined foes. Saudi rulers have supported a host of U.S. adventures in the Islamic world — in neighboring Iraq and in the battle against al-Qaeda, which was founded by the son of one of the monarchy's most devoted servants. Other Sunni nations are equally important to U.S. interests. Bahrain — a Sunni monarchy ruling an increasingly unruly Shiite majority — serves as home to the American 5th Fleet.\n\nToday, however, there is no reason to play the Saudi card. Nor for that matter is it likely to help. Saudis' fears of a tilt away from them toward Iran could well have played a role in the monarchy's decision to execute the Shiite imam Nimr al-Nimr. So imagine what a real-life tilt toward either side could mean now. We must find a way to right the ship, to redress the balance.\n\nAt stake is any ability to bring together the kind of Arab coalition President Obama seeks — forces that could challenge Sunni ISIL on the ground. Other countries — the UAE, Bahrain and Qatar, pillars of the Middle East economic establishment — are lining up behind Saudi Arabia. Certain figures in Iraq and the Assad regime in Syria are lining up with Shiite Iran. But in paramount jeopardy is America's image as a neutral force of moderation. Only by restoring that image can the United States hope for a constructive outcome in Syria or in the struggle with our paramount threat, the Islamic State.\n\nDavid A.

Michael O'Hanlon\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn his traditional New Year's Day speech earlier this week, North Korean strongman leader Kim Jong-Un has just made an offer that, if serious, could present an opportunity for President Donald Trump to reach a historic breakthrough in the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula and record his greatest foreign-policy accomplishment as president.\n\nKim's speech was not all sweetness and light. He warned that his patience is not infinite, and that in the absence of diplomatic progress, his country may resort to more confrontational tactics. Little has happened since the famous Singapore summit back in June between Kim and Trump; we seem no closer to a deal on North Korea's threatening military capabilities now than we did six months ago. Meanwhile, Kim clearly resents and suffers from the tough international sanctions that the Trump administration has convinced the United Nations to impose these last two years, after North Korea's big missile and nuclear tests of 2017. The latest statistics show that, despite sanctions evasion in multiple quarters, North Korean trade was down as much as half in 2018 compared to the year before.\n\nRead more commentary:After Defense Secretary Jim Mattis leaves, what then? Some ideas for Afghanistan\n\nDangerous mix of world conflicts create recipe for a rough century\n\nAfter James Mattis resigned, Trump's America is slinking off the world stage\n\nBut Kim held out an olive branch nonetheless. He seems to want a deal, and seems interested in another summit. He was much more specific than ever before about what he might offer in the course of such a tete-a-tete with Trump. So far, North Korea has only offered to place a moratorium on future nuclear and long-range missile tests, which has been a welcome development, but has only talked vaguely about denuclearization and has not stopped making more bombs. Now, apparently, Kim would put nuclear production capability on the table as a bargaining chip.\n\nNorth Korea experts like Jonathan Pollack and Jung Pak have documented how unlikely Kim would be to give up all his nuclear bombs (U.S. intelligence estimates he has as many as 60 by now). They represent the collective accomplishments of a program that Kim's grandfather and father prioritized when they led North Korea, so giving up all those bombs quickly would almost seem to dishonor the memory and legacy of his forefathers. And perhaps even more importantly, Kim as well as his generals remember the one cardinal mistake Saddam Hussein, Mohammar Quadhafi, and the Taliban all committed — leaving themselves vulnerable in war against the United States because of the lack of a nuclear deterrent. For Kim to give up the bomb, he would need a great deal of confidence that relations will remain peaceful.\n\nThere is an opportunity to compromise, relax\n\nYet there is still a big opportunity for compromise, if Kim is serious about ending production of more bombs. North Korea could stop expanding its nuclear arsenal, and we could relax, then lift some of the sanctions imposed on North Korea over the years, especially the U.N. sanctions that have really cut into North Korean trade with China and South Korea in the last couple years. The goal of complete denuclearization could await another day.\n\nWith this approach, the United States would keep enough sanctions in place to stay true to its principle that North Korea cannot be accepted as a nuclear-weapons state; before being fully welcomed into the community of nations, it will in fact have to honor its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and give up all its bombs. Yet as a practical matter, that second stage of nuclear talks can wait for a number of months or years. That is ok. The world will be much safer if North Korea stops enlarging and improving its nuclear and long-range missile arsenals that could threaten not only South Korea and Japan (and the almost 300,000 Americans living in those two countries combined), but also eventually North America.\n\nTrump should take what he can get for now\n\nThe real challenge is likely to be verification. We know where some, but not all, of North Korea's nuclear infrastructure is located. As such, international inspectors would have to be allowed to return not only to the Yongbyon location where they have been before, and where North Korea has operated a nuclear reactor to make plutonium as well as centrifuges to enrich uranium. They would also need some degree of free reign to explore other suspicious sites around the country. On the one hand, this would not be an arrangement unique to North Korea; similar provisions are part of the Iran nuclear deal, for example. On the other hand, North Korea has shown extreme nervousness about such inspections in the past.\n\nAnother possible problem: John Bolton, Trump's national security advisor, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo may consider a deal that only freezes, rather than eliminates, North Korea's nuclear arsenal inadequate for purposes of American and allied security. But they should reassess, or Trump should overrule them.\n\nThis compromise deal would go further than the Iran deal, in fact, if North Korea were willing to see its nuclear production facilities dismantled permanently. Yes, Kim would keep his nukes for a while. But he would have powerful economic and military reasons to behave himself. In this case, taking half a loaf is far more realistic than hoping for a complete denuclearization accord that just isn't in the cards anytime soon. We should immediately engage in serious talks to see just how serious Kim really is about this intriguing and promising offer.\n\nMichael O'Hanlon is director of research for the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution.

© Copyright 2019, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nJessica Bensley can legally carry a pistol in public — in part because she has never been convicted of a felony.\n\nBut last year, Bensley somehow ended up on Iowa's felon list. Because Iowa law doesn't allow felons to vote, the Polk County Auditor's Office, in turn, rejected the ballot she cast in November.\n\nIowa's mistake cost Bensley her constitutional right to vote. And she wasn't the only one.\n\nA Des Moines Register investigation of six counties found that the ballots of more than two-dozen voters have been wrongly rejected since 2017 — including 20 in November's midterm elections — because their names mistakenly appeared on the felon list the state circulates to county officials.\n\nIowa maintains the list to enforce one of the nation's most restrictive bans on felon voting rights — permanently barring felons from voting unless they successfully petition the governor or president to restore their rights.\n\nBut the Register's investigation shows that the state's process for enforcing its felon ban is seriously flawed — and officials have known about systemic inaccuracies in its database of roughly 69,000 banned felons since at least 2012.\n\nEmails show that state and county officials have blamed each other for failing to properly vet the felon list to make sure someone's voting rights are not wrongly denied, the Register found.\n\nIn June 2016, the Iowa secretary of state cross-checked felons in the state's I-VOTERS database, which contains the names of registered voters, and correctly restored 2,591 records — putting those Iowans back on the voting rolls, an email to county auditors shows.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds has indicated she might be willing to support automatically restoring voting rights to felons who complete the terms of their sentence, a move that could re-enfranchise more than 50,000 Iowans and potentially reduce the errors that are denying some legal voters their right to have their ballot counted.\n\nBensley — who became aware her name was on the state's felon list when Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald notified her Nov. 20 that her Nov. 6 vote was rejected — spent hours trying to resolve the error.\n\nShe said the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, which provides the felon list to local auditors, never gave her a reason why her name was added to the list in August.\n\nWhy was I not contacted telling me my voter's rights were being taken away? Bensley asked, noting that if she were a felon she could have faced criminal charges for voting.\n\nGroups such as the League of Women Voters of Iowa, the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP, already critical of Iowa's felon voting restrictions, called the Register's findings further evidence of a broken and punitive system.\n\nThis is a concern we've had for a while, that the list itself is not accurate, said Daniel Zeno, policy director for the ACLU of Iowa.\n\nKaren Person of the League of Women Voters of Iowa echoed those concerns.\n\nTo find out there are lots of inaccuracies with who can and can't vote because of the felon database is eye-opening, Person said. I'm surprised and disappointed.\n\nGovernment agencies blame each other\n\nThe Iowa court administrator compiles the felon list, which the Iowa secretary of state then distributes to all 99 counties.\n\nThe felon database is matched against the state's I-VOTERS registration database, which has been used for more than a decade. Those on the felon list are marked as ineligible in I-VOTERS.\n\nBut the Register found that the felons list also includes people who were charged but never convicted of a felony or who received a deferred judgment, which means their record was expunged after they completed probation.\n\nIn either situation, the person's voting rights should not be terminated under Iowa law.\n\nIn at least two-dozen cases, including Bensley's, the Register could find no justification for names being on the felon list.\n\nSteve Davis, a spokesman for Iowa Court Administrator Todd Nuccio, noted that the Iowa Judicial Branch does not manage the I-VOTERS list. The electronic updates of felony convictions in Iowa courts are sent automatically by electronic transfer to the Iowa secretary of state, Davis said.\n\nThe Court Administrator's Office is aware of clerk data entry errors concerning felony convictions, Davis said.\n\nStaff workers for former and current Iowa secretaries of state Matt Schultz and Paul Pate also have acknowledged errors in the list and urged all of Iowa's county auditors to verify each individual felony conviction before rejecting a ballot.\n\nBut Iowa county auditors have said it isn't feasible for their staffs to do that level of verification. It would require them to individually contact each clerk of court where a felony sentence was handed down, as well as two separate federal court districts.\n\nThey don't have the resources to conduct the searches, and the law doesn't require them to go to that level of verification, they argue.\n\nEven if Iowa auditors were able to conduct the searches, they don't have access to some data that can definitively conclude whether an individual is eligible to vote, an Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation agent told a county official in 2013, documents obtained by the Register show.\n\nPate on Friday issued a statement to the Register that said he has dedicated significant time and resources to fixing the problem.\n\nI share the frustrations people have with a system that is not perfect, Pate said.\n\nHe emphasized that his office doesn't create the data but instead serves as a conduit between the state's court system and auditors. He provided the Register with a seven-step flowchart for how Iowa's felon data and voting rights review is supposed to go.\n\nPate's staff contend in written responses that the onus is on county auditors to make sure a voter's ballot isn't wrongly rejected.\n\nIn our communications with county auditors, we stressed that while we could not require the auditor to seek a final review by the clerk of court, final reviews added a vital additional check before canceling a voter's registration, Kevin Hall, a spokesman for Pate, said in a written response to questions. The Secretary of State's Office declined repeated requests for interviews on the topic.\n\nThat frustrates county officials such as Linn County Auditor Joel Miller, one of several auditors who told the Iowa Secretary of State's Office that the felon database is inaccurate. Requiring auditors to make those checks exposes them to legal liabilities for mistakes, Miller said.\n\nIt's a list, and it is subject to human error, Miller told the Register. This is a tough thing, but I have to take the felon list as gospel, and I've had to say (to the secretary of state), 'Look, this is your list. I'm not going to be your fall guy.'\n\nNuccio, the Iowa court administrator, said he will issue a directive later this month that will require clerks of court to review and confirm each listed felony conviction before sending a felony report to the secretary of state. The directive — which he told the Register about Jan. 7 — is being made because of identified instances of clerk data entry errors.\n\nIt's unclear how the new directive will work.\n\nBecause some counties have a large number of felony convictions — Polk County reported 167 in December — clerks from smaller counties may help with the quality-control verification, said Davis, the court administrator's spokesman.\n\n► Database: Iowa's list of felons ineligible to vote\n\n► More:How Iowa can fix its 'anti-democratic' felon voter ban? Critics say end it; governor willing to listen\n\nTesting the cases in court\n\nThe ACLU of Iowa, an organization that has tracked complaints from Iowans about the felon database, believes that the state's actions violate federal law.\n\nThe organization is asking people to contact its offices to review possible legal remedies.\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to keep voter registration lists accurate and current. It says voter removals must be completed at least 90 days before a federal election, noted Zeno of the ACLU of Iowa.\n\nBut Iowa has no statewide standards in place to accurately verify the identity of people convicted of a felony, leaving each district court clerk to decide that, Zeno said.\n\nThe ACLU identified a Clay County case where a man was wrongfully denied the right to vote in fall 2017 because of confusion in court filings between him and a defendant with a similar name.\n\nThe ACLU also identified a Polk County case where a father and son share the same name, and the father was wrongly added to the felon database.\n\nIt is disappointing, to say the least, that people who should have had the legal right to vote were denied the right to vote not because they made a mistake but because the state of Iowa did, Zeno said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice can pursue federal civil actions against states that violate election law, but its role in felon voter errors is unclear.\n\nKelly Laco, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, noted that felon voting bans are a creature of state law, not federal law, so DOJ has no role in enforcing them.\n\nThe Register's follow-up questions about other aspects of the law that the ACLU believes could have been violated due to database errors have gone unanswered because of the federal government shutdown, which has furloughed Laco and many of her colleagues.\n\nIt's also unknown whether federal officials have fielded complaints about the Iowa felon list, but Hall, the secretary of state's spokesman, said the office has not been made aware of any complaints.\n\nRejected voter is 'pretty pissed off'\n\nJoseph Rice of Des Moines and Tami Williams from Waukee contacted the Register on Nov. 6 to say they were wrongly placed on the felon database.\n\nThe two said their precinct officials informed them on Election Day that casting a vote would be illegal.\n\nBut Rice and Williams do not have felony convictions, which the Register confirmed through public records. They each told the Register they spent hours calling state and local election officials on that day, attempting to get the issue resolved.\n\nThe two were allowed to cast provisional ballots. Williams' vote was counted, but Rice's was rejected, the Register determined.\n\nTheir names have since been removed from the state felon database, public records show.\n\nI'm pretty pissed off, Rice said a few days after he received a letter from the Polk County auditor informing him that his vote was rejected. This just opened my eyes.\n\nAfter speaking with Rice and Williams, the Register obtained the names of voters whose provisional ballots were rejected in November because they were listed on the felon database, picking as a sample Polk, Warren, Dallas, Story, Linn and Johnson counties.\n\nThe Register compared the rejected provisional ballots from the six counties against the secretary of state's database of more than 69,000 people listed as ineligible to vote because of felony convictions.\n\nThe Register found that at least 20 people whose provisional ballots were rejected because they were flagged as felons have since been removed from the felon list, including 18 in Polk County, and one each from Johnson and Warren counties.\n\nThe Register additionally identified five voters in Linn County who were on the felon list and were removed after a 2017 review that the secretary of state conducted at the county's request.\n\nColt Moss is an attorney for the Wandro & Associates law firm in Des Moines whose Nov. 6 ballot was rejected, though he has never been convicted of a felony.\n\nMoss received a deferred judgment for drug-related charges in 2016, but it was expunged from his record after he completed probation.\n\nHe challenged his name's inclusion on the felon list and cast a provisional ballot Nov. 6.\n\nYet his ballot was rejected on Nov. 13 when the Polk County auditor reviewed the records and found his name on the felon list.His name has since been removed, the Register found.\n\nIn another situation, the Register identified an error involving two men living in the same home who share similar names. One of them — Michael Anthony Thomas, 52 — has a felony conviction and is ineligible to vote under Iowa law.\n\nBut the other — Michael Thomas Huss, 48 — does not have a felony conviction, yet he was placed on the felon list and was forced to cast a provisional ballot. His vote was rejected.\n\nContact us The Des Moines Register's review of voter issues is ongoing. Readers who have faced voting difficulties are encouraged to share their stories by contacting reporter Jason Clayworth at the above email or phone number.\n\nHuss' name was removed from the felon list after the Nov. 6 election, but the correction was too late for his vote to be counted, records show.\n\nThis is wrong, Michael Huss told the Register. People are urged to go vote. So you do your civic duty and then find this out? It's disturbing. It has stripped me of my rights as a citizen.\n\nFitzgerald, the Polk County auditor, said the secretary of state contacted his office regarding at least two other individuals after the Nov. 6 elections who had their provisional ballots rejected because their names mistakenly appeared on the felon list.\n\nFitzgerald believes that the felony database frequently contains names of people charged with a felony but never convicted, which is what happened with some of the wrongly rejected ballots reviewed by the Register.\n\nFitzgerald also believes that the felon database is incomplete and that Iowans with felony convictions in other states are voting. The Register's analysis found that the felon database did not list felony convictions from every state.\n\nFor example, it listed no felony convictions from Alabama or New York and only one from Florida.\n\nIt is unclear how felon convictions from other states are being added to the list or checked for accuracy.\n\nHall, from the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, directed that question to Nuccio, the court administrator. But Nuccio said felony convictions from other states are neither reported nor tracked by Iowa clerks of court.\n\nI don't think the state has any malice towards these folks; I just think they have a bad database, Fitzgerald said.\n\nLongtime problems plague system\n\nOn Nov. 6, 2012, Cerro Gordo County officials rejected three people's provisional ballots after confirming their names were on the state's felon list.\n\nBut Matt Anderson, an agent from the Division of Criminal Investigation, determined in December 2013 that their names were on the list incorrectly: One was charged but not convicted of a felony, and two had their voting rights restored under an executive order by former Gov. Tom Vilsack, Anderson found.\n\nAnderson reported that it would take someone with his level of access and expertise to affirm someone's voter rights status, Cerro Gordo County Auditor Kenneth Kline wrote in a Jan. 28, 2014, memo to then-Secretary of State Matt Schultz.\n\nTo have rejected a ballot based on an error or incorrect information is troubling, to say the least, Kline wrote in the 2014 memo.\n\nSchultz acknowledged the system's deficiencies in an April 10, 2014, memo to state auditors that said at least nine other voters were wrongly listed as felons.\n\nSchultz created a task force that included staff from the governor's office to address the deficiencies. He also requested auditors work with local county attorneys, county sheriffs and county clerks of court to make sure felony conviction information is accurate before they reject provisional ballots.\n\nSome auditors resisted Schultz's 2014 request, saying they don't have the resources or the access to some databases to accurately determine whether a person is a convicted felon.\n\nIn 2017, Mike Sievers of the Iowa Secretary of State Office's election division told auditors that the names in the database represent potential matches, saying it is up to your office to make the final determination whether a match is referencing the same person.\n\nSievers instructed auditors that once they have verified a match, to record the person's information on the felon review form.\n\nHe added this sentence in bold:Do NOT cancel any record due to a felony conviction until you have verified the conviction with the appropriate clerk of court.\n\nBut county auditors again in 2017 pushed back. In Linn County, for example, election officials noted the request would require them to contact 14 clerks of courts and officials in two separate federal court districts.\n\nSherrill Fillman, a Des Moines resident who had her November vote rejected because her name was erroneously on the felon database, said somebody — be it the state or county election officials — needs to be held accountable.\n\nFillman's name has since been removed from the database — but it was too late for her vote to be counted in the 2018 general election.\n\nI was listed as a felon and I'm not. Of course, this concerns me, Fillman said. Everyone should be concerned about that list because they could find themselves on it, too.\n\nThe felon ban process and where it fails\n\nHere is a brief outline of the Iowa law outlining the management of the felon voting ban, how it is supposed to work and where the Register found it had failed:\n\nBeing identified: Iowa district court clerks, the U.S. attorney or the Iowa secretary of state identifies people convicted of Iowa district court clerks, the U.S. attorney or the Iowa secretary of state identifies people convicted of a felony as defined by Iowa law State notified: The district clerks or attorneys notify the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, which maintains a list of convicted felons, including those whose voting rights have been restored. That office, in turn, determines whether the felon is registered to vote in any of Iowa's 99 counties and is to notify the appropriate county election official about that person's felon status. Record reconciliation and voter registry cancellation: Within 15 days of receipt of a list produced by the secretary of state, county election officials are to review matches and determine the accuracy of the state list, removing registered voters who are confirmed ineligible. Multiple auditors do not conduct those verifications , the Register found. Notice to voter: County election officials are to send the voter a notice and provide an opportunity to have the registration status reviewed. Multiple voters told the Register they had not been notified by the county auditor before the Nov. 6, 2018, election. Identifying errors: When a voter's name on the state's felon list is found to be inaccurate, county officials are to notify the secretary of state so the database is updated. The Iowa Secretary of State's Office in 2016 instructed county auditors to fill out a form for all voters who contest their listing as convicted felons and cast provisional ballots. It remains unclear whether any auditors used that form in 2018. The Register requested copies of the forms in November but the secretary of state has not provided any.\n\nSource: Iowa law\n\nAbout the author\n\nJASON CLAYWORTH is an investigative reporter at the Des Moines Register whose focus includes government operations.

Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nRight now, the country with the world's biggest oil reserves — Venezuela — is putting out a fraction of its traditional production, as a corrupt and inept socialist government has lost the ability even to keep the golden goose going. Meanwhile, Iraq is in turmoil, Iran is crazy and Saudi Arabia has been looking shaky.\n\nDespite all this, oil and gas prices are holding steady, and while what's going on in the Middle East constitutes a diplomatic crisis, it's nothing like the sort of earthshaking trouble it would have been a decade or two ago.\n\nYou can thank the frackers for our energy independence\n\nWhy is that? Because frackers have turned the United States from a nation deeply dependent on imported oil to a net exporter and the world's single largest producer of oil and gas.\n\nFor decades, U.S. foreign policy and defense strategy revolved around keeping the flow of oil from the Middle East going. Now it's an afterthought. In fact, though the Navy used to have to be able to keep the Strait of Hormuz open so that oil could flow out against possible Iranian efforts to stop it, now the Navy only needs to be able to keep the strait closed, keeping Iran from selling the oil it produces for revenue it desperately needs.\n\nEven an Iranian drone attack that shut down half of Saudi Arabia's output didn't have much impact.\n\nAnd world markets know that Donald Trump, or any subsequent American president, can quickly boost supplies even further by opening up federal land to hydraulic fracturing, which extracts oil and gas from rock by injecting high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals.\n\nAny effort to block the flow of oil would probably just have the effect of boosting U.S. market share, making the United States even more economically powerful.\n\nThat's not just bad news for Iran. It also weakens the hand of Saudi Arabia, which has gone from jihad-encouraging frenemy to a nervous ally as it faces Iran across the Persian Gulf, while its power over the United States is also reduced.\n\nFracking also drastically undercuts the power of Vladimir Putin, whose economic leverage depends on Russian oil and gas exports.\n\nThey're gonna have to compromise:Democrats must embrace shale gas boom to win elections and climate battle\n\nAnd it's not just the United States undercutting Putin. As Cornell law professor William Jacobson blogged, while everyone was focused on the killing of Iranian terror general Qasem Soleimani, Israel became a natural gas superpower. The new offshore Tamar and Leviathan gas fields give Israel a huge new supply of cheap natural gas, enough to supply its own needs while leaving huge amounts to export.\n\nThis is particularly significant because Israel's biggest market is Europe, now dependent on, you guessed it, piped-in gas from Russia. Europe is also starting to receive shipments of natural gas from the United States, once again, courtesy of fracking.\n\nEnvironmentalists oppose fracking, but it's hard to understand why. Fracking has led to the replacement of coal with cleaner-burning natural gas. United States carbon emissions have fallen largely because of this substitution.\n\nRussia isn't happy about our natural gas success\n\nPutin doesn't like this and has dispatched Russian trolls to try to stop pipelines in the United States, has worked against U.S. fracking and has also tried to block Canadian oil sands development. And he's getting help.\n\nBack in 2017, in response to claims that President Trump was a Putin puppet, scholar Walter Russell Mead commented:\n\nIf Trump were the Manchurian candidate that people keep wanting to believe that he is, here are some of the things he'd be doing: ►Limiting fracking as much as he possibly could\n\n►Blocking oil and gas pipelines\n\n►Opening negotiations for major nuclear arms reductions\n\n►Cutting U.S. military spending\n\n►Trying to tamp down tensions with Russia's ally Iran That Trump is planning to do precisely the opposite of these things may or may not be good policy for the United States, but anybody who thinks this is a Russia appeasement policy has been drinking way too much joy juice. Barack Obama actually did all of these things, and none of the liberal media now up in arms about Trump ever called Obama a Russian puppet.\n\nEditorial Board:Flaring natural gas turns 'drill, baby, drill' to 'burn, baby, burn'\n\nThey don't call the Democratic presidential candidates, who have pretty much all come out against fracking and pipelines, Putin puppets. But what's more likely to strengthen the United States and weaken our adversaries — from Putin to the ayatollahs to the Chinese — than a bigger boost for American energy independence? Someone should ask them why they want to make us weaker and Putin stronger.\n\nIn the meantime, as you look at reasonable energy bills and a booming economy in spite of turmoil in the Middle East, give thanks to the people who have made it possible. Have you hugged a fracker today?\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a top House Republican, said Monday President Donald Trump's call with top Georgia election officials asking them to find more votes for him was deeply troubling, making her the highest-level Republican to publicly criticize Trump's conduct.\n\nCheney, who is the third-ranking House Republican, told reporters on Capitol Hill the call was deeply troubling, and I think everybody ought to listen to the full hour of it.\n\nHer remarks laid bare divisions between Trump and the Republican Party just a day before a crucial runoff election in Georgia that could determine control of the Senate. Republican lawmakers have increasingly broken with the president, including on a major defense policy bill and Trump's attempts to overturn the Electoral College results in Congress.\n\nTrump has taken criticism from some Republican lawmakers for his remarks on the call. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., a stalwart defender of the president, said on Fox & Friends Monday morning the call was not a helpful call.\n\nAnd Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who is retiring in 2022, said in a statement the Georgia call was a new low in this whole futile and sorry episode.\n\nI commend Republican election officials across the country who have discharged their duties with integrity over the past two months while weathering relentless pressure, disinformation, and attacks from the president and his campaign, he said.\n\nBut David Perdue, one of two Republicans up for reelection Tuesday, said on Fox News the president's remarks were exactly what he's been saying the last few months. It was disgusting that anyone would tape the call, Perdue said.\n\nLive politics updates:2 House Democrats ask FBI to investigate Trump's call to Georgia election official\n\nIn a call reported Sunday by the Washington Post, Trump told Raffensperger, a Republican, to alter the result of the election.\n\nSo look. All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state, the president said in a recording of the call released by media outlets.\n\nRaffensperger told Good Morning America Trump had done most of the talking, but he wanted to get his points across that the data that he has is just plain wrong.\n\nGeorgia has retallied its results three times and has reaffirmed Biden's win each time despite Trump's unfounded allegations of massive electoral fraud against him. Biden won the state by 12,670 votes.\n\nSome Democrats have called for investigations into the call, and two House Democrats, Reps. Ted Lieu of California and Kathleen Rice of New York, asked the FBI to investigate and said evidence of Trump's election fraud was now in broad daylight.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Trump's call was an impeachable offense, though top House Democrats have struck a more cautious tone.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Monday he had not reviewed the transcript of the call and that We're not looking backward, we're looking forward to the inauguration of Joe Biden.
Sean Williams\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nSocial Security is a program that more than 41 million retired workers rely upon each and every month. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), 71% of unmarried elderly individuals, and 61% of elderly individuals as a whole, receive at least half of their monthly income from Social Security.\n\nHowever, Social Security was never meant to be leaned on so heavily by retirees. The SSA suggests that Social Security benefits are only designed to replace about 40% of your working wages. Yet based on the data above, we know that 3 out of 5 seniors would likely be in serious trouble without Social Security income. According to the November SSA snapshot, the average retired worker brings home $1,354.78 a month, or about $16,260 a year. That's (depressingly) not too far from the federal poverty level of $11,880.\n\nHey Social Security, you're doing it wrong!\n\nYet, according to a new study from The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonpartisan organization designed to keep senior citizens and retirees abreast of the policy decisions that can affect them, a simple change to Social Security could give retirees a considerably brighter outlook and, according to the report, net the average retiree in 2015 nearly $30,000 extra in lifetime benefits over 25 years.\n\nA notable problem TSCL has identified with Social Security is the method by which cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, are calculated. Social Security COLAs are the raises beneficiaries receive most years.\n\nSocial Security's COLA is calculated based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W is designed to measure the change in the price of a predetermined basket of goods and services. To calculate Social Security's COLA, the average CPI-W reading from the third quarter of the previous year acts as the baseline figure, while the average CPI-W reading from the third quarter of the current year serves as the comparison. If there's a year-over-year decline in the average CPI-W readings, no COLA is given. If, however, there is an increase, Social Security beneficiaries receive the difference, rounded to the nearest 0.1%.\n\nBut, as TSCL points out, the CPI-W has a fatal flaw: it represents the spending habits of working Americans, not senior citizens, despite the fact that two-thirds of all Social Security recipients are retired workers.\n\nThis fix could put nearly $30,000 in retirees' pockets over their lifetime\n\nAccording to TSCL, the solution would be to switch the COLA measure to the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E). As the name implies, the CPI-E only factors in the spending habits of households with individuals who are 62 and older.\n\nAs you can see by the Dec. 2011 comparison of the CPI-W and the CPI-E below, the weighting of expenditures is quite different for certain categories. For example, seniors spend twice as much on medical care as do working Americans. They also tend to spend more on housing. By comparison, the CPI-W places a higher emphasis on education, apparel, entertainment, and transportation expenses.\n\nThese percentages may not look large on this Bureau of Labor Statistics comparison, but over the course of 25 years using the CPI-E instead of the CPI-W could be expected to increase annual payouts by an average of 8.9%, or $29,568 in aggregate, based on the current average monthly payout of $1,355 a month for retired workers.\n\nWhat's more telling is that over the past 33 years, the CPI-W would have resulted in a greater annual COLA than the CPI-E on just three occasions (2006, 2009, and 2012). In the remaining 30 years, the CPI-E would have provided a substantially higher COLA, which would presumably allow seniors to more comfortably afford the rising cost of medical care. Not surprisingly, medical care inflation has outpaced Social Security's COLA in 33 of the past 35 years.\n\nThe CPI-E has its flaws, too\n\nOn one hand, TSCL makes a strong case for the CPI-E considering that seniors make up a majority of Social Security recipients, and given that they're falling far behind the medical care inflation curve. But the CPI-E brings its own set of problems to the table.\n\nTo begin with, there are far more working Americans than there are seniors. In other words, even though the CPI-W doesn't perfectly match the spending habits of seniors as outlined in the BLS chart above, it arguably creates a more accurate picture of the spending habits of Americans than the CPI-E because it has so many additional data points for analysis.\n\nAnother concern is that the CPI-E doesn't factor in the rising cost of Medicare Part A expenses. Part A is the hospital insurance component of Medicare, and it covers in-patient costs, surgeries, and long-term skilled nursing care. Part A costs can be extensive, and if they aren't factored into the CPI-E seniors could still wind up falling way behind the medical care inflation curve, even if the CPI-E were being used to calculate COLAs instead of the CPI-W.\n\nLastly, and this could arguably be the biggest issue of all, switching to the CPI-E, could also expedite how quickly the Social Security Trust burns through its spare cash. TSCL's calculations demonstrate that seniors would receive a higher COLA in most years than with the CPI-W, which means even more pressure on Social Security.\n\nWill the CPI-E debate gather steam on Capitol Hill? It's really anyone's guess at this point, but considering that Republicans are in charge of Congress for at least the next couple of years, and many of them favor moving to a Chained CPI (a measure that produces even slower growing COLAs than the CPI-W), I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere's how you can make more money in retirement\n\nWhen is it appropriate to take Social Security at age 62?\n\nWhich IRA offers the best tax benefits?\n\nSean Williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article.

The Labor Department has suspended enforcement of Donald Trump's executive order restricting diversity training by government agencies and contractors that the president labeled divisive and un-American after a federal court judge blocked it.\n\nLate last month U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman granted a preliminary nationwide injunction in a lawsuit filed by LGBT rights groups in the Northern District of California, saying the groups were likely to prevail on their First Amendment claims.\n\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success in proving violations of their constitutional rights, Freeman wrote in a 34-page order. Moreover, as the government itself acknowledges, the work Plaintiffs perform is extremely important to historically underserved communities.\n\nIn guidance issued by the Labor Department on Monday, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs will stop investigating any agency or contractor suspected of violating the executive order and will take no enforcement action. A hotline set up to collect complaints will no longer be used.\n\nThe department is fully complying with the preliminary injunction, a Labor Department spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nTrump diversity training ban blocked:Donald Trump executive order banning diversity training blocked by federal judge\n\nDemocrats call it a 'political stunt':Trump diversity training ban challenged by Senators Bob Menendez, and Elizabeth Warren\n\nMegan Petersen, senior director for policy, public sector and counsel at industry trade group ITI, said the move is a welcome step toward undoing an Executive Order that fails to acknowledge the realities of systemic racism in America, fully undercuts companies' efforts to promote a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workforce, and that was implemented contradicting all normal federal rulemaking processes.\n\nTrump's executive order was seen by critics as a broadside against diversity and inclusion programs seeking to reverse patterns of discrimination and exclusion going back decades. The incoming Joe Biden administration is widely expected to scrap it.\n\nTrump's executive order, which affected government agencies, Fortune 500 companies, educational institutions, nonprofits and any others that have federal contracts or plan to apply for them, had an almost immediate chilling effect on reinvigorated efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, under the knee of white officer in Minneapolis in May.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation found that more than 55 years after the Civil Rights Act, less than 2% of the top executives at the nation's largest companies are Black.\n\nThis is welcome news for federal contractors and grantees, many of whom had embarked upon the difficult task of attempting to comply with the order's vague requirements in order to avoid potentially crippling penalties for violations, Franklin Turner, a partner with law firm McCarter & English, told USA TODAY.\n\nIn all likelihood, the issue will be moot when President-elect Biden takes power in less than two weeks and promptly rescinds the order. At that point, I fully expect that collective sighs of relief will be heard in corporate Zoom meetings across America, said Turner, who represents multinational contractors and small and medium-sized companies.\n\nTrump executive order under fire from corporate America, Democrats\n\nDemocrats had called on the federal government to back off the order, calling it a political stunt. Bob Menendez, D-N.J.; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and 18 other senators sent a letter opposing the implementation of the executive order, saying it stifles much-needed efforts in our states to reduce racial and sex-based discrimination.\n\nWe cannot as a nation expect to work towards and achieve equality without first acknowledging and addressing the biases that are deeply rooted in the fabric of this nation, attorney Avatara Smith-Carrington who represented the LGBT groups in the November lawsuit, told USA TODAY last month.\n\n'It's already having a massive effect':Corporate America demands Trump rescind executive order on diversity\n\nBiden likely to dump Trump diversity ban:Biden administration likely to overturn Donald Trump diversity training executive order\n\nThe executive order's stated goal was to combat offensive and anti-American race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating.\n\nThe Labor Department previously told USA TODAY the elimination of race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating in employment was a key civil rights priority of the Trump Administration.\n\nTrump diversity training ban faced other challenges\n\nCivil rights groups including the NAACP Legal Defense Fund filed another lawsuit in October alleging the executive order violates free speech rights in an extraordinary and unprecedented act by the Trump administration to undermine efforts to foster diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\nA White House memo in late September suggested rooting out ideologies that label entire groups of Americans as inherently racist or evil in diversity training materials by searching for keywords such as white privilege, systemic racism, intersectionality and unconscious bias.\n\nAsked about his executive order during the first presidential debate, Trump said: They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place, it's a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not gonna allow that to happen.\n\nBiden responded, Nobody's doing that.\n\nThe fact is that there is racial insensitivity, he told Trump.\n\nTrump took aim at critical race theory\n\nThe target of Trump's executive order was critical race theory, which teaches that racism pervades government and other American institutions, giving white people an advantage.\n\nTrump seized on the issue following appearances by conservative activist Christopher Rufo on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight.\n\nWhat I've discovered is that critical race theory has become, in essence, the default ideology of the federal bureaucracy and is now being weaponized against the American people, Rufo, director of the Discovery Institute's Center on Wealth & Poverty in Seattle, said on Carlson's show.\n\nRufo celebrated achieving his goal – persuading the President of the United States to abolish critical race theory in the federal government – posting on Facebook moments after Trump issued the order.\n\nThe Trump administration also challenged corporate efforts to recruit more Black executives and executives of color into leadership ranks.
Alexandra Samuels\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTori Pradier, 21, a long-time tennis player and an accounting major at Clark Atlanta University, chose to attend the historically black college over a predominately white university because Clark Atlanta offered her the most scholarship money to pursue a sport she loves.\n\nBesides that, Pradier says an HBCU – a historically black college or university established before 1964 with a principal mission of educating African Americans -- gives students like her who were raised in predominantly white environments a completely different experience.\n\n(Attending an HBCU) is one of the best decisions of my life because it has allowed me to grow as an individual, as well as be in the midst of other students who are just like me, Pradier says.\n\nPradier and many of her classmates, however, were disheartened to see the racial unrest last semester at predominantly white institutions like the University of Missouri, Boston University and Yale. They were dismayed to hear Justice Antonin Scalia – the longest serving Supreme Court Justice – appear to discredit the work of black students at prestigious white universities by suggesting they would benefit from attending slower track schools.\n\nThere are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well, Scalia said in December during oral arguments in the Fisher vs. University of Texas case, which challenges the constitutionality of the university's use of race as a factor in some admissions decisions. Abigail Fisher, who is white, was a high-school student denied acceptance into UT-Austin in 2008. She contends she was rejected because of a discriminatory admissions policy that favored less qualified students of color.\n\nI feel that (this incident) speak to a very problematic narrative in our country, black inferiority, said Xavier Clark, 21, a political communications major at the University of Texas at Austin. Scalia's comments showed that people in this nation still do not believe in the great things black people can do. In the eyes of Scalia, many black people are still inferior and not suitable to be regarded as equal.\n\nSchool officials around the country denounced Scalia's comments, and many colleges and universities are enacted diversity programs or reexamining existing one to be sure they foster a more inclusive community.\n\nI think that the diversity programs at UT are doing a great job, Clark said. They do whatever they can do to make students feel included on campus. Clark notes how his professors in his African and African Diaspora Studies programs made sure black students understood their history and how race plays out in everyday life by hosting seminars on various topics.\n\nTo make these programs better, however, both Clark and Pradier suggest one thing: paying more attention to student voices.\n\nI think they should actually listen to our voices in meetings and not wait to take action, Pradier said. Also include a few key students in the decision-making process, because often times they make decisions on what they think is best for us but in reality it's not what we really want.\n\nClark said that while he's generally had positive experiences as a black male student at UT-Austin and with his school's diversity program, he wishes the school's administration would support additional diversity programs, originating with students, that he refers to as necessary.\n\nMany times students feel a certain way and express it, Clark said. However, their grievances are overlooked. The opinions of the students are vital in making students feel included and engaged.\n\nFollow Alexandra Samuels at @AlexSamuelsx5
WASHINGTON – As news that President Donald Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani spread, the Democratic candidates vying to defeat him in 2020 were quick to react.\n\nThe Defense Department said it conducted the attack at Trump's direction as a defensive action against Soleimani, who it said was planning further attacks on American diplomats and service members.\n\nSoleimani is an extremely influential figure inside Iran, heading Iran's elite Quds Force, part of the country's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden said in a statement that No American will mourn Qassem Soleimani's passing. He deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region. He supported terror and sowed chaos. None of that negates the fact that this is a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region.\n\nMore:US to send 3,000 more soldiers to the Middle East in the wake of Qasem Soleimani killing\n\n2020 election:A visual guide to the candidate's positions on healthcare, climate change, guns and more\n\nHe continued that he believes Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox, and he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel, our people and our interests, both here at home and abroad, and our partners throughout the region and beyond.\n\nI'm not privy to the intelligence and much remains unknown, but Iran will surely respond. We could be on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East, Biden concluded.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren stated that Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans but reckless move escalates the situation with Iran.\n\nOur priority must be to avoid another costly war.\n\nCampaigning in Iowa today, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders quipped that the assassination of Soleimani is a dangerous escalation that brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East.\n\n7 days in Iraq: How US-Iran conflict led to general's death\n\nHe continued with a tweet accompanied by a video, I was right about Vietnam. I was right about Iraq. I will do everything in my power to prevent a war with Iran. I apologize to no one.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg released a statement, saying that Before engaging in military action that could destabilize an entire region, we must take a strategic, deliberate approach that includes consultation with Congress, our allies, and stakeholders in the Middle East.\n\nThere is no question that Qassim Suleimani was a threat to that safety and security, and that he masterminded threats and attacks on Americans and our allies, leading to hundreds of deaths. But there are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences, he stated.\n\nMore:Democrats warn against 'march' to war with Iran after Trump orders killing of Qasem Soleimani\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker on MSNBC acknowledged Soleimani was a bad person but continued that we have to look at the larger, strategic situation in that area.\n\nWe have a president who has had, really, a failure in his Iranian policy, who's had no larger, strategic plan and has made that region less stable and less safe, he continued.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota released a statement, saying that the timing, manner, and potential consequences of the Administration's actions raise serious questions and concerns about an escalating conflict.\n\nThe Administration needs to fully consult with Congress on its decision-making, response plans, and strategy for preventing a wider conflict, she concluded.\n\nPresidential election 2020: Marianne Williamson lays off entire campaign staff\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson stated that The killing of Soleimani is extremely serious, and will almost certainly cause a significant reaction from Iran. It's not that Soleimani was a good man; he was not. But that's not what this is about. It's about the wise versus unwise, responsible versus irresponsible use of military power.\n\nNow the president has called for deploying 3,000 more troops to the Middle East. Make no mistake about it, this is an extremely dangerous moment for our country and for our world, she continued. Every American must realize that war with Iran would be catastrophic.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, released a video, declaring that Trump's actions last night in bombing the Baghdad airport with the targeted killing of Iran's top military general was an act of war.\n\nShe additionally appeared on Fox News Friday morning and quipped that there is no question about how evil this guy is. No one should shed a single tear for his death. But that's not really the question here. The real question is, what are we trying to accomplish here in this country and where will this decision that this president made to escalate these tensions and this crisis and commit this act of war without congressional authorization?\n\nMore:Pompeo says attack that killed Iran military leader Qasem Soleimani was in response to 'imminent attack'\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg released a statement that said, Without more information, we can only hope that the president has carefully thought through the national security implications of this attack for our country and the grave risks involved. But given his track record and his history of making reckless and impulsive decisions that undermine U.S. strategic objections and weaken our allies -- most recently in Syria -- there is every reason to be deeply concerned.\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang tweeted that War with Iran is the last thing we need and is not the will of the American people. We should be acting to deescalate tensions and protect our people in the region.\n\nI have signed a pledge to end the Forever Wars. We have been in a constant state of armed conflict for 19 years at a disastrous cost to both our people and our resources. This must end, he continued.\n\nDeval Patrick, former Massachusetts governor, acknowledged that Soleimani was a menace to the world and to peace-loving people everywhere but continued that a difficult situation is becoming more dangerous because of a lack of leadership.\n\nAmericans deserve a leader who they can trust in moments like these. The President owes the American people and the world an explanation of his strategy and what the next steps will be going forward, he concluded.\n\nMore:Angry protests erupt after US airstrike kills Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer tweeted a thread that read, Soleimani was a terrorist responsible for killing Americans. But this wasn't authorized by Congress and is an escalation that risks a wider war with Iran. Mr. Trump risks making a bad situation worse with reckless action.\n\nIt is essential that we protect American service members and citizens throughout the region while working with our allies to prevent further escalation that could lead to a devastating war that Americans do not want, he concluded.\n\nRep. John Delaney, D- Md., tweeted that While Soleimani was directly responsible for the deaths of countless lives, including many Americans, and was a significant danger to our troops and a destabilizing force in the region and deserved to be brought to justice for his actions against our troops, the Administration's failure to brief Congressional leadership on this action is troubling and raises the risk of reckless actions that could lead to a dangerous escalation.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet tweeted, Donald Trump is the weakest foreign policy president in my lifetime. This was a terribly reckless and provocative act. It's the latest in a long string of non-strategic choices that he has made in the Middle East that have weakened our position and strengthened Iran's.\n\nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen, Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY
Matthew Frankel, Selena Maranjian and Dan Caplinger\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nAll investors, from rookies to professionals, make mistakes from time to time. The characteristic that distinguishes great investors is the willingness and ability to learn from those mistakes. With that in mind, three of our contributors would like to share their biggest investing regrets from the past year, in the hopes that they (and you) will learn from them.\n\nSelena Maranjian: My biggest investing regret of 2015 is one I've regretted over many years: holding too many different stocks. I'm not a rookie investor, but I'm making a rookie mistake by adding more and more holdings over time without thinning them out.\n\nWhat's so bad about that? Well, lots of things. For starters, it's much harder to keep up with dozens of different companies than it is to keep up with 10 to 20. Thus, I'm underinformed about most of them and I may not realize when it's a good time to sell one -- or add shares.\n\nHaving lots of holdings does offer diversification, so that if one holding tanks, my portfolio isn't likely to suffer too much. But that also means that my gains in any particular holding aren't likely to move the needle by a lot, either. Imagine, for example, one portfolio with 10 stocks and one with 50, with assets evenly distributed in each. Each holding in the 10-stock portfolio represents 10% of its overall value, while each of the 50-stock one represents just 2%.\n\nIt's best to have your portfolio concentrated on your best ideas -- ideally your 10 to 20 best ones, not your 50 best ones. After all, if you're adding money to your portfolio, wouldn't it be better to add to one of your top ideas, rather than, say, your 48th-best idea? It's not smart to hold too few companies, but holding too many doesn't let your most promising holdings perform as powerfully for you as they could.\n\nDan Caplinger: My biggest investing regret in 2015 was one that I've struggled with throughout my investing career: being reluctant to buy shares of stocks after they've already gone up in price substantially. I tend to be a value investor, looking for stocks that have gotten beaten up and hoping to buy in at bargain prices. Once the stock bounces back, it's frustrating to have missed out on the best opportunity to invest.\n\nWhat 2015 taught me is that many stocks that have already seen substantial gains turn out to have more room to run. For instance, Dow component Nike (NYSE: NKE ) has performed extremely well in recent years, and coming into 2015, it was reasonable to expect a potential pullback based on rising competition and a strong dollar. Yet in its most recent quarterly report, Nike reported a 4% rise in revenue that produced earnings growth of 20%, despite facing currency-related headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, double-digit percentage growth in all of Nike's geographical areas showed how well the athletic giant has done even in economically weaker parts of the world. Not buying into Nike early in 2015 cost investors a 34% gain, showing how you can miss out on opportunities by thinking it's too late in the game to take advantage.\n\nMatt Frankel: My biggest investing regret of 2015 is hanging on to some of my losing investments for far too long.\n\nLike Dan, I tend to be a bargain hunter and try to pick up beaten-down stocks with the intention of holding them for years to come. However, sometimes it becomes a good idea to know when you made the wrong choice, cut your losses, and move on.\n\nFor example, I first bought shares of Transocean (NYSE: RIG ) in 2013, and added to my position in late 2014 on what I thought was just temporary weakness in oil prices. When I bought my shares, the company had an impressive $27.3 billion backlog of business and was paying a generous $3.00/share dividend. Since then, the backlog has shrunk by nearly 40%, and the dividend was cut by 80% in February 2015, and finally suspended in September 2015.\n\nIf I had followed my instincts and cut my losses when the company initially chopped its dividend, not only could I have sold for $19 per share (about 50% more than today's price), but I could have put that money to work for me in a more positive way. It is important to be able to admit when you're wrong, and I intend to learn from this mistake.\n\nSPONSOR CONTENT: The $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known Social Security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year!

Jon Shirek\n\nWXIA-TV (Atlanta)\n\nALPHARETTA, Ga. -- A text for help from a deaf woman who spotted two small children in a car highlights a 911 center in Georgia that is among the first cities in the state utilizing a popular technology.\n\nOn Wednesday night, she shared her story – through the same technology – with WXIA-TV.\n\nHer name is Lisa Collis, and she texted that it was at about 4:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve in a parking lot in Alpharetta when she saw two children alone in a parked car.\n\nLuckily for all, since Collis is deaf and this is Alpharetta, she was able to report what she saw by texting 911.\n\nOur 911 dispatcher was able to text back with her, said George Gordon with the Alpharetta Department of Public Safety. And they created a communications string where we obtained all the details, the location, what was going on, what's the problem, and we were able to dispatch a police officer to the scene... We're very grateful to Collis.\n\nGordon said this was the first time anyone had texted to 911 since the city started the 911-texting service in late 2014.\n\nI pulled in next to the car and as I was getting out I saw the children, but there were no adults in sight, she said. I waited 10 minutes in my truck before I texted 911.\n\nGordon said the texts go straight to police and an officer was heading toward Collis even while the 911 dispatcher was still texting with her.\n\nHere's what she and the dispatcher texted each other:\n\nCollis: Does anyone work on text?\n\n911: Alpharetta/Milton 9-1-1. If it is safe to do so please call 9-1-1. If not, what is the address of the emergency?\n\nCollis: I'm at Old Navy by Northpoint Mall. Someone left two young kids in the car. They're about 2 and 5 I think. I'm deaf.\n\n911: Okay, what type of vehicle?\n\nCollis: It's silver. It's parked right in front of the store.\n\n911: Car, truck, SUV or van?\n\nShe gives the dispatcher a few more details, and then the dispatcher tells her an officer is on the way.\n\nCollis said, in her texts with WXIA-TV on Wednesday, that she didn't think twice about contacting 911.\n\nI wasn't sure if it was going to work. I have two [children] of my own and I didn't think it was right to [leave kids in a car alone]. Especially if they were that young. No one should ever leave children in a vehicle, especially just to shop. I was thrilled when the 911 operator answered my text, she said.\n\nCity policy does not permit 911 dispatchers to appear on camera or answer questions from the public, including the news media, but Gordon said the center is proud that Alpharetta is the first city in Georgia to join a handful of Georgia counties in providing the 911 texting service.\n\nI would like to see more agencies making it available in all areas, Collis said. It not only made it accessible for the deaf people, but works for those who couldn't speak or if their lives are in danger.\n\nIt could be domestic violence, Gordon said. It could be seeing a serious crime in progress, or wanting to be an anonymous witness, whatever it is, where you don't have to speak [or it's too dangerous to speak], you can text-in anything to the 911 center now in our city, and that's a tremendous benefit to the public.\n\nGordon said in this case the parents had left a 15-year-old babysitter in charge of the children in the car, but the babysitter left the children alone.\n\nGordon said the parents had returned to the car by the time the officer arrived. The officer's investigation resulted in warnings, but no arrests.\n\nSo far, according to the FCC, Georgia is far behind other states in providing 911 texting.\n\nOnly a limited number of 911 centers in Georgia have upgraded. They include the City of Alpharetta, and Paulding and Floyd Counties.\n\nIn September 2015, two additional Georgia counties began offering 911 texting, Cobb County and Coweta County, but as of December, 2015, they had not yet been included in the FCC's data.
Unbidden, Gabby Giffords broke into song.\n\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound, she began in a clear voice, a broad smile on her face. It is a favorite hymn, one she was shown playing on her French horn in a clip at the Democratic National Convention last summer. That saved a wretch like me.\n\nThe former Arizona congresswoman had been talking to USA TODAY about the difficult, momentous year of pandemic and politics, one that ended with the election of her husband, Mark Kelly, to the U.S. Senate seat once held by John McCain.\n\nBut she was also talking about the difficult, momentous decade since she was grievously wounded by a gunman at a listening session she was holding outside a Tucson Safeway. On that Saturday morning, six others who had gathered to see her were killed. Their assailant would be sentenced to life in prison.\n\nFriday is the 10th anniversary of the attack that transformed her life and has reverberated through the lives of others.\n\nGabby Giffords breaks out in song discussing her life 10 years after Tucson shooting Staff Video, USA TODAY\n\nShe'll mark the day as she has before, by remembering those who died, touching base with those who survived, and pressing her efforts for gun violence laws through the advocacy group she heads, Giffords. She plans to join the dedication of the new January 8th Memorial in Tucson's El Presidio Park, a green space around a reflecting pool, an event being held virtually because of the coronavirus.\n\nI'm happy and I'm sad, she said when asked about how she'll feel on the anniversary. One, two, three, four, five, six shootings – dead.\n\nA shadow passed over her face as she remembered the young aide, the federal judge, the 9-year-old girl and the others who were murdered that day. Then she stiffened her posture and collected herself, punching her left hand in the air for emphasis as she repeated her mantra: Move ahead. Move ahead. Move ahead.\n\nThe past is never far away, of course. An hour or so before her conversation with USA TODAY, conducted over Zoom on Wednesday afternoon, a mob supporting President Donald Trump's grievances over the election had stormed the Capitol and forced the frantic evacuation of lawmakers from the House and Senate chambers, including Kelly. Giffords had gotten reassurances that he was safe just before the interview.\n\nScary, she said.\n\nAfter the interview was over, she posted a message on Twitter to her husband. As I sat waiting for information about @SenMarkKelly's safety today, I couldn't stop thinking about what you must have gone through 10 years ago this week, she tweeted. I love you, sweetie.\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, converse at their home in Tucson, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2014. David Wallace/The Arizona Republic\n\nAlmost precisely 10 years since her Congress on your Corner event was disrupted by a gunman, the Capitol itself had come under assault. Then, she was an up-and-coming lawmaker and her husband was an astronaut, in Houston as he prepared for a flight to the International Space Station. This time, he was a newly minted senator and she was working from their new D.C. home on the campaign against gun violence that she has adopted as her own.\n\nWomen of the Century: Gabby Giffords among influential women on Arizona list\n\n'People were calling it Gabby's Group '\n\nShe and Kelly founded their advocacy group in 2013, in the wake of the horrific mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Originally called Americans for Responsible Solutions, the organization's name was changed in 2017 to simply Giffords, a reflection of her signature role on the issue, a recognition of her brand.\n\nPeople were calling it 'Gabby's Group,' said Peter Ambler, a former congressional aide who is now executive director. We decided to cut right to the chase.\n\nGabby Giffords is the co-founder, chief spokesperson and lead fundraiser for the group that carries her name. She sets the tone and sets the strategy, Ambler said, marked by an effort to recast gun laws as a public-safety issue, not a cultural one, and to reach across partisan lines. The group now claims about two million supporters, 70 staff members, and an annual budget of more than $20 million.\n\nFormer Rep. Gabby Giffords, speaks during a news conference to announce the introduction of bipartisan legislation to expand background checks for sales and transfers of firearms, on Capitol Hill, on Jan. 8, 2019 in Washington.

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who has emerged as a central leader against gun violence since the Sandy Hook shooting in his home state. He and Giffords have been friends since both were first elected to the House in 2006 and assigned offices next to one another in the attic of the Cannon House Office Building.\n\nProgress in enacting federal laws on gun violence has been excruciatingly slow. Two years ago, the Democratic-controlled House passed legislation to strengthen the federal background check system – in a nod to Giffords, it was introduced on Jan. 8 and numbered H.R. 8 – but the Republican-controlled Senate never took up the bill and Trump had vowed to veto it, anyway.\n\nNow Democrat Joe Biden is poised to be inaugurated as president and the new Senate will be under Democratic control, improving its prospects for passage. That is her top priority for the year, Giffords said.\n\nPatience and persistence, even in the face of setbacks, are qualities she has honed in her own recovery from the bullet that pierced her brain. She has limited use of her right arm and leg; she walks with a limp and uses a cane. Her memory is sharp and her humor intact, but she struggles to speak.\n\nFor her videotaped remarks to the Democratic National Convention in August, which lasted about 90 seconds, she practiced and trained with her speech therapist for 130 hours, Ambler estimated.\n\nThat said, her use of language this week was more fluent than it had been during a USA TODAY interview with her in 2014, although she still typically responds to a question with just a word or two. Now 50, she seemed more confident and relaxed. She easily recalled the name of a Tucson restaurant she had taken the reporter to more than six years earlier – it was Pizzeria Bianco – and lamented the fact that it has since closed.\n\nStorytellers event marks 10-year anniversary of Giffords shooting Watch\n\nA year of Zoom and masks\n\nThe year of COVID-19 has been isolating for her, as for so many others.\n\nZoom, she said when asked about her year, them made the wah-wah-wah sound of a sad trombone. Lot of Zoom. Lot of Zoom. Lot of Zoom.\n\nShe has been taking a virtual yoga class twice a week as well as French horn lessons and Spanish lessons. She rides her recumbent bike whenever she can. And masks, she adds, describing 2020. The masks.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., talks with his wife, former Rep.

In Tucson, I'm home; I'm home, she said, noting her least favorite feature of the East Coast. Freezing cold. Really cold! Wintertime. Oh, chilly.\n\nGiffords' willingness to let people see her struggle is one reason she has been so effective as an advocate, said Patricia Maisch, a constituent who had signed up to speak with her that day 10 years ago. She had grabbed the assailant's extra ammunition to keep him from reloading his gun. Watching her progress endears her to a lot of people and helps pull them to the light side, Maisch, now 71, said in an interview.

He had long planned to be a nurse or doctor; afterward, he decided to pursue public policy instead. He now is a member of the Arizona House of Representatives.\n\nThe anniversary of the shooting can get me into kind of a funk, Hernandez said in an interview, so he turns to a favorite song, the iconic 1963 duet of Happy Days Are Here Again and Get Happy sung by Judy Garland and a young Barbra Streisand.\n\nI listen to that on a loop all day, he said – that is, on Jan. 8 each year, the day of the shooting. It seems like it was just yesterday, but it also feels like it was a lifetime ago.\n\nGabby Giffords shooting: Who was shot, and how they changed How a mass shooting at a suburban Tucson shopping center on Jan. 8, 2011, changed their lives forever. Thomas Hawthorne, The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nFor Giffords, too, her life and her mission were changed that day, but she is not a person generally given to funks. It will be a long, hard haul, but I'm optimistic, she said. She pointed to the outcome of Georgia's Senate runoff elections this week. Two Republican incumbents backed by the NRA lost to Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who were backed by Giffords and other gun safety groups and now give control of the Senate to Democrats.\n\nWarnock won! she said.

Alex Berezow and Dr. Chuck Dinerstein\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nEven though the long, difficult process of developing an effective vaccine against the coronavirus has ended successfully, now begins another long, difficult process: the act of administering the vaccine into people's arms. According to Reuters, 10 million doses of the vaccine remain unused. What is going on?\n\nVaccine administration is much harder than it sounds for at least two reasons: logistics and vaccine refusal.\n\nThe logistical problem begins with shipping and storage, since the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must be kept in the freezer. (The Pfizer vaccine requires an especially cold freezer.) But the logistical problem doesn't end once the vaccine arrives at its final destination. The process of vaccinating thousands of people in a single location is a challenge in and of itself.\n\nTo facilitate the process, patients must register ahead of time rather than standing in line. Not only does this reduce the risk of social congestion, but it allows more efficient allocation of vaccines, which reduces waste.\n\nSolutions to the problems surrounding vaccination\n\nThe best way to accomplish this would be with a COVID vaccine app. At least one state will launch an app soon, but every state needs one. Additionally, an app that can factor in age, gender, and other underlying health conditions could help prevent line jumping. Medicare might be in a good position to create a federally coordinated registration app, but they have no expertise in scheduling programs. Therefore, there is no national COVID app, and we are unlikely to get one.\n\nAnother logistical problem is the observation period required after a person receives the jab. Patients must remain socially distanced, but waiting rooms in most facilities aren't all that big. Therefore, the rate at which people can be vaccinated is capped. To help address that, we need to work around the clock. After all, President-elect Biden's goal of fully immunizing one million people a day translates to 1,388 vaccinations per minute (since two doses are required).\n\nAngry politicians have made things worse. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's solution is to fine everyone. Healthcare providers that are too slow to vaccinate will be fined $100,000, while those that speed things along by giving the vaccine too freely will be fined $1,000,000. The result is predictable: 54% of New York's vaccines are sitting idle, and some have been thrown in the trash. Apparently, fines don't fix logistical problems.\n\nThe second challenge is vaccine refusal. Disturbingly, a substantial proportion of frontline health care workers — about 50% in some locations — are refusing the vaccine. Why?\n\nCOVID vaccine:Why holding second doses of COVID-19 vaccines in reserve is the wrong strategy\n\nAnti-vaccine propaganda on social media always plays a role, but the problem is much bigger this time. One reason is that much of the public fears that the vaccines were rushed before being properly tested. This is not true, as the Phase III clinical trials enrolled over 30,000 volunteers for each vaccine.But the perception persists. Names like Operation Warp Speed probably didn't help.\n\nIn addition to sending a terrible message that frontline health care workers don't trust the health care system, vaccine refusal also worsens the labor shortage currently hitting hospitals, which in turn exacerbates all of the other logistical problems. What can be done?\n\nHow to speed up the sluggish rollout\n\nTwo things. First, mass vaccination programs for the general public should occur in large spaces, such as mostly idle school gymnasiums and cafeterias. Also, because so many people are working from home, there is a lot of empty retail space that could be converted into makeshift clinics.\n\nSecond, it should be public health policy that frontline health care workers cannot refuse the COVID vaccine. Those who do should be given a choice: Get the jab or lose your job.\n\nCOVID surge:Brace for another onslaught of COVID cases. The post-Christmas surge has begun.\n\nNow, the Trump administration announced that all available vaccines are to be released to people aged 65 and older, consistent with the plans of the incoming Biden administration. While this approach has its advocates, we are concerned that the clinical trial data does not support such a move. Specifically, we do not know if the vaccines will remain effective if a second dose is delayed beyond one month. Policymakers may want to reconsider.\n\nOur scientists have done the heavy lifting of providing us with a safe and effective vaccine in record time. Now, it is up to our local governments, public health officials and health care workers to do their part.\n\nAlex Berezow, a Ph.D. microbiologist, is vice president of scientific communications at the American Council on Science and Health.

Jason Noble\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa — The 2016 caucuses and the subsequent presidential election are over, but three candidates remain in debt for their Iowa campaign efforts.\n\nOne year after Iowans initiated the 2016 presidential race, former Republican candidates Rand Paul, Chris Christie and Rick Santorum still owe a collective $45,000 to Iowa businesses and individuals. The debts were reported in year-end campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday.\n\nRand Paul, the Kentucky senator and Libertarian-minded Republican who placed fifth in the Feb. 1, 2016, caucuses, owes a total of $29,000 to Victory Enterprises, a Davenport-based political consulting group. The bills are related to the campaign's online store sales as well as printing and collateral.\n\nVictory Enterprises founder and consultant Steve Grubbs could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.\n\nFormer Ohio lawmaker's case shows flaws in campaign finance law enforcement\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie campaigned hard in Iowa but ultimately placed 10th in a 12-candidate field with a paltry 3,284 votes. His year-end report recorded a $12,276 debt to Bruce Rastetter, an agribusinessman, Republican donor and president of the Iowa Board of Regents, for private air travel.\n\nA spokesman for Rastetter said Wednesday that the debt has been taken care of — perhaps in January after the period captured by the year-end report had ended — and would not appear in Christie's next filing.\n\nRick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator who won the 2012 caucuses but never gained traction in 2016, owes $4,000 to the Iowa Policy Institute, a West Des Moines-based political consultancy, for grassroots consulting services.\n\nPatti Brown, the firm's director, declined to comment except to confirm that she'd done work for Santorum and say that she believed the outstanding balance was accurate.\n\nAmong the other 14 GOP candidates and the three leading Democratic candidates, several others have outstanding campaign debts, but none owes money to vendors or individuals in Iowa.
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Thursday to renew for six years a surveillance program that collects the content of an unknown number of Americans' email, text messages, photos and other electronic communication without a warrant.\n\nThe Senate voted 65-34 to renew the controversial law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The action came after Senate leaders narrowly won a vote Tuesday night to allow the renewal bill to move forward.\n\nThe House approved the legislation last week, and President Trump is expected to sign the bill before the law expires at midnight Friday.\n\nFederal intelligence agencies, which urged Congress to renew the law, have credited the program with thwarting terrorist attacks against the U.S. by giving them the power to spy on the electronic communications of foreigners located outside the U.S.\n\nThe men and women we trust to protect this country say this capability is essential to their missions, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday in a speech on the Senate floor. They tell us that it has saved American lives. That is why we cannot let this capability lapse.\n\nCritics say they support the law's anti-terrorism goals, but want to amend it to protect Americans' constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Specifically, they want federal agents to get warrants before searching through a database of Americans' emails and texts that are collected as part of the foreign surveillance.\n\nOur intelligence agencies do need a FISA program to protect us, said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. But our security as a people also requires real protections from invasive governmental spying.\n\nThe Section 702 program was originally approved by Congress in 2008 to increase the government's ability to track and thwart foreign terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIt was designed to spy on foreign citizens living outside the U.S. and bars the targeting of American citizens or anyone residing in the U.S. But critics say the program also sweeps up the electronic data of innocent Americans who may be communicating with foreign friends or relatives, even when those foreigners aren't suspected of terrorist activity.\n\nIntelligence officials have so far refused to tell Congress how many unknowing Americans have had their personal communications collected under the program.\n\nCivil liberties groups of all political stripes fear that the FBI and other federal agents could use the information collected on Americans to search for evidence of domestic crimes — such as failing to pay taxes or minor drug offenses — without having to obtain a warrant as they normally would in such cases.\n\nThe government will use this bill to continue warrantless intrusions into Americans' private emails, text messages, and other communications, said Neema Singh Guliani, policy counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. No president should have this power.\n\nSupporters of the law say that federal courts have upheld its constitutionality and that critics' concerns are unwarranted. They credit the law with stopping terrorist plots to bomb the New York City subway system and the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nLet me be clear: this has been tested in the courts and the courts have ruled that this program is lawful and constitutional, said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe debate crossed party lines, with libertarian-minded Republicans such as Lee, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Sen. Steve Daines of Montana joining with liberal Democrats such as Sens.

Apple will help launch a global innovation and learning hub for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as part of its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nThe Propel Center will offer support to students and faculty at HBCUs through virtual platforms, a physical campus at Atlanta University Center and on-campus activities.\n\nApple will contribute $25 million toward the center, which will offer educational tracks such as AI and machine learning, app development and augmented reality.\n\nWe are all accountable to the urgent work of building a more just, more equitable world – and these new projects send a clear signal of Apple's enduring commitment, said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement.\n\nCES 2021:Masks, air purifiers and other gadgets trying to protect us from COVID-19\n\nYouTube ban:Google blocks new uploads to Donald Trump's channel after Capitol riots\n\nApple also plans to open the first U.S. developer academy in Detroit.\n\nThe academy will offer two programs: The first is a 30-day introductory program aimed at helping participants better understand what it means to be a developer. The other is a 10- to 12-month intensive program that will give them the skills to become a developer and possibly start their own business.\n\nDetroit has 50,000 small businesses that are owned by Black and Brown owners, and we thought this would match very well with that entrepreneurial spirit and the kind of folks who are rebuilding and building in Detroit, said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives.\n\nAs part of the announcement, Apple said it will invest $10 million with Harlem Capital, a New York-based venture capital firm, to support investments in companies with diverse founders. It will also invest $25 million in the Clear Vision Impact Fund, which provides capital to small and medium-size businesses, with a focus on minority-owned companies.\n\nApple announced their Racial Equity and Justice Initiative in June, one of several companies to reveal donations and commitments following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Last year, YouTube announced it was investing $100 million in an initiative for Black creators, while PayPal unveiled a $530 million plan to support Black-owned businesses and battle economic inequality.\n\nOther companies outside tech have revealed similar commitments. Last month, a coalition of CEOs from 37 companies pledged to hire, train and promote 1 million Black Americans to jobs over 10 years.\n\nHowever, companies in and out of the tech sector have been scrutinized for a lack in diversity both in their workforces and upper-level management. A USA TODAY analysis last August found less than 2% of top executives at the 50 largest companies are Black.\n\nAt Apple, only 9% of its employees are Black, according to diversity data from 2018. Google says 3.7% of its workforce is Black. According to 2019 diversity data from Amazon, more than 26% of its global workforce is black, but only 8.3% at the managerial level.\n\nContributing: Adrienne Roberts, Detroit Free Press\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.
Time's run out: Outgoing first lady Melania Trump won't be carrying out one last first-lady duty by inviting incoming first lady Jill Biden to tea and a tour of the White House family quarters.\n\nHaving failed to do so before she and President Donald Trump fly off to Florida early on Jan. 20, the day Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th President of the United States, making the snub the first deliberate break in the 100-year-old first ladies' transfer-of-power tradition in decades.\n\nIn modern history, there has always been an invitation, this goes back to at least Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower (in 1952), says Kate Andersen Brower, author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, Trump, 50, made an effort to carry out some first-lady traditions she liked, but not this one.\n\nInstead, she posted a seven-minute farewell video on her Twitter account, reflecting on her four unforgettable years in the White House, praising her own FLOTUS Be Best agenda, and urging Americans to remember that violence is never the answer and will never be justified.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the East Wing but so far Trump has not commented on her failure to meet with Jill Biden. Trump's chief of staff and spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, resigned abruptly in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob pro-Trump extremists.\n\nWe have not heard from the First Lady's office, said Michael LaRosa, spokesman for Jill Biden.\n\nIn an interview with former first daughter Jenna Bush Hager Tuesday on the Today show, Biden's daughter, Ashley Biden, confirmed there are no plans for the walkthrough, but shrugged at the impact.\n\nNo, I don't think they're doing the traditional protocol, which is unfortunate, she said. But I think we're all OK with it.\n\nEarlier, the first lady posted an essay on the White House website last week denouncing both violence at the Capitol and salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks and false misleading accusations she claimed were aimed at her, although she didn't explain.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House – not the president – invited the Bidens to spend the night before his swearing in at Blair House, the presidential guest residence on Lafayette Square across from the White House, and the Bidens accepted, according to a statement to USA TODAY from the State Department, which oversees the complex. Outgoing presidents have customarily extended the Blair House invitation to incoming first families since former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter in 1976.\n\nAdd these to the catalog of norms broken during the Trump administration, not just by the president but by his wife.\n\nThe former fashion model, who has been an unusually low-key FLOTUS, announced her unconventional approach early when she delayed moving into the White House by five months so her then-10-year-old son Barron could finish the school term in New York.\n\nOnce again breaking with tradition, says Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff for former first lady Laura Bush, who's now a fellow at American University who directs the First Ladies Initiative exploring their influence on politics, policy and global diplomacy.\n\nThe civic ritual of the first ladies' meet-and-greet just after the election may seem inconsequential but it's not, first lady historians say. It's at least as important as the usually simultaneous meeting of the outgoing and incoming presidents, which also did not happen.\n\nPresident Trump will be among a handful of outgoing presidents who skipped their successor's inauguration, and the first in more than 150 years. No one can think of a first lady who deliberately snubbed her successor, at least not in modern times.\n\nIt's one of the more visible customs that became a tradition, so that for the last 40-plus years or more, Americans have grown accustomed to seeing the new first family invited to the White House in tandem with the president inviting the president-elect, McBride says.\n\nAlmost organically over the decades, this tradition has come to symbolize a kind of peaceful transfer of power, not to mention good manners and grace under pressure, McBride and Andersen Brower say.\n\nThe point is conveying unity and continuity, and that is the most dramatic, visible display that the transfer has occurred – that the new first family has gone to the house, McBride says.\n\nCeremony matters. Tradition matters, adds Andersen Brower. Our expectations about what's normal and civil behavior in our society matters.\n\nI know a tea in the Residence between two powerful women married to presidents might seem quaint, but I believe in the power of these traditions to set the stage for civil relationships that lead to dialogues between people that can sometimes lead to action, she adds. Michelle Obama and Laura Bush were able to work together because of the relationship they forged early on.\n\nObama in turn hosted Trump at the White House days after the bitter November 2016 election campaign. Both Trumps had indulged the racist birther movement that asserted President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S., a slur the former first lady later said she never forgot and never forgave. But the two of them managed to convey civility as they discussed how to raise children in the White House fishbowl.\n\nThe ostensible purpose of the meeting is to give the incoming family a walk-through of the White House's private living quarters on the second and third floors and introduce them to the residence staff.\n\nAccording to the White House Historical Association, 19th-century presidents-elect and their wives typically called on the sitting president and first lady once they arrived in Washington, and sometimes the outgoing presidents hosted dinners or receptions for them. By the 20th century, this had changed. Newspaper coverage suggests that the first well-documented first ladies meeting for tea and a tour of the White House took place in December 1920 when first lady Edith Wilson hosted her successor Florence Harding.\n\nIn fact, these meetings between first ladies have not always been sweetness and light even when the new administration is from the same party as the outgoing administration, as was the case with Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush in 1989. Their relationship was frosty at best, even though Bush had served eight years as second lady in the Reagan administration. Their meeting was brief, occurring just nine days before the Bushes were to move in, according to Andersen Brower.\n\nIn 1960, when Mamie Eisenhower welcomed ailing Jacqueline Kennedy (she had given birth to John Jr. via a Caesarian-section two weeks earlier) to the White House, that was awkward, too, according to Andersen Brower. Aside from politics, the older, frumpier Eisenhower resented younger, glamorous Kennedy, and was reluctant to move out of the White House.\n\nJackie had been told by the White House that she would be getting an invitation in mid-November, but Mamie clearly had no interest in making a big announcement or a show of public affection to her young and beautiful successor. Mamie was in control and she intended to relish her position, Andersen Brower wrote in her book.\n\nThe much-anticipated meeting was not revealed to reporters until five minutes after Jackie had arrived.\n\nOther meetings between first ladies didn't happen because of tragedy or resignation: Lady Bird Johnson became first lady suddenly in 1963 after the assassination of President John Kennedy, but she welcomed her successor, Pat Nixon, in 1968.\n\nBetty Ford became first lady in 1974 after President Richard Nixon resigned rather than be impeached, and her husband, then Vice President Gerald Ford, became president, then lost his re-election bid in 1976 in part because he pardoned Nixon. Devastated by the loss, Ford didn't really want to meet her successor Rosalynn Carter but she conducted a brief but cordial tour after President Ford reminded her to be a good sport, Andersen Brower writes in her book.\n\nThe reason there's been no mingling of Trumps and Bidens at the White House is because the president never conceded he lost the election and has spent the last two months baselessly claiming he won by a landslide. He acknowledged the inevitable only in the wake of the riot at the Capitol by a mob of his supporters whipped into a rage by Trump at a rally down the street from Capitol Hill.\n\nLast week, Melania Trump, who only occasionally said or did anything to contradict her husband, recognized the obvious as well, saying it was the honor of my lifetime to serve as first lady.\n\nShe portrayed herself as a victim of shameful attacks from people who are looking to be relevant and have an agenda. This may have been an allusion to another call-out by her ex-friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who's been promoting her critical book about Trump and charged in a Daily Beast essay that Trump was as morally responsible for the mob as her husband.\n\nOnce she was living in the White House, Trump carried out other traditional first lady engagements, particularly those involving children, whom she made the focus of her Be Best initiative. Except for the pandemic, she was always on hand for the annual Easter Egg Roll and Halloween party, and the annual visit to Children's National Hospital in Washington.\n\nShe dutifully greeted the White House Christmas tree's arrival every year and organized the holiday decorations, although a secret recording by Wolkoff showed she really didn't care for that latter task. She hosted a record low of only two state dinners (a third was cancelled due to the pandemic in 2020), and enthusiastically revealed details of the table settings, menus and decor for both formal affairs.
For many Americans who watched the violence engulf the U.S. Capitol last week, the treatment of the rioters came down to a matter of Black and white.\n\nLaw enforcement officers responded slowly, and in some cases passively, as a largely white crowd that supported President Donald Trump trashed the seat of Congress in a fit of violence that led to five deaths.\n\nThe images loomed in stark contrast to last year's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, when mostly peaceful protesters decrying the constant killings of African Americans by police were frequently met with rubber bullets, tear gas and a significant show of force by law enforcement.\n\nNo one can tell me that if that had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden said, addressing the nation a day after last week's riot.\n\nRacism is the Achilles heel of the United States, and the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer; the death of Breonna Taylor who was shot in her apartment by Louisville Metro police officers; and a pandemic that is having a disproportionate impact on people of color, has vividly illustrated the vast economic and social inequalities woven into the American system.\n\nRace, particularly the hardened notions around Black and white identity, is not rooted in biology. Rather, scholars say, this stratification that has riven virtually every aspect of American life was a social construct that allowed an elite few to hoard wealth and power, justified the subjugation of those being exploited, and created a color divide that prevented the working class from uniting.\n\nResearch shows that the racial wealth gap wasn't created because of something that individuals or families of color did wrong,'' says Kilolo Kijakazi, an Institute Fellow with the Urban Institute, a think tank focused on economic and social policy. It is driven by these structural barriers … policies, programs and institutional practices that facilitate the creation of wealth for white families while creating barriers to wealth accumulation by or stripping wealth from families of color.''\n\nIn the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, those long-standing racial and economic disparities are putting African Americans at greater risk of losing their jobs, their businesses, their homes, and their lives.\n\nAs a result of the downturn caused by the health crisis, 9.9% of African Americans were out of work in December, in contrast to 6% of whites, 9.3% of Latinos and 5.9% of Asians.\n\nAfrican American entrepreneurs, long denied equal access to credit and capital, struggled to access the federal paycheck protection loans that kept some businesses afloat during the early months of the pandemic.\n\nBlack- and brown-owned small businesses had less access to that relief,'' Biden said on Jan. 8 when announcing his economic and jobs team. He added that one-third of Black-owned small businesses, as well as one-fifth of those owned by Latinos and more than one-quarter of Native American-owned businesses had less than a month of cash in reserve to handle expenses without more relief.\n\nAnd the median wages paid to Black workers, whether they lack a high school diploma or have a graduate degree, are less than whites at every level of education, according to Kijakazi, citing analysis by the Center for Economic and Policy Research. That makes it harder to save and build a financial cushion to fall back on during hard times.\n\nBlack people are striving for the American dream, but they're simply not getting the return on their investment,'' says Andre Perry, a Brookings fellow who is the author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities.\n\nWe're working, Perry adds. We're going to school. We're buying homes. But predatory lending, job discrimination ... and racism is throttling economic mobility.''\n\nBlack and white: The beginnings\n\nHuman beings, whether they're from Senegal or Syria, Australia or the United States, share 99.9% of the same DNA, and most of the differences represented by that fraction of a percent have no biologic relevance,'' says Lawrence Brody, director of the Division of Genomics and Society at the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nBut in the past few hundred years, the development of the concept of race, and the assigning of status according to such distinctions, became a way to serve the self-interests of those who had, and wanted to maintain, power.\n\nClearly, in modern times, it was just an excuse for domination,'' Brody says.\n\nAnti-racism scholar Ibram X. Kendi traces the start of documented anti-Black racist ideas to The Chronicle of the Discovery and Conquest of Guinea.'' The work, published in 1453, sought to justify exclusive trading in enslaved African captives by Portugal's Prince Henry as an endeavor to expose them to Christianity rather than as a way for him to build wealth.\n\nThe author, Gomes Eanes de Zurara, essentially created the idea of multi-ethnic Blackness that is inferior in the minds of racist thinkers, Kendi said in an email. The captives had varying skin tones and represented several different peoples, but Zurara deemed them a single group that was lesser and in need of salvation.\n\nSo, Kendi says, racist notions became a way to justify the exploitation of African peoples.\n\nA similar scenario would play out two centuries later across the Atlantic, where wealthy British colonists would protect their power by creating a society that granted and denied opportunities, protections and basic rights along color lines. But those divisions, ultimately codified by law, were carved out over time.\n\nThough terms like Negroe,' and Indian'' were used during the early 17th century, the first time a law uses the word white'' to refer to a category of people in the English-speaking colonies that became the U.S. appears to have occurred in April 1691, according to Terrance MacMullan, professor of philosophy at Eastern Washington University and author of Habits of Whiteness: A Pragmatist Reconstruction, citing research by the historian Theodore Allen.\n\nThe law, passed by the colonial Virginia legislature known as the House of Burgesses, threatened banishment for any free white man or woman who married a negroe, mulatto, or Indian man or woman bond or free,'' and essentially outlawed English women having sex with any man who was not white.\n\nBut disparate treatment for those who would be defined as white, and those who were deemed Black, had begun decades before.\n\nIn 1640, John Punch, an African man, ran off with two other servants, a Dutchman and a Scotsman. When the three men were caught, they were punished quite differently.\n\nWhile the two Europeans with white skin had to fulfill their period of indentured servitude and then spend another three years as servants to the colony, Punch, a Black man, was sentenced to bondage for the rest of his life.\n\nThey do the same thing, commit the same offense ... but the 'negro' will be in perpetual servitude,'' says Deena Hayes-Greene, co-founder of the Racial Equity Institute in Greensboro, North Carolina. That's beginning to create this wedge.''\n\nThe Virginia colony's wealthy planters became focused on keeping laborers from uniting and the Virginia Slave Codes of 1705 were pivotal and onerous. They created white slave patrols, criminalized marriage between whites and people who were Black or of mixed heritage, and expanded the rights of those who owned enslaved people, including giving them permission to kill those workers without consequence.\n\nThese poor white people who had been seeing themselves similarly oppressed with indigenous people and kidnapped and enslaved Black people are now aligned with land-owning whites,'' Hayes-Greene says. The message was, 'You're not going to get what we get, but you'll get more than them. You can police them, you can oversee them, you can harm them in any way, and you'll be acquitted.'\n\nIn 1790, after the United States had become a nation, whiteness officially became a requirement to vote, own land and to have other rights when the country's first rule of naturalization declared that only a free white person'' could be a citizen.\n\nThose early laws had long-ranging ramifications.\n\nOne of the continual questions about American politics is why Americans across what we call race lines don't make common cause according to class,'' says Nell Irvin Painter, author of The History of White People.'' And a lot of that is because of the really gut-level impossibilities for poor white people and working-class whites to see themselves together with poor and working-class nonwhite people.''\n\nThe cost\n\nThe economic disadvantages Black people face began most glaringly when those who were enslaved were denied the ability to profit from their own work, Kijakazi says.\n\nFor Black families, these policies began with human trafficking and bondage of people of African descent to build wealth for white people, while denying Black people wealth from their own labor, she says.\n\nLong after the Civil War, the ability of Black Americans to build and hold on to wealth continued to be hindered, whether it was discrimination that blocked them from getting more than menial jobs, the destruction of Black businesses and homes by white mobs in cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma, or restrictive covenants and redlining that prevented Black buyers from moving to white areas or getting loans to buy and build in neighborhoods of color.\n\nMany whites, however, do not believe discrimination has been an impediment to Black Americans getting ahead, according to a USA TODAY analysis of a Pew Research Center survey from early 2019. Among those earning between $30,000 to $74,999 a year, 33% of whites believed racial bias was a significant reason African Americans might have a harder time progressing than whites, compared with 79% of Black Americans who felt that way.\n\nThe wedge of race has made it more difficult to enact economic policies that could broadly benefit Americans, regardless of background, particularly those who are lower income or part of the working and middle class, scholars and social justice experts say.\n\nIt's a part of the American ethos,'' says Bishop William Barber II, co-chairman of the Poor Peoples Campaign, regarding the use of race to divide people who he says should otherwise be allies.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson, a Texan who shepherded the most significant civil rights legislation of the past century, spoke of this dichotomy as well. According to a 1988 article in The Washington Post written by journalist and former Johnson staff member Bill Moyers, Johnson told him that, If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.\n\nActivists and scholars note that working-class Americans broadly agree on policies that could lead to greater economic equity.\n\nDavid Madland, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, says his research found working-class Americans, regardless of race, backed progressive economic policies and when given the opportunity to vote directly on ballot initiatives, supported changes like raising the minimum wage.\n\nBut the working class do not often get a direct say on economic issues,'' Madland says. Most often they are choosing between candidates .... Some candidates seek to divide the working class along racial lines, often to avoid having to deal with the common economic issues that the working class of all races deal with.''\n\nAn emphasis on those issues however could erase those divisions.\n\nRace can be a wedge,'' Madland says. But a focus on progressive economic policies can help unify the working class.\n\nUnity in place of division\n\nCross-racial alliances have existed throughout U.S. history, from the abolitionists who fought to end slavery, through the early days of the labor movement, and up to the recent protests against police brutality and systemic racism that filled the nation's streets.\n\nAnn Beeson, the former CEO of Every Texan, an Austin, Texas-based social justice advocacy group, says that while some politicians have resorted to racist dog whistles to argue against the Affordable Care Act, both white Texans and people of color have been united in demanding health care access.\n\nThere is no question that the conservative political resistance to Medicaid expansion in the South is rooted in racism, Beeson said. But It's important to distinguish between politicians and the grassroots ... because there is broad support from both people of color and rural and other white Americans in actually pushing for Medicaid expansion.''\n\nMultiracial coalitions are also working to boost wages and secure job protections and benefits for the working class.\n\nThe labor movement has embodied both alliances and division. Black and white workers in the South drew together during the Reconstruction period that followed the end of the Civil War, but were purposely divided when laws were passed to reinforce white supremacy, says Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union.\n\nEven without government intervention or politicians influence, parts of the labor movement excluded workers of color from joining. That's why I think this is a moment for our union and the rest of the labor movement to embrace the fight for racial justice and to integrate into it how we bargain on behalf of workers.''\n\nOne recent union victory involved an agreement with Swedish Health Services, a health system with multiple hospitals in Washington State. Workers bargained together and got management to agree to stand with nurses of color if a patient says they'd prefer a white nurse instead, the SEIU says.\n\nThe Poor Peoples Campaign has focused on mobilizing poor people of all backgrounds, organizing ... from Alabama to Appalachia,'' Bishop Barber says. He says that when campaign workers have told white coal miners in Kentucky, for instance, that the same politicians who are supporting voter suppression laws have also voted against legislation that would raise wages, or allow them to unionize, invariably, in room after room, people see we're being played against each other.''\n\nIn June, he says, a virtual Moral March on Washington'' was attended by over 3 million people of every race, creed and color.''\n\nThat is meaningful, he says.\n\nIf Black and white people get together,'' Barber says, it's a new day.''\n\nContributing: Jayme Fraser
New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara has been fined $5,000 by the NFL for wearing cleats that violated the league's uniform policy on Christmas Day, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nWith one red shoe and one green, Kamara had six rushing touchdowns, tying an NFL record set in 1929 and finishing with a career-high of 155 yards rushing to help the Saints defeat the Minnesota Vikings 52-33.\n\nKamara shared his thoughts after the game, knowing that a fine was likely in his future.\n\nOh, they're probably going to fine me, Kamara said during a postgame interview. If they fine me, I'll just match it and send it to charity. The Grinch always tried to steal Christmas.\n\nThe league allowed Kamara to wear the cleats for the entirety of the game since they did not pose a safety risk or any branding issues, unlike a game between the Denver Broncos and the Cleveland Browns last year where Browns receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry were asked at halftime by the league to change their decorative, non-conforming shoes or be prohibited to play in the second half.\n\nKamara and the Saints head into Week 17 No. 1 in the NFC South. They play the Carolina Panthers on Sunday at Bank of America Stadium.\n\nContact Analis Bailey at aabailey@usatoday.com or on Twitter @analisbailey.
AP\n\nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) — Thomas Dimitroff's Super Bowl matchup against Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots is far more than an executive facing his former boss and employer.\n\nDimitroff, the Atlanta Falcons general manager since 2008, has extremely deep ties with Belichick. Dimitroff's first NFL job was on the Cleveland Browns' grounds crew when his father was a scout and Belichick was the coach.\n\nDimitroff climbed the ranks before spending five years as the Patriots' director of college scouting under Belichick.\n\nNow Belichick and the Patriots stand in the way of the Falcons' attempt to win their first Super Bowl.\n\nIt's a challenge Dimitroff said he relishes.\n\nThis is kind of a dream game that way, to be able to go against the Patriots and against one of my mentors in this league, Dimitroff said Friday.\n\nDimitroff's respect for his former boss is obvious. He says New England is where he learned the most important lessons that prepared him for the opportunity in Atlanta.\n\nI learned a lot from my father and from different places I was at, of course, but it wasn't until I got to the Patriots that I truly realized the idea at the core of the team concept, he said.\n\nI mean, I grew up hearing it all the time, but actually being put into effect there in New England, I'll take that with me forever.\n\nThe Falcons retained Dimitroff when hiring coach Dan Quinn in 2015. The two formed a management partnership that produced Atlanta's second Super Bowl berth, perhaps faster than either could have predicted.\n\nThough Quinn was given ultimate control of player personnel decisions, the two appear comfortable sharing authority with no apparent sign of friction. Dimitroff calls their relationship a partnership.\n\nThe coach and GM often are seen in warm embraces on the field after games, and Dimitroff says they talk 10 or more times during a day on so many levels from policy to acquisitions to how we're going to replace lights in this (indoor practice) facility.\n\nDimitroff says Quinn is a general manager's dream to be with. Quinn has started four rookies and four second-year players on defense this season.\n\nThe success of the young players, including rookies Keanu Neal, Dion Jones, De'Vondre Campbell and Brian Poole, is the best reward for a general manager and his scouts.\n\nI mean, he has all kinds of nerve to go into this season and start four rookie defensive players, Dimitroff said. To me, that's amazing. I've had countless personnel men call me and ... laud Dan for that. That's what personnel men want, that's what general managers want.\n\nQuinn was willing to commit to the rookies because of their speed and athleticism. That's the Falcons' new image, according to Belichick.\n\nI'd say the stamp on the team, the thing that I would notice the most is just the speed, the team speed that the Falcons have, Belichick said. They have a lot of fast guys. Defensively they close up space very quickly.\n\nQuinn said when he interviewed with Atlanta he was looking for a general manager who together we could share the whole vision of what a team could be.\n\nDimitroff's vision bears the imprint of his time under Belichick. The Patriots' influence also comes from Falcons assistant GM Scott Pioli, the former New England GM.\n\nDimitroff signed a three-year extension on Nov. 7 that carries through the 2019 season.\n\nBelichick said he remembers the young Dimitroff in Cleveland working in the organization when he was coming out of high school and into college.\n\nBut he's a football guy, so it's in the family, Belichick said. He works hard. He knows the game. He did a real good job for us with skill players, defensive backs, receivers, linebackers, running backs, things like that.\n\nThe Super Bowl will provide Dimitroff his ultimate test to prove he learned his lessons well under Belichick and taken them to a new level with Quinn.\n\nA lot of things that I brought to the table were learned in New England, he said. It's just been fun watching us develop here over the years.\n\nThere's definitely a northeastern stamp on it in certain ways, and yet we've really evolved into something that is very much the Falcons and not, obviously, the Patriots.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Foxborough, Massachusetts, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
Hal Bundrick\n\nNerdWallet\n\nImagine mortgage credit standards as a roadway, connecting lenders with potential borrowers who dream of owning a home. What in the mid-2000s was a wide-open superhighway with few barriers became, after the 2008 housing crash, became a one-lane path open only to the most credit-qualified.\n\nAs loan defaults multiplied and banks collapsed, lenders abruptly lost their appetite for risk and abandoned their former if you breathe, you qualify loan standards. The Urban Institute says lenders would have issued an additional 6.3 million mortgages between 2009 and 2015 if lending standards had been more reasonable — for example, like the pre-housing-crisis home loan requirements of 2001.\n\nWith such stringent loan criteria in place, homeownership rates in the U.S. fell sharply, especially for minority households, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n» MORE: Building financial health in the black community\n\nBlack and Hispanic households today are still far less likely than white households to own their own homes — 41.3% and 47%, respectively, versus 71.9% for whites — and the homeownership gap between blacks and whites has widened since 2004, Drew DeSilver, a senior writer at Pew Research Center, wrote in a recent report.\n\nPew research finds that black and Hispanic home buyers have a harder time qualifying for conventional mortgages than white and Asian applicants — and when approved, are typically charged higher interest rates.\n\nIn September 2016, Fannie Mae, the government-sanctioned company that buys many of the mortgages that lenders issue, unveiled two new credit scoring initiatives in its underwriting process. Here's what those changes may mean, especially to borrowers of color.\n\nTrended credit data\n\nFannie Mae's automated loan-underwriting system is how nearly 2,000 lenders determine whether a borrower qualifies for a mortgage. Among upgrades put in place late last year was the integration of trended credit data. This takes credit reporting beyond simply noting yes or no as to whether you paid a bill on time each month.\n\nTrended data actually takes into account the amount you pay, the level of revolving debt that you have and how that relates to your total available debt, says Mike Mondelli, senior vice president of TransUnion's alternative data services. It also compares the amount you paid with what the minimum due was.\n\nIt's a 24-month snapshot of borrowers' payment patterns. That allows lenders to better predict how borrowers might pay their bills going forward.\n\nFor example, consider two borrowers. One pays off the full balance each month or makes a payment higher than the minimum amount due. Another makes only the minimum payment due. Both pay on time, but if all else is equal, trended data might help a lender conclude that the first borrower is a lower credit risk.\n\nUse of trended data could move about 23 million people from a nonprime to a prime score categorization, Mondelli says.\n\nIn 2015, more than one-quarter (27.4%) of black applicants were turned down for home loans, most commonly because of credit history issues, according to Pew research. And people with subprime scores — generally considered to be below 670 — pay higher interest rates.\n\n» MORE: Check your free credit score\n\nAlternative credit data\n\nThe updated Fannie Mae system also incorporates some alternative credit data, such as rent and utility payments, when it's available. Mondelli says that information is just beginning to come into play.\n\nWhile credit and debit card companies have been adopting alternative credit data, mortgage lenders are the last to make such moves, Mondelli says.\n\nTrended data is the focus for now, particularly for mortgage lenders.\n\nAddressing the cause of tight credit\n\nKaran Kaul, a research associate for the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, doubts if either initiative will have a significant impact on minority homeownership.\n\nIt is a step in the right direction, and I think we need this step. We always want to improve our credit scoring models, Kaul says. But at the same time … this doesn't address the root cause of why credit is tight.\n\nUrban Institute research says lenders, for the most part, are still shying away from loosening lending restrictions because the scars of the housing crash remain fresh. And lenders are concerned about continued legal action and default risks.\n\nThe issue of tight credit is a structural problem that is, unfortunately, at this point deeply embedded into the mortgage market, and it's going to require a multipronged strategy, Kaul says.\n\nAre minority borrowers getting a break?\n\nStill, there may be some hope for minority borrowers. Mindy Armstrong Kielmeyer, senior product manager at Fannie Mae, says all 1,800 lenders that use its underwriting system have access to the upgrades.\n\nTrended credit data provides additional information that we can take into consideration when a borrower is on the border of getting an 'Approve' recommendation, Kielmeyer told NerdWallet by email. And with alternative credit data, lenders can now underwrite loans for borrowers with no credit score, she says. Since its implementation, we have seen hundreds of loan applications underwritten using this enhancement.\n\nHal Bundrick is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Just months before the presidential election, Facebook says it's taking steps to combat deepfakes, videos that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence to make it appear that someone has said or done something they haven't.\n\nFacebook is banning videos that are edited or synthesized to fool users but will allow parody and satire.\n\nWhy now? Many fear this insidious form of digital disinformation could be used to mislead voters, much the same way that fabricated news stories influenced public opinion in 2016.\n\nSo what are deepfakes anyway and just how worried should you be that the video you are watching isn't real?\n\nFake but convincing videos\n\nDeepfakes are videos doctored using cutting-edge artificial intelligence, or AI, to distort reality. The technology, which analyzes real images to generate fake ones, is a growing form of disinformation and social media platforms have been struggling with how to deal with it.\n\nFacebook and other tech companies are sponsoring a Deepfake Detection Challenge to encourage AI researchers to develop new ways to automatically detect doctored videos.\n\nFacebook disinformation:What you can do to stop its spread\n\nWait, is that video real? The dangers of manipulated recordings\n\nThe ability to create fake videos or manipulate existing videos has been around for decades but typically required some software or skill. In recent years, tools have become popular on social media and elsewhere that allow anyone to manipulate images and video, though this footage usually appears obviously manipulated.\n\nToday, powerful new technologies are making it cheaper, faster and easier to produce deepfakes that are nearly indistinguishable from reality, says Hao Li, associate professor of computer science at the University of Southern California.\n\nThere are also simpler but still effective ways to hoodwink social media users called cheap fakes, which typically involve editing videos to spread disinformation or propaganda.\n\nDigitally manipulated video is dangerous because we tend to have faith in what we see, Li says. It's a real problem, and it's something that is advancing really quickly, he says. Regulators and lawmakers are not catching up with this kind of technology.\n\nFacebook's new deepfake policy is too narrow, says Hany Farid, a computer science professor at University of California, Berkeley specializing in digital forensics.\n\nUnder the policy, Facebook would not prohibit videos using lower-tech methods of spreading disinformation, such as last year's video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi which was edited to make it seem as though she was slurring her speech, Monika Bickert, vice president of global policy management, told lawmakers during a Wednesday congressional hearing.\n\nWhat they are saying is: If it's a misleading video of someone saying something they didn't say and it was created using this specific type of technology, deepfakes, then we reserve the right to take it down, but if it was generated using some other kind of technique, we don't have a problem with that, Farid says. That doesn't really make sense. The issue is not how it was made, the issue is: Is it misleading and is it harmful?\n\nWhy you should worry (no, really)\n\nRachel Thomas, director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at University of San Francisco, says she expects cheap fakes and the more sophisticated deepfakes to proliferate ahead of the presidential election as part of shadowy campaigns to sway public opinion.\n\nImagine a fake Donald Trump or a fake Joe Biden simulated saying a racial slur. Then imagine how quickly those videos would spread on Facebook or YouTube.\n\nThe stakes are very high, Thomas says. This kind of misinformation can have a big impact.\n\nWhen used to target elected officials or political candidates, doctored video can erode trust. Nearly two-thirds of Americans recently surveyed by Pew Research said altered images and videos caused a great deal of confusion in understanding the basic facts of current events.\n\nHow can you spot deepfakes?\n\nHow can you tell if the video you're watching is a deepfake?\n\nThat is becoming incredibly difficult. The technology behind fake videos is improving almost on a continuous basis, says Siwei Lyu, computer science professor at the State University of New York at Albany and a member of the Deepfake Detection Challenge's advisory group.\n\nHe recommends psychological preparedness, as in being constantly on the alert for videos, images and audio that have been altered.\n\nWhenever you see an interesting video showing something that is bizarre or exceptional, a certain vigilance should be raised, he says.\n\nExamine the video carefully before sharing it on social media. Is the video low-resolution or grainy? Is it a single person talking in the video? Is it relatively short, say 30 seconds or 60 seconds long?\n\nIs the lighting strange or the face discolored or blurry? Is there blurriness between the face and neck or between the face and the hair? Is the sound not synced with the images?\n\nSome of the other tell-tale signs discernible to the naked eye, according to Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer science professor at Arizona State University: different-sized eyes or ill-formed teeth, or more than two eyes, or inconsistencies in the background of the video.\n\nBut, says Kambhampati, the rapid improvements in deepfake technology means that we will soon have to rely on AI techniques to detect what the human eye cannot.\n\nThere is not a 100% foolproof way of identifying deepfakes, not even for AI researchers, Thomas says. Detection is always going to be an arms race. As people develop more accurate detection algorithms, fakers will develop even more sophisticated frauds.\n\nThere are non-technical ways to sniff out a deepfake, just like other forms of disinformation. Ask yourself: Who is the person publishing this information? Is this person reliable? What else has this person posted? Are the claims in the post backed up by sources you trust?\n\nWhen in doubt, turn to nonpartisan fact-checkers who've spent hours, sometimes days, tracking down accurate information, Farid says.\n\nYou never want to jump to a conclusion one way or another, you never want to say: I looked at this and I'm sure it's real or I looked at this and I'm sure it's fake, he says. The best you can really hope to do is to say: You know what? I should be careful here because I'm not sure, and then research it.\n\nFair warning: It's going to get worse\n\nLi says his company, Pinscreen, will demonstrate for attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos how to livestream fake video.\n\nHe says it's part of an effort to raise awareness of the need for technologies that root out deepfakes.\n\nIn real-time, you can reenact yourself as Will Smith or some celebrity or a politician. You can be George Bush, he says. The results are very convincing.
Washington Capitals superstar Alex Ovechkin, recently named one of the captains for the upcoming NHL All-Star Game, has informed the league he won't be playing so he can better prepare for the second half of the regular season.\n\nMy body needs a rest, he said Wednesday.\n\nOvechkin, 33, clearly feels strongly about it, because NHL rules dictate that he will have to sit out a game for skipping the event.\n\nThe NHL started the one-game penalty in 2009 when Detroit Red Wings superstars Pavel Datsyuk and Nicklas Lidstrom sat out to rest their bodies for the stretch run. The Red Wings appealed, but the NHL refused to back down. The one-game penalty, served in the team's first game after the All-Star Game, has been policy since.\n\nBecause Washington's bye week comes right after All-Star weekend (Jan. 25-26 in San Jose), skipping this year's event has added appeal for Ovechkin, who has played in seven previous All-Star Games.\n\nIn 2016, Ovechkin and Chicago's Jonathan Toews both skipped the ASG and had to sit out a game.\n\nThis is bad news for the NHL because Ovechkin is a major attraction at All-Star Games, often playing to fans at these events. However, he also has more reason to skip this season because the Capitals played until June last year when they won the Stanley Cup.\n\nMORE:As the NHL season enters 2019, here are things that we don't want to see\n\nMORE:Opinion: Time for Chicago Blackhawks to take a break from the Winter Classic
AP\n\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — Magic Johnson swept in to soothe the rattled Los Angeles Lakers, a young, struggling team still reeling from front-office upheaval and the trade of leading scorer Lou Williams.\n\nThe Hall of Famer's words were brief before practice Wednesday, with some of the players meeting for the first time the former star of the franchise's Showtime era in the 1980s.\n\nHe's going to come in here and try to make us better, get us back to winning, Jordan Clarkson said.\n\nCo-owner Jeanie Buss installed Johnson as president of basketball operations after firing longtime general manager Mitch Kupchak and dismissing brother Jim as executive vice president of basketball operations a day earlier.\n\nEverything happened so fast, rookie coach Luke Walton said. The initial thought is why do it right before the trade deadline, but Magic came in and we got to work right away.\n\nWalton was processing his own conflicted emotions, having been close to Kupchak and Jim Buss. He spoke to both men on the phone after their ousters, listening as they offered encouraging words about his bright future with the franchise and ability to work with the young roster.\n\nIt was definitely a little sad, Walton said. It's important to really remember all the great things they did while they were here, too. On the other hand, you have Earvin coming in. He's in there and making phone calls.\n\nIt was a strange feeling all day, honestly.\n\nWalton said Johnson spent the last two days at the team's practice facility, talking with him and other employees about focusing on their individual jobs.\n\nIf I'm sitting in a room with Magic and he's selling me on something, most times I'm buying it, Walton said.\n\nJulius Randle experienced the awe factor when Johnson addressed the team.\n\nHe is going to be around, the power forward said. He has an open door policy to talk to him whenever we need to.\n\nPerhaps more important to the players than the front office shake-up was the absence of Williams, who is headed to the Houston Rockets for Corey Brewer and a future draft pick, a deal that has yet to be confirmed by either team. Rookie Brandon Ingram called Williams' departure a real heartbreaker.\n\nThe 30-year-old guard led the Lakers off the bench with 18.6 points per game. Williams was a fourth-quarter spark and steadying presence in the locker room.\n\nThat was my vet, Ingram said. He told me a lot of things on and off the court.\n\nThe Lakers have yet to announce Kupchak's replacement, although Walton referenced speculation that agent Rob Pelinka would be hired as GM.\n\nWalton said he wasn't involved in the team's discussions with Pelinka, who has been a frequent presence at Lakers games as Kobe Bryant's agent.\n\nI like Rob, Walton said. If it was someone I didn't like, I'd probably be disappointed.\n\nThe 16-time NBA champion Lakers come out of the All-Star break with a record of 19-39, third-worst in the league. They are at Oklahoma City on Friday and host San Antonio on Sunday.\n\nFocused on what he calls the big job he has to do, Walton tried to sound an upbeat note amid the mixed emotions still swirling around the team.\n\nIt's tricky because I am sad that Mitch and Jimmy aren't here anymore, but at the same time, I'm excited to be working with Magic and Rob when it finally happens, he said.\n\nI believe in the group that we have. We believe in our future.
Three former Galena (Reno, Nev.) High School football players have sued the coach, principal and Washoe County School District, alleging they were kicked off the team for standing up to the coach's bullying.\n\nIn the federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, the three players allege they were kicked off the varsity football team after they stood up to Coach Steve Struzyk for taunting and demeaning them during a dispute about an over-the-counter supplement. They also allege Principal Tom Brown backed Struzyk, telling the players that bullying behavior not allowed in the classroom is OK on the football field, according to the lawsuit.\n\nTerri Keyser-Cooper, who represents high school seniors Mateo Lemus, Bryan Madison and Jake Berger, said state law and the district's own anti-bullying policy prohibits such a double standard.\n\nThe public policy point we're trying to make is that this conduct is as prohibited on the athletic field as it is in the classroom, Keyser-Cooper said. This coach was over the top and played a significant role in harming these students and their future.\n\nIn a prepared statement, spokeswoman Victoria Campbell said the school district couldn't comment on the specifics of the lawsuit.\n\nThe district, however, takes all such allegations seriously and is looking into this matter, Campbell said. Based on its findings, the district will continue to adjust its policies, regulations, and training practices to ensure that all our children receive the highest quality education available in a safe and respectful learning environment.\n\nWe will also, when appropriate, vigorously defend the district's actions.\n\nThe three players had been co-captains of the football team this season and were recognized as star players for the school.\n\nBerger played running back and safety. He had 245 yards rushing and 41 yards receiving in three games. Lemus played receiver and linebacker. He caught 10 passes for 137 yards and four touchdowns in the Grizzlies' first three games. He also ran 10 times for 29 yards. And Madison played receiver and free safety. He caught two passes for 40 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nGalena finished 2-7 and did not win a game after the players were dismissed the week of Sept. 17. The season ended Oct. 27.\n\nStruzyk completed his 15th season at Galena. He couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nWhat's so really traumatic for these kids is they were all planning on getting football scholarships, Keyser-Cooper said. Football was an essential element of their life, to which they dedicated tremendous time and attention.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the school discovered in September the three players had used a testosterone-enhancing supplement, Boost Elite, which is available over the counter. Keyser-Cooper said it was ultimately determined that the supplement was not prohibited by Nevada Interscholastic Athletic Association.\n\nBut Struzyk was troubled by it. He called a meeting of the varsity players and angrily rescinded the trio's status as team captains.\n\nStruzyk placed a trash can in the middle of the room and with dramatic flourish ripped up the captain's papers for Lemus, Madison and Berger, the lawsuit said. Struzyk threw the ripped captains papers in a trash can he had positioned nearby. Struzyk condemned Lemus, Madison and Berger as a disgrace and unsuitable to be captains.\n\nA few days later, Struzyk called Lemus into his office and interrogated him about his use of the supplement and whether he sold it to other players, which Lemus denied. The lawsuit said the conversation took nearly 90 minutes as Struzyk berated Lemus, calling him a cancer on the team and belittling both his football and leadership skills.\n\nWhen Lemus tried to defend himself, the coach became enraged, the lawsuit said.\n\nI'm not the kind of person to bend over and take this, Lemus said, according to the suit.\n\nYou better learn to bend over if I tell you to, Struzyk responded, according to the suit.\n\nAs the conversation spiraled, Lemus felt that he was being forced to leave the team. He handed over his football gear and thanked Struzyk for the opportunity to play, the lawsuit said.\n\nIn the days that followed, Madison and Berger approached Struzyk, hoping to convince him to bring Lemus back. Struzyk angrily rejected their entreaty, kicked them out of his office and told them to turn their (stuff) in, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWhen the boys and their parents asked principal Brown to intercede, Brown told them such language is just football talk. A district investigation into a bullying complaint filed by the players' parents found there is not enough corroborating evidence to substantiate school personnel violated the district's anti-bullying policies.\n\nOutside of the confrontation over the supplements, the players reported that abusive language by coaches was common during practices.\n\nKeyser-Cooper acknowledged that tough language is common in athletics, but said abusive language shouldn't be accepted. She said the district's own policies prohibit it, pointing to a coaches handbook that advises coaches to treat players as they would treat their own children and to always act as a role model.\n\nThat way of treating football players is not supposed to happen, at least at the public high schools, she said.\n\nShe added that she doesn't believe these players are overly sensitive.\n\nThese guys have been around football their whole life, she said. It's not like they woke up one day and got offended because someone said something awful to them.
WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security requested more support from active-duty military troops Friday to bolster Customs and Border Protection officers along the southern border, according to two U.S. government officials.\n\nThe request is for more combat engineers to install concertina wire and for more aircraft and crews to transport CBP officers. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan must review the request and determine how to provide the assistance. A decision is expected next week, said the officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nDHS officials didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe DHS made the request as a standoff played out between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats about border security and how to respond to a large influx of migrants making their way across Mexico from Central America. Trump insists the situation is a national emergency, but Democrats have resisted wall funding without a more comprehensive overhaul of immigration policy.\n\nTrump initially called for the deployment of troops in October in a step that was criticized as an election-year ploy. The number of troops reached 5,800, but withdrawals began around the holidays as 4,000 troops remained. The current authorization for the deployment expires Jan. 31, although an administration official said that could be extended.\n\nThe latest troop request comes during a partial government shutdown that has lasted two weeks and that Trump said Friday could last months longer. Trump has demanded $5 billion, but Democrats who now control the House have refused to provide that much. CBP officers are considered essential personnel who continue working during the shutdown.\n\nTrump has called the southern border sieve and said illegal immigration pours through it so physical barriers are needed.\n\nTrump met again Friday with congressional leaders. Schumer said afterward that the president was prepared for the shutdown for a very long period of time, months or even years, which Trump confirmed at a later news conference. Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence, senior adviser Jared Kushner and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to meet with congressional staffers during the weekend to discuss options.\n\nWe're not doing a wall, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York, said Friday the shutdown made the border less secure because CBP officers were working without pay, immigration judges weren't being hired and a system for employers to check whether immigrants were eligible to work is offline.\n\nAs the president's talking about making the border more secure, his shutdown is making it less secure, Schumer said.\n\nMore:Exclusive: President Trump vows to send as many troops to the border 'as necessary' to stop caravan\n\nMore:US troops deployed to border will aid, not replace, agents\n\nMore:US border agents fire tear gas across Mexico border to stop 'rock throwers'
David Jackson, USA TODAY\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump nominated Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton to head up the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Trump transition team announced Wednesday.\n\nClayton, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell law firm, is a noted specialist in public and private mergers and offerings.\n\nCiting his campaign pledge to reduce federal regulations, Trump said Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.\n\nTrump added that we need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers.\n\nAccepting the nomination, Clayton pledged to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs.\n\nClayton interviewed with Trump on Dec. 22 during the president-elect's stay at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nTrump also continued to fill out his White House team, naming three deputy chiefs of staff: Katie Walsh, who will be responsible for the White House itself; Rick Dearborn, who will be in charge of legislative and intergovernmental affairs and Implementation, and Joe Hagin, who will be deputy chief of staff for operations.\n\nWalsh worked with incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus when he chaired the Republican National Committee; Dearborn served as chief of staff for Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a major supporter of Trump who has been nominated for attorney general; and Hagin performed similar duties for President George W. Bush.\n\nThe President-elect's bold vision to make America great again demands a team of doers who can hit the ground running on day one, Priebus said in a statement. Katie, Rick, and Joe will fill critical roles as we push forward on all of the key priorities for our great nation.\n\nThe transition team also announced nearly a dozen other appointees -- including former Apprentice contestant Omarosa Manigault, who will be communications director for the Office of Public Liaison\n\nRead more:\n\nWho has Trump picked for his Cabinet so far?\n\nPresidential Inauguration 2017\n\nTrump announces his first news conference since July
This week, USA TODAY Politics focuses on the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, his remaining Cabinet picks, the Senate runoff in Georgia, and certification of the Electoral College vote.\n\nDates to watch:\n\nJan. 3: New Congress is sworn in.\n\nJan. 5: Senate runoff election in Georgia.\n\nJan. 6: Congress will count and certify the electoral results in a joint session.\n\nJan. 20: Inauguration of Biden, who will take the oath of office.\n\nBe sure to refresh this page often to get the latest information on the transition.\n\nSeveral prominent GOP senators skip NDAA vote\n\nThe Senate voted to override President Donald Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on Friday, the first congressional override of Trump's presidency and a final rebuke just weeks before he leaves office.\n\nSeveral prominent, pro-military GOP senators skipped the vote, including Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who face runoff elections on Tuesday. The outcomes of those races will determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress.\n\nPerdue is currently quarantining after possible exposure to COVID-19.\n\nSenator Kelly Loeffler is so afraid of disagreeing with President Trump that she'd rather skip work and decline to support Georgia's military families than vote against Trump's reckless veto, said Alex Floyd, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Georgia. By skipping this vote for Georgia military families, Senator Loeffler is once again showing Georgians where her priorities lie in Washington.\n\nAdditionally, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is a vocal supporter of Trump on Capitol Hill, skipped the vote. He had posted on Twitter last week he would not vote to override the president's veto, and did not vote for the bill the first time.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nMore than 100 Republicans may object to election certification\n\nRepublican Rep.-elect Byron Donalds said Thursday that he will object to the certification process for making the results of the 2020 presidential election official.\n\nDonalds released a statement through social media that he cannot in good faith vote to support the certification of the Electoral College results on Jan. 6.\n\nThe future Florida congressman joins a growing list of Republican lawmakers who have vowed to object to the final vote count, which awarded President-elect Joe Biden with 306 electoral votes to President Donald Trump's 232. The effort to challenge the Electoral College result is certain to fail and comes even though no evidence of widespread fraud has been presented in any of the Trump campaign's myriad election lawsuits, nor was any such evidence found in reviews by the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nCNN reported Thursday that Donalds could be joined in objecting to the result by as many as 140 of his Republican colleagues in the House. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said on the The Bulwark Podcast that he expects at least 100 GOP members of Congress to join the effort, which he called the undermining of democracy.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is the lone Republican senator to announce he also plans to object to the vote count, which would force a debate and a vote on the objection. Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who tried to keep his members from joining House Republicans' objection, said in a conference call that he considers the upcoming vote to certify the election the most consequential I have ever cast in a 36-year Senate career, Axios reported.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., sharply denounced the institutional arsonist members of Congress who will object to the Electoral College vote, warning they were playing with fire.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence has asked a federal judge to reject a lawsuit filed by a group of Republicans led by Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, who want to put the authority to overturn the election in the hands of the vice president.\n\n– William Cummings, USA TODAY; Bill Smith, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nHow climate change is factoring into Georgia Senate runoff\n\nClimate and sea level rise haven't been a major focus of either Georgia runoff race ahead of the Jan. 5 election that could determine control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nWith Georgia's main population center about four hours from the beach, climate change and sea level rise remain backburner issues for many Georgia politicians, but Georgia has seen 10 inches of sea level rise since 1935 and scientists predict another 1 to 6 feet before 2100.\n\nEven though Sen. David Perdue owns a $1.3 million home near the water on exclusive Sea Island, the sitting senator's campaign website doesn't mention climate change. He earned a lifetime score of 3% from the League of Conservation Voters based on his voting record.\n\nPerdue's Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff said he sees climate change as a direct threat to prosperity and health on Georgia's coast, though he does not support the Green New Deal.\n\nThe Rev. Raphael Warnock, running against Sen. Kelly Loeffler, has also not endorsed the Green New Deal but sees a need to act on climate change issues, especially in coastal cities like Savannah, where he grew up.\n\nLoeffler, who often pivots to clean air and water and to the economy when asked about climate change, has cited her support of the Great American Outdoors Act as evidence of action she's taken to address the problem. The bill, which passed with bipartisan support that included every Democratic senator, is considered a victory for the environment, mainly for the funding it provides to restore and maintain national parks and other federal lands.\n\n– Mary Landers, Savannah Morning News\n\nTrump extends visa ban; court clears health insurance rule\n\nTrump on Thursday extended pandemic-related bans on green cards and work visas to large groups of applicants through March 31, while a federal appeals court sided with him on a rule that requires new immigrants to have their own health insurance.\n\nThe twin developments on the final day of 2020 encapsulated how Trump has made U.S. immigration policy more restrictive without support from Congress. Biden has promised to undo many of Trump's actions, but it is unclear how quickly and even to what extent.\n\nFederal judges have limited the impact of the pandemic-related visa bans, which were set to expire Thursday. Biden, who is now forced to decide when and whether to lift them after taking office Jan. 20, doesn't specifically address the issue in his immigration platform.\n\nBiden also doesn't directly address the health-insurance requirement in his platform. A lawyer who sued over the policy on Thursday urged him to immediately rescind the requirement.\n\nIn its ruling issued Thursday, a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel voted 2-1 to clear the way for Trump's requirement that immigrants have health insurance. New immigrants must demonstrate they can obtain coverage within 30 days and pay their medical expenses. A federal judge blocked the rule from taking effect almost immediately after it was announced in October 2019.\n\n– Elliot Spagat, The Associated Press
Well, last week was both a good and bad week to take a vacation.\n\nWhile spending some time off at home (mostly playing board games, watching Frasier and cuddling with Apollo), I got the news about the riot at the U.S. Capitol through breaking news alerts, on TV and in text messages from friends and family. Since I wasn't working, I wasn't consumed with newsroom chats, editorial tasks and writing like I often am during tragic and scary events.\n\nTurns out, I rely on that distraction as a coping skill far more than I realized. Without a long to do list and the buzz of work to keep my mind busy, I had to use other coping strategies to get through the week. I leaned on my support system. I exercised. I let my husband take my phone so I'd stop doom-scrolling. And it helped. Even just a little bit.\n\nIt's hard, we're more exhausted than we know (more on that below) and it's a tough and scary time. I hope this newsletter can offer some distraction and some help this week.\n\nToday's mental health tips\n\nThere is a term for what a lot of us are feeling right now.\n\nMy colleague Alia Dagastir, wrote about emotional exhaustion, the feeling many of us have right now. Our tanks are empty, as she put it.\n\nEmotional exhaustion is this sense of overwhelmingness. Overwhelmed to the point where you feel like you don't have the capacity to deal anymore, said Vaile Wright, senior director of health care innovation at the American Psychological Association. It's physical tiredness. It's mental tiredness. It's difficulty concentrating. It's all the things that we experience when we're just at our capacity.\n\nAnd yet, most of us don't have the luxury of stepping away from our responsibilities, especially now. In this era of uncertainty, we can't eliminate some of our biggest stressors nor can we predict which one is coming next.\n\nHere are some tips from mental health experts about dealing with this extreme exhaustion.\n\nSet boundaries. If you've been supporting a friend or family member, maybe it's our turn to say, 'Hey, I don't have the bandwidth to be your emotional support right now. I care for you. I love you. But I really got to hang up the phone and take care of me for a moment,' said Lynn Bufka, associate executive director for practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association.\n\nIf you've been supporting a friend or family member, maybe it's our turn to say, 'Hey, I don't have the bandwidth to be your emotional support right now.

Christina Goldbaum\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nMOGADISHU, Somalia — Africa's most chaotic country is struggling to elect its first democratic government in a half-century.\n\nGiven its recent history for war and turmoil it's not surprising that Somalia's fledging effort at democracy has been marred by delays, corruption and allegations of vote-buying.\n\nSince October, people have gone to polling stations across the country to cast ballots as part of a complex process to choose members of parliament who will then vote for a new president and prime minister. The goal is to install the Horn of Africa nation's first representative leadership since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre ousted a popularly elected government in a 1969 military coup.\n\nHe was overthrown in 1991, engulfing Somalia in a bloody civil war — first between clan militias and then by the al-Shabab terrorist group, which continues to control swaths of territory.\n\nThe last 25 years have been particularly bad with ... the state destroyed, said Michael Keating, the U.N. special representative for Somalia. This is the first time since 1969 that the Somalis are attempting to put together a rules-based process involving quite a large number of people to bring about a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nThough Somalis were promised a direct election for 2016, political leaders instead designed an indirect vote: 14,025 delegates chosen by 135 clan elders are electing members of the lower house of parliament. The clan elders are choosing the upper house members, and the two houses of parliament will then elect a president and prime minister by late January.\n\nThe country's last parliamentary election took place in 1984, but was hardly democratic: Strongman Siad Barre only allowed voters to approve a list of 171 members of parliament his regime had chosen.\n\nAn indirect process was created for the latest elections, because Somalia has no court system to handle any election disputes and no national census to register voters.\n\nFor many Somalis, the lack of promised universal suffrage represents a continuation of government by a powerful elite.\n\nWe are hearing that corruption is high. We are hearing people have been excluded from becoming candidates, and regional administrators are abusing their power, said Mursal Saney, deputy director of the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies in Mogadishu. It's unfair to empower a political elite that already was dominated and to keep others outside the power.\n\nDuring negotiations by clan elders on who to choose, seats were being sold for as much as $1.3 million, according to one official involved in the electoral process who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.\n\nIn a country where 73% of the population lives below the poverty line, many Somalis see the widespread graft as an indication that the elites aren't serving the country's pressing needs. We as a civil society would like for the money that is being spent on vote-buying to be spent on the establishment of social services like schools, hospitals, clean water, electricity, said Abdullahi M. Shirwa of Somalia Peace Line, a non-profit group in this capital city.\n\nJiiddu Clan elder Suldan Warsame Aliyow admitted that the election has involved some misconduct, but few of the allegations could be proven by the Independent Election Dispute Resolution Committees.\n\nI'm sure it's not a 100% perfect system, but in every election happening everywhere in the world there are always complaints (of corruption), even in America, he said.\n\nOne change that is winning praise is that women get 30% of the seats in both houses of parliament, long dominated by men. Women are no longer onlookers but active participants in matters that affect them, said Hamsa Sheikh Hussein, a newly elected female member of parliament in Kismayo.\n\nHussein says she does not believe the 30% quota will be met, and that those women who do win seats will face tough opposition from male colleagues once parliament is in session.\n\nHer district includes an area still largely controlled by al-Shabab, which remains a continual threat despite the presence of 17,000 African Union peacekeepers in Somalia.\n\nThe terrorist group, which has links to al-Qaeda, targeted clan elders and government officials in the past six months to derail the electoral process.\n\nTheir goal has always been to disrupt government operations in Somalia ... to cause an image of insecurity and fear in this country, said Lt. Joe Kibet, spokesman for the African Union Mission.\n\nSecurity concerns and logistical problems have delayed the presidential vote three times, but electoral officials hope the vote will occur in January. After that, parliament can begin finalizing a provisional constitution and defining the roles of government positions.\n\nYou know there aren't often periods in a nation's history where it has to design itself, said the U.N.'s Keating, and that's what the Somalis are doing.
WASHINGTON – Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican, voted to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday, leading a list of Republicans who backed the president's removal after blaming him for inciting a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol last week.\n\nTrump will leave power as the first president in the nation's 245-year history to be impeached twice. The vote to impeach Trump was 232 to 197, the most bipartisan impeachment vote in history.\n\nThere has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution, Cheney said in a statement Tuesday, declaring: I will vote to impeach the President.\n\nSENATE:Impeachment trial likely won't begin until Biden sworn in\n\nCheney, R-Wyo., was the highest-ranking Republican to back Trump's removal from office. She noted that the Jan. 6 attack, which resulted in five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer, aimed to obstruct America's democratic processes and caused injury, death and destruction in the most sacred space in our Republic.\n\nFor that, Cheney said the president alone was to blame.\n\nThe President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing, she said in a statement. None of this would have happened without the President. The President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence. He did not.\n\nNine other Republicans also voted to impeach Trump:\n\nRep. John Katko, R-N.Y.\n\nRep. Fred Upton, R-Mich.\n\nRep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash.\n\nRep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio\n\nRep. Tom Rice, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich.\n\nRep. David Valadao, R-Calif.\n\nKatko, a former federal prosecutor and moderate Republican who endorsed Trump for reelection, said he reviewed the facts and reached his own conclusion.\n\nTo allow the President of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy, Katko said in a statement. For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this President.\n\nKinzinger, a former Air Force veteran who served multiple tours overseas, said there was no doubt in my mind that the President of the United States broke his oath of office and incited this insurrection.\n\nMore:House passes measure calling on Pence to invoke 25th Amendment; Pence says he will not\n\nI will vote in favor of impeachment, he wrote in a statement.\n\nUpton, a moderate, joined the group Wednesday, saying he would have preferred censuring the president, but he had decided it is time to say: Enough is enough.\n\nHerrera Beutler announced late Tuesday she would vote to impeach, saying her party will be best served when those among us choose truth. She slammed Trump's pathetic denouncement of the violence during the riots.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats applauded Republicans for backing the effort.\n\nGood for her for honoring her oath of office, Pelosi said of Cheney.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., similarly applauded Cheney, calling her a person of principle.\n\nNewhouse on Wednesday became the first Republican to announce on the House floor that he would support impeaching Trump.\n\nLast week there was as domestic threat at the door of the Capitol and he did nothing to stop it, Newhouse said.\n\nThat is why with a heavy heart and clear resolve, I will vote yes on these articles of impeachment, he said to applause from the Democratic side of the House.\n\nThroughout Trump's presidency, Cheney has remained a loyal Republican vote but has repeatedly come out against the president over his rhetoric and some foreign policy decisions.\n\nIn recent months, Cheney's criticisms of the president have grown stronger. She's taken veiled jabs at Trump over his refusal to wear a mask, publicly asked him to stop using his Twitter account to accuse an MSNBC media host of murder and pushed Trump for answers after media reports surfaced showing Russians had offered bounties to the Taliban for killed U.S. troops.\n\nAnd before backing Trump's removal, Cheney vehemently opposed pro-Trump efforts by some of her Republican colleagues to object to counting Electoral College results in certain swing states, saying on Twitter that Congress has no authority to overturn elections by objecting to electors. Doing so steals power from the states & violates the Constitution.
Christopher Rugaber\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — The partial shutdown of the U.S. government has begun to make it harder to assess the health of the economy by delaying or distorting key reports on growth, spending and hiring.\n\nGovernment data on home construction and retail sales, for example, won't be released next week because staffers who compile those reports have been furloughed. The retail sales report provides a snapshot of consumer spending, which fuels more than two-thirds of the economy. With Macy's and Kohl's having said Thursday that their holiday sales were weaker than expected, a broader gauge of retail spending would have provided important clarity.\n\nIn addition, the next report on the economy's overall growth, set for Jan. 30, won't be released if the shutdown remains in effect. Even if the government has fully reopened by then, federal workers won't likely have had enough time to produce the scheduled report on the nation's gross domestic product.\n\nNot all agencies are closed. Congress approved funding last year for the Labor Department, so the government's next monthly jobs report will be released as scheduled on Feb. 1. But it's unclear how long the department will be able to issue jobs reports — the most closely watched barometer of the economy — after that.\n\nThough the economy remains healthy in most respects, there are rising concerns that growth could slow or even stall in coming months. The trade war between the United States and China, which has helped depress global growth, is likely slowing business investment. The stimulus from the Trump administration's tax cuts is expected to fade.\n\nAnd borrowing costs have risen since the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates four times last year. Before rebounding this week, stock markets had plummeted roughly 16 percent from their peak Oct. 2.\n\nFed officials are now stressing their flexibility on rate hikes, emphasizing that they will be patient and their policy data dependent. By this, the Fed means that the government's latest readings on hiring, inflation and growth will factor heavily in its rate decisions. Yet much of that data will now be unavailable — to the Fed or anyone else.\n\nFor us, one of the biggest effects of the shutdown has been around data, Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed's Atlanta regional bank, said Wednesday. We're worrying about that.\n\nEven some reports that are released on schedule are likely to be distorted by the shutdown. For example, the January jobs report may show an artificially high unemployment rate and low employment figure. That's because up to 380,000 federal employees who aren't working or being paid during the shutdown — but who will return to work afterward — could be counted as unemployed for January.\n\nIf so, that would raise the unemployment rate by 0.2 percentage point, estimated Ben Herzon, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. And the monthly job count could decline by 380,000 if the shutdown continues through the end of January, Herzon said. That could push the monthly job figure into negative territory.\n\nIf all the federal workers eventually receive back pay, as occurred after previous shutdowns, then the January jobs report would later be revised to restore those 380,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFuture jobs reports could be jeopardized, too, if the government remains shut down. The Census Bureau conducts the monthly surveys that the BLS uses to calculate the unemployment rate. Census is part of the Commerce Department, which remains closed during the shutdown. As a result, it's unclear if future jobs reports will be released if the shutdown continues, the BLS said.\n\nOther economic reports have already been missed. They include a monthly report on factory orders that was scheduled for Monday. That report typically provides insights into how much U.S. companies are spending on large equipment.\n\nInflation data will also be affected: The consumer price index will be released Friday morning as scheduled, because it is prepared by the Labor Department. But the Fed's preferred inflation gauge is published by Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is closed.\n\nAnd because the Agriculture Department is closed, future reports on wholesale prices and import prices won't include farm-related data, the BLS said Thursday.\n\nA report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, considered a nearly real-time reflection of layoffs, is still being published. But it could be distorted by the shutdown: Nearly 5,000 federal employees sought benefits two weeks ago, according to the latest data available, roughly five times the usual figure.\n\nAnd only a portion of the government's report on productivity, or output per hour worked, will be released Feb. 6, the Labor Department said. That's because that report requires data on the growth of GDP, the broadest measure of the economy.\n\nEven after the government fully reopens, weeks will likely be needed before all the postponed reports can be prepared and released.\n\nIt may take some time to get a 'clean' read on the economy, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Thursday.
Paul Singer and Jenny Ung\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The Senate Ethics Committee released its annual report this week declaring that for the ninth straight year, it imposed no disciplinary sanctions against anyone in 2015. Since 2007, the committee has received 613 allegations of wrongdoing and has summarily dismissed more than 90% of them. Only 75 have had even a preliminary investigation.\n\nThe total of the committee's discipline during the nine-year period is a half-dozen letters the committee has written to senators saying, basically, you should not have done that. The committee did not issue activity reports prior to 2007, and did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nThe committee's activity reports indicate that in nearly every case, allegations are dismissed because there are not enough facts to prove wrongdoing (13 of 55 cases last year) or there is no Senate rule governing the alleged activity (36 of 55 cases). In seven cases last year, the Ethics Committee carried out preliminary inquiries; five of those were dismissed as inadvertent or minor technical violations. None of those cases was made public by the committee.\n\nThese results raise all kinds of red flags, said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center. It begs credulity that there have been no ethics violations worthy of disciplinary sanction since 2007 in the entire Senate. The fact is the Senate Ethics Committee has become the 'dead letter' office.\n\nThe lack of public punishments may simply reflect that the committee has not found any violations that rise to that level, said Stanley Brand, an ethics lawyer who has advised the committee and also advised lawmakers under investigation. You don't start out saying we have a quota of members of the Senate that we are going to prosecute, Brand said. There has to be a probable cause for every investigation. Ethics watchdog groups want every peccadillo to be investigated like a federal crime and I don't think that's the way it should work.\n\nA coalition of government watchdogs, including the Campaign Legal Center, sent letters to Senate leaders in 2014 urging them to reform the committee and create an independent ethics office modeled after the House Office of Congressional Ethics, which reviews ethics allegations and makes recommendations to the House Ethics Committee for further action. OCE reports become public even if the Ethics Committee rules that there was no violation, which has made the office wildly unpopular among lawmakers.\n\nThe last time the Senate Ethics Committee issued any kind of public scolding was a May 2012 letter to then-Sen. Tom Coburn, saying that he should not have held an official meeting with Doug Hampton, a former aide to then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who had become a lobbyist but was still barred from lobbying the Senate. The incident was part of Ensign's messy affair with Hampton's wife; Coburn had intervened to counsel Hampton on his departure from Ensign's office and the committee concluded it should have known he was still under a lobbying ban. Ensign resigned while the Ethics Committee was investigating him.\n\nSenate Ethics has a reputation of being a black hole for allegations, said Jordan Libowitz of the left-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Information tends to go into the committee and nothing comes out of it.\n\nLibowitz said the committee tends to be more interested in protecting the individual senators and staffers instead of the institution.\n\nThe committee serves both as the ethics cop and the ethics adviser to the Senate. In 2015, the Ethics Committee handled approximately 10,265 telephone inquiries and 2,784 inquiries by email for ethics advice and guidance and wrote 930 advisory letters on how to avoid conflicts of interest or improper gifts, according to the new activity report.\n\nBy comparison, from January 2013 through December 2014, the House Ethics Committee launched 53 investigations, created four subcommittees to probe specific matters and issued 19 publicly disclosed resolutions as well as 43 resolutions that were confidential, according to an activities report it issued a year ago.
Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nIt's no secret that most Americans are woefully unprepared for retirement. According to a report from the Economic Policy Institute, the median family between the ages of 32 and 61 has just $5,000 saved in a retirement account, while almost half of workers have no retirement savings whatsoever.\n\nGiven the many expenses you'll face as a senior, it pays to get your hands on as much retirement money as possible. So this year, when you think about your 401(k) strategies and goals, don't make the same mistake a good 25% of workers are currently making: passing up an employer match.\n\nHow much free money are we giving up?\n\nEmployer matches weren't always the norm, but these days, companies seem to be getting more generous. An estimated 92% of companies that offer a 401(k) plan are willing to match employee contributions up to a certain amount. Unfortunately, 25% of workers don't contribute enough to capitalize. The result? We're leaving an astounding $24 billion in unclaimed matching dollars on the table each year.\n\nIn fact, the average employee who doesn't receive a full company match passes up $1,336 annually. And not surprisingly, it's lower earners – those who need that extra money the most – who are increasingly likely to miss out. Among those earning less than $40,000 a year, 42% don't contribute enough to pocket company matching dollars in their entirety. Higher earners – those making more than $100,000 a year – are far more likely to get a full match, though 10% still end up falling short.\n\nAge is a factor here, too. Employees under the age of 30 are about twice as likely to miss out on employer matching dollars than those over the age of 60. And while workers are more likely to claim their full employer match as they get older, this trend is interrupted when they reach their mid-30s and only picks back up in their mid-40s – presumably because during this time, child care expenses and obligations eat up much of the money they'd otherwise allocate to retirement savings.\n\nBut no matter your reason for passing up free money, it's a major mistake, and one that might prove costlier than anticipated in the long run. The thing to remember about passing up a 401(k) match is that you're not just losing out on the base amount you fail to collect; you're also forgoing the opportunity to grow that money into a larger sum.\n\nLet's assume you pass up $1,336 a year for 20 years, during which time your investments could've generated a somewhat-conservative 6% average annual return. First of all, over the course of 20 years, that's $26,720 less in your 401(k) right off the bat. But if you take growth potential into account, you're actually missing out on $49,000 – almost double.\n\nNow think about what $49,000 might do for your retirement. For one thing, it gives you an extra $200 a month in spending money over a 20-year stretch. Furthermore, it's money that could go a long way toward travel, paying off your mortgage or tackling the mountain of medical bills you're likely to face as you age.\n\nNo matter how old you are or how much you earn, here's your takeaway from all of this: Do what it takes to collect that employer match. Otherwise, you're putting your retirement at risk.\n\nFinding ways to save\n\nIf you're living paycheck to paycheck, contributing to a 401(k) can be easier said than done, so here are a few ways to eke out some additional savings:\n\nBank whatever extra money comes your way. Whether it's a bonus, a tax refund, or an unexpected inheritance, take your found money and put it into your 401(k). If you weren't counting on it to begin with, you should have less of a problem socking it away.\n\nCut back on one major spending category. If you take one large expense and lower it, whether it's housing, transportation or food, you might feel the effects less so than you would by cutting numerous corners elsewhere. Think about it: You're probably better off living in a smaller apartment and shaving $300 off your rent than slashing your cable package, getting rid of your internet service, and being homebound every Friday and Saturday night to save money on leisure.\n\nConsider some part-time work. If your current paycheck is truly maxed out but you have a hobby or talent you can monetize, a little effort might bring in some much-needed cash. It's far better than spending three evenings a week rotting away at a telemarketing center. That said, if your only option is that less appealing job, take it, at least temporarily, if it will give you enough cash to get that full match.\n\nIt's not often that free money comes your way, so if you have a chance to get your hands on some extra retirement cash with no strings attached, you'd be crazy not to take advantage. And while it might require some sacrifice now, your 65-year-old self will be unquestionably grateful down the line.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Matthew Stevens\n\nMontgomery Advertiser\n\nAUBURN – The price for fans storming the court Saturday following Auburn's 75-70 upset win over then-ranked No. 14 Kentucky will be six figures.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference announced Monday what Auburn officials already considered a formality by setting the fine at $100,000 for the fans getting on the playing court in violation of the league's access to competition area policy.\n\nThe court storming by fans following Auburn's first win over Kentucky since 2000 was the first in the history of Auburn Arena and first for the Tigers men's basketball program since 2001. Before Saturday's win, Auburn had lost 32 of its last 33 contests against the Wildcats program.\n\nWhen you beat Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas or Duke in college basketball, it is significant, Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. When you beat a team like Kentucky, all of a sudden you have an opportunity to be nationally relevant even if it for a very short period of time.\n\nThe celebration at Auburn Arena Saturday is seen as the school's second violation of the policy went into effect on Dec. 1, 2004. Auburn's first offense was when fans flooded the field of Jordan-Hare Stadium following Chris Davis' 100-yard touchdown return in the Tigers victory over Alabama in the 2013 Iron Bowl matchup.\n\nThe Conference has unanimously approved a policy requiring fines be applied when spectators enter the playing court after a game, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said in the league's statement announcing Auburn's fine. While understanding the enthusiasm following an exciting victory, fans need to remain in the stands and avoid the safety concerns associated with rushing on to the playing floor. We want to have exciting experiences around SEC games, but also want to maintain a safe environment for student-athletes, coaches, spectators and officials.\n\nFinancial penalties for violating the league's policy were increased during the league's spring meetings and include all of a universities' sponsored athletic competitions. The fine structure is now $50,000 for a first offense to fines of up to $100,000 for a second offense and up to $250,000 for a third and subsequent offenses.
In closing arguments at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial last year, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff leveled a prescient warning.\n\nOf the president's efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to smear Democratic rival Joe Biden, Schiff declared that Trump will do so again.\n\nYou cannot constrain him. He is who he is, the California Democrat said.\n\nNearly a year later, Trump appeared to make good on Schiff's admonition during a stunning hourlong telephone call in which the president sought to strong-arm Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn his election defeat in that state.\n\nTwo weeks before the end of Trump's presidency, there is little time to launch an impeachment inquiry, but legal experts and Democratic lawmakers assert that Trump's action was tantamount to criminal conduct that should open him to fresh legal scrutiny.\n\nTop GOP: Liz Cheney calls Trump phone call 'deeply troubling'\n\nThis is a horrendous effort to undermine our system of government, said Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in President George H.W. Bush's administration. Is it something within the purview of the Department of Justice? Yes, absolutely. You open an investigation to figure out whether there is something you can do to stop it or punish it.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Trump's conversation with Raffensperger was made public, the first formal calls for a criminal inquiry came Monday from Reps. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., who urged the FBI to open an immediate criminal investigation.\n\nThe evidence of election fraud by Mr. Trump is now in broad daylight, the lawmakers said in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nThe FBI acknowledged it received the referral but declined further comment.\n\nThe Justice Department also declined to comment.\n\nRaffensperger, in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America, said an appropriate venue for an investigation would probably be the Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney's Office.\n\nDistrict Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, said her office stood ready to investigate if a case was referred to prosecutors.\n\nLike many Americans, I have found the news reports about the president's telephone call with the Georgia Secretary of State disturbing, Willis said in a statement.\n\nAs I promised Fulton County voters last year, as District Attorney, I will enforce the law without fear or favor, she said. Anyone who commits a felony violation of Georgia law in my jurisdiction will be held accountable.\n\n'It was a veiled threat'\n\nLieu and Rice said their joint request to the FBI centered on provisions of two federal election fraud statutes and one Georgia law, which they say Trump may have breached during his call Saturday with Raffensperger and the secretary of state's general counsel.\n\nThe lawmakers called specific attention to Trump's demands for Georgia officials to find 11,780 votes to overturn the Biden victory.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated, Trump told the officials, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nLieu and Rice said the president's request for a recalculation of the vote represented a solicitation of election fraud in violation of federal and state laws.\n\nWe request that if you believe Mr. Trump also violated state criminal law, that you refer the state violations to the Georgia Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney in Georgia, the lawmakers said in the letter to Wray.\n\nAt a briefing late Monday afternoon in Atlanta, Gabriel Sterling, the state's voting system manager, said he was not aware of discussions about the prospect of a criminal investigation.\n\nAsked to assess the president's call, Sterling said, I personally found it to be something that was not normal, out of place. Nobody I know who would be president would do something like that to a secretary of state.\n\nNick Akerman, an assistant special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation, said Trump's call to Raffensperger is not much different from wiretapped conversations involving Mafia bosses he heard during his years as a federal prosecutor.\n\nAkerman said he was particularly struck by Trump's suggestion that it's going to be very costly if the state official doesn't recount votes in a way that favors Trump.\n\nSo tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? said Trump, who was joined on the call by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and the president's lawyers. We won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. And it's going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers.\n\nMore:Trump travels to Georgia before Senate runoff that will decide control of Senate\n\nAkerman said the words represented a threat.\n\n(Trump) doesn't come right out and say, 'You're going to be in big trouble.' … When he says it's going to be costly, I think everybody knows what that means, he said. It's specific enough and vague enough that you know what he's talking about. Who would it be costly to? I mean, come on. … It was a veiled threat saying, 'You better take care of this and find me these ... votes or you'll be in trouble.'\n\nPeople get the message. … It doesn't take much. It's all there. It's right out of 'The Godfather,' Akerman said.\n\nThe former Manhattan federal prosecutor characterized the call as part of a pattern of criminal activity by the president, referring to Trump's call in 2019 when he repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, then his potential presidential rival. Akerman also cited the instances of possible obstruction outlined in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation and the presidential pardons he has granted to allies convicted in the Russia inquiry.\n\nMueller, who refused to clear Trump of criminal wrongdoing, said charging him with obstruction was not an option because of a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. After Trump leaves office this month, that policy would no longer be relevant should prosecutors pursue an investigation.\n\nThis is the way he operates. You can't look at (the call to Georgia officials) myopically. You have to look at this whole pattern of activity, Akerman said. If I were a prosecutor and I was given this case, I would be looking at … the federal racketeering statute.\n\nProving intent, political obstacles\n\nAs jarring as Trump's words sounded on the recording, some former prosecutors said, building a criminal case probably would be difficult.\n\nProving the criminal intent behind the words that Trump used during the calls is the biggest hurdle, said David Weinstein, a former Miami federal prosecutor. I ... can make an argument that (Trump) was encouraging Raffensperger to create fraudulent evidence or simply change the numbers. Alternatively, I can make an argument that Trump was simultaneously actively extorting Raffensperger to do the same, with a threat of criminal prosecution behind that suggestion.\n\nWeinstein said Trump defenders would probably argue that the president was puffing and simply suggesting other alternatives, not actively extorting or encouraging Raffensperger to break the law.\n\nThe prosecution would then have to show proof that Trump went beyond that and that it created a reasonable belief in Raffensperger's mind that he was being extorted or forced to break the law, he said.\n\nBrian Kelly, who was head of the public corruption unit of the U.S. attorney's office in Boston and was among the attorneys who prosecuted organized crime boss Whitey Bulger, said he does not believe the Biden Justice Department will – or should – pursue a criminal investigation based on Trump's call.\n\nProving election law violations are very difficult. If President Trump believes there are actually additional legitimate votes which need to be counted, then he is certainly within his rights to urge state officials to find them and count them, Kelly said. It's a waste of time, and it's inappropriate to use the criminal justice system to settle political scores.\n\nPatrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw numerous cases against organized crime figures, said a case against Trump would face political obstacles.\n\nBecause Trump is an elected official who has just lost an election, he and his supporters would claim that any criminal prosecution was politically motivated, Cotter said. Leaving aside the political difficulties of such a situation, the ability to ever seat a jury that was not infected with Trump's false claims of a political motivation for the charges would be a serious obstacle to conviction. Not insurmountable in my opinion, but significant.\n\nCotter said it was hard to separate the Trump recording from cases involving the conversations of known criminals – with a few exceptions.\n\nI would note that the majority of the mafioso I prosecuted or investigated would never have exhibited the astounding stupidity and obviousness of the Trump gang on that call, Cotter said. More intelligent criminals would never have made such threats on a call they should have expected was being recorded.\n\nWashington and Georgia require only one-party consent for recording phone calls. Somewhere I imagine John Gotti is shaking his head and muttering, 'Freakin' amateurs,' Cotter said.\n\nOpinion: Impeach Trump over new threats
Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nTo understand events around the world today, one must think in terms of the class struggle.\n\nThis sentence sounds like something that could be written by a doctrinaire Marxist. But it is nonetheless true. Much of the current tension in America and in many other democracies is in fact a product of a class struggle. It's not the kind of class struggle that Karl Marx wrote about, with workers and peasants facing off against rapacious capitalists, but it is a case of today's ruling class facing disaffection from its working class.\n\nIn the old Soviet Union, the Marxists assured us that once true communism was established under a dictatorship of the proletariat, the state would wither away and everyone would be free. In fact, however, the dictatorship of the proletariat turned into a dictatorship of the party hacks, who had no interest whatsoever in seeing their positions or power wither.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nToday's kids love socialism — but it's not because of their radical professors\n\nCastro, Chavez, and 'bad luck': Glenn Reynolds\n\nOn Syria, Trump is right to ignore failed foreign policy elites who embroiled us in Iraq\n\nYugoslav dissident Milovan Djilas called these party hacks the New Class, noting that instead of workers and peasants against capitalists, it was now a case of workers and peasants being ruled by a managerial new class of technocrats who, while purporting to act for the benefit of the workers and peasants, somehow wound up with the lion's share of the goodies. Workers and peasants stood in long lines for bread and shoddy household goods, while party leaders and government managers bought imported delicacies in special, secret stores. (In a famous Soviet joke, then-leader Leonid Brezhnev shows his mother his luxury apartment, his limousine, his fancy country house and his helicopter only to have her object: But what if the communists come back?)\n\nDjilas' work was explosive — he was jailed — because it made clear that the workers and peasants had simply replaced one class of exploiters with another. It set the stage for the Soviet Union's implosion, and for the discrediting of communism among everyone with any sense.\n\nElites of postwar institutions don't want change\n\nBut the New Class isn't limited to communist countries, really. Around the world in the postwar era, power was taken up by unelected professional and managerial elites. To understand what's going on with President Donald Trump and his opposition, and in other countries as diverse as France, Hungary, Italy and Brazil, it's important to realize that the post-World War II institutional arrangements of the Western democracies are being renegotiated, and that those democracies' professional and managerial elites don't like that very much, because they have done very well under those arrangements. And, like all elites who are doing very well, they don't want that to change.\n\nThe postwar era saw the creation of international institutions ranging from NATO to the United Nations to the World Bank, along with a proliferation of think tanks and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to accompany them. It saw the vast expansion of higher education in the United States, and the transformation of academic degrees into something close to must-haves for the upper-middle class. It saw a great expansion of power on the part of media organizations, and on the part of government bureaucrats and lobbyists, both of whose numbers increased enormously.\n\nBut after the turn of the millennium, other Americans, much like the workers and peasants in the old Soviet Union, started to notice that while the New Class was doing quite well (America's richest counties now surround Washington, D.C.), things weren't going so well for them. And what made it more upsetting was that — while the Soviet Union's apparatchiks at least pretended to like the workers and peasants — members of America's ruling class seemed to view ordinary Americans with something like contempt, using terms such as bitter clingers, deplorables and flyover people.\n\nClass wars in America disguised as culture wars\n\nSuddenly, to a lot of voters, those postwar institutional arrangements stopped looking so good. But, of course, the beneficiaries showed no sign of giving them up. This has led to a lot of political discord, and a lot of culture war, since in America class warfare is usually disguised as cultural warfare. But underneath the surface, talk is a battle between the New Class and what used to be the middle class.\n\nIf you look at the yellow jacket protests in France, the election of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and events in places like Italy and Hungary — or, for that matter, the Brexit movement in Britain — you find a similar unhappiness with institutional arrangements and the sleek and self-satisfied elites who benefit from them. People who, in President Bill Clinton's famous phrase, worked hard and played by the rules now suspect that the rules were rigged, and that they were treated as chumps.\n\nTalking about the yellow-vest movement, French geographer Christophe Guilluy observes: Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist, but this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it is not working anymore.\n\nThat's right. It's class war masquerading as something else, but people have seen through the mask.\n\nUnderstanding this won't make the conflict less intense, but it might make it clearer what's really at stake. What's happening in America is an echo of what's happening in democracies around the world, and it's not happening because of Trump. Trump is the symptom of a ruling class that many of the ruled no longer see as serving their interest, and the anti-Trump response is mostly the angry backlash of that class as it sees its position, its perquisites and — perhaps especially — its self-importance threatened.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
I've conducted somewhere around 10,000 interviews in my 40 years as a journalist, but one in particular has been on my mind lately.\n\nIt was my Sept. 12, 2016, face-to-face meeting with longtime USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nThe reflection was spurred by days of raw, emotional testimony over the last week in a Michigan courtroom. More than 100 amazingly strong women detailed the physical and mental struggles they experienced after being sexually assaulted by Nassar under the guise of medical treatment.\n\nTheir horror stories have been covered live on TV and spread across the Internet, attracting worldwide attention to what many are calling the worst sex abuse scandal in American sports. Nassar, a 54-year-old physician who also worked at Michigan State University, faces up to 125 years in prison. And whatever sentence he receives won't even begin until he completes a 60-year sentence handed down last month in a federal child porn case.\n\nI was part of the IndyStar investigative team, along with Mark Alesia and Marisa Kwiatkowski, that first exposed Nassar's crimes in a story published Sept. 13, 2016. To the best of my knowledge, I was the first — and still the only — journalist to interview Nassar about the sexual abuse allegations.\n\nNassar came to our attention about a month before the interview. It was Aug. 4, 2016. That was the same day we published a story revealing USA Gymnastics officials kept sexual abuse complaint files on scores of coaches, but failed to report many of those allegations to law enforcement. It was part of an internal executive policy.\n\nAmong the many gymnasts who contacted us in the days after that story ran were three who wanted to share stories about a treatment they received from Nassar as minors struggling with sports injuries. Looking back now, the young women told us, they were convinced they had been sexually assaulted.\n\nHearing their remarkably similar accounts, we set out to see if there was something to the story. My job was to learn about Nassar's alleged use of an invasive, intravaginal procedure, then try to arrange an interview with the gymnastics and sports medicine icon.\n\nMore:Former USA Gymnastics doctor accused of abuse\n\nMore:Larry Nassar's downfall started with an email to IndyStar\n\nMore:A 20-year toll: 368 gymnasts allege sexual exploitation\n\nAfter talking to medical experts and spending hours reading medical literature on the Internet, I reached out to Nassar on Sept. 6, 2016. I started by calling the Michigan State University clinic where Nassar worked. A receptionist said he wasn't there and didn't know when he would return.\n\nMy next option was to send emails to Nassar at both his MSU and personal accounts. I didn't expect a response. So when I checked my email the next morning, I was surprised to see two messages from Nassar in my inbox.\n\nI am very sorry for what has occurred with this misunderstanding of my medical care. It saddens me greatly to think that these gymnasts feel I offended them when I was trying to help them, the first said.\n\nI think it would be best for us to meet and discuss this so you have a good understanding of these procedures. I would like to meet at my house next week, Thursday morning at 9:30 am if that works for you. I would like the meeting to be private between you and I to openly discuss this.\n\nThe second email from Nassar was sent about an hour after the first.\n\nMy wife told me this morning that I should talk to my lawyer first about our meeting and meet with the lawyer instead of at our house. That may be best. OK? Larry.\n\nI quickly wrote back to Nassar. I offered to meet him that night or the next day. I also sent Nassar my cell phone number. Later that afternoon, Nassar's then-attorney, Matthew Borgula, called me. He wanted to know more about the allegations and discuss the possibility of an interview. I asked for a few minutes to gather the team and our editors in a conference room, then called Borgula back.\n\nBy then, Borgula told us, he and Nassar were aware that one of the women who contacted us also had filed a complaint with MSU police.\n\nHe may be willing to talk to you, Borgula said. There is a serious risk of destroying this man's reputation just based on the mere allegations of some sort of sexual assault.\n\nAnguish, courage:Here are some of the most empowering moments from Larry Nassar's victim testimony\n\nBorgula, who had been hired to look into allegations surrounding Nassar's departure from USA Gymnastics and communicate the doctor's position, declined to comment Monday citing attorney-client privilege.\n\nIt's not clear what the attorney knew at that time, but his willingness to make Nassar available for an interview suggests he didn't know the full story.\n\nBut in that call, Borgula issued the first of what would be several denials on behalf of Nassar. He said that the doctor said he never used any procedure involving vaginal penetration. I told him that claim was contrary to what the three women alleged.\n\nHe adamantly denies any wrongdoing. He adamantly denied any intravaginal examinations and he's never had any type of an exam or procedure done on a minor without the mother present, Borgula said.\n\nMonths later Nassar would plead guilty to penetrating underage athletes. And testimony last week revealed he often treated girls alone in hotel rooms and training rooms.\n\nBut that wasn't the story Nassar was telling in 2016. He's a well-respected doctor, Borgula said. He's had thousands of patients. He's been honored in various different capacities and he feels like he's being thrown in with other investigations that have nothing to do with him. So I appreciate you giving him the opportunity to respond.\n\nThe conversation ended with an invitation to meet with Nassar and Burgola at the attorney's office in Grand Rapids. I again suggested the next day, which was a Thursday, but Borgula said he was tied up the rest of week. He said we could meet the following Monday.\n\nI want him to have a chance to respond before you put his name in that paper, Borgula said, because he's adamant he's done nothing wrong and he thinks this is going to destroy his career.\n\nThat Monday, I left home at 6 a.m. for the drive to Grand Rapids to meet Nassar and his attorney at Borgula's office. My colleagues were busy working other angles.\n\nThe Nassar I encountered wasn't the broken man the world saw last week, head down in a courtroom listening to dozens of victims describe how his abuse ripped apart their innocent, young lives. He was not the same man who wrote the judge a six-page letter complaining about the emotional distress he experienced listening to the survivors.\n\nI saw the confident Larry Nassar, buoyed by a reputation as a caring miracle-worker. I saw the charismatic doctor, a man with a legion of adoring supporters. I saw the smooth Nassar, a master manipulater who had convinced police and university officials that earlier complaints were misunderstandings — and went on molesting young girls.\n\nAt times in the about 30 minutes we were together, he came off almost arrogant. That was particularly true as he tried to convince me the misunderstanding was the result of the women's ignorance of his sophisticated medical work. His demeanor didn't come as a surprise. Nassar was revered in gymnastics and highly regarded internationally as a sports medicine physician.\n\nBut at other times, I picked up a different vibe. When we first met, Nassar essentially pleaded that we not write a story. He even indicated he could provide dirt on USA Gymnastics officials. As we talked, particularly when he wasn't directing the conversation, Nassar came off as much more socially awkward. Faced with a question, he would stammer. His eyes fluttered. They're the kind of nonverbal cues I look for during contentious interviews.\n\nStill, I chalked up his odd countenance to the difficult circumstances. I was nervous, too. There I was telling a physician with an unblemished reputation that we were about to publish a story making serious, criminal allegations.\n\nAt that time, I didn't have the benefit of the knowledge the following 16 months would provide. Today, aware that Nassar knew he had committed the crimes we were about to expose — and that he had previously faced and quietly eluded similar allegations — his behavior makes more sense.\n\nFormer USA Gymnastics doctor accused of abuse\n\nWhen we met in a conference room in Borgula's office, Nassar had a stack of medical books, magazines and a laptop. Before agreeing to answer questions on the record, Nassar asked to show me a video. He said it was one of many he had made for training purposes. He said he hoped it would help me better understand the medical procedure the three women had misconstrued as a sexual assault.\n\nThe video focused on the backside of what appeared to be a young girl. She was lying down, wearing underwear. Nassar worked his hand between her legs, massaging the girl's buttocks and inner thighs. His hands slowly worked deeper into her crotch, but I never saw any penetration.\n\nNassar appeared at ease as he started to explain what he was doing. But the presentation was interrupted when my phone pinged with a text message that would end up derailing the interview.\n\nMy colleagues' text confirmed a lawsuit had been filed against Nassar in California. The way I saw it, I had an ethical duty to tell the doctor and Borgula. With this new development, I asked, did they want to continue with the interview?\n\nBorgula asked for a copy of the lawsuit. I forwarded him a copy one of my colleagues had sent to me. Nassar and his attorney then left the interview room to review the new allegations from a former Olympian.\n\nI waited alone for about 15 minutes before they returned. Although the victim was identified only as Jane Doe, the background in the court record about her Olympic involvement was enough for them to know who she was. Nassar said he couldn't believe the woman would make such allegations. He said he had a plaque in his office that she sent him as a thank-you gift after the 2000 Olympics.\n\nSupport investigative journalism:The 6 benefits of an IndyStar digital subscription\n\nIn light of the lawsuit, Borgula cut off the interview. Nassar would not be allowed to talk, but the attorney said he would make a statement addressing the allegations.\n\nHe denies all the allegations. He's never heard these allegations before. No one from law enforcement, any other regulatory body, USA Gymnastics, any individuals, parents — no one has ever suggested Dr. Nassar has done anything in any context with either this gymnast or any other that he's aware of. This is the first time anyone's ever made such an allegation related to USA Gymnastics, Borgula said.\n\nAgain, this would be proven wrong. Others had complained.\n\nBorgula and Nassar parted ways not long after our interview. The split came after federal authorities served a search warrant at the embattled doctor's home and found 37,000 images of child pornography.\n\nAs I gathered my notebook and recorder, it was clear the lawsuit rattled Nassar. His eyes were watery, and he was trembling as I shook his hand and said goodbye. My last memory of the encounter was Nassar pleading for me to be fair and to consider the harm a story could do to his reputation and family.\n\nAfter I left, I drove to a parking lot of a nearby office building and called back to Indianapolis to share the little my interview had yielded.\n\nOur story was published on the Internet that afternoon and in the Indianapolis Star the following morning. We were immediately bombarded with phone calls and emails from Nassar's supporters. They vociferously defended him, while questioning our motives, ethics and truthfulness.\n\nHere's one of many examples: ... I am 150% sure that he is innocent, and I do not appreciate the one-sided reporting on this issue. Please, I urge you to look beyond making money by writing scandalous stories and consider the huge, unfair negative affect this is having on an innocent man's life. These false allegations bring me and my family so much sorrow. Please listen and also report on the many, many people who are coming to this man's defense. By focusing on these false allegations, you are doing good to no one.\n\nSince then, more than 150 women have come forward to say Nassar sexually abused them. Many of those survivors are sharing their stories in the courtroom where Nassar will learn his fate later this week.\n\nAnd I'll be watching.\n\nTim Evans is an investigative reporter at IndyStar.

Ryan T. Anderson and Robert P. George\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nA decade ago, President Barack Obama affirmed that marriage unites a man and woman. So did 45 states and the federal government. The only states to redefine marriage had done so through activist court rulings or, in 2009, legislative action. At the ballot box, citizens had uniformly voted against redefinition. A majority agreed with Obama.\n\nThen, in 2012, Obama evolved, and the Supreme Court took cases involving marriage law. Nothing in the Constitution answered the actual question at hand: What is marriage? The court should have left the issue to the people. But in 2013, it struck down the federal definition of marriage as a male-female union in a 5-4 ruling.\n\nThe court also punted on a challenge to a state definition of marriage adopted in a 2008 constitutional referendum by which a majority of Californians — yes, Californians — overturned an activist court. Only in 2015 did the Supreme Court, breaking 5-4 again, redefine marriage for the nation, provoking four irrefutable dissents.\n\nSame-sex marriage advocates told the public that they sought only the freedom to marry. Same-sex couples were already free to live as they chose, but legal recognition was about the definition of marriage for all of society. It was about affirmation — by the government and everyone else.\n\nIt's unsurprising that once a campaign that used to cry live and let live prevailed, it began working to shut down Catholic adoption agencies and harass evangelical bakers and florists. This shows it was never really about live and let live — that was a merely tactical stance.\n\nFamily, marriage — redefined\n\nWhile these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. Law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. The law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. This undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each.\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board:Baker's case is not about the First Amendment\n\nJack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop:Here's why I can't custom-design cakes for same-sex weddings\n\nIt also undercuts any reasonable justification for marital norms. After all, if marriage is about romantic connection, why require monogamy? There's nothing magical about the number two, as defenders of polyamory point out. If marriage isn't a conjugal union uniting a man and a woman as one flesh, why should it involve or imply sexual exclusivity? If it isn't a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence?\n\nMarriage redefiners could not answer these questions when challenged to show that the elimination of sexual complementarity did not undermine other marital norms. Today, they increasingly admit that they have no stake in upholding norms of monogamy, exclusivity and permanence.\n\nSame-sex marriage didn't create these problems. Many in America had unwisely already gone along with the erosion of marital norms in the wake of the sexual revolution — with the rise of cohabitation, nonmarital childbearing, no-fault divorce and the hookup culture. It was no surprise that many would then question the relevance of the male-female norm. Legal redefinition is a consequence of the cultural breakdown of marriage.\n\nMonogamy is old news\n\nBut same-sex marriage is a catalyst for further erosion. Already, we see respectable opinion-makers mainstreaming throuples, ethical nonmonogamy and open relationships. This was predictable; we and others predicted it.\n\nSomething we didn't predict are the headlines about transgender and nonbinary identities. A decade ago, few Americans had given much thought to the T in LGBT. Today, transgender identity seems to dominate the discussion of sexuality and sexual morality.\n\nA sex change couldn't solve the underlying issues:I was a transgender woman for 8 years — time I can't get back\n\nLiving your truth is hard — but right:High school could have been hell for my transgender son. Don't make it hell for the next kid.\n\nThere's a logic here. If we can't see the point of our sexual embodiment where it matters most — in marriage — we'll question whether it matters at all. Hence the push to see gender as fluid and existing along a spectrum of nonbinary options.\n\nThere's a deeper logic, too. Implicit in the push for same-sex marriage was body-self dualism — the idea that we're actually nonphysical entities inhabiting physical bodies, or ghosts in machines. That's why the plumbing in sexual acts seemed not to matter.\n\nTrue one-flesh union, the foundation of conjugal marriage, was thought illusory. What mattered was emotional union and partners' use of their bodies to induce desirable sensations and feelings. Of course, two men or two women (or throuples or even larger sexual ensembles) could do that. But the logic didn't stay with marriage. If the body is mere plumbing, then sex matters less than identity.\n\nThis has had tragic consequences, especially for children.\n\nChildren burdened by our mistakes\n\nNearly unthinkable a decade ago, certain medical professionals tell children experiencing gender dysphoria that they are trapped in the wrong body, even that their bodies are merely like Pop-Tarts foil packets, as one expert explained.\n\nSome doctors now prescribe puberty-blocking drugs to otherwise healthy children struggling to accept their bodies. They prescribe cross-sex hormones for young teens to transform their bodies to align with their gender identities.\n\nAs part of a government grant-supported study, doctors even performed double mastectomies on adolescent girls — including two 13-year-olds.\n\nDiscrimination isn't dead:Trump's anti-transgender memo would hurt teens like me. I'm hoping my state protects me.\n\nA national policy epidemic:My daughter thinks she's transgender. Her public school undermined my efforts to help her.\n\nThese changes weren't grassroots movements. They've come from people wielding political, economic and cultural power to advance sexual-liberationist ideology. The change has been top down — from Hollywood's portrayal of LGBT characters to business executives boycotting states over religious-freedom laws. Having lost at the ballot box over and over — even in California — activists found new avenues: ideologically friendly courts, federal agencies, big corporations.\n\nHaving secured a judicial redefinition of marriage, they pivoted to the T, with the Obama administration redefining sex to mean gender identity and imposing a new policy on all schools.\n\nAnd having won government support, activists turned to eliminating private dissent. Former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke wants to yank the tax-exemption of noncompliant churches. Megadonor Tim Gill vows to spend his fortunes to punish the wicked. Who are the wicked? Those who refuse to accept the new sexual orthodoxy.\n\nAll of us, including those identifying as LGBT, are made in God's image, are endowed with profound dignity and thus deserve respect. It's because of this dignity and out of such respect that the institutions serving the human good — like the marriage-based family — should be supported, not undermined or redefined. That basic rights like religious freedom ought to be upheld, not infringed. That a healthy moral and physical ecology — especially for children — must be preserved.\n\nThe progress of the past decade has exacted steep costs.\n\nRyan T. Anderson is the William E.

AP\n\nHONOLULU (AP) — Until this year, the Sony Open did not hold many fond memories for Brandt Snedeker.\n\nHe made his PGA Tour debut as a rookie in 2007 and missed the cut by seven shots. He returned the following year, shot 68-72 at Waialae to make the cut, walked into the scoring trailer and was told he would not have a tee time the next day.\n\nI remember making the cut and the guy in the scoring trailer said, 'There's a new rule — MDF.' And I said, 'What's MDF? What the hell are they talking about, MDF?' I finally made the cut and they're telling me I can't play, Snedeker said.\n\nMDF stands for Made the cut, did not finish. It became the most loathsome acronym in golf.\n\nAnd it all started eight years ago in the Sony Open.\n\nThat's when the PGA Tour took its first step toward trying to reduce the size of the field on the weekend. A dozen times the previous year, after the cut was made to the top 70 and ties, the field was so large that the final round had to be played in threesomes off both tees, taking at least 5 1/2 hours.\n\nIt was no good for television. It was no fun for anyone.\n\nNot that the original alternative was much better.\n\nThe tour decided that if more than 78 players made the cut, the closest number to 60 advanced to the weekend. Everyone else received last-place money and credit for making the cut, even though they didn't play. So in 2008 at the Sony Open, there were 68 players at 1-under 139 and 86 players at even-par 140.\n\nThe 18 players at 140 were sent home. That included Snedeker, who was only nine shots out of the lead.\n\nPut that into context this year. Matt Kuchar made the cut on the number Friday and was nine shots out of the lead. Under the original policy to limit the size of weekend fields, he would have been on his way to the next tournament. On Saturday, he shot 62 and went into the final round tied for sixth. Even if he doesn't win, there are FedEx Cup points, ranking points and Ryder Cup points to be earned.\n\nBut eight years ago in Hawaii, the new MDF policy was all the rage — or all the outrage.\n\nIt's a stupid rule, said John Daly, another victim that year.\n\nDaly told of meeting a family from Australia who wanted to come watch him play and planned to be there on Saturday and now they're not going to get to see me play. Then again, any fan of Daly should know not to wait until Saturday to watch him. Sometimes it's best not to wait until Friday.\n\nTwo weeks later, 19 other players had MDF next to their names at Torrey Pines.\n\nSnedeker was so mad at the Sony Open that he called PGA Tour headquarters demanding an explanation. Stephen Ames was curious what would happen if Tiger Woods were even in that position and the tour explained to sponsors why it was sending home golf's biggest attraction (Woods had his only MDF six years later).\n\nThe mandatory players meeting was held that week in San Diego, and while the new anti-doping policy was tops on the agenda, there was greater passion over whether someone who finished two rounds in the top 70 could get a tee time Saturday.\n\nThe tour changed it a month later to the policy that remains today. If more than 78 players make the 36-hole cut, there is a 54-hole cut for top 70 and ties.\n\nEveryone talks about how rigid the tour is, Snedeker said. But there are certain things where they say, 'OK, we may have screwed this up. Let's reevaluate.' They worked it out, and I think it's a great policy now. I think that speaks to their willingness to get it right.\n\nLast season, there were seven tournaments where the MDF came into play. This season, the Sony Open was the third time it was used in six events with a cut.\n\nIt seems to be working. No one likes it. But hardly anyone is complaining.
The ripple effect of Donald Trump's executive order on immigration is being felt in the high school basketball ranks.\n\nProlific Prep (Napa, Calif.) boys basketball team has pulled out of an international game in March amid fears that one of its foreign-born stars may not be able to re-enter the country, according to the Napa Valley Register.\n\nWhile the game against Athlete's Institute (Mono, Ontario, Canada) was set to be played on March 18 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Prolific Prep co-founder and director of operations Philippe Doherty told the Napa Valley Register Tuesday that the team is trying to move the game to either Portland, Ore., or Napa.\n\nAbu Kigab, a 6-foot-7 small forward for Prolific Prep, was born in Sudan, one of seven countries subject to Trump's temporary travel ban on the entry of non-US citizens into the country. Kigab holds dual Canadian and Sudanese citizenship.\n\nRELATED: Trump's immigration policy and elite 7-1 basketball recruit Chol Marial\n\nProlific Prep officials told the Register they worry Kigab could be stopped at the border when he tries to return from Canada.\n\nToo many things at stake, Doherty told the Register. With all of this uncertainty, I just don't want to put any of my kids at risk. We don't want to put Abu in a position where we go play one game, in Vancouver, Canada, even though he's Canadian, and then for some unforeseen reason, he's not allowed back in the country since he was born in the Sudan. If Abu is not allowed back in the country, and he can't graduate high school, that affects his college eligibility. And if that's because of this government's policies with this new (presidential) regime of the United States, I just don't want to take any chances, especially with Abu.\n\nKigab is a senior and attends Justin-Siena High School as all the Prolific Prep players do.\n\nAn Oregon commit, Kigab is a two-year starter for Prolific Prep. The three-star recruit at small forward is rated as the No. 13 player in California, according to the 247Sports Composite. He is from St. Catharines, Ontario, and played for Canada in the FIBA Americas U18 Championship last summer.\n\nHe's really talented, Doherty told the Register. Abu is a major player and a good kid.
WASHINGTON—Chief Justice John Roberts lamented a decline in civic awareness in the country and urged the federal judiciary to help fill the void at a time when social media has hastened the spread of false information.\n\nWe have come to take democracy for granted, and civic education has fallen by the wayside, Roberts said in an annual year-end report on the federal judiciary. In our age, when social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale, the public's need to understand our government, and the protections it provides, is ever more vital.\n\nThe chief justice's message comes as he is set to preside at the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. While Roberts did not refer to the pending case against the president, he reminded his colleagues of their collective role in maintaining public trust in government.\n\nI ask my judicial colleagues to continue their efforts to promote public confidence in the judiciary, both through their rulings and through civic outreach Roberts wrote. We should reflect on our duty to judge without fear or favor, deciding each matter with humility, integrity, and dispatch. As the New Year begins, and we turn to the tasks before us, we should each resolve to do our best to maintain the public's trust that we are faithfully discharging our solemn obligation to equal justice under law.\n\nTrump himself has been among the federal judiciary's harshest critics when rulings have gone against him. He has often vented those frustrations on social media in the wake of adverse decisions in cases ranging from his personal business interests to immigration policy during the course of his presidency.\n\nWe should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability, Roberts wrote. But we should also remember that justice is not inevitable.\n\nAt the same time, the chief justice said that federal judges are positioned to play a crucial role in advancing civic engagement in the country.\n\nJudges from coast to coast have made their courthouses available as forums for civic education, Roberts said, at one point making an indirect reference to the efforts of Merrick Garland, the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nGarland Nomination: 'Greatest honor of my life'\n\nTrump nominee gets seated:Neil Gorsuch confirmed for Supreme Court\n\nNominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama following the 2016 death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Garland was blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate. The seat was ultimately filled by Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch.\n\nReferring to Garland, Roberts said that the chief judge of the District of Columbia Circuit has, over the past two decades, quietly volunteered as a tutor at a local elementary school, inspiring his court colleagues to join in the effort.\n\nI am confident that many other federal judges, without fanfare or acclaim, are playing similar selfless roles throughout the country, he said.
Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nCORAL GABLES, Fla. - OK, the first year with his new gig was easy enough for Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, surprising himself with the painless transition, but Year 2 is lurking just around the corner.\n\nAnd, oh, how it could be a doozy.\n\nThere's a new collective bargaining agreement that needs to be ironed out by Dec. 1, and with more money generated in the game than ever before, the negotiations with the powerful players union threatens to be challenging.\n\nThere has never been a greater disparity in revenue among clubs, with the Los Angeles Dodgers tipping the scales with their $298 million payroll last year, while 26 other clubs had payrolls less than half the size.\n\nLucrative national and regional TV contracts - forces that made baseball a more than $9 billion industry - could be further threatened by cord-cutting consumers, even as most folks in Los Angeles enter their third consecutive season without their beloved Dodgers beamed into their living rooms.\n\nThere are rumblings from general managers about the need to have the DH in both leagues, which Manfred still opposes.\n\nMLB commissioner Rob Manfred not yet sold on DH rule in NL\n\nThere's determining the appropriate punishment on the computer hacking case involving the St. Louis Cardinals, whose former scouting director pleaded guilty to five federal counts.\n\nAnd with the world watching how he'll handle it, Manfred soon will become the first baseball commissioner to invoke punishments with their new domestic violence policy. He has three cases sitting on his desk that he wants to formally address before opening day.\n\nHold onto your scorecards - this could be a landmark year in the sport.\n\nPerhaps nothing will be more important to the sport's image than Manfred's rulings on the domestic violence cases involving Jose Reyes of the Colorado Rockies, Aroldis Chapman of the New York Yankees and Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nIt's important because it's an important societal issue,'' said Manfred, who took over for Bud Selig on Jan. 25, 2015, and approved a domestic violence policy in September. Baseball has tried to be thoughtful and a leader in the space. Like every institution, we're not perfect. We're not always right. But we really would like to send the right message in terms of what we do here.\n\nWhen you have a new policy, the first ones take on a special significance in terms of tone and precedent and all those things. So I'm going to make sure to know everything I can possibly know about each of these cases before I make any decisions.\n\nThe punishment rulings, particularly in the cases involving Chapman and Puig, who, unlike Reyes, aren't facing criminal charges, should be in during spring training.\n\nI would love to have these resolved before we begin play again,'' Manfred said. The one thing I've learned about these cases is timing is not mine. You have to really rely on the criminal process playing out in order to put yourself in a position that you're comfortable what the facts actually are before you impose discipline.\n\nSo I'd love to get it done on that timetable, (but it's) not completely within my control.\n\nNo charges filed against Aroldis Chapman\n\nIt's no different, Manfred said, in the Cardinals' computer hacking investigation. Major League Baseball is waiting for the government's investigation to be completed before any discipline is levied.\n\nThe government is uniquely positioned to know exactly what happened there,'' Manfred said. If I conduct my own investigation, the idea that I would be able to uncover the sort of information they can without the benefit of subpoenas and warrants, is just not realistic.\n\nI'm hopeful that, as that process moves along, that the U.S. attorney will share as much information as he can with us, and I'll try to make the best decision possible.\n\nMLB also plans to adjust postseason roster rules involving injured players. They eventually want to end the disparity between clubs with expanded September rosters, requiring each team to have the same number of eligible players.\n\nNow, if he can only end the fight between cable companies and regional sports networks, hoping that Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully doesn't end his career without being heard in most of the Los Angeles market. There's a fear more teams could find themselves in the same predicament as multi-billion dollar contracts kick in.\n\nLook, the media landscape is really challenging for us,'' Manfred said. We have advantages in terms of national broadcast agreements, long-term RSN (regional sports network) deals that are out there, but that's a temporal advantage.\n\nIt's possible that some of the ways we currently get games to our fans are not going to be available to us. It requires us to be really thoughtful of where the industry needs to be in response to some of the changes that may be coming.''\n\nMeanwhile, when Manfred celebrates his one-year anniversary as commissioner on Monday, he can only pray that Year 2 will even be better.\n\nHonestly, I thought Year 1 was better than I could have hoped for,'' he said. I think I was lucky on some issues in terms of a great competitive year, and a really great World Series.\n\nBut I really believe I have the greatest job in the world.''\n\nManfred says that now, but as they love to say in baseball, just wait 'til next year.
Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican whose seat was considered vulnerable in the midterm elections, announced Wednesday that he will retire from Congress at the end of this year.\n\nIssa, a member of the House since 2001, called his time in office the privilege of a lifetime.\n\nWhile my service to California's 49th district will be coming to an end, I will continue advocating on behalf of the causes that are most important to me, advancing on behalf of the causes that are most important to me, advancing public policy where I believe I can make a true and lasting difference, and continuing the fight to make our incredible nation an even better place to call home, he said in a statement.\n\nIssa was a national figure and a staple on cable talk shows when he chaired the House Oversight House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from from 2011 to 2015. He was a relentless critic of the Obama administration and led the investigation of the 2012 terror attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi until GOP leaders decided to create a special committee to handle that probe.\n\nGenerally described as the richest member of Congress, Issa bankrolled the successful 2003 effort to recall California governor Gray Davis, leading to the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nIssa joins the wave of GOP lawmakers who have announced that they won't run for re-election this year.\n\nMore:Here are the members of Congress retiring at the end of 2018\n\nIssa was narrowly re-elected to his seat in 2016, when he won with 50.3% of the votes. The district — a part of Southern California that swung in favor of Hillary Clinton in 2016 — has since been listed as a top target by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nSo far, four Democrats have announced their intention to run for the seat: Doug Applegate, Sara Jacobs, Paul Kerr and Mike Levin. Applegate was Issa's 2016 opponent.
WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned encrypted messaging app, announced Friday it is delaying its new privacy policy by three months, citing confusion and a lot of misinformation.\n\nThe update, which was scheduled to go into effect on Feb. 8, aims to refresh the app's terms of use and privacy policy – expanding how the app's business users can store their communications.\n\nIt includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, the company said in a blog post.\n\nWhatsApp – and others like Signal and Telegram – offers what is called end-to-end encryption, meaning all messages (photos, videos, etc.) sent and received through the app are accessible only through the phones on the sending and receiving end (or other authorized devices, like browsers and desktops).\n\nNews of the update was originally met with skepticism among users over privacy concerns.\n\nHow about Gab? What is Gab, the social network gaining popularity among conservatives?\n\nParler goes dark:Amazon suspends the social platform from its web hosting services\n\nBut this isn't something new. Back in 2016, two years after WhatsApp was acquired, the company launched a major update to its policy where it started sharing user information and metadata with Facebook, as reported by Wired.\n\nA growing discomfort at the level of personal information being mined combined with more aggressive moderation by social media tech giants recently have prompted more Americans to look into encrypted messaging.\n\nParler going dark also may be a factor in the growth of the apps. And a prompt by Elon Musk to use Signal doesn't hurt either.\n\nSignal's creator Moxie Marlinspike said in a 2015 interview: Privacy is at an all-time low, and surveillance is at an all-time high.\n\nHere's how Signal and Telegram compare on privacy:\n\nSignal\n\nThe Signal app is a free messaging and voice call app that supports end-to-end encryption for all features – meaning no one can access your information other than the intended recipient.\n\nI use WhatsApp for work, but was on it first with my kids for when they were out of the country. Two were on deployment, one kept using WhatsApp but the other who was on a special ops deployment (so we) had to switch to Signal due to security protocols, said Twitter user @simpse01.\n\nWith Signal, you register with your phone number, and after that the app knows little to nothing about your account because even to discover and send you information the app sends a different set of numbers to act as a contact.\n\nInformation is neither transmitted nor stored on Signal's servers. Your message history is stored on your own devices, the app's privacy policy reads.\n\nSignal tweeted Sunday that it was continuing to shatter traffic records and add capacity as more and more people come to terms with how much they dislike Facebook's new terms.\n\nTelegram\n\nWe don't use your data to show you ads, Telegram's privacy policy states. One of its big attractions is the fact that users do not have to link it to a phone number (after registration). The app instead uses a username to add contacts.\n\nWe neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don't have, the policy says about its end-to-end encryption.\n\nThe app does collect basic device data and IP addresses for moderation. And if you want to use a two-factor authentication system using email, the company will see that, too. But for those looking for an alternative to a Facebook-owned platform that might not be a deal breaker.
Jessica Masulli Reyes\n\nThe (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Children and teens appear every day in Delaware courtrooms with ankles locked together by metal leg irons.\n\nTheir crimes range from drug possession and theft to gun charges and rape. All are in state custody because they cannot afford to post bail. All are presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThey are shackled and brought into court like a slave more or less, said Democratic state Rep. James Johnson. That is something that will stick with with you the rest of your life.\n\nDefense attorneys and child advocates say this daily scene in Family Court is grisly — youths are restrained and left traumatized by a criminal justice system that is supposed to rehabilitate, not punish, them. That is why there is an effort to end the shackling of youths during proceedings at the the state's three courthouses.\n\nAdult defendants in Delaware are not usually shackled during trials so as not to influence juries. Typically, adult defendants wear leg irons only during other court proceedings.\n\nSupreme Court reluctant to rule on juvenile murderers' life sentences\n\nFor juveniles, handcuffs and belly chains are removed once they get to the courtroom, but leg irons remain during all proceedings. Nearly half of all states have ended this practice in the United States.\n\nJohnson introduced a bill in the state House of Representatives in June to limit the use of shackles except in rare circumstances where the court can show that restraints are necessary to prevent flight or physical harm to the child or others. The bill is on hold in the House Judiciary Committee and could get support if the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families doesn't change its policy on shackling juveniles on its own.\n\nThe department's division that handles youth detention and transport to court is looking forward to young people attending court free of shackles, a spokeswoman said, but is concerned about the layout of the Family Court facilities in Dover and Georgetown. The 3-decade-old courts are in desperate need of upgrades and pose security concerns, court officials have said.\n\nIn November, Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo E. Strine Jr. stressed to lawmakers the need for funds to upgrade these buildings.\n\nOne judge in Dover was spat on by an inmate when they were forced to share the same elevator in the back of the courthouse, according to an attorney. And because the facilities are small, those seeking protective orders bump into people they are accusing and lawyers have little space to discuss cases with their clients.\n\nWe will need to work with our system partners — Family Court, the Attorney General's Office and the Public Defender's Office — to ensure that any changes that are implemented can be done in a way that can provide for the safety of the youth and others in the courthouse provided the challenges of the physical plant in some of the court facilities, department spokeswoman Dawn Thompson said in a statement.\n\nDelaware Chief Public Defender Brendan O'Neill said the matter is pressing and can't wait for those changes.\n\nThe practice of routinely shackling kids coming into court without an affirmative finding that they pose a genuine security risk is just flat out wrong, he said. We are trying to change it.\n\nFEELING LIKE A 'CAGED ANIMAL'\n\nIn January 2014, the National Juvenile Defender Center, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., launched a nationwide campaign to end indiscriminate juvenile shackling. The campaign comes amid a flurry of criminal justice reform efforts, including pushes to end the money bail system and a proposal to scale back mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nPeople are realizing that the things we have done in the past have not worked and should be changed, Johnson said. This is one of the changes that should be made.\n\nTwenty-three states have banned the practice of juvenile shackling either by legislation or court order. About half of those have done so since 2014.\n\nMost recently, in September, the Maryland Court of Appeals and the state Judicial Council adopted an anti-shackling policy that leaves the decision to shackle a youth up to a judge if there are safety concerns.\n\nMaryland Public Defender Paul B. DeWolfe, a strong supporter of the change, wrote in an editorial in the Baltimore Sun last year that during the media storm surrounding the death of Freddie Gray, one instance of juvenile shackling stood out to him. A teen was arrested by Baltimore police during protests and told an NBC reporter that being shackled felt like a caged animal.\n\nIt's tragic, DeWolfe told The News Journal. It's tragic to see a 12- or 13-year-old coming into a courtroom ... in chains. It's completely unnecessary and goes against the whole principle of juvenile court.\n\nWHAT DOES DELAWARE DO?\n\nJuveniles who are detained in Delaware are transported by the Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services to the state's three courthouses in Kent, Sussex and New Castle counties.\n\nWhen they arrive, handcuffs and belly chains are removed, but leg irons remain during court proceedings. On a case-by-case basis, judges can consider if an individual poses a safety risk and should have the additional restraints left on.\n\nEven with the restraints on, youth can still pose a risk, some say. For example, a 17-year-old defendant kicked out the window in a van that was taking him in shackles from a family court proceeding in September.\n\nHe jumped out of the moving vehicle in Wilmington and was on the run from authorities for about a month.\n\nAdvocates say these types of scenarios are rare — and need to be weighed against the more widespread harm that shackles can inflict on children.\n\nTHE DEVELOPING BRAIN\n\nAttempts by The News Journal to speak with youth who have been detained and their families were unsuccessful.\n\nKaren DeRasmo, executive director of Prevent Child Abuse Delaware, said the experience of being shackled can impact a child's brain at a time when it is still developing.\n\nWhat we always have to imagine and appreciate is that kids' brains are in the process of developing, she said. They tend to think much more concretely about things. They don't have some of the higher level of thought processes that adults have.\n\nFor that reason, shackling could be traumatizing to a young person, especially because those who are entering the juvenile justice system are probably already experiencing a higher level of toxic stress in life, she said.\n\nIt could actually affect the way their brain is developing and how they are going to view the world going forward, she said.\n\nGilbert said eliminating juvenile shackling can also change the courtroom environment from one of an authoritative, penal system to one of openness and fairness.\n\nWe know that the idea of procedural justice is so important to youth, she said. The juvenile court is designed to be different from the adult court system. It is supposed to be rehabilitative, not punishing.
Corrections & Clarifications: This story has been updated to clarify the nature of the call Brandon Griesemer admitted making to an Ann Arbor mosque.\n\nNOVI, Mich. — Residents of Chestnut Tree Way were surprised to learn Tuesday that a neighbor had been accused in federal court of making violent threats toward the news network CNN.\n\nWhen you hear something like this, it knocks my socks off, said Bill Nelson at a house across the street from where Brandon Griesemer lives with his parents.\n\nGriesemer, 19, faces a charge of using interstate communications to threaten injury, conviction of which could mean a prison sentence of up to five years. A complaint by Sean Callaghan, an FBI special agent, alleges the Atlanta-based network received 22 calls from Griesemer on Jan. 9 and Jan. 10; the specifics of in four of those calls, some of which included racial slurs, references to fake news and threats to shoot staffers, were detailed in the complaint.\n\nNelson, who said he uses a cane, has known Griesemer for years and described him as a nice guy who, with friends, would carry equipment or furniture for him if they saw him struggling with it. They're always helpful, he said.\n\nMore:Man threatens to gun down CNN staff for 'fake news,' FBI says\n\nMore:Sen. Jeff Flake: Trump 'charting a very dangerous path' with media attacks\n\nThe teen and his mother would also fetch groceries for him from the Busch's supermarket where Griesemer works, Nelson said. Just normal people is how Nelson described the family.\n\nWould never have believed it, he said of the accusation of threats.\n\nGriesemer, a 2017 Novi High School graduate, was arrested Friday and charged in U.S. District Court. He was freed on an unsecured $10,000 bond, meaning he will owe the government that amount, plus face an additional charge, if he fails to follow the terms of his release.\n\nA preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 9 at the federal courthouse in Detroit.\n\nNo one answered the door at the Griesemer house on Tuesday afternoon, but a man behind the closed front door said, We have no comment when asked about Griesemer. Later, people were seen coming and going from the house.\n\nGriesemer's attorney, Tenny R. Beardslee of the federal public defender's office, did not return a call.\n\nNelson said he and Griesemer often greeted each other in passing:  'How's it goin'? What's new?' You know? Chit-chat, he said.\n\nLike Nelson, four other neighbors said Tuesday that they were hearing about the charge against Griesemer for the first time. One refused to comment, two others would not give their names and a fourth said she did not know the family.\n\nAn employee at the Busch's on 10 Mile, where Griesemer works, referred questions to the company's corporate office, where a message was left late Tuesday afternoon. An employee outside on a smoke break said he knew of the situation but could not comment because of company policy.\n\nNelson said that as a young boy, Griesemer would stop by and tell him about superheroes.\n\nHe kept me up to date on all the superheroes and how good they were, Nelson said.\n\nIn federal court on Friday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Anthony P. Patti highlighted several of Griesemer's bond conditions, which include that he not have contact with CNN, not possess weapons or drugs and not travel outside the court's jurisdiction of the U.S. Eastern District of Michigan.\n\nPatti sternly told Griesemer not to make any sorts of threats. Griesemer was accused of calling an Ann Arbor mosque in September and making derogatory statements about the mosque and Muslims, and the FBI's complaint says Griesemer admitted to police that he made that call. He was not charged in that case.\n\nGriesemer was accused of making a threatening call to an Ann Arbor mosque in September, and the FBI's complaint says Griesemer admitted to police that he made that call.

Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIran has met all the requirements under its nuclear deal with world powers to gain relief from international sanctions beginning as early as this week. Yet that long-awaited moment may prove to be a bit of a political and economic letdown for the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe price of oil has dropped so much since the nuclear negotiations began several years ago that estimated annual revenues from exports by the oil-rich country will be less than half original expectations. And it is still unclear what the U.S. Treasury will allow foreign banks and businesses to do in their dealings with Iran without running afoul of U.S. sanctions that will remain on the books.\n\nOne certainty: an estimated $56 billion to $100 billion cash infusion from frozen assets that comes with sanctions relief. It may be used to purchase military equipment and benefit companies controlled by Iran's conservative Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, not middle-class Iranians who the White House had hoped would feel empowered by the deal to push Iran to become a more cooperative member of the world community.\n\nThe drop of oil prices from $100 a barrel to $30 a barrel overwhelms any benefits from the deal, said Patrick Clawson, director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nIran is expected to increase its oil output by $6 billion a year at current prices, far less than hoped for, Clawson said.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, who pushed for the nuclear deal and is considered a moderate force in Iran, hoped sanctions relief coupled with increased oil exports would help his followers win parliamentary elections next month, said Ali Alfoneh, an expert on the Iranian leadership at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank.\n\nBut with no immediate impact on Iran's economy likely as a result of the accord reached last summer, he has difficulties telling the Iranian public he solved Iranian issues by getting the nuclear deal with the United States, Alfoneh said.\n\nIran announced Monday that it had removed the core of its Arak nuclear reactor and filled it with concrete, as required under the agreement. If true, that would be the last of several steps Iran had to complete, including the dismantling of machines that process nuclear fuel and shipment of uranium stockpiles, to gain relief from United Nations and European Union sanctions.\n\nThat will happen when Yukia Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, signs off on Iran's progress, probably this week.\n\nOn Wednesday Iranian officials issued mixed messages on the progress at Arak reactor.\n\nIran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the work would be done by Saturday and predicted Amano's report would come soon after, according to Iran's Tasnim News Agency. Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said that only the initial steps had been taken for removing the core of the Arak Reactor and filling it with concrete. The measures have not been finalized but they may be in next few days, and implementation day will likely happen next week, the Iranian Students' News Agency reported.\n\nU.N.: Iran conducted nuclear weapons research as recently as 2009\n\nForeign businesses stream into Iran as sanctions may end\n\nMost U.S. sanctions will remain until Iran takes additional steps to implement the deal, so international investors, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies and foreign banks are waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department on what they will be allowed to do in Iran without breaking U.S. law, Clawson said.\n\nIn the nuclear agreement, the U.S. committed itself to lift a very small portion of sanctions and then issued grand statements about facilitating trade, he said. The greatest risk (for businesses) is a serious misconnect between what the U.S. government plans to do and what people around the world think the U.S. government plans to do.\n\nComplicating matters is an ongoing debate between Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress and the White House over whether recent ballistic missile tests by Iran constitute a violation that warrants new sanctions.\n\nU.S. says Iran tested rockets 1,500 yards from American carrier\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters Monday he is urging President Obama to press ahead with new sanctions. I am concerned with the hesitation to move forward with the ballistic missile-related designations, Coons said. I'm going to continue to raise this issue, to push and to insist on rigorous enforcement this year.\n\nObama said Monday he would veto any new sanctions imposed by Congress.\n\nClawson said the impasse risks sending a message to Iran that it could do anything it wants without repercussions.\n\nLifting holds on the billions of dollars of Iranian cash frozen in foreign banks is likely to boost sectors of Iran's economy that are most worrisome to the United States and its allies, Alfoneh said.\n\nMuch of that money is likely to be used on large infrastructure projects that will put thousands of Iranians to work, he said. But there's a catch: The Revolutionary Guards control at least a third of Iran's economy, including construction and engineering firms that would handle large infrastructure projects, he said. According to the U.S. State Department, the Guards conduct Iran's overseas military operations, including support for terrorist groups.\n\nThe private sector is so small they can't take upon their shoulders the task of employing a lot of people, Alfoneh said. It's going to be the Revolutionary Guards who are going to hire people and whose people will benefit, not the Iranian middle class who Rouhani wants to empower.
LG, the South Korean electronics giant, is planning to charge more for its products in the wake of President Trump's decision to allow hefty taxes on washing machines bought from overseas.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, LG executive Thomas Yoon said in a memo to its customers that as a result of the trade situation, we will be initiating pricing actions, which will be sent under separate cover shortly.\n\nLG did not respond to queries.\n\nMore:Trump tariffs on solar panels, washing machines could raise prices\n\nMore:Macron drops climate change joke about Trump at Davos\n\nIndustry representatives had predicted that washing machine prices, as well as those for solar panels, would likely increase as a result of the steep new taxes recommended by the U.S. Trade Representative and green lighted by Trump.\n\nLarge imported washing machines and parts will be subject to tariffs of up to 50%, while solar panels will have taxes as high as 30%. While largely aimed at South Korea and China, the new duties will apply with a few exceptions, worldwide.\n\nThe tariffs come in the wake of Whirlpool complaining that Korean manufacturers were flooding the U.S. market with steeply discounted washing machines from 2012 to 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, solar makers Suniva and SolarWorld accused China of giving unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers during that same time period. China manufactures 71% of the world's solar modules.\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission sided with those companies, stating that the imports were causing serious injury to U.S. manufacturers based on a 1974 trade law.\n\nThe duty on washing machines will gradually reduce and then expire after three years, while the tax on solar cells and modules phases out after four years.\n\nThough solar and appliance industry representatives say that the taxes will ultimately hurt consumers, some U.S. trade groups say that the policy change will lead to more jobs.
Confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine is growing, a USA TODAY analysis of dozens of polls and scientific papers shows.\n\nSurveys in recent weeks show close to 60% of respondents saying they'd get the COVID-19 vaccine, up from a low of 1 in 2 Americans polled in September.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey of 12,648 Americans in late November showed 60% said they'd get the vaccine if it were available today, up from 51% polled in September. The Kaiser Family Foundation noted a similar increase, with 71% of the 1,676 surveyed indicating they'd accept a COVID-19 vaccine, up from 63% in September.\n\nUSA TODAY's analysis drew on methods used by Duke University and Florida State University researchers and by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to summarize vaccine polling.\n\nIt's unknown what percentage of the population needs to get the vaccine in order to wipe out COVID-19. But the increased willingness to receive the vaccine marks a notable reversal of previous trends and comes at a crucial time in the pandemic that's claimed more than 350,000 lives in the United States alone. The country is now being battered by a third wave of surging infections while the administration of vaccines has gone slower than planned in recent weeks.\n\nDistrust of the COVID-19 vaccine has been visible in pockets across the country, from nursing home workers in Ohio to Indigenous communities in Montana to college students in Texas.\n\nFrom March through late fall, trust in the COVID-19 vaccine declined steadily, according to dozens of surveys of Americans asked whether they'd get the vaccine when it became available.\n\nA running Morning Consult poll of 2,200 adults found 72% of those surveyed in April would accept the COVID-19 vaccine. As of Oct. 10, that number dropped to about 48% willing to get vaccinated. A CNN/SSRS poll found a similar trend – of the approximately 1,200 people polled, 66% said in May that they'd get the vaccine; by October, just 51% indicated they'd get it.\n\nA review published last week in the journal Vaccines looked at 126 scientific studies and surveys of popular opinion towards the COVID-19 vaccine and found a decreasing trend in vaccine acceptance since March. The researchers found that overall confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine fell, on average, from more than 70% of people polled in March indicating they'd get a vaccine to just 50% in October.\n\nCheryl Lin, an author of the review and co-director of the Policy and Organizational Management Program program at Duke University, said the decline in vaccine acceptance as the coronavirus spread was almost counterintuitive.\n\nWillingness to get vaccinated did not increase with growing case numbers or death total, said Lin. When people first realized the seriousness of the outbreak and personally experienced the pandemic, acceptance was high. Then, six months later, vaccine acceptance dropped to below 50%.\n\nMany of the surveys Lin studied highlighted communities that are especially distrustful of the COVID-19 vaccine. Polls from Pew Research Center, Gallup and Economist/YouGov have shown Republicans as less accepting of the vaccine than Democrats. And surveys published in the journals Annals of Internal Medicine and Vaccine have found that Black respondents were less likely to say they'd get the vaccine.\n\nUnfortunately, health disparities are likely to persist if we don't make a strong effort to target those groups with customized communication campaigns and more accessible vaccine delivery, said Lin. There's an urgent need for a national campaign, in addition to political figures or celebrities getting the shot in front of the cameras, and really targeting specific groups.
WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court was deep into oral argument back in 2014 about a Florida fisherman's federal conviction for destroying evidence – in his case, 72 undersized grouper.\n\nWhat kind of a mad prosecutor would try to send this guy up for 20 years? Associate Justice Antonin Scalia railed.\n\nYou make him sound like a mob boss or something, Chief Justice John Roberts chastised the Justice Department's lawyer.\n\nThe case – which went well for the fisherman, if not the fish – was one of many recent examples in which the high court has admonished prosecutors for stretching laws to win convictions. Others rescued by the justices ranged from a jilted wife charged with assault under an international chemical weapons treaty to a legal immigrant deported for hiding four prescription tablets in a sock.\n\nSince you're reading this story, you might also like to hear about tonight's Democratic presidential debate. Click 'play' above to listen.\n\nOn Tuesday, the high court will shed some light on whether its forgiveness extends to shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge – the busiest bridge in the world – for political retribution.\n\nThe case pits two mid-level public officials with ties to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie against federal prosecutors who charged them with fraud and won 18-month prison sentences for a political prank that ran amok.\n\nUpset by a Democratic mayor's refusal to endorse Republican Christie's re-election in 2013, the two associates created gridlock for several days in Fort Lee, N.J. As it turned out, they also helped turn a popular governor with presidential ambitions into a joke on late-night television, helping to tank his political future.\n\nThe scandal, now going on seven years, became known as Bridgegate. The Supreme Court's willingness to hear it following two lower court convictions is a positive sign for Christie aides Bridget Kelly and William Baroni, though it's too soon to tell if they'll get off the hook like the Florida fish captain.\n\nWhat's clearer is the court's impatience with federal and state prosecutors, even in cases of political corruption.\n\nFour years ago, the court vacated the conviction of former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell, who had been sentenced to two years in prison for accepting luxury gifts and loans from a wealthy businessman in exchange for official acts. The justices ruled unanimously that those acts were commonplace actions taken on behalf of constituents.\n\nThe ruling made it harder for prosecutors to use federal fraud statutes against public officials by characterizing what the justices called common favors as crimes. That could work against the Trump administration in the New Jersey case.\n\nA good number of the recent cases are examples of where prosecutors stretched the law, says Ellen Podgor, a white-collar crime research professor at Stetson University College of Law.\n\nSiding with defendants\n\nThe Supreme Court began pushing back against public corruption prosecutions in 1987, reversing the conviction of Kentucky officials who had skimmed money paid by the state to insurance companies. The court reasoned that fraud statutes do not guarantee officials will perform their duties honestly. A generation later, it added that honest services fraud must include bribery or kickbacks.\n\nMore recently, the justices have sided frequently with small-time criminal defendants swept up by large-scale prosecutions:\n\nIn 2014, the court ruled unanimously that the federal government had no business using an international chemical weapons treaty to prosecute a jilted wife who committed a two-bit local assault against her husband's lover.\n\nIn 2015, it chastised federal prosecutors for deporting a Tunisian man on drug paraphernalia charges based on four Adderall tablets hidden in a sock.\n\nIn 2017, the justices ruled unanimously that a Serbian immigrant's lie about her husband's military record was not reason to strip away her citizenship.\n\nLast year, the court again ruled unanimously that states, along with the federal government, cannot impose excessive fines as criminal penalties – such as the seizure of a small-time drug dealer's $42,000 Land Rover.\n\nThe protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government's punitive or criminal law-enforcement authority, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote.\n\n'Honest government'\n\nPerhaps sensing a sympathetic audience, lawyers for Kelly have raised another recent Supreme Court decision: last year's ruling against the Trump administration's effort to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census.\n\nNoting that Chief Justice John Roberts said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' reason for adding the question seems to have been contrived, Kelly's lawyers said Ross could have been imprisoned for fraud under the reasoning used to convict their client.\n\nThat astoundingly expansive theory of criminal fraud cannot be correct, they wrote. It would undo, in one fell swoop, three decades of this court's precedents rejecting attempts to enforce 'honest government' through vague federal criminal statutes.\n\nBut there's another side to the Bridgegate saga. The Justice Department says Kelly and Baroni didn't just conceal political motives. Rather, it says they blatently made up a non-existent traffic study and used Port Authority of New York and New Jersey resources to manufacture what Kelly warned would be some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\n\nUnlike some of the small fish the Supreme Court saved from overzealous prosecutors, such as Florida fish captain John Yates, public officials are in positions of power, says Jennifer Ahearn, policy director at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an anti-corruption group.\n\nThis is really how our system works, Ahearn says. We give discretion to prosecutors in the federal criminal justice system writ large. You don't have courts stepping in and saying, 'This person isn't worthy of being prosecuted.'
Kurt Bardella\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Monday that he will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.\n\nKeep in mind that just a few hours earlier, Trump declared on Twitter: The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party. It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!\n\nOn the same day that he continued his never-ending attack on the free press, President Trump is asking the media to give him prime-time air to address the nation.\n\nThey shouldn't.\n\nIt is a disservice to the American people to broadcast, without context or real-time fact-checking, someone who is using the airwaves for the sole purpose of lying to the American people about an overtly racist agenda.\n\nIn 710 days, Trump has made 7,645 false or misleading claims. He is a proven, pathological liar. He lies about things large and small. He lies when he doesn't even need to. He even lies when there is indisputable evidence proving he is wrong.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nRomney: Trump is wrong to vilify the press. It's not the enemy, it's critical to democracy.\n\nIn a scary week of pipe bombs, will President Trump finally recognize that words matter?\n\nTrump's hatred of the press, lies and bullying echoes dangerous regimes of the past\n\nABC, CBS, NBC and Fox were still deciding Monday night whether they would air Trump's address. Cable news stations CNN, Fox News and Fox Business have confirmed that they will air the speech live, while MSNBC is considering the request.\n\nFor any network considering airing Trump's address live, executives should consider his bizarre statements during his 90-minute Cabinet meeting last week. He claimed to have fired former Defense Secretary James Mattis, when in reality, Mattis resigned. He laughably declared that he would've been a good general when he used five deferments to avoid fighting in Vietnam. He said he could be the most popular person in Europe while also saying, I don't care about Europe. He mocked the building of a library in Afghanistan and oddly claimed that Jeff Flake is now selling real estate, or whatever.\n\nThen there was Trump's brief publicity stunt Thursday in the White House briefing room, where he refused to take any questions from reporters.\n\nGiving Donald Trump air time without context or conditions is downright irresponsible. Yes, the public at large has a right to hear from the president, but the media have a responsibility to provide their audience with context and facts.\n\nHere are several options for how the news networks could approach Trump's Tuesday night remarks:\n\n►Air the president's address on a 15-to-30 minute delay so they can fact-check his statements and air those fact-checks as the remarks are broadcast.\n\n►Refuse to air the speech in its entirety and only air truly newsworthy sound bites about substance and public policy.\n\n►Get an advance copy of the speech and clear it for accuracy before agreeing to air it.\n\n►Give a Democrat, such as Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, equal time to rebut the president.\n\nThe reality is no matter what news networks do, Donald Trump will not relent on his crusade to brand the media fake news and the enemy of the people. Knowing that, the news media should err on the side of the public good and the public interest. They should calibrate their programming decisions around the most effective way to communicate truth, fact and context to their audiences.\n\nMake no mistake about it, if the media decide to air the president's remarks unchallenged and unfiltered, they are complicit in spreading propaganda and disinformation to the American people.\n\nKurt Bardella is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and served as the spokesperson and senior adviser for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from 2009-13.

AP\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Mavericks point guard Dennis Smith Jr. had a simple strategy in the fourth quarter when it came to Harrison Barnes.\n\nGive him the ball and get out of the way, Smith said.\n\nBarnes had 13 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, Yogi Ferrell made seven 3-pointers and scored 22 points and the Mavericks fended off fatigue to beat a fresh Charlotte Hornets team 115-111 on Wednesday night. Barnes made all five of his shots in the fourth quarter and added 11 rebounds for the Mavericks, who won on back-to-back nights.\n\nBarnes said he liked his matchup against Frank Kaminsky in the fourth quarter.\n\nI just tried to be aggressive and attack the rim, Barnes said. I saw a few shots drop and I was kind of in a rhythm after that. Coach kept going to me and just kept on converting.\n\nMavericks coach Rick Carlisle called Barnes' game absolutely brilliant.\n\nHe hit on a variety of shots — 2s, 3s, drives, Carlisle said. Look that's what great players do. Really proud of him. He had a pretty good rhythm going all night. We just needed to get the ball in his hands.\n\nDirk Nowitzki added 19 points — one shy of his season high — and Smith had 15 points and six assists.\n\nIt was a crushing loss for the Hornets, who were coming off a 3-1 West Coast road trip that included a win over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nKemba Walker had 41 points on 16-of-28 shooting for the Hornets. Dwight Howard had 15 points and 12 rebounds for Charlotte, but was an anemic 5 of 18 from the foul line, which proved costly in a close game.\n\nThe Mavericks were playing their third game in four days, while the Hornets were coming off a four-day layoff. But Dallas showed no signs of wearing down in the fourth quarter, repeatedly thwarting Charlotte's attempts to take the lead.\n\nCharlotte trailed by six entering the fourth quarter, but Jeremy Lamb buried a 3-pointer from the right wing to pull the Hornets even with 9 minutes left.\n\nBut the Hornets could never grab the lead.\n\nThe big play came with 2 minutes remaining when Salah Mejri ripped an offensive rebound away from Howard and kicked the ball out to Ferrell, who buried a 3-pointer from the top of the key to give the Mavericks a 5-point lead.\n\nBarnes followed with a long 3 on the next possession.\n\nI told him, if you aren't getting the ball enough, let me know, Smith said. I will do whatever it takes to get it to you, especially if you are in a groove like that. That's what he does, he closes.\n\nTIP INS:\n\nMavericks: The team was awarded two-way forward Jalen Jones on a waiver claim. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. In a related move, the Mavericks also requested waivers on two-way guard Kyle Collinsworth.\n\nHornets: Hornets associate head coach Stephen Silas said backup center Cody Zeller is not very close to returning to action following his left knee injury. He just started doing some spot shooting, but he's not very close, Silas said.\n\nDIRK DOES IT AGAIN: Yes, it's painful to watch him run up and down the court, but Nowitzki still finds a way to be productive in his 20th season. He repeatedly hit big shots — both 3s and fadeaways — at clutch times.\n\nDirk's really one of the most amazing athletes I've ever seen or been around, Carlisle said. To perform like this at the advanced age of 39 in the NBA is just unbelievable.\n\nHORNETS 'DIRE' WITHOUT WALKER: The Hornets (15-24) are struggling, but Silas said things would be pretty dire to imagine the team without Walker, who is second in scoring among point guards in the Eastern Conference.\n\nHe does everything, Silas said. He comes up with big steals. He goes for charges. He makes every big pick and roll play, every shot, every play for everybody else.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nMavericks: Host Lakers on Saturday.\n\nHornets: Host Jazz on Friday.
President-elect Joe Biden introduced an additional four members of his economic team Friday, as the government announced the economy lost 140,000 jobs in December, by saying the need for relief is urgent and job creation is crucial.\n\nBiden chose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo to serve as his secretary of the Commerce Department and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to become secretary of the Labor Department. Biden also picked Isabel Guzman to head the Small Business Administration and Don Graves as deputy secretary of Commerce.\n\nBiden said he would unveil his legislative package Thursday for the COVID-19 recovery. He said he is focused on curbing the virus, distributing the vaccines and rebuilding the economy.\n\nWe're going to direct relief to those businesses that have been so badly hit, hit the hardest, Biden said from The Queen theater in Wilmington, Delaware. We owe them that support, to help them get through to the other side of this crisis.\n\nAfter introducing Judge Merrick Garland as his choice for attorney general on Thursday, Biden has now picked nominees to lead all federal departments. Biden hasn't named someone to lead the CIA, but Biden said he has completed his 24-member Cabinet.\n\nBiden has asked the Senate to move quickly on confirmations after his inauguration Jan. 20 and hearings for some have been scheduled. He said the secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury and Homeland Security must be confirmed quickly.\n\nGiven what our country has through for the last four years, the last few days, given the threats and risks in this world, they should be confirmed as close to Jan. 20 as possible, Biden said. We have no time to lose with regard to the entire team.\n\nBiden's announcement came as the Labor Department announced Friday that employers cut 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline in payrolls since April. The economy has about 10 million fewer jobs than before the COVID-19 pandemic began a year ago, leaving President Donald Trump as the first chief executive since former President Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression 90 years ago to lose jobs during his term.\n\nThe bottom line is that the jobs report shows we need to provide for immediate relief for working families and businesses now, not just to get to the other side of this painful crisis, but a larger purpose, to avoid a broader economic cost that exists out there, due to long-term unemployment, homeless and business failings, Biden said.\n\nRaimondo, Rhode Island's first female governor, helped the state recover from the worst unemployment rate of any state in the nation. She launched workforce training programs like what Biden has advocated. And she expanded clean energy jobs, another Biden priority.\n\nIf confirmed, Walsh would be the first union member to serve as Labor secretary in nearly half a century. As mayor, he fought for a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave, two Biden goals. And as chairman of a group of 470 climate mayors, Walsh promoted job creation by investing in clean energy.\n\nBiden said he considered former campaign rival Sen. Bernie Sanders for the post, but didn't want to risk Democratic control of the Senate to have him. Runoffs pending certification in Georgia resulted in a Senate evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, which will allow Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to break ties in Biden's favor.\n\nI'm confident he could have done a fantastic job, Biden said of Sanders. I can think of no more passionate, devoted ally to work with people in this country.\n\nBut Biden said he and Sanders agreed that it wasn't worth putting control of the Senate at risk with a special election. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, represents Vermont, which has a Republican governor to appoint his successor.\n\nWe agreed we'll work closely on our shared agenda of increasing worker power and protecting the dignity of work for all working people, Biden said of Sanders.\n\nGuzman is director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she works with entrepreneurs to help them weather the pandemic. The former entrepreneur has been a former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff at the agency.\n\nWhen Detroit faced bankruptcy, Graves coordinated the federal response for the Obama administration by working with city, state, business and community leaders. He is the Treasury Department's former deputy assistant secretary for small business, community development and housing policy.
The federal government shutdown could wreak havoc on U.S. agriculture and the rural economy as farmers wait on subsidy payments, loans and data they need now to make plans for the spring.\n\nFarmers say the timing could hardly be worse as they've already been hit with fallen commodity prices and the loss of foreign markets in President Donald Trump's trade wars.\n\nAs a result of the shutdown, applications are now on hold for a $12 billion emergency aid package Trump and the Department of Agriculture announced for farmers hurt by retaliatory tariffs from China and other nations. A Jan. 15 deadline for that program may have to be extended.\n\nWith one round of payments processed in November, it's uncertain whether a second round made it through before thousands of USDA employees were furloughed.\n\nFarmers are waiting on that second payment because they need to start buying their seed, fertilizer and chemicals for 2019, said Michael Slattery, a grain farmer and economist for the Wisconsin Farmers Union. The earlier in the year you buy seed, the bigger the discount you get.\n\nUSDA Farm Service Agency offices, which process farm loans and gather data farmers need to make decisions, are closed.\n\nEverything just grinds to a halt, said Mike Ballweg, a University of Wisconsin-Extension agent.\n\nMore:Government shutdown 2019: Homebuyers with USDA mortgages can't close on house sales\n\nMore:IRS to take taxpayer's money in a shutdown but not issue refunds, plan says\n\nMore:Government shutdown: How it could hurt the economy\n\nTough times for farmers\n\nFarmers count on the USDA for a wide range of services, many of which are now suspended during the shutdown that began Dec. 22.\n\nIt's especially troublesome as farmers have been caught in a downward spiral of lost markets, low prices for milk, crops and livestock. Also, the shutdown threatens the implementation of the 2018 farm bill and its program aimed at helping small dairy farms endure one of the worst downturns in the dairy industry in recent memory.\n\nThe rules and policies to put the massive piece of legislation in place are largely written by USDA employees at many levels.\n\nAnd that's a mad scramble. They really work hard to get all that in place as quickly as possible, said Mark Stephenson, director of dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nThe shutdown is coming at a bad time, for sure, Stephenson said.\n\nUSDA isn't writing the checks or doing the things to get payments out to dairy farmers, corn and soybean growers. So that's a problem, he added.\n\nWhen farmers are hurting, it's felt throughout the rural economy.\n\nEach dollar of net farm income results in an additional 60 cents of economic activity as farmers spend money in their local communities, according to University of Wisconsin research.\n\nThat translates to millions of dollars in urban centers as well since most of the items farmers buy come from other places.\n\nAnd to some degree, farmers are gamblers. They borrow money in the spring to plant crops, betting that the fall harvest will cover their loans and generate a profit. They borrow money to raise livestock, hoping the price they receive when the animals are sent to market will be sufficient.\n\nThere are a lot of farmers who count on FSA loans to pay bills. And that works its way through the community, said Jim Goodman, a board member of the Wisconsin-based group Family Farm Defenders who recently retired after 40 years of dairy farming.\n\nDuring the shutdown, the government continues to inspect meat, poultry and eggs. It's also releasing data needed for setting farm milk prices.\n\nCertain USDA activities will continue if they are related to law enforcement, the protection of life and property or are financed through available funding.\n\nBut a lot of farm data, necessary in forecasting global agricultural trends, isn't getting processed and that could undermine commodities markets.\n\nWe have not seen export sales figures since the shutdown began. And it's at a time when China supposedly has been making some new soybean purchases from the U.S., said Todd Hultman, a markets analyst with DTN/The Progressive Farmer.\n\nIt's unfortunate that we're not able to get confirmation in the markets. I think traders would have a little more confidence if they could see, in black and white, the reports from USDA about what sales are being made, he said.\n\nIf the shutdown doesn't end this week, Hultman said it's likely the USDA will have to delay a major report, scheduled for Jan. 11, expected to contain data which influences global markets.\n\nWe are just a little bit in the dark at this time, he said.\n\nAs traders, investors and farmers look ahead in 2019, many of their concerns remain the same as they were in 2018, said Alex Breitinger with Breitinger & Sons, a commodities futures brokerage firm.\n\nTrade disputes with China, Mexico, and Canada still hang over all markets, especially major U.S. exports like grains, livestock and machinery. The United States seems to have won some battles in the ongoing trade wars, but the long-term damage suffered by both sides may exceed any gains notched so far, Breitinger wrote in a recent column.
A lawyer for O.J. Simpson has threatened a lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel-casino in Las Vegas that would seek at least $100 million in damages over alleged malice and racial prejudice related to Simpson's banishment from the property in November.\n\nMalcolm LaVergne told USA TODAY Sports that he will press forward with litigation if the casino doesn't make public that Simpson did nothing untoward when he was asked to leave the casino.\n\nMr. Simpson has had 100% perfect behavior since he's been on parole, LaVergne said. He was having dinner with a friend from out of town and everything was going great. The next thing you know, when he was leaving, they told him, 'Don't come back.'\n\nRepresentatives from The Cosmopolitan have declined to provide specifics on what — if anything — took place, and a spokesperson described initial reports by other outlets as inaccurate when contacted in November. Reached Friday night, The Cosmopolitan said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports that it was company policy to not comment on potential litigation.\n\nAt least part of TMZ's original report was erroneous. The first version of the story — which claimed Simpson had become drunk and disruptive — also alleged that a dispatcher referred to Simpson by name. A spokesperson for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told USA TODAY Sports that the department was not contacted about Simpson and a search of radio traffic from that Nov. 8 night included no mention of Simpson.\n\nLaVergne said in the letter obtained by USA TODAY Sports that Simpson received a trespass notice from The Cosmopolitan.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan Casino discriminately singled out Mr. Simpson amongst his non-African American friends and subsequently expelled him for what turned out to be a fake reason while he peacefully visited the Cosmopolitan property, LaVergne wrote.\n\nLaVergne said as result of the night, Simpson was contacted by his parole officers and underwent drug and alcohol tests, both of which were negative. LaVergne said while The Cosmopolitan is within its rights to ban an individual, he added that the casino has fostered the perception that the Pro Football Hall of Fame running back and Heisman Trophy winner was intoxicated and unruly.\n\nWe are asking, in newspaper terms, for a retraction, LaVergne said.\n\nIn the letter, LaVergne asked The Cosmopolitan for copies of any surveillance video from that night, a list of employees who were on duty and a copy of the policy on what leads the casino to ban patron.\n\nSimpson, who was acquitted of double-murder charges in 1995, was paroled from a Nevada prison in October after he served nine years in prison for armed robbery and assault with a weapon conviction, a crime that took place at another Las Vegas hotel in an attempt to regain possession of memorabilia.\n\nContributing: Josh Peter\n\nMORE O.J.

AP\n\nControversial coach Marcelo Bielsa will take charge of ambitious Lille for next season, signaling his return to French football after a chaotic end to his spell with Marseille.\n\nLille said in a statement on Sunday that Bielsa will replace interim coach Franck Passi on July 1 and has been given a two-year deal.\n\nMarcelo Bielsa is without a doubt one of the most respected and influential coaches in the world and it's a huge satisfaction for Lille, said Marc Ingla, a club director. It also proves the ambition of our club.\n\nA former Argentina manager, Bielsa is highly rated as an innovative, attack-minded leader who brings the best out of his players.\n\nWith Lille hiring Bielsa, Lyon already settled into a new stadium, Marseille recruiting aggressively under new American ownership and Monaco challenging Paris Saint-Germain strongly, next season promises to be an even more competitive one in France.\n\nA more entertaining one, too, now that Bielsa is back and likely to give the French media plenty of headlines.\n\nBielsa stunned fans and the club's directors when he quit Marseille last season, after just one game of the new campaign. The 61-year-old Argentine was taking charge of his second season and was a fan favorite when he suddenly quit.\n\nHe was out of contract but had struck a verbal agreement with the president to extend his tenure.\n\nThen, just before putting pen to paper on his new deal, he changed his mind, alleging that Marseille officials amended the terms of the agreement at the last minute. He had previously publicly criticized Marseille's president in a vitriolic outburst during a news conference because he was angry at the club's transfer policy, saying it had signed players over his head.\n\nControversy seems to follow Bielsa, who in football circles earned the nickname El Loco Bielsa (Crazy Bielsa), due to his driven personality, single-mindedness, tough talking and relentless determination to do things only on his terms.\n\nIn the summer of last year, he quit as coach of Italian side Lazio — just two days after the Italian club announced it had signed him.\n\nIn football terms, Bielsa made much of his reputation more than a decade ago.\n\nAt club level, he won three Argentinian titles with Newell's Old Boys and Velez Sarsfield — reaching the South American Copa Libertadores final with Newell's in 2002. Later on, he also guided Athletic Bilbao to the Europa League and Spanish Cup finals in 2012.\n\nWith Argentina, he won gold at the 2004 Olympic Games and led Argentina to the Copa America final the same year.\n\nLille's new owner Gerard Lopez, the president of the finance group Genii Capital and former president of the Lotus Formula One team, previously spoke about Bielsa in glowing terms.\n\nLopez recently took over from Michel Seydoux — a French businessman and film producer who was club president since 2002 — and Lopez is keen on rebuilding Lille with talented young players in the same way Monaco has done.\n\nOn the final day of the transfer window last month, Lille signed six players aged 23 or under. Dutch forward Anwar El Ghazi, who joined from Ajax, scored his first goal for the club on Saturday.\n\nThe club's scouting network is also likely to be very strong in South America, with Bielsa working closely alongside Luis Campos — who is an advisor to Lopez.\n\nCampos previously worked with Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid and then for three years as a technical director with Monaco.\n\nThe well-connected Campos oversaw the arrival of several promising young players at Monaco — including highly rated attacking midfielder Bernardo Silva — and they have blossomed so much that Monaco is top of the league and has scored more than 100 goals overall this season.\n\nLille is playing catch up.\n\nAlthough Lille qualified six times for the Champions League during Seydoux's tenure and clinched the league and cup double in 2011, results have dropped and the northern French club is currently in 14th place.\n\nThe club's youth system — which produced players such as Chelsea star Eden Hazard — has not been so successful in recent years and this will also be an area for Bielsa to improve.
The rules of the retirement game just saw a sizable overhaul in Congress, giving a nod to the reality that many Americans can't afford to quit working.\n\nThe changes aren't massive enough to put to rest concerns about a coming retirement crisis, where some forecast a growing gap between the haves and have-nots. Even so, the adjustments are likely to help some households boost their retirement savings.\n\nThe new law, signed by President Donald Trump in late December, has key twists for those who work at small businesses, those who steadily work part time at a given company and those who are worried about whether they're on a bleak path to outlive the money in their 401(k). Eventually, workers may see their 401(k) plans begin to add options that offer annuities in their 401(k) plans, too.\n\nThe SECURE Act — or the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement — offers small business owners some additional tax incentives for starting a retirement plan and seeks to make it less costly to do so. Financial services firms would be allowed to offer new multiple employer 401(k) plans to unrelated small companies with unrelated businesses.\n\nWorkers who spend a large chunk of their careers at small companies that do not offer pensions or 401(k) plans are particularly vulnerable to an inadequate level of savings to cover the bills in retirement.\n\nHere's a look at some points to know:\n\n1) Turning 70 in 2020? New rules can help delay spending savings.\n\nStart thinking of age 72, instead of 70½, if you want to delay taking money from your IRA or 401(k) for as long as possible.\n\nUnder the new law, savers who are currently in their 50s and 60s wouldn't be required to take a minimum distribution from retirement savings until they hit age 72.\n\nTaking out the correct required minimum distribution, or RMDs for short, is essential each year, especially since the penalty for not doing so is 50% of what you should have taken out that year. The penalty is in addition to the ordinary income tax you pay on the money you withdraw from the retirement accounts. (Tax experts at H&R Block note, though, that it is possible to get a waiver by making the appropriate withdrawal as soon as the mistake is discovered and filing Form 5329 with an explanation of the error. If the IRS considers the error to be reasonable, the penalty will be waived. It may help to talk with a tax professional.)\n\nGiven that many Americans are living longer and working longer, it can make sense for some to try to keep their hands off their retirement savings for as long as possible.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a one-size-fits-all-situation, said Keith Bernhardt, vice president of retirement income for Fidelity Investments.\n\nKeeping the money in a tax-deferred IRA or 401(k) can help the account grow more in the future, too, depending on the success of your investments.\n\nYou're still benefiting from the tax-deferred nature of having money inside the account, Bernhardt said.\n\nThe new threshold applies to people who turn age 70½ in 2020 and later.\n\nThe new 72 is simpler to track than the old age rules. After all, it's a little odd to try to figure out when you turn age 70 and a half.\n\nOne potential point of confusion: If you turned 70½ in 2019 or earlier, you don't get the benefit of the new delay. You're still required to take the RMD for 2019 and in future years.\n\nThe new rules can give you more flexibility for minimizing the tax hit in some years, too. Maybe you'd rather spend money from a regular brokerage account earlier in your retirement years.\n\nSay that investment outside of a retirement account is worth $10,000 but only $2,000 of that money represents actual earnings. Then, you'd only be taxed on the $2,000 not the entire $10,000.\n\nTake $10,000 out of the IRA and you'd be taxed on the full amount if you saved that money on a pretax basis while working.\n\nTake a hard look at your own numbers and talk to a tax professional or financial adviser.\n\nOutliving your money remains a real risk for many. Once people retire, they can run the risk of dipping too heavily into their retirement savings and running short of money as they age.\n\nThough people retire at different ages, Fidelity noted that participants in the 401(k) plans it manages often retire around age 65.\n\nRegardless of age, most make withdrawals in the first year, then the withdrawal rate declines until the required minimum distribution age, according to Fidelity.\n\nOne drawback for withdrawing money from a tax-deferred retirement account is that withdrawals are taxed at your regular income tax rate. You might face a 10% penalty if you withdraw the money before age 59½ as well. If you take out too much money, you're at risk of driving up your annual income tax bill.\n\n2) Retirement savings can help young families, too.\n\nThe act allows parents to withdraw money without penalties — but you would pay income taxes on those withdrawals — from a 401(k) or IRA to cover costs associated with childbirth or adoption. The change applies to distributions in 2020 and afterward.\n\nNew parents would be allowed to withdraw up to $5,000 without the 10% penalty if the money is withdrawn within a year of the birth or adoption. You'd have to check with your plan sponsor to see when this might be allowed within a given plan.\n\n3) Working part time won't hurt your ability to save.\n\nGoing forward, the new law requires companies that offer 401(k) plans to allow part-time employees who have worked at least 500 hours a year for at least three consecutive years to set aside money from their paychecks into the plan. The employer isn't required to make matching contributions until the worker meets the plan's normal eligibility requirements.\n\nIn the past, someone who was steadily working part time could legally be excluded from saving for retirement in a 401(k) or similar plan if he or she worked less than 1,000 hours a year. So the change is expected to open the doors for many people who work in retail, health care and other part-time heavy fields. The change may be particularly beneficial for women.\n\nHow soon will you be able to save? It might be sometime in 2024 or earlier.\n\nSome plan sponsors could wait until 2024 to make this change relating to part-time workers based on the statute, said Mark Iwry, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Iwry was responsible for national retirement policy and regulation of the private pension system while serving as senior adviser to the U.S. secretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration.\n\nBut, he continues, some plans will voluntarily implement this change earlier by taking into account years worked before 2021. Or, he said, some might conceivably decide for administrative simplicity not to look back for three years and simply allow participation by employees who have at least 500 hours of service in a given year.\n\n4) Time for a wake-up call.\n\nBy December 2021 or after, savers are expected to begin receiving estimates once a year for how much monthly income their current 401(k) savings might generate in retirement.\n\nIwry, who has supported such a disclosure for more than a decade, said the number will be key in helping people understand what kind of regular income their retirement accounts could generate.\n\nPeople don't readily have a way to translate the account balance that they've accumulated to the amount of regular income that it can deliver to them in their retirement years, Iwry said.\n\nThink of something similar to the estimates that you receive for Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nOnce you have a clearer picture, you may decide to work longer, save more, or maybe even realize that you're well on track when it comes to saving for retirement.\n\nRight now, many people are in the dark when it comes to their retirement savings, according to Joshua Gotbaum, a guest scholar for economic studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nMany people haven't saved enough before they retire, but they don't know it, he said. Or others who have retired don't know how long their savings will last and they could be afraid to spend even when they have enough financial resources to do so.\n\nThis lifetime income benchmarking will help both, Gotbaum said.\n\nConsider this example: A woman with $50,000 in her 401(k) at age 65 could get an annuity paying just under $3,000 per year — or $250 a month — for life.\n\nIt's a number that might motivate you to bump up your regular savings rate.\n\nIn 2020, individuals can save up to $19,500 in their 401(k) plans — or $500 more than last year. If you're 50 or older, you can save even more than that through what's called catch-up contributions, which max out at $6,500 in 2020. In all, someone 50 and older could save up to $26,000 in 2020.\n\nThe annual contribution limit for Individual Retirement Accounts for 2020 is $6,000 or $7,000 for those 50 and older.\n\n5) Want to work and save more into your 70s?\n\nIf you're working, the new law removes the age cap for setting aside savings into a traditional Individual Retirement Account. Beginning in 2020, the age cap — formerly age 70½ — goes away for individuals who have wage income.\n\nYou're allowed to set aside money in a traditional IRA as long as you have income from work. Another plus: If a couple could contribute to a spousal IRA before age 70½, the new rules allow them to do so now even if the person is older than 70½.\n\nBut remember, the change is only effective starting with tax year 2020 contributions made for the year 2020, so people should understand the 70½ age limit is still in place for traditional IRAs when it comes to contributions made for tax year 2019.\n\nFollow Detroit Free Press personal finance columnist Susan Tompor on Twitter@tompor.
Tamara E. Holmes\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nMore than 40 million Americans had a disability in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. For some, physical and cognitive impairments can hinder their ability to make decisions, live independently and provide for themselves financially. While parents may be accustomed to stepping in, every family should prepare for the day they no longer are around to do so.\n\nThe fear that we have as parents is that our loved one is going to outlive us, says Brian N. Rubin president of the Special Needs Alliance, an organization of attorneys that specialize in disability and public benefits law. 'Special needs' is a term used to describe those who need extra support because of a medical, emotional or learning disability, such as Rubin's 37-year-old son Mitchell, who has autism.\n\nWe don't expect anybody else to do what we do for our child, so while we're still here, we want to try and have some peace of mind that everything will be OK, Rubin says.\n\nHere is how to achieve that goal:\n\nStep 1: Consider the Financial Implications\n\nWhen you plan for people with disabilities, everyone's goal is the same — to provide security for their family member, says John Nadworny, a partner with Special Needs Financial Planning, a specialty practice of Winchester, Mass.-based Shepherd Financial Partners.\n\nGovernment services such as Social Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Medicaid will provide much of that security. Families can also supplement government resources with their own funds or purchase a life insurance policy to provide income for their child after they pass away.\n\nCreating a financial plan also means making sure the parents have enough for retirement, says Michael Berry, head of the Advanced Planning Team for Voya Financial in Des Moines. It's really important to do a complete life plan for not only for the individual (with special needs), but also for the advocate, Berry says.\n\nStep 2: Put Legal Protections in Place\n\nMany government services have income and asset limitations. For example, to qualify for SSI, you must have less than $2,000 in assets. A child who is left an inheritance or designated the beneficiary of a life insurance policy may inadvertently be disqualified from receiving benefits, says Jay Robert, a New York-based attorney with Kassoff, Robert & Lerner, who specializes in special needs planning.\n\nDepending on the state, that could cost the adult child hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, says Benjamin Rubin, an attorney and Mitchell's brother. This is an astronomical sum that most families cannot afford for the rest of that child's lifetime, Benjamin says. The Rubins estimate that Mitchell receives approximately $90,000 per year for such services as his day program, job coaches and housing.\n\nA special needs, or supplemental needs, trust is a legal vehicle that will hold the assets of a person with disabilities without costing them their government benefits. Those trusts will essentially protect any assets held for the benefit of the children, Robert says.\n\nThere are two types of special needs trusts — first-party and third-party trusts. First-party trusts have a payback provision, meaning that when the beneficiary dies, any money left in the trust will first be used to repay the states that paid out benefits on their behalf. With third-party trusts, any money left in the trust could pass back to family members.\n\nAnother financial vehicle is an ABLE Account, a tax-advantaged savings account that lets you save up to $100,000 without losing government benefits. Like first-party trusts, ABLE accounts have a payback provision.\n\nMore:Let go of these items to hang on to more cash\n\nMore:Tax prep: 7 things to ask before hiring a tax professional\n\nMore:Break the taboo of talking money with our partners\n\nStep 3: Gather Your Support Team\n\nIdentify those who will support your loved one after you're gone. For example, a guardian would have the legal ability to make decisions for the adult child if he or she is unable to do so, while a trustee would oversee the special needs trust.\n\nInvolve the person with disabilities in the planning process if possible. A lot of people with mental health concerns absolutely can say who they want and who they don't want involved in their lives, says Cynthia R. Haddad, a partner with Special Needs Financial Planning.\n\nCreate a letter of intent that will let people know what you want to happen once you are gone. This detailed set of instructions should include everything from an overview of the benefits the child receives to who you want — or don't want — playing a role in your child's life.\n\nThe goal in the advocacy community is for every individual with disabilities to live a full life in a community, Benjamin says. With the right financial resources and legal protections in place, an adult with special needs can thrive.\n\nResources:\n\nExperts recommend working with professionals who specialize in special needs planning. Here are some organizations that can help you find the professional help that you need.
AP\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — JuJu Smith-Schuster didn't catch a snap of the 2017 AFC championship game.\n\nLife out in Los Angeles was just a little too hectic as the wide receiver prepared for the NFL draft.\n\nMartavis Bryant skipped out on it too, in part because of the pain of missing out while serving a one-year suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy was a bit too acute.\n\nTyson Alualu and Joe Haden's viewpoints were the same as they've always been during their respective careers: watching the NFL playoffs go on without them.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nA year removed from New England's clinical domination of the Pittsburgh Steelers on their way to the Super Bowl on that snowy night in Foxborough last January, all four find themselves playing vital roles in Pittsburgh's effort to finally unseat Tom Brady and company.\n\nWith their Pro Bowl teammates taking the afternoon off in Sunday's regular-season finale against Cleveland to rest up for the playoffs, all four showcased why they'll be needed over the next month if the Steelers (13-3) want to end New England's long run at the top.\n\nSmith-Schuster piled up 265 all-purpose yards, returned a kickoff for a touchdown and caught Landry Jones' pass for another score in Pittsburgh's 28-24 victory .\n\nBryant tied a season high with six receptions to cap a resurgent stretch in which he caught 29 passes and a pair of touchdowns over the final six weeks.\n\nHaden returned from a fractured fibula that threatened to disrupt his season by providing Pittsburgh's secondary with a steadying presence while Artie Burns struggled in his second season.\n\nHaden embraced change when he signed with the Steelers in August after seven years in Cleveland, and the Steelers repaid his respect by making him the lone game captain on Sunday while facing his former team.\n\nAlualu had the first multiple sack game of his eight-year career against the Browns, including the one that gave the Steelers 56 on the season, a franchise record.\n\nThe giddy celebration after Alualu took down Cleveland's DeShone Kizer early in the fourth quarter provided Alualu with a reminder on why he signed with Pittsburgh after seven seasons in Jacksonville.\n\nJust being around these guys, this atmosphere, I knew I wanted to be around these talks just so that it kind of changes my mentality of where I came from, Alualu said.\n\nI'm not saying I'm used to being a loser or anything like that, but it was definitely different being around this group and I just wanted to feed off of that. Hopefully we can keep going and get that ring.\n\nThat's been the mission since the second the Patriots finished off their 36-17 dissection of the Steelers 49 weeks ago.\n\nPittsburgh limped through that game with a depleted wide receiving group, a secondary that looked overmatched at times and a pass rush that did little to disrupt Brady.\n\nThat won't be the case when the Steelers open the playoffs on Jan. 14. Bryant's return and Smith-Schuster's arrival have given the Steelers a complement to star Antonio Brown they didn't have last season.\n\nWhile Brown is recovering from a left calf injury suffered in a close loss to the Patriots on Dec. 17, he appears to be close to returning. The NFL's leading receiver posted video on Instagram Monday showing him walking briskly on a treadmill.\n\nPittsburgh's best chance at reaching the Super Bowl in Minneapolis next month is with Brown's No. 84 on the field.\n\nYet the past two weeks have shown the Steelers have the versatility to survive and perhaps even thrive even if he's limited.\n\nSmith-Schuster and Bryant were spectacular against New England and kept it going against Houston and Cleveland.\n\nI wish everybody had a JuJu in their life, left tackle Alejandro Villanueva said.\n\nThe 21-year-old Smith-Schuster is the league's youngest player and he's spent most of his rookie season documenting his acclimation to life in the NFL, episodes that include putting together some of the league's most entertaining touchdown celebrations , losing his bicycle, having Villanueva teach him how to drive and adopting a French Bulldog named Boujee.\n\nIt makes for a good time to be sure, but it's Smith-Schuster's precocious talent and not his outsized personality that has given Pittsburgh the biggest boost.\n\nThe contributions of Haden, Bryant and Alualu have been less dramatic but in many ways no less important. The Steelers will need their stars to be stars.\n\nWe expect our guys to win, Heyward said. They're drafted here and they're picked because (general manager) Kevin Colbert and (coach) Mike Tomlin decided they should be here ... Now we have to get back to this tournament we're going to go into.\n\nA tournament in which Pittsburgh's many bold-faced names will need to play up to their pedigree if the Steelers want to win.\n\nYet if they falter, Pittsburgh has the kind of depth it lacked a year ago while eyeing a rematch with the Patriots that only an upset can prevent.\n\nThere's no difference (in expectations) whether the starters are playing or the backups are playing, Villanueva said.\n\nEverybody has a standard they have to meet. It speaks volumes of what Coach Tomlin and the organization have done with everybody on the roster.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
South Korea normally encourages North Koreans to defect, but not at next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, where North Korea will send an historic delegation.\n\nThe reason: Both countries want to avoid a confrontation at such a sensitive time with the whole world watching.\n\nThat would be a diplomatic incident that would work in no one's favor, said Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.\n\nBoth sides want the Olympics to go smoothly. The two countries will march in the opening ceremony behind the same flag, and the women's ice hockey team will be the first with players from both countries. North Korea also will send a 230-member cheering squad and a 30-member taekwondo demonstration team.\n\nMore:IOC says North Korea to have 22 athletes in 5 Olympic sports\n\nIn addition, a 140-member orchestra from the North will be part of the delegation and is expected to perform in the South Korean capital of Seoul, 80 miles west of the Olympic site, and Gangneung, a city hosting some of the events.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said Saturday that North Korea will send 22 athletes to 5 Olympic sports this year.\n\nA defection would be a major embarrassment for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and a major blow to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has made peace overtures to the North a central policy.\n\nMoon has urged North Korea to participate.\n\nNeither side has much to worry about because the danger of anyone defecting from the delegation is low, Town said. The people who are chosen to go are very loyal to the regime. There will be lots of security.\n\nThe North's participation came as a result of a series of historic meetings in a conference room in Panmunjom, a village that straddles the Demilitarized Zone separating the two countries, which have maintained an uneasy truce since the end of a war in 1953.\n\nThe talks led to an agreement by North Korea to send a sizable contingent to the Games.\n\nThe discussions have not resulted in any major diplomatic breakthroughs and are not designed to reach an agreement on North Korea's controversial nuclear and ballistic missile development, which has led to bellicose exchanges between Kim and President Trump.\n\nMore:North and South Korea agree to form first unified Olympic team\n\nMore:Why the overwhelming majority of North Korean defectors are women\n\nBut Moon sees the Games as an opportunity to lessen tensions, which could lead to broader agreements, and has staked much of his political reputation on hopes the North's participation will go off without a hitch.\n\nThe North's delegation will be carefully vetted and consist of regime loyalists, analysts say. Their movements will be highly scripted and they will always be together, providing no opportunities to slip away.\n\nThese are people they trust, said Robert Wampler, an analyst at the National Security Archive.\n\nEven so, the North will add security officials to the delegation whose job it will be to monitor the athletes, who will be aware that their families in North Korea will be at risk if they attempt to flee.\n\nDefections are frequent and have been the source of tensions between the two countries. More than 30,000 North Koreans have made it to South Korea since the end of the Korean War.\n\nFour North Korea soldiers dashed across the border to the South last year, in some cases under fire from North Korean soldiers attempting to stop them.\n\nThe bulk of the defections are people fleeing desperate economic circumstances. It is rarer to have privileged members of the regime flee, though there have been a handful of high-level defections.\n\nHistorically, South Korea has encouraged defections and used them as a propaganda leverage against the much poorer and isolated North. South Korea last year quadrupled the reward it pays defectors who escape with valuable intelligence from $217,000 to $860,000.\n\nNo members of North Korean sports teams have ever defected while traveling abroad. I seriously doubt there is really any risk of defection, Wampler said.
Gabriel Schoenfeld\n\nCloser relations with democratic Taiwan. Unflinching support for Israel. A pledge to restore America's atrophied military power.\n\nDeregulation and tax cuts that have already sent the stock market soaring. A Cabinet with key slots assigned to individuals of impeccable integrity.\n\nThe record of this interregnum is enough to give a determined conservative #NeverTrumper like myself pause. Was I wrong? Did I badly misjudge things? Will America not only avert disaster but enjoy an unexpected renaissance? Is this rough orange beast slouching toward the White House the second coming of Ronald Reagan?\n\nIf so, having denounced Trump in op-ed after tweet after op-ed, I will be personally embarrassed. Worse, I also slammed his supporters for willful blindness at best and moral turpitude at worst, quite a few of them by name. If they turn out to be right, and I have made a monumental misassessment of President-elect Donald Trump, I will be deservedly dining on crow for the rest of my life.\n\nHowever, I have not yet quite reached the point of repentance. Rather, as I look around at the emerging Trump administration, if I am not feeling vindication, I am perceiving something else.\n\nFirst, Trump is in the honeymoon phase that is part of our democratic tradition. He is America's next president, after all, and even his harshest critics want him to succeed, to make the country prosperous and to keep it secure. In some quarters (including my own), expectations have been so low that we are inwardly astonished when he exceeds them.\n\nAre Trump's aides playing him on Taiwan?: Gabriel Schoenfeld\n\nTrump-Putin bromance unnerves the Baltics: David Andelman\n\nTo be sure, exceeding them has not happened with great frequency. But Trump is also benefiting from something else. Reflecting the bitter divisions of the campaign, Trump's transition (as no doubt will be true of the early months of his presidency) is turning out to be one of the nastiest honeymoons in the history of marriage. Yet some of the nastiness directed at the groom is working to his advantage. Trump and his entourage have been subjected to relentless salvos of over-the-top criticism — which are having a boomerang effect, discrediting his detractors and building support for their target. An anti-Trumper abusing Ivanka in front of her children on a JetBlue flight is part of a larger pattern.\n\nAt the same time, the outgoing administration of President Obama is failing so abjectly in core duties that one wonders whether, under incoming President Trump, things could possibly get worse. The fall of Aleppo, Syria, has illuminated a grim and seemingly endless landscape of national security failure. We are witnessing human suffering on a grand scale while simultaneously enduring strategic defeats, with Russia and Iran making headway in the Middle East and a refugee crisis in Europe merging with a terrorism crisis to jeopardize the post-war European liberal order. Obama's foreign policy legacy is so appalling — and Obama and his apologists are so blithe about what they have wrought, while also stopping to shaft Israel at the United Nations on their way out — that it fosters the impression that Trump can only do better.\n\nIt is only human to hope that will be true, and of course, we will have to wait and see. But the reality is, Trump can do worse, much worse.\n\nWe should not succumb to the pitfall of defining Trump's manifest deviancy downward. All the signs of trouble that were present across his career and during the campaign are present today, plus more: the conspiracy theorists whom Trump has selected as his key White House national security advisers; the compulsive tweeting about everything from a dearth of U.S. nuclear weapons to the wounds inflicted by Saturday Night Live to his blossoming love affair with Russian President Vladimir Putin; the impulsive policymaking based upon whatever adviser or business partner or child has most recently entered or left the room; the cyber bullying of critics, the threats against individual companies for daring to contradict him, the self-dealing, the incessant lying about matters trivial and great.\n\nRight-sizing the Trump defense buildup: Michael O'Hanlon\n\nHow to unite in spite of Trump: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAlready, the audience for these eccentricities extends to the heads of state of allies and adversaries. Soon, as Trump gains the power to move aircraft carriers or dispatch the Marines or make nuclear threats, their impact will be magnified by the awesome powers of the U.S. presidency.\n\nBeyond Trump's erratic character, there is the troubling substance of the Trump Doctrine itself, encapsulated in the formula Art of the Deal. If America's relationship with the world is reduced to a balance sheet of profits and losses, as seems to be one of Trump's core ideas, how will a country like Taiwan fare if its security turns out to be a bargaining chip in a negotiation with China over tariffs? How will Israel fare under a president who wants to sort of be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians, who also wants to back Israel to the hilt, while also bringing about the ultimate deal between the parties?\n\nThis is not strategic ambiguity; it is an incoherence replicated in Trump's approach to every trouble spot on the globe. Will this presidency end well? Even as I continue to fear the worst, I sincerely hope, for the good of the country, that I will soon be dining on crow.\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and the author of Necessary Secrets: National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law.

Kate Brannen\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWhen President Donald Trump strode to the podium last week to tell America what would happen next with Iran, he clearly wanted to project his vision of American strength. He stood amid top members of his national security team, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other military officers. All men and all white.\n\nWhile it was a clear display of U.S. military might, as well as Trump signaling that he had the full support of his team (something that can never be taken for granted in this administration), this carefully choreographed moment sent another message: The only people who can handle this national security crisis are white men.\n\nThis message was hammered home again later in the day, when the White House released new photos of Trump huddling with his national security team in the Situation Room, discussing the Iran crisis. Again, everyone pictured was white and male, with the exception of Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. It should be noted that Gina Haspel, Trump's CIA director and the first woman to ever hold that job, reportedly called in to those meetings, and for whatever reason was not part of the group that stood next to the president during his Wednesday speech.\n\nThrowback to white, male America\n\nWhile these tableaus have become standard in the Trump administration, it can still take your breath away to see such a complete lack of diversity presented as the public image of the United States in the year 2020. This is especially true when Trump hosts foreign leaders like the Saudi crown prince or travels to countries where the rights of women and minorities are under assault. Instead of setting an example for the rest of the world, the United States, under Trump, is sanctioning a worldview that excludes women and people of color from positions of power and influence.\n\nMore than taking a stand:Diversity is good for business, not just social justice, and colleges should say so\n\nThe problem with their absence isn't just optics. It means the president and his team are not getting the best national security advice available. In November, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tweeted a photo of himself with a group of think tank experts, after a discussion with them about China and the opportunities/challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. All 12 men pictured were white. Not to knock their expertise, but if you're going to assemble a group to discuss China and the region, maybe include a few experts from the region? Also, some of the top Asia specialists in Washington are women. Excluding them from the conversation is not just Esper's loss but the country's.\n\nAnd having Ivanka Trump at the table doesn't count. Advocating for more diversity in national security decision-making is not about checking a box. The whole point is that there are women and people of color who are just as qualified as the white men who have long monopolized these roles. Allowing your daughter (who has a background in real estate and running a clothing brand) to sit in for you or hobnob with world leaders at the Group of 20 summit should not be considered an example of empowering women in foreign policy.\n\nPersonnel choices will outlast Trump\n\nWith the Trump administration, that's usually the best it can do. We've come to expect this of Trump, given that he and his political allies are associated with white nationalism.\n\nThe U.S. military, however, should do better. There is no good reason why its leaders cannot reflect the racial diversity of their troops, especially at a time when the military is struggling to address problems of white supremacy and far-right extremism in its ranks.\n\nWomen, meanwhile, have long faced barriers to entry for the military's top leadership roles, but the recent acknowledgment of the front-line roles women were already playing, plus the new combat positions opening up for them, is expected to improve their professional advancement.\n\nDefining diversity:Democrats' debate lineup could be all white, but diversity isn't only about race\n\nThere are also outside groups, such as the Leadership Council for Women in National Security, working to improve the situation. The council is asking presidential candidates to commit to diversity when making their senior national security and foreign policy appointments. Seventeen candidates have signed a pledge to do so; the president is not one of them.\n\nIn fact, whether Trump wins or loses reelection, his personnel choices (not to mention his policies) will have lasting impacts on diversity long after he's president. For example, about 70% of Trump's judicial appointees are white men, meaning they will be shaping the federal court system and making decisions that affect all Americans for decades to come.\n\nThe judiciary is hardly unique. According to The Atlantic, the White House has named twice as many men as women to administration positions. This isn't just giving white men an advantage now, but the valuable experience they will gain in their government posts they can use throughout their careers.\n\nIn 2020, it shouldn't be necessary to remind anyone that women and minorities deserve access to these opportunities, too. Clearly, with this administration, it is.\n\nKate Brannen is editorial director of the Just Security blog. Follow her on Twitter: @K8Brannen
Erin Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHere are the key things we learned from Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election.\n\n1. More than one motive\n\nTop intelligence officials reiterated their belief that the Russians hacked Hillary Clinton's campaign and other political party groups in an attempt to influence the presidential election and help President-elect Donald Trump win. However, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said there was actually more than one motive. He said multiple motives will be detailed in a comprehensive report to be made public next week.\n\n2. Trump still won\n\nClapper said the Russian cyber attacks did not change any vote tallies or anything of that sort. However, he added that there is no way to gauge the impact of the hacking and the subsequent leak of information from Clinton's campaign on how Americans voted. He said the report to be released next week will not question the outcome or legitimacy of the election results.\n\n3. No need for name-calling\n\nThe president-elect's dismissive comments about the intelligence community and its assessment that the Russians tried to influence the election were repeatedly brought up by both Democratic and some Republican senators, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Clapper said the comments are not helping the morale of agents at the CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies. He said he encourages elected officials to maintain a healthy skepticism about intelligence reports but added that there is a difference between skepticism and disparagement.\n\n4. Russians did more than hack\n\nClapper said Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential campaign was a multi-faceted campaign that also included the dissemination of fake news and propaganda. The hacking was only one part of it, he said. He added that the fake news and other disinformation efforts are continuing.\n\n5. This is going to take a while\n\nArmed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he will continue to hold a series of hearings in the months ahead to try to develop a policy on how to best deter cyberattacks. McCain said basic questions must still be answered as part of that effort. Among them: what constitutes an act of war or aggression in cyberspace that would merit a military response, either a cyber counterattack or other action; who is accountable for this problem, and do they have sufficient power to deliver results; and does Congress need to change how its committees are organized to help find solutions? McCain has said he plans to create a new cyber subcommittee as part of the Armed Services panel. Republican congressional leaders have so far rejected calls for the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Russian hacks.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Russian hacking saga: How we got here\n\nTrump cites Assange claim about Russia hacking\n\nObama sanctions Russian officials over election hacking\n\nSanctions mark rare window into cyberwar
WASHINGTON – You might assume a government shutdown that is about to set an unwelcome record and is being battled over funding for a border wall most Americans oppose might leave President Donald Trump itching to make a deal.\n\nYou would be wrong.\n\nIn a combative exchange with reporters Thursday as he left the White House for a day trip to Texas, wearing a campaign Make America Great Again hat, Trump denounced as dishonorable the Democratic leaders who would have to negotiate any agreement. He accused his opponents of not caring about violent crime and national security. Although he said the word compromise, he gave no indication that he was actually willing to give an inch on his demand for funding the wall.\n\nTrump attributes his spectacular rise in politics to the shrewdness of his gut, the power of his bluster and his command of a devoted core of supporters. Even though those are the instincts that led him into an impasse with no clear exit, they are still the priorities he extols.\n\nHe bragged not about progress toward resolving the standoff but about the unity of Republicans behind him in standing firm, although a few GOP senators have expressed concern about the extended shutdown. It is poised to become the longest in history on Saturday. They all want to see something happen, but they are extremely united, and I don't think I have ever seen unity like this in the Republican Party, he declared. It's really a beautiful thing to see.\n\nThat said, the costs and complications of the partial government shutdown continue to increase: Security lines are getting longer at some airports, trash is piling up at national parks and 800,000 federal workers are about to miss a paycheck Friday. A Politico/Morning Consult poll released this week showed Trump bearing the brunt of the blame: About half of Americans hold the president responsible; a third blame congressional Democrats.\n\nAmong Republicans surveyed, the blame goes to Democrats by almost 5-1. Trump's rating within his party actually ticked up a few percentage points from before the shutdown, and 84 percent express approval of the job he's doing as president.\n\nSince his inauguration, Trump has made more efforts to hold the support of those who voted for him than he has to expand his appeal to those who didn't. That helps explains his unyielding stance in a standoff that would have prompted most of his predecessors to seek a settlement and move on.\n\nBy all objective standards, it's all downside for him – except for one, Mo Elleithee, a veteran Democratic strategist and executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, said in an interview. That's his base. His base is loving it. They're eating it up, and it's increasingly clear that's all he cares about. Anything else is irrelevant.\n\nThursday on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweaked congressional Republicans for that unity, for refusing to break with Trump on this or much of anything else. Did you take an oath to the Constitution or to Donald Trump? she asked. She warned Trump that he could put his partisan solidarity at risk if he delivers on his threat to declare a state of emergency as a way of bypassing Congress for wall funds.\n\nI think the president will have problems on his own side of the aisle for exploiting the situation in a way that enhances his power, she said, a reference to concerns expressed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republicans that future Democratic presidents would feel empowered by the use of emergency declarations to pursue policy goals. I think he's going to have to answer to his own party on usurping that much power.\n\nTrump gave no sign of being deterred.\n\nI have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, he said, an assertion some legal analysts disputed. If this doesn't work out, probably I will do it – I would almost say definitely.\n\nOn Day 20, the end of the shutdown didn't seem to be getting closer. It seemed to be getting further away. Pelosi didn't signal any willingness to relent in the Democrats' refusal to approve funding for a wall. In a tweet, Trump blamed Democrats intransigence as he announced he canceled a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, because of the shutdown, a sign he thinks it may not be settled by then.\n\nHis departure was slated for Jan. 21 – when the shutdown would hit Day 31.
Greg Toppo\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCNN security personnel on Sunday escorted a White House adviser off the set of the network's State of the Union show after a combative TV interview with host Jake Tapper, the network said.\n\nStephen Miller, senior adviser for policy to President Trump, tried several times during the interview to both praise Trump as a political genius and criticize the cable news network's political coverage, which Trump often refers to as fake news.\n\nIn a series of tense exchanges, Tapper tried to redirect Miller, responding at one point that the adviser was using the interview to speak directly to Trump: There's one viewer that you care about right now, and you're being obsequious, you're being a factotum, in order to please him, Tapper said.\n\nMiller spent much of the interview slamming Fire & Fury: Inside The Trump White House, the new book by journalist Michael Wolff, which features critical remarks on Trump from former White House adviser Steve Bannon.\n\nMiller called Bannon's remarks grotesque, saying his criticism of Trump reads like an angry, vindictive person spouting off to a highly discredible author.\n\nHe added, The book is best understood as a work of very poorly written fiction.\n\nMiller also recalled traveling across the country with Trump, telling Tapper, I saw a man who was a political genius.\n\nEventually, the host ended the interview, telling Miller, I think I've wasted enough of my viewers' time.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News Monday, Miller told host Tucker Carlson that the story about him being escorted off the CNN set was not true, but he did not offer specifics about which aspects of the story were inaccurate.\n\nMore:White House aide Stephen Miller says story of being escorted off CNN 'not true'\n\nBusiness Insider first reported on the incident, citing two sources who said that after the taping, Miller refused to leave the set and had to be escorted out by security. One source told the publication, The segment was over and Mr. Miller was politely asked to leave the set multiple times — after refusing to leave, he was escorted out by security.\n\nCNN late Sunday noted that it hadn't released a statement on the incident. On Monday, a CNN official who was not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY that during a commercial break after the segment, Miller wanted to continue the interview but was asked to leave. Ultimately, CNN security escorted him from set because the live show was about to resume.\n\nThe White House declined to comment to USA TODAY, but Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters on Monday that Miller was not escorted out of the studio. Gidley said Miller left on his own will, according to a pool report.\n\nFollow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIn a crisis, Americans will follow a leader who has a plan and can lay out a clear path to a resolution.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt offered this kind of clarity at the Casablanca conference of 1943, when he committed the United States to achieving nothing less than unconditional surrender of the Axis Powers. On a smaller scale, George H.W. Bush employed overwhelming firepower in 1991 to an uncomplicated goal, driving Iraqi troops from Kuwait. He did it in 100 hours, and his approval rating reached 89%.\n\nNow it's Donald Trump's turn to spell out his endgame in Iran to Congress and the public.\n\nSoleimani not the only bad man\n\nAfter ordering the assassination Thursday of Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, the president needs to explain the way forward for what appears, for now, to be little more than retaliatory brinkmanship with high potential for escalation.\n\nWithout question, the world is better off without Soleimani. In the aftermath of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, he was blamed for the deaths of more than 600 American troops, in large part by arming insurgents with specialized roadside bombs that could fire molten metal through armored vehicles, eviscerating soldiers riding inside.\n\nOPPOSING VIEW:Iran strategy of 'maximum pressure' continues\n\nNevertheless, there are a lot of bad men in the world, from Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and America isn't in the business of killing them all. In fact, the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama both determined that the costs of assassinating Soleimani could well exceed the benefits.\n\nTrump's Iran policy, meanwhile, has careened from major caution to drastic reaction.\n\nIran lashed out\n\nHe crippled the only constraint on Iran's nuclear program by pulling out of a 2015 agreement, imposing severe economic sanctions to curtail Tehran's regional aggression. When that didn't work, Trump dispatched emissaries to seek talks and boasted that Islamic leaders were ready to make a deal.\n\nIn fact, reeling from sanctions, Iran chose to lash out — attacking or seizing oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, shooting down a U.S. military drone and briefly taking out half of Saudi Arabia's oil-refining capacity in a coordinated air assault.\n\nTrump remained notably restrained through all of this, calling off a military counter strike in June 10 minutes before it was to be launched, actions that might have emboldened Iranian hard-liners. On Dec. 27, an Iranian-backed militia showered rockets onto a joint U.S.-Iraqi base, and an American contractor died. The United States responded with airstrikes that killed 25 militia fighters, and Iran-supported demonstrators temporarily laid siege to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\n\nIn the midst of this back-and-forth, Trump suddenly — and surprisingly, according to some advisers — ordered the killing of Soleimani, who was visiting Baghdad. State Department officials later said that Soleimani was planning imminent attacks and that his killing would de-escalate the Iranian crisis.\n\nIt's very clear the world's a safer place today, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told ABC News.\n\n52 Iranian targets\n\nIn fact, that isn't clear at all. Nor is it clear whether the president acted impulsively, or whether he carefully thought through the ramifications.\n\nTrump, who campaigned both as a tough guy and a candidate opposed to foreign entanglements, finds himself sending thousands more U.S. troops into the Middle East as Iran vows to retaliate, either directly or, more likely, through proxy forces or cyberattacks.\n\nIn Tehran, where there had been demonstrations against the regime in November, hundreds of thousands gathered Monday to mourn Soleimani, united in their hatred of America. And in Baghdad, an Iraqi parliament angered about a U.S. assassination carried out on its soil, voted to force out 5,000 U.S. troops deployed there to help fight the Islamic State terrorist group — a move that, if carried out, would boost Iranian influence over Iraq's struggling democracy.\n\nAdministration officials are finally scheduling a meeting with members of Congress on Wednesday to brief them on the Soleimani killing. There are a host of crucial questions: What was the proof Soleimani was planning imminent attacks? Has the threat ended with his death? And, most important, what's the ultimate goal?\n\nIt's difficult to predict where this is all headed. Perhaps the Soleimani killing will prove to be a necessary punch in the nose to deter a regional bully. But tit-for-tat actions, driven by notions of national pride and religious fervor, have a way of getting out of hand. Iranian leaders said they had 35 U.S. retaliatory targets to choose from. Not to be outdone, Trump said he has 52 Iranian targets in mind, including cultural sites.\n\nAmericans deserve to hear a better strategy than can be communicated by bursts of invective on Twitter.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — For years, Don Cravins was the only African-American chief of staff in the Senate. He may be gone, but not much has changed.\n\nThere is still only one African-American chief of staff in the chamber and fewer thantwo dozen staffers of color in other top senior-level positions.\n\nThe doors have been closed to many of our people,'' said Cravins, who served as chief of staff for former Democratic senator Mary Landrieu and is now senior vice president for policy at the National Urban League. We're going to really try to put a stop to this and deal with this issue once and for all.\n\nThe Urban League, along other civil rights groups, and current and former staffers are calling on Senate leaders to step up efforts to address the lack of diversity among top staffers and make it a priority in the new Congress. Just this month, groups have sent letters to Senate leaders, hosted a panel on the issue and met with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nThere's seems to be more synergy this time around, said Cory Horton, legislative director for Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.\n\nRead more:\n\nNevada voters send first Latina to U.S. Senate\n\nDon Bell, president of the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus, said the push is coming from groups on and off the Hill, which has made it an issue that members and senior staffers here in the Senate have to take notice of.''\n\nBell said his group has been meeting for weeks with senior staffers and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. Our perspective is that the lack of diversity is an institutional problem that requires a bipartisan response,'' he said.\n\nSupporters of the effort note that Congress is more diverse. The Congressional Black Caucus is the largest it has ever been with 49 members. The Senate has three African-American members. Despite those milestones, they say lawmakers have fallen short on hiring a more diverse staff.\n\nOf the more than 300 top staffers in the Senate in 2015, only 24 were people of color, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank that focuses on issues affecting African Americans.\n\nThe center, which plans to release an updated report, recently applauded several lawmakers for hires, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., whose chief of staff is African American.\n\nThe groups say the push comes at a critical time as communities become more diverse.\n\nWith a country as diverse as ours we need policy makers providing input from as wide a spectrum as possible, said Horton. The things that members of Congress do on the Hill are often a reflection of who they are and their staff.\n\nA coalition of civil rights groups met Tuesday with Schumer, where they discussed a range of issues, including the lack of diversity. The groups also hope to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nSchumer's office said he has taken some steps, including expansion of an initiative set up by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., in 2006 to focus on increasing staff diversity. Schumer has hired more staffers and revamped the candidate database.\n\nRead more:\n\nLawmaker raps Obama for lack of diversity in top posts\n\nThis new Capitol Hill selfie highlights interns of color\n\nSchumer is also encouraging colleagues to follow the Rooney Rule,'' an NFL policy that requires teams to also interview minority candidates for top jobs.\n\nThe more diverse the Senate is, the better it can serve the American people,'' said Schumer. Expanding the diversity initiative, following the Rooney rule, and dedicating ourselves to increasing diversity will be good for the Senate and for the country.\n\nSupporters say many senior level jobs are not posted so the rule may not be enough.\n\nThe Rooney Rule is great, but it doesn't work if there's no interview process,'' said Cravins. If we never know there's a vacancy, then how do you know if the Rooney Rule was even used?''\n\nDemocratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Brian Schatz of Hawaii are also urging colleagues to diversify their staffs.\n\nAmong other proposals, groups are also calling for senators to:\n\n• Adopt a resolution to create a Senate chief diversity office and diversity office\n\n• Collect data of the makeup of offices\n\n• Support minority internships and fellowships to increase the number of prospects in the pipeline\n\n• Expand the pool of candidates\n\n• Create a task force of lawmakers, civil rights leaders and staffers to address the issue.\n\nA diverse staff informs public policy in a full and complete manner,'' Marc Sebastian Mason, president of the Washington Government Relations Group, a group of black lobbyists, wrote to Senate leaders.\n\nThe Urban League also plans to send a letter later this month to Senate leaders and new senators, particularly those from states with significant minority populations, such as John Kennedy, R-La. The Urban League also hosted a panel last week.\n\nWhile the Senate is the focus now, the groups say the House also needs to improve its staff diversity. Many senior level staffers of color work in the offices of minority lawmakers. The House shouldn't get a pass,'' said Cravins.\n\nSupporters acknowledge there may not be a legislative fix to the problem, but said the effort should come from lawmakers.\n\nWhether they legislate or not, they could just do it on their own,'' Cravins said. There are some things they can do starting now and they can fix this issue in six months if they really wanted to.''
David Jolly\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib was right to say impeachment of President Donald Trump should be on the table. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer should acknowledge the same. They should do so now, repeatedly, and regardless of the status of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. They should own the message and set the narrative for the nation.\n\nConsider two scenarios:\n\nIn the first, a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives presents itself as a coequal branch of government, negotiating as constitutional peers with Trump on traditional policy such as the government shutdown while also engaging in anticipated oversight hearings on alleged malfeasance by his administration.\n\nIn the second, a Democratic-controlled House asserts itself as a coequal branch, but declares now, without hesitation, that its main function — necessitated by a time of national crisis the president brought upon us — must be to present Trump as having knowingly compromised his fitness for office, publicly treat him as such, and hold hearings with constitutional scholars regarding whether his alleged criminal activity rises to the level of impeachment.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nNow is the time to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump\n\nNo exit: America's not only trapped in Trump's legal reality show, we're paying for it\n\nHow House Dems can save democracy and the rule of law: Impeach Trump ASAP\n\nThe former conveys to the majority of Americans the traditional, and predictable, peer relationship between a Congress and a president of divided parties, similar to other chapters in American political history.\n\nThe latter is a deliberate, persistent and dire expression of congressional leaders that we are in an unprecedented chapter of U.S. history in which the president faces significant criminal allegations, has lied about matters of national security, must not be afforded the traditional credibility due the presidency, and cannot be trusted in word or deed.\n\nDonald Trump was identified as a conspirator in a federal crime already entered into judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in a plea deal coordinated with federal prosecutors and accepted by a federal judge. That matter in and of itself exceeds the culpability standard used to impeach our 42nd president, Bill Clinton.\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders should remind the American people of this daily, consistently reiterating that the bar for impeachment has already been met and that Trump is constitutionally compromised. Democratic congressional leaders should aggressively present Trump as an impeachable president unworthy of being approached as a constitutionally respected peer.\n\nWe need impeachment hearings, not oversight\n\nLikewise, Trump has lied about the denuclearization of North Korea, has misled the American people about his personal financial dealings with Russia (see Trump Tower Moscow) and has been shown to have been manipulated by the leaders of Russia (see Helsinki), Turkey (see Syria), Saudi Arabia (see Jamal Khashoggi) and others on matters of U.S. security interests. He has disclosed classified intelligence to foreign diplomats in the Oval Office and has suffered the public rebuke of his own Defense secretary, who found the president's national security behavior so unsettling that he resigned.\n\nThese are facts we know now. Democratic congressional leaders would be smart to consistently define the president by these events with a level of seriousness and unrelenting public indictment worthy of their significance in presidential history.\n\nImportantly, neither the Southern District of New York matter nor the president's national security actions are part of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. For congressional Democrats to defer action on the above until completion of the Mueller report is simply a misleading non sequitur born of political convenience and 2020 trepidation rather than acceptance of a sacred constitutional responsibility.\n\nThese are extraordinary times. They must be confronted as such. To do otherwise — to deal constructively with this president as a credible political leader — only normalizes for all of history the damage he has already wrought upon the presidency and the nation. Traditional oversight hearings are simply insufficient. Discussion of impeachment should be seriously presented to the American people now by Pelosi and Schumer. And in so doing, they will set a narrative that relegates this president to one deserving only dishonor.\n\nVoters elected Democrats to check Trump\n\nCautious politicos warn, often with broad generalization, that the American people would prefer the parties deal constructively with each other as loyal adversaries, that Congress and the president find a way to work together, producing policies and oversight measures for the greater good of the nation. In traditional times, that might be true. But that warning sells short the intelligence of voters who worked to restore Democratic control to the House last November knowing that these are not traditional times.\n\nVoters who went to the polls in November did not expect Democrats to successfully enact a progressive agenda if they were to win the House or the Senate in 2018. Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, comprehensive immigration reform — they would each be pursued in contrast to the disjointed policies of the president and eventually make up an attainable platform for the party in 2020. But the voters did expect two things from a Democratic House: a hard stop to the continued enactment of Trumpian policies, and a direct, deliberate and fierce response to the president's known wrongdoing.\n\nVoters who turned out in November to usher in a blue wave will not walk away from the cause if Democratic leaders demonstrate now, with honest conviction, that Trump cannot be trusted with the powers of the presidency, that impeachment is on the table, and that he will not be afforded the credibility traditionally given to his predecessors.\n\nBut if Democratic congressional leaders miss this opportunity, many voters who were there for them in November likely won't be in 2020.\n\nAttorney David Jolly was a Republican congressman from Florida's 13th district from 2014 to 2017.

Cyborg is back in business.\n\nInvicta FC featherweight champ and UFC star Cristiane Justino (17-1 MMA, 2-0 UFC) has been granted a retroactive therapeutic-use exemption by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, the UFC's anti-doping partner, clearing the way for her shot at the women's featherweight championship.\n\nUSADA announced the decision today on its website, ending a two-month period of uncertainty after Justino failed an out-of-competition drug test and faced an anti-doping violation that could have derailed her title hopes.\n\nJustino was granted the exemption after a comprehensive review of her medical history involving spironolactone, the banned diuretic for which she tested positive, USADA said. She denied using PEDs and her representative said she took the drug to combat the effects of a brutal weight cut she undertook to fight Lina Lansberg at a catchweight of 140 pounds in a UFC Fight Night 95 headliner.\n\nUpon notice of her positive test, Justino immediately identified a medication prescribed by her physician for the treatment of a common endocrine disorder as the source of the prohibited substance detected in her sample, USADA said in its statement. She also participated in multiple interviews with USADA's investigative team and consented to USADA interviewing her physician as well.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation of the circumstances that preceded her positive test, which included a comprehensive review of Justino's documented medical history, USADA accepted Justino's explanation that her use of spironolactone began in late September, following her bout at UFC Fight Night Brasilia, and was in accordance with her physician's recommendation for the treatment of a legitimate medical condition.\n\nUFC President Dana White recently indicated Justino had turned a corner with the promotion's anti-doping regulator and indicated she would be cleared to fight sooner than later. She attended last Saturday's UFC 208 and watched Germaine de Randamie (8-3 MMA, 4-1 UFC) outpoint ex-bantamweight champ Holly Holm (10-3 MMA, 3-3 UFC) for the inaugural featherweight title, an opportunity Cyborg was supposed to receive before she declined multiple offers citing a need to recover from her weight cut.\n\nWhite indicated Justino was first in line to meet de Randamie, but this week the newly minted champ said she'd rather rematch Holm after their bout ended in controversy.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty is a possible surgery de Randamie may need to repair a hand injury. Justino told MMAjunkie she won't wait for the champ and said de Randamie knew the winner of the UFC 208 title fight had to fight her. She accused de Randamie of being scared to step in the octagon, which de Randamie denied.\n\nIf @IronLadyMMA is injured I'd like 2 give Australias biggest #keyboardwarrior @MeganA_mma a chance to put her belt up and show my weakness https://t.co/CpMAvMMrR4 — #UFCRIO (@criscyborg) February 14, 2017\n\nBelow is USADA's full statement:\n\nUSADA announced today that UFC® athlete Cristiane Justino, of Curitiba, Brazil, has been granted a retroactive Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) and will therefore not face an anti-doping policy violation after testing positive for a prohibited substance in December of 2016. With this announcement, USADA is providing a public notice of the case's resolution following the announcement of the potential anti-doping violation by the UFC on December 22, 2016.\n\nJustino, 31, tested positive for Spironolactone, following an out-of-competition urine test conducted on December 5, 2016. Spironolactone is a prohibited substance in the category of Diuretics and Masking Agents and is prohibited at all times under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, which has adopted the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List.\n\nUpon notice of her positive test, Justino immediately identified a medication prescribed by her physician for the treatment of a common endocrine disorder as the source of the prohibited substance detected in her sample. She also participated in multiple interviews with USADA's investigative team and consented to USADA interviewing her physician as well.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation of the circumstances that preceded her positive test, which included a comprehensive review of Justino's documented medical history, USADA accepted Justino's explanation that her use of Spironolactone began in late September, following her bout at UFC Fight Night Brasilia, and was in accordance with her physician's recommendation for the treatment of a legitimate medical condition. Nonetheless, because Spironolactone is prohibited at all times under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, USADA advised Justino that her use of the medication without a valid TUE violated the UFC Anti-Doping Policy. Accordingly, Justino applied for a TUE to authorize her use of the medication, with retroactive effect.\n\nUSADA recognizes that over the course of a career, athletes may experience illnesses or medical conditions that require the use of a particular medication for proper treatment. While athletes are educated and encouraged to apply for a TUE in advance of using a prohibited substance or method, the UFC Anti-Doping Policy permits athletes to file for retroactive TUEs where the use of a prohibited substance or method was medically justified. Athletes are cautioned, however, that applying retroactively is at their own risk and the only guaranteed way to avoid an anti-doping policy violation for using a prohibited substance or method is by obtaining a TUE prior to the use of a prohibited substance or method.\n\nUnder the UFC TUE Policy, to receive approval of a TUE, athletes must submit medical records demonstrating a verifiable medical diagnosis and legitimate medical need for the requested medication in accordance with the applicable WADA guidelines. At least two members of USADA's independent TUE Committee (TUEC) – comprised of medical experts with various areas of expertise from around the U.S. – must individually review the TUE application, after which a recommendation is made to USADA as to whether the TUE should be granted or denied.\n\nIn the case of Justino, the application for a TUE was granted because the athlete had an unequivocally diagnosed chronic medical condition for which the use of Spironolactone is the appropriate standard of care. Further, it was determined that the athlete and her medical team pursued and exhausted all non-prohibited alternatives and that the low dose of the medication is consistent with best medical practice to treat her condition and would return the athlete to a normal state of health without providing a performance-enhancing benefit.\n\nBecause Justino's TUE application was granted retroactively, her provisional suspension has been lifted with immediate effect and her positive test will not result in an anti-doping policy violation. However, as a condition of the TUE approval, Justino will be required to continue to carefully document her medical care and must apply for a TUE renewal in advance of TUE expiry should she wish to maintain compliance with the UFC Anti-Doping Policy.\n\nUSADA conducts the year-round, independent anti-doping program for all UFC athletes. USADA is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental agency whose sole mission is to preserve the integrity of competition, inspire true sport, and protect the rights of clean athletes. In an effort to aid UFC athletes, as well as their support team members, in understanding the rules applicable to them, USADA provides comprehensive instruction on the UFC Anti-Doping Program website (UFC.USADA.org) regarding the testing process and prohibited substances, how to obtain permission to use a necessary medication, and the risks and dangers of taking supplements as well as performance-enhancing and recreational drugs. In addition, the agency manages a drug reference hotline, Drug Reference Online (UFC.GlobalDRO.com), conducts educational sessions, and proactively distributes a multitude of educational materials, such as the Prohibited List, easy-reference wallet cards, and periodic athlete alerts.\n\nFor complete coverage of UFC 208, check out the UFC Events section of the site.
Orrin G. Hatch\n\nRight now, one of our own is suffering in a leaky prison cell in Latin America, cut off from family, friends and many of the people he loves the most. Joshua Holt, a constituent of mine and an upstanding American citizen, was arrested by Venezuelan authorities in June 2016 and jailed on false charges. His health is quickly failing, and he desperately needs our help.\n\nJosh's story is the nightmare of any American traveling abroad.\n\nMore:Iran unrest threatens Tehran's tyrants. Can protesters drive them out?\n\nMore:On immigration, Trump is positioned to do what Obama and Bush couldn't\n\nJosh first flew to Venezuela last year to marry his fiancée, Thamara Caleno Holt, a young Venezuelan woman whom he fell in love with after months of constant correspondence. Just days after their marriage, the newlyweds were detained on spurious charges — for allegedly possessing weapons and engaging in espionage. In clear violation of the Vienna Convention, Venezuelan authorities not only denied Josh medical attention but also barred access to U.S. Consular officials for the first several weeks of his incarceration.\n\nFor months, Josh's case has languished in Venezuelan courts. And while Venezuelan authorities dither, Josh continues to suffer in prison, alone and afraid in an alien country. With his case scheduled to move to trial in January, government authorities have offered no clarification as to how long the trial will take, or if U.S. officials will even be able to help Josh in legal proceedings. The Venezuelan government has also refused to guarantee that Josh will receive much-needed medical attention, even as his health continues to deteriorate.\n\nThe tragedy is that Josh is completely innocent of the crimes for which he stands accused. I know Josh to be a good and honorable man with a pure heart. As a case in point, Josh served for two years as a Mormon missionary in Washington prior to his marriage. It was in this setting that he learned Spanish and developed a deep love for the Hispanic people, culture and customs. That he would ever inflict harm on anyone, let alone the good people of Venezuela, is unthinkable.\n\nFrom the time of Josh's arrest last year, I have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. I have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with Venezuelan authorities. I even raised the issue of Josh's captivity with President Trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on Venezuela and called on President Nicolas Maduro to set Josh free.\n\nAs a leader looking to do what is good and just, President Maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of Josh and Thamy on humanitarian grounds. This action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. With this gesture of goodwill, the governments of Venezuela and the United States could move forward together towards a better future.\n\nThe path to greater peace begins with simple steps, and I invite President Maduro to take the first step.

AP\n\nNFL owners will try again to settle the issue of relocation to Los Angeles, this time knowing that Commissioner Roger Goodell has declared the stadiums inadequate in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego.\n\nTwo days of meetings in Houston start Tuesday, six weeks after owners delayed a vote because they wanted more information on possible moves involving the Raiders, Rams and Chargers. Any move would involve one or two teams.\n\nAll three cities have tried to make their cases with the NFL, and each team recently submitted a formal relocation bid.\n\nThe latest development was Goodell's report last week to all 32 teams that says the existing stadiums are inadequate and unsatisfactory, and that the proposals the Raiders, Rams and Chargers received to remain in their current cities lacked certainty. The report is required in the relocation process.\n\nRams owner Stan Kroenke is planning a $1.8 billion stadium in Inglewood, California, at the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack. The Raiders and Chargers have a joint project in mind for nearby Carson. Kroenke also is willing to share his proposed stadium with either the Chargers or Raiders.\n\nA move requires approval from at least 24 owners.\n\nIt's a long, tedious process, New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch said at the December meetings in the Dallas area. There's a lot of questions and there are not answers to every question yet. And there will be more questions when we meet in mid-January for sure.\n\nThe St. Louis proposal calls for an open-air, $1.1 billion stadium along the Mississippi River north of the Gateway Arch to replace the Edward Jones Dome.\n\nThe plan includes $150 million from the city, $250 million from Kroenke, at least $200 million from the league, and $160 million in fan seat licenses. The rest of the money comes from the state, either through tax credits or bonds. Goodell has countered that NFL policy limits the league's contribution to $100 million.\n\nSan Diego has a $1.1 billion proposal to replace aging Qualcomm Stadium, but it will require a public vote that likely wouldn't happen before June. The Chargers walked away from negotiations with the city and have focused their efforts on the Carson project.\n\nHouston owner Bob McNair, a member of the relocation committee, canceled a meeting with San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer last month, and made disparaging public remarks about city leadership.\n\nOakland is still in debt from a renovation 20 years ago when the Raiders moved back from Los Angeles. City officials have said they won't seek help from taxpayers with a new stadium, and asked the NFL for more time to develop a project in a league-required response to the Raiders' relocation plan.\n\nNo NFL franchise has moved since the Houston Oilers went to Tennessee in 1997. The Raiders and Rams both left Los Angeles after the 1994 season.\n\nI think the league, the NFL, looks at the disruption to any home city that potentially could lose their team to another city, Tisch said. And they look at it very seriously. No one is doing this to encourage clubs moving from Oakland, San Diego or St. Louis to Los Angeles.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Schuyler Dixon on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apschuyler
Amazon has fired a number of employees for breaking company policy by sharing private customer data with a third party on the heels of another privacy scandal involving its Ring doorbell cameras.\n\nThe e-commerce giant with millions of customers sent out an email on Friday letting some shoppers know that their email address and phone number was disclosed by an Amazon employee to a third party, TechCrunch reports.\n\nIt's unclear how many customers received the email on Friday, or exactly how many employees were terminated for such offenses. Amazon said its internal systems alerted the company about suspicious behavior.\n\nThe individuals responsible for this incident have been terminated and we are supporting law enforcement in their prosecution, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nWhat's more alarming is that there was nothing customers could do to stop it, and you can't respond to the email Amazon sent out for information. Amazon also did not identify the third party involved.\n\nPrivacy lawsuit:Amazon's Ring fires four employees for snooping on customers' doorbell camera video feeds\n\nCES 2020:Fast & Furious actor Ludacris' thoughts on Tesla as EVs have a major moment\n\nThis is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to take any action, Amazon's customer service division said in the email.\n\nEarlier in January, Amazon confirmed that its security camera division Ring fired four staffers for snooping on customers' video feeds.\n\nIn each instance, once Ring was made aware of the alleged conduct, Ring promptly investigated the incident, and after determining that the individual violated company policy, terminated the individual, Amazon Vice President of Public Policy Brian Huseman wrote in a letter to senators.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.
Darla Mercado\n\nCNBC\n\nThis year, if you want to boost your tax savings beyond the new standard deduction, consider giving away some of your wealth.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect on Monday, bringing with it a slate of changes to the code. Those include an increase to the standard deduction (which nearly doubles to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples who file jointly), as well as the elimination of personal exemptions.\n\nAbout 49 million taxpayers, or 28%, currently itemize, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Due to the higher standard deduction, fewer filers are expected to do so in the future.\n\nMore than 36 million filers claimed the charitable-giving deduction on their 2015 taxes, according to the IRS.\n\nHowever, filers who plan their charitable gifts may be able to get themselves over the new standard deduction and itemize — if they use a strategy called bunching.\n\nYou would give the same amount of dollars that you would over a two-year period, but you bunch them into one year, said Charlie Douglas, partner and director of wealth planning at Cedar Rowe Partners in Atlanta.\n\nBunching in one year will help you itemize deductions where you couldn't, he said.\n\nHere's what you should know about bunching your charitable gifts.\n\nAccelerated giving\n\nThe tax overhaul took away many of the levers taxpayers could use to ramp up their deductions so that they could itemize on their taxes.\n\nFor instance, filers could previously take an unlimited deduction every year for property and state income taxes. Now, they are only allowed to claim up to $10,000 in these expenses each year.\n\nThe charitable giving deduction remains for taxpayers who itemize. Under the new law, this break is limited to 60% of adjusted gross income for cash gifts, but you can carry forward by up to five years any amount that exceeds that.\n\nSingle donors who fall short of the $12,000 threshold ($24,000 if married) can itemize on their taxes if they supercharge their giving in one year.\n\nEvery other year\n\nConsider that a married couple is claiming the maximum property and state income tax deduction of $10,000. This couple also paid $6,000 in mortgage interest in a year.\n\nThey will need at least $8,000 of charitable gifts in order to hit — and surpass — the $24,000 standard deduction threshold.\n\nIf this couple normally gives $4,000 to charity annually, they can accelerate the gift by cramming in two years of donations into one tax year. This way, they itemize on their taxes one year and take the standard deduction the next.\n\nYou could do three years of gifts, even two years of gifts to get over the standard deduction, said Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning for Baird's private wealth management group.\n\nBunching deductions sounds great, but it'll probably be talked about more than it's implemented because of the cash commitment it will take to get over the standard deduction, said Steffen.\n\nMore:Charity gets a jolt from tax law -- but due to drop next year\n\nMore:Are your donations to charities doing all the good they could?\n\nMore:Some homeowners see prepaying property taxes as way to save this year and next
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nA perp walk for Kevin Spacey\n\nKevin Spacey is scheduled for a perp walk Monday to a Massachusetts courthouse as he's arraigned on a felony charge of indecent assault and battery. A motion filed by the 59-year-old actor's attorneys to excuse his appearance was denied. The arraignment could last only minutes, but it will be the first time Spacey has been seen in public in more than a year, not counting the baffling YouTube video he posted after the sex charge became public. He's accused of groping a then-18-year-old son of a Boston TV anchorwoman in July 2016. More than a dozen men — including five who said they were teens at the time — have alleged that Spacey sexually harassed, assaulted or attempted to rape them.\n\nTrade war talks: US officials due in Beijing\n\nAmerican officials are due in Beijing Monday for talks aimed at easing a trade battle that's caused both nations' economies to suffer. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about trade negotiations over the weekend, claiming tariffs have absolutely hurt China very badly. After several tit-for-tat tariff increases, leaders agreed Dec. 1 to postpone further hikes, and both governments face pressure to reach a settlement. Chinese economic growth fell to 6.5 percent in the quarter ending in September. Third-quarter U.S. growth was 3.4 percent and unemployment is at a five-decade low.\n\nUnited bans Fido on long flights\n\nStarting Monday, emotional support animals will not be able to travel on United Airlines flights more than eight hours long. In a statement, the airline noted an increase in on-board incidents with the animals, many of which are not used to spending hours in an aircraft cabin. The airline will also not accept kittens or puppies younger than four months as emotional support animals, in-cabin pets or service animals. United received much attention after rejecting a support peacock named Dexter for a flight last year. The airline joins Delta Air Lines and Spirit Airlines in setting more restrictions on emotional support animals.\n\nIt's Alabama and Clemson (again)\n\nFor the third time in four years, it's Alabama vs. Clemson for the College Football Playoff national championship. The Crimson Tide and Tigers face off Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ESPN. The mirror-image teams split their first two championship game encounters with Alabama beating Clemson for the 2015 season title, and Clemson topping Alabama to win the 2016 one. If Alabama can pull off another victory against Clemson, Tide coach Nick Saban would surpass legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant for the most titles by a coach in the poll era. Saban and Bryant are currently tied with six. But Clemson's freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence has reawakened the Tigers' offense.\n\nA US withdrawal from Syria. Maybe\n\nJohn Bolton, President Donald Trump's national security adviser set to travel to Turkey Monday, said some conditions apply to the U.S. military's withdrawal from Syria. They include the defeat of remnants of the Islamic State and Turkey's assurance of safety for Kurdish fighters allied with the United States, Bolton told reporters Sunday. The comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as Trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
Steven Strauss\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nRussia is corrupt and autocratic. It ranks 138th out of 180 countries for corruption (where a higher ranking means more corrupt) and 149th for freedom of the press (where a higher ranking means less freedom). In Russia, government policies benefit the ruling party's allies and punish its opponents.\n\nAmerica used to condemn countries like Russia. Now, President Donald Trump openly expresses his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and other corrupt autocrats. Even worse, Trump and the GOP want America to become more like Russia.\n\nConsider the very Republican state of Wyoming (Trump got 68% of the vote there in 2016, and the GOP controls its legislature and governorship.) A Berkshire Hathaway Energy company is being reamed by Wyoming Republicans for plans to close coal-fired plants in Wyoming that aren't cost effective. Despite their party's claim to believe in capitalism and to oppose socialism, Wyoming Republicans passed a law making it difficult to close the plants and are investigating Berkshire's business plans.\n\nThe general message is to hell with capitalism — we need these tax revenues and jobs! In true autocratic crony-capitalist style, these GOP politicians view companies as a means to fund their political supporters and buy their votes.\n\nFriend in high place for Trump allies\n\nThis isn't a one-off. The Trumpified GOP increasingly meddles in our economy and legal system to punish its opponents and reward its supporters.\n\nJeff Bezos owns The Washington Post (which refuses to toe the Trump party line) and is also the largest shareholder in Amazon, as well as its founder and CEO. The company says Trump aimed to punish Bezos by pressing the military to award Microsoft, rather than Amazon, a multibillion dollar cloud computing contract. Trump also accused Amazon of ripping off the U.S. Postal Service and demanded that it be charged MUCH MORE!\n\nThis isn't just about Bezos. Trump also lobbied the military to give a major building contract for his border wall to a GOP supporter.\n\nLooking at the economy, the Federal Reserve found that Trump's trade war with China and tariffs damaged many Americans. However, Trump and the GOP gave billions of our tax dollars to America's farmers (who mainly vote Republican) to ensure that the trade war doesn't hurt them.\n\nThe GOP 2017 tax act was basically a tax cut for the rich who fund the party, full of special provisions to benefit corporate and wealthy supporters.\n\nAs for the news media, consider the disparate treatment of Rupert Murdoch/Fox News (consistent supporters of Trump) and CNN (which reports news, rather than cheerlead for Trump). CNN's merger with AT&T was opposed by Trump and challenged by his Justice Department. A major merger of some Fox properties into Disney, expected to encounter antitrust challenges from the government, sailed through suspiciously smoothly.\n\nAs investigative journalist Jane Mayer commented, Under Trump the government has consistently furthered Murdoch's business interests, to the detriment of his rivals.\n\nCorruption fighter:There's plenty for Donald Trump to investigate very close to home. His home.\n\nTrump is also corrupting our criminal justice system. For example, he pardoned political supporter and former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio under dubious circumstances. Trump also reversed the demotion of then-Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, charged with several war crimes but convicted only of bringing discredit to the armed services, and vowed not to let the Navy remove him. Instead, Gallagher retired, and Trump met with him at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump has also pressed government employees to break the law, promising them pardons if they're caught. (A spokesman said Trump was joking, and Trump called the story totally Fake.)\n\nAttacks on those who tell the truth\n\nThis president, who routinely demands investigations and punishment of anyone he feels is disloyal to him, has been impeached for pressing Ukraine to investigate a political opponent. When Democrats didn't give him a standing ovation during his 2018 State of the Union address, he called it treason.\n\nTrump has also attacked career military and foreign service officers for telling the truth under oath. And in flagrant violation of U.S. government policy, Trump is attempting to out a whistleblower who reported on his nefarious activities. Let's call this what it is — witness intimidation.\n\nTrump and the GOP want to reduce civil service protections for government employees and regularly attack nonpartisan career civil servants (who are simply doing their jobs) for lacking loyalty to Trump and the GOP. Moreover, Trump and his Republican allies claim that the FBI is a deep state conspiracy that must be purged, while the evidence shows the FBI, like the civil servants, is just trying to do its job.\n\nGlobal reach:America once led anti-corruption fight. Now self-dealing Trump is kleptocrats' role model.\n\nTrump has said that if he orders the military to commit war crimes, he expects them to do it. He also wants a justice system, civil service and media loyal to the Trumpified GOP. Meanwhile, his party has abandoned any pretense of trying to get the majority of Americans to vote Republican on the merits, relying instead on gerrymandering, voter suppression, the Electoral College and the Senate (where a small GOP state like Wyoming has the same number of votes as California) to maintain control.\n\nI could keep giving examples, but I've made my point. If, as expected, Trump survives an impeachment trial in the Republican Senate and stays in office, we'll have a simple choice in 2020.\n\nIf the Democrats win, America could become more like Canada or Germany (higher taxes, probably on the wealthy, and universal health insurance), but within a framework of the rule of law. If you're an ideological conservative, you won't like the Democrats' proposals, but they might fail in Congress and/or the courts. And, you'll get to vote for president again in 2024 (and beyond) — hopefully, for a law-abiding conservative.\n\nAlternatively, if Trump and Republicans win, America could become more like Russia. Vote wisely.\n\nSteven Strauss is a lecturer and visiting professor at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, an economic development specialist and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

LOS ANGELES – Smoke from grills full of kabob koobideh wafted past Roxanne Mirzaee as she cooked at a birthday party with Iranian American friends.\n\nMirzaee smiled warmly as laughter filled the air, but rising tensions far from this Beverly Hills barbecue have left her uneasy. While Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Donald Trump exchanged threats after a U.S. airstrike killed the regime's top general, Mirzaee worried for her father living in Iran.\n\nWe don't know what's happening, or what's going to happen next, she says.\n\nMany Iranian Americans in Los Angeles are not mourning the death of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, community members told USA TODAY, but they disagreed on the potential consequences for family here and abroad. Some feared war and restrictions on travel, while others hoped the assassination would dampen terrorism and spark another protest against the Iranian regime.\n\nWhether it was safe to share reactions to Soleimani's killing further divided the community, with more than 25 people declining to talk with USA TODAY, expressing fears that speaking out could endanger the lives of family members in their homeland. Others cited concern of being blacklisted from Iran, and some said they feared retaliation from their own parents.\n\nEscalating situation:What you need to know about the death of Gen. Soleimani of Iran\n\nMirzaee, 51, faced her own daughter's disapproval for criticizing the regime on Sunday night. After refusing an interview, unlike her mother, the daughter asked over a video call: Why did you do that, mom? How are we supposed to get grandpa now?\n\nBut Mirzaee, who says she fled Iran about 40 years ago to be free to voice her opinions without facing execution, was adamant. Disapproving of Trump's decision to strike Soleimani, she said the move creates sympathy for the regime.\n\nThe way it has been carried out just makes the people of Iran more supportive of the government because there are people like him, Mirzaee says. Killing one is not going to do much. There are hundreds worse than him. There's going to be one tomorrow taking his place.\n\nStill, much of the Iranian diaspora celebrated the killing, says Nasser Sharif, president of California Society for Democracy in Iran. Calling Soleimani a terrorist and a murderer of Iranians, Syrians and American soldiers in Iraq, Sharif says his contacts in Iran are thrilled and not fearful of strikes from the U.S. for any retaliation.\n\nI feel like there are not going be any major developments in that area because, again, the Iranian regime is very weak and vulnerable and desperate, Sharif says. At the same time, their worry is from inside Iran. The uprising of 191 cities in Iran had a big effect. The separation that took place shows that the regime is very unpopular among the public and the young generation.\n\nWill Iran strike against U.S.? 'We cannot rule out anything from them'\n\nIn Southern California, which is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran, Sharif says opposition to President Hassan Rouhani's government is widespread. Thousands fled to Los Angeles after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and today about 87,000 people of Iranian descent live here, according to the U.S. census.\n\nAmong them is Mateen Markzar, 15. During brunch with his father in the Little Persia enclave nicknamed Tehrangeles – a word formed through the blending of Tehran, the capital of Iran, and Los Angeles – he worried about the potential for war in Iran.\n\nI know that war is costly and unnecessary, Mateen says after a sip of Persian tea. However, if war was engaged with Iran, it would serve a benefit of squandering the Iranian regime's hopes of an all-area supremacy. It would put a damper on the Iranian regime's oppression of women and minority groups in Iran.\n\nMateen, who has never visited Iran, also expressed concern for culturally significant sites Trump said are possible targets if Iran attacks any U.S. assets. He listed Persepolis and the Azadi Tower before his father cuts him off, saying: You don't know that.\n\nWe don't know, Mateen acknowledges, but it's possible.\n\nThe remains of their omelette and gata pastries had gone cold. The boy's father, Sam Markzar, 51, says their family in Iran cannot say much about the rising tensions because the regime monitors everyone's actions and communications. He says he left Iran about eight years after the revolution, and adds that he is not surprised by some media reports that U.S. officials detained Iranians at the Canadian border over the weekend.\n\nWhatever that they do in order to secure the borders, I think that's absolutely necessary because that's the only way that they can come in if they want to plot something inside United States, Markzar says. I hope they're not crazy enough to do that, but from mullahs (leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran), anything can go. We cannot rule out anything from them.\n\nHow will the killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani impact Iranian-Americans?\n\nA few blocks away in Little Persia, Ray Kafi passed out flyers for a convention planned before the assassination but made more timely by it. Titled Stand with the Iranian People's Uprising for Freedom, speakers at the Jan. 11 event plan to discuss recent developments in Iran.\n\nTaking a break from talking with fellow Iranian Americans, the 66-year-old Kafi says people's reaction to the killing of Soleimani indicates whether they support the regime or democratic protesters.\n\nWhoever is happy today is on the side of democracy, Kafi says. And whoever is unhappy and has an issue, he's to the side of mullahs or that kind of policy.\n\nBack at the birthday party in Beverly Hills, Bijan Khalili says he doesn't expect discrimination against Iranian Americans to result from the killing. Since he immigrated to Los Angeles in 1980, Khalili, 67, says he hasn't experienced discrimination. He doesn't expect unequal treatment now.\n\nMounting anger:Iraq votes to expel U.S. troops after Iran Gen. Qasem Soleimani's killing\n\nBy the grill, however, Mirzaee disagreed. Since Trump's election in 2016, she says she has seen less tolerance and more divisiveness.\n\nBefore it was all about tolerance, tolerating each other, tolerating each other's ideas, Mirzaee says. That's why we came here, that's why all the immigrants came here for, to be able to voice out their opinion. Now it basically takes me back to the revolution, because I was there when it happened.\n\nAll she can do now, she says, is pray.
AP\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Former Florida quarterback Treon Harris plans to transfer to Football Championship Subdivision program Tennessee State.\n\nTennessee State athletic department spokesman Jose Garcia said Friday via email that I can inform of his intention to enroll at Tennessee State, but we cannot confirm until he steps on campus.\n\n247Sports first reported that Harris plans to enroll at Tennessee State next week. Harris has two seasons of eligibility remaining.\n\nHarris played 20 games and made 15 starts at Florida before leaving last July. He was suspended from Florida's team three times.\n\nHe started the final eight games of the 2015 season after Will Grier was suspended for violating the NCAA's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nDuring that 2015 season, Harris made a total of nine starts and completed 50.6 percent of his passes for 1,676 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nIn his two years at Florida, Harris completed just over half his pass attempts for 2,695 yards with 18 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also ran for 570 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe was suspended from the team for the third time in January 2016 for violating the university's code of conduct policy.\n\nTennessee State, a member of the Ohio Valley Conference, went 7-4 this season.\n\n___\n\nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org
President Donald Trump's National Security Council asked for military options on striking Iran in response to that country's support of insurgents in Iraq, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.\n\nThe council, under national security adviser John Bolton, made the request after militants aligned with Iran fired three mortar rounds into the diplomatic section of Baghdad, which includes the U.S. Embassy, according to the report. The mortars landed in a vacant lot, and no one was injured.\n\nThe Journal reported that the Pentagon developed plans for a strike on Iran in response to the National Security Council request, but it is unclear whether those plans were shared with the White House or Trump.\n\nUnnamed sources told the Journal that the request raised alarm within the Defense and State Departments.\n\nIt definitely rattled people, a former senior administration official told the newspaper. People were shocked. It was mind-boggling how cavalier they were about hitting Iran.\n\nA current senior administration official disputed that characterization, telling USA TODAY that the Pentagon and State Department were not caught off guard.\n\nNSC spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement that the council provides the president with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats.\n\nWe continue to review the status of our personnel following attempted attacks on our embassy in Baghdad and our Basra consulate, and we will consider a full range of options to preserve their safety and our interests, Marquis said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to comment on the report when asked about it during a news conference in Qatar.\n\nRelated:U.S. Navy veteran has been held in Iranian jail since July, mother says\n\nMore:5 facts about John Bolton, Trump's new national security adviser\n\nFormer U.S. officials told the Journal it was unnerving that the National Security Council asked for far-reaching military options to strike Iran in response to attacks that caused little damage and no injuries.\n\nBolton has long backed a more aggressive U.S. policy toward Iran. He was a strong proponent of pulling out of the Obama administration-era deal in which Iran agreed to pause its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a reduction in sanctions.\n\nNot long after the mortar attack that riled the National Security Council, Bolton warned the Iranians that if you cross us, our allies or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay.\n\nBefore joining the administration, Bolton was a strong advocate of a U.S. attack on Iran. In a New York Times op-ed in 2015 titled To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran, Bolton argued the inconvenient truth is that only military action could stop the nuclear program and called for vigorous American support for Iran's opposition, aimed at regime change in Tehran.\n\nBolton has said the Trump administration policy is not regime change, but we want to put unprecedented pressure on the government of Iran to change its behavior. Citing unnamed sources, the Journal reported that since joining the administration, Bolton has made it clear that he personally supports regime change in Iran.\n\nAfter Bolton replaced former Gen. H.R. McMaster in March, The American Conservative wrote that his appointment creates a prospect of war with Iran that is very real.\n\nHe has been obsessed for many years with going to war against the Islamic Republic, The American Conservative said.
Melanie Eversley\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe crisis over lead-contaminated water in impoverished Flint, Mich., is prompting a flood of quickly assembled grassroots campaigns to get clean, bottled water to the Midwestern city.\n\nImages of the rashes of children who've bathed in the water and of brown liquid spilling from faucets have spread through social media and news organizations. They have lit a fire under people from Los Angeles to Syracuse, N.Y., from the Chicago area to Texas. Churches, community organizations, groups of friends and concerned citizens are raising money to buy and ship water, or asking for bottled water donations that they will drive to Flint themselves.\n\nA few days ago, the Rev. Daren Jaime of People's AME Zion Church in Syracuse, N.Y., had an epiphany that he wanted to help. He put the word out and now a citywide campaign that includes Syracuse schools and the Southwest Community Center is in place. Jaime also reached out to the Rev. Darius Pridgen of True Bethel Baptist Church in Buffalo, N.Y., and president of the Buffalo Common Council. Pridgen set up a similar sister effort in his city, and Robert Rich, president of the Roar Logistics public transportation company, based in Buffalo, is handling the transport of the water to Flint. The campaign seemed to take on a life of its own and people just want to help, Jaime said.\n\nIt's a human tragedy to be in America, to be struggling for the most basic of necessities, and to watch kids, about 9,000 of them, to be contaminated with lead poisoning, Jaime said. I think people have a sense of compassion for the people of Flint knowing that a basic right, something we need on a day-to-day basis, has been taken away from them.\n\nEven before the water crisis, Flint was in crisis. An estimated 41.6% of the city's residents live in poverty, according to the Census Bureau. The city once known for being a bustling stronghold for General Motors' Buick and Chevrolet divisions took a turn for the worse after General Motors closed up shop, leaving Flint to take one hit after another. Today, it is often referred to as one of the most dangerous cities in America. Its decline was the subject of the 1989 documentary Roger & Me by filmmaker Michael Moore.\n\nA new problem hit Flint in 2014. Lead from corroded pipes began leaking into Flint's water. The situation took a dramatic turn in recent weeks when the national media grabbed hold of the story. A turning point seems to have been a cover of Time magazine that featured an image of a little boy with rashes on his face. Weighing on the story is the fact that Flint has such a high poverty rate and also is 56.6% black, according to the 2010 census, prompting many to charge that the city's water disaster was not addressed adequately because of race and class.\n\nMichigan governor: No time frame for Flint water fix\n\nEPA: Lead levels in Flint water exceed filters� ability\n\nThe need appears to have set people into motion. Celebrities such as talk show host Jimmy Fallon and singer Madonna are donating, but grassroots efforts seem to be taking over the philanthropic end of things.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, staffers at the GoFundMe.com crowdfunding website that allows members of the public to raise money for causes noticed a cluster of fundraisers for Flint cropping up organically, so the California-based company decided to help those efforts along.\n\nThe organization created a landing page for the 99 fundraising campaigns that had raised almost $365,000 from more than 8,700 donors as of Friday night. GoFundMe also launched a contest to add $10,000 to the campaign that raised the most by Friday night.\n\nThe fundraising includes many smaller donations from ordinary citizens. If these mechanics are reminiscent of President Obama's first campaign, there may be a reason for that; Dan Pfeiffer, vice president of communications and policy for GoFundMe, is a former senior White House advisor and worked on President Obama's campaign.\n\nThe grassroots is responding to the need because the Flint situation has struck a nerve, Pfeiffer said.\n\nYou should be able to take for granted access to clean water, Pfeiffer said. An American city where a decent number of the population lives below the poverty line being told they have to buy bottled water and they can't afford it, people understand the inherent unfairness of that.\n\nChicago firefighter Eric Washington, one of the GoFundMe fundraisers, decided to launch a campaign after seeing the image of the little boy on the Time cover. Washington, the father of an 11-year-old boy, said the picture tugged at him. He reached his fundraising goal of $20,000 Friday night.\n\nThis is my first time planning anything like this as far as being a humanitarian is concerned, Washington, 33, said. This is my first time reaching out to people on a large scale.\n\nLos Angeles podcasters Kennelia Stradwick, Sofia Stanley and Emile Ennis, hosts and creators of the Happy Hour Podcast, decided to launch a fundraising campaign after Stradwick, a native of Flint, filled in listeners on the dire nature of the situation in her hometown.\n\nI think it's horrible, and that's an understatement, Stradwick said. It affects every single person and, on a deeper level, it affects their family members. I have to make sure my family is OK every day, see how my cousins are doing … It's a domino effect.\n\nThe podcasters' campaign initially aimed to raise $500, but now that they have raised twice that amount, they are reconsidering how far they want to take their efforts, they said.\n\nBack in Syracuse and Buffalo, campaign organizers had enlisted retired NBA player Derrick Coleman, who grew up in Detroit and graduated from Syracuse University, to help hand out water in Flint, Jaime said. Something about the Flint situation has touched people.\n\nWe've got people from all over dropping off water at the church, Jaime said. Last Saturday, a couple of people from the community came by and just wrote checks. A couple of people donated pallets of water. I think people really identified with it.\n\nEPA: Lead levels in Flint water exceed filters� ability
PHILADELPHIA – Philadelphia Eagles fans sought to distance themselves from violent scenes that reportedly took place in the Lincoln Financial Field parking lot leading up to Sunday's NFC Championship game between their team and the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIn the hours leading up to the evening kickoff, NJ.com reported that riot police had been called to break up a bloody skirmish between Eagles supporters and police officers. Video of the incident showed one man bleeding from the face. According to the report, six officers on horseback plus several state troopers were ordered to the scene to break things up. It also said that no Vikings fans were involved.\n\nIt breaks my heart a little bit, Shellie Hancock, of South Philadelphia, told USA TODAY Sports. More than 99% of the people here are just here to cheer for the team and want to see us win. But it is a few people who act stupid who will get the attention. Hancock saw video relating to the incident on social media but did not witness any trouble on her way to the stadium.\n\nIt is just a shame, lifelong Eagles fan Don Hackett, 65, added. Everyone is in high spirits, but it just gives us and the city a bad name.\n\nRepeated telephone calls to the media relations office at Philadelphia's police department went unanswered.\n\nMore:Tom Brady rescues Patriots with masterful rally past Jaguars\n\nMore:Tom Brady, Patriots fooled us again on way to another Super Bowl\n\nDennis Wilson, Philadelphia's deputy commissioner, told 6abc.com earlier in the week that his force would operate with a policy of low tolerance in relationship to any aggressive behavior.\n\nIt is pretty simple, Wilson said. You don't want to hurt other people, damage property and you don't want to get yourself hurt.\n\nWhile the crowd inside the stadium was naturally overwhelmingly in favor of the Eagles, there was still a hardy band of Vikings supporters who had trekked from Minnesota. Philadelphia Airport was filled with purple-and-gold clad fans from early Sunday, and by lunchtime, a group had descended upon the city's iconic steps leading up to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and performed the team's famous Skol chant. Even the famous statue of Rocky Balboa got a makeover, being decked out in a Vikings shirt.\n\nOur season has been built on making big things happen at home, Steve Charles, 42, said, flanked by a group of three traveling friends. One more game on the road, and then we will finish it off in front of our own crowd. Minneapolis will host the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.\n\nCharles' group reported that they had endured nothing more than a few mild taunts when they walked through the throng of Eagles support on their way to the entry gates. However, other internet videos appeared to show Vikings fans having full beer cans and bottles hurled in their directions, while being issued with insulting salutes by their Philadelphia counterparts.
Paul Maslin and Joe Trippi\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nWhen the Sheraton hotel ballroom in Birmingham erupted on the night of Dec. 12 with the news that Democrat Doug Jones had upset Republican Roy Moore and won the Alabama special election for the U.S. Senate, tears of joy were falling not just there but all over America and indeed the world.\n\nComing just 13 months after the stunning presidential election of Donald Trump and weeks after a Democratic wave in Virginia, this was definitive confirmation that at this moment, in the most conservative of states, America had woken up and decided to pursue a different path.\n\nMore:Take it from voters, Dems don't want a Bernie Sanders or a blue Donald Trump\n\nMore:Republican war on Millennials looks like a suicide mission\n\nEvents and elections this year will tell that ultimate story, and whether it will hold in races without Moore and his singular problems. But for Democrats who rejoiced Wednesday as the brand new senator from Alabama was sworn in, we offer the following observations about what our candidate's victory might mean:\n\n►Run everywhere and anywhere. In order to have the chance to exploit first Moore's nomination and then his scandal, Democrats needed a credible candidate. Jones, while never having run for office before, was a successful prosecutor and respected attorney with a broad network of contacts in Alabama. We need similar people to step forward to run for office throughout the South, such as Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, the former Tennessee governor — but also in the Midwest and other supposedly Trump or Republican strongholds. The wave will reach its full power only if there are plenty of surfers who know what they are doing atop it.\n\n►Don't trim your sails. Jones is a moderate Democrat willing to work across the aisle and find common ground to get things done for Alabama and our country. However, he did not alter his support for reproductive rights, immigration or gay marriage — or downplay his role in prosecuting and convicting two of the Ku Klux Klan members who murdered four African-American girls at a Birmingham church in 1963 — to curry favor with certain constituencies. Not every Democrat will agree with every other Democrat on policy issues. We have had, and still possess, a big tent. Voters would rather you say what you mean and mean what you say than believe you are willing to sacrifice your principles in exchange for a few votes.\n\n►Common ground works as a message, even in, and perhaps especially because of, these polarized times. Jones' willingness to cross the aisle was an integral part of his message from the beginning of the campaign and became a constant in our advertising. Our polling showed that Jones won two in five voters who had favored Luther Strange (the establishment choice) in the September GOP runoff, and Jones also won independents by nearly 10 points on Election Day. The truth is that the actions of President Trump and his GOP majority in Congress have made them vulnerable to the charge that they are unwilling to compromise — thus failing to achieve any progress on health care and other key issues. In contrast with Jones' strengths, by election eve, 49% of Alabamians felt that Moore would make things worse in Washington.\n\n►We have an energized coalition that can produce electoral magic. African Americans, particularly black women, made a heroic demonstration of their political clout in Alabama: 96% favored Jones. And they punched way above their weight on turnout — exceeding their share of the overall electorate by several points while the white electorate that fueled the 2016 Trump win shrank substantially.\n\nCollege-educated white suburbanites and Millennials of all races and ethnicities helped produce the Jones victory margin as well. In each case, our campaign and various complementary groups used traditional forms of communication — television, radio and mail — as well as social media and direct voter contact in substantial volume. Campaigns must use every medium to communicate urgency to these voters.\n\nMore:Pelosi-Schumer tactics won't beat Trump. Stop cowering and hiding, Democrats\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\n►More important, groups within these communities need and deserve more support and resources to build strong and effective get-out-the-vote efforts. The groups that built those efforts in Alabama had to do so from scratch with little or no existing organization in place. What they did was nothing short of amazing.\n\nOne caution: This special election stood alone on the political calendar, with everyone focused on one campaign. That will not be the case next fall, so campaigns won't be able to count on the concentrated efforts of others. They must budget enough money to make the Democratic enthusiasm gap pay off in 2018.\n\nFinally, we would urge the next wave of Democratic candidates to set their sights as high as possible while also keeping a disciplined eye on the electoral prize. The best contenders combine a sweeping vision or campaign strategy with the resolute ability to stay on message, come hell or high water. Think Bill Clinton 1992, Barack Obama 2008 or, for that matter, Donald Trump 2016.\n\nAnd think Doug Jones 2017. He stayed incredibly grounded, even as his campaign soared to unthinkable heights. He might have pointed the way for his nation to become Sweet Home America.\n\nPaul Maslin, a Democratic pollster, and Joe Trippi, a Democratic media consultant, were chief strategists for Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama. Follow Trippi on Twitter: @JoeTrippi
Sharon Peters\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nYou're a successful fiftysomething author and former federal prosecutor with four kids, a quite famous husband (novelist Michael Chabon), and raging mood swings that therapy and the usual pharmaceuticals no longer blunt. What do you do?\n\nWhat Ayelet Waldman did was break the law and secretly consume minuscule doses of LSD every third day for a month, monitoring and recording the changes in her moods, relationships and productivity.\n\nA Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference In My Mood, My Marriage and My Life (Knopf, 219 pp., ***½ out of four stars) is the chronicle of Waldman's short experiment with what most regard as a dangerous mind-bending psychedelic. She, on the other hand, asserts that the tiny doses she consumed amounted mostly to a sip of serenity, or something close to it.\n\nRelentlessly honest and surprisingly funny (in parts), the book is also an energetically researched history of this drug (which until it was criminalized in the 1960s was regarded by many researchers and counselors as a helpful tool in addressing several forms of mental illness).\n\nWaldman's underlying bias — that LSD was and is safe and effective in therapeutic settings and hasn't been all that risky when used recreationally, either — might challenge mainstream thinking. But she produces some very decent data and arguments. It's worth noting that she taught a course on the War on Drugs at UC Berkeley School of Law, so she knows where the good stuff about drugs and policy and vested interest is buried.\n\nIn modified diary form, Waldman details her use of and reactions to LSD microdoses (two drops, about one-tenth of a typical recreational dose), branching off for sweeping forays into drug history, drug law and some of the most private corners of her life. She was motivated by a lifetime held hostage by the vagaries of mood, and writes that at the worst times she's beset with self-loathing, and knotted with guilt and shame….overtaken by a pervasive sense of hopelessness.\n\nOnce she embarked on this experiment, she experienced the probably predictable moments of fretting over whether she would have to be resuscitated by EMTs and worrying about how wretchedly irresponsible she was, what with all those children counting on her.\n\nAlthough hers was a journey few will take, A Really Good Day reads almost like an Everywoman's experience, because Waldman's fears and reactions are so commonplace. She is so likable in her flaws and her determination that it's a relief to learn that the microdoses (or possibly her therapy sessions or maybe even a placebo effect, she acknowledges) allowed enough of a head shift that her life has become easier, lighter.\n\nShe had the courage, the credentials and the insight to make this journey and tell us about it. They all add up to a fine read.\n\n—————\n\nSharon Peters is author of Trusting Calvin: How A Dog Helped Heal A Holocaust Survivor's Heart.
RODNEY BAY, St. Lucia — Jenna Furger is having a Pirates of the Caribbean moment.\n\nThe 25-year-old alumni association staffer from Madison, Wis. is standing near the wheel of the world's largest full-rigged sailing ship, Royal Clipper, watching as more than a dozen deck hands scramble across its teak deck to set the sails.\n\nLike in a scene out of one of the Pirates movies, officers barks out orders as the crew pulls on thick ropes connected to massive sheets of sailcloth. Soon the first of a dozen triangular staysails lining the middle of the vessel begins to unfurl. Then another one opens up. And another. Moments later the giant rectangular mainsails begin to come down, and the massive Star Clippers ship — four decks high and 439 feet long — catches the wind.\n\nIt's a dramatic beginning to the ship's departure from St. Lucia, made all the moreso by the blasting of the triumphant theme song from the movie 1492: Conquest of Paradise across the deck from loudspeakers.\n\nRELATED: Sailing to French Polynesia on a Windstar ship\n\n\n\nIt feels like I'm on a real pirate ship, says Furger, one of dozens of passengers out on deck to take in the spectacle as Royal Clipper sets off for nearby Guadeloupe. I'm just waiting for Johnny Depp to walk up.\n\nIn a cruise industry increasingly dominated by floating mega-resorts that carry thousands of vacationers and are chock full of gee-whiz attractions, Royal Clipper is an anomaly — and a throwback to a bygone era.\n\nCarrying just 227 passengers, it's a true clipper ship of the sort that famously sped across the world's oceans in the 1800s. But it's no relic of the grand age of sail. While it's modeled on an iconic sailing vessel of old, the Preussen, it was built just 17 years ago and features such modern comforts as cabins with marble-lined bathrooms, a spa and three deck-top pools.\n\nBy far the biggest of Star Clippers' three ships (the other two are nearly 80 feet shorter and carry just 170 passengers a piece), Royal Clipper offers a taste of what crossing the world's oceans was like before the arrival of propeller-driven vessels.\n\nIn the place of such mega-ship attractions as theater shows and deck-top water parks, Royal Clipper boasts such allures as lounging in the bowsprit nets that jut out from its sleek bow. Climbing the ship's soaring masts is another draw.\n\nIf you don't look down, you're fine, quips Tony Carlson, 60, of Ottowa, Canada, after scrambling up a 65-foot rope ladder to the crow's nest on one of Royal Clipper's forward masts.\n\nWearing a ship-provided harness that's tied into a safety line, Carlson gazes across Royal Clipper's elaborate rigging, which contains 56,000 square feet of sails spreading out from five masts. There are 42 sails in all.\n\nIt's as fantastic as I thought it would be, he says.\n\nLater in the cruise, Carlson and other passengers will have the chance to help hoist the sails. They also can pop into the bridge to talk sailing with ship officers. The bridge has an open-door policy.\n\nStill, the experience is about more than the novelty of traveling on a cruise vessel powered by the wind. Just as notable: Royal Clipper's relatively small size as compared to modern mega-ships allows it to access destinations that often are off limits to bigger vessels.\n\nOn this seven-night Caribbean voyage out of Barbados, Royal Clipper anchors off such off-the-beaten-path hideaways as Terre-de-Haut, a tiny French island with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants that's part of the Iles des Saintes archipelago. Tendering to shore on small launches, passengers wander the island's single, picturesque village or strike out down the trail to its hilltop fort, named after Napoleon.\n\nOther stops include one of the beach-lined coves of Les Anses-d'Arlet, a fishing village along the southwest coast of Martinique that sometimes goes months without a ship visit, and the picture-perfect yachting haven of Falmouth Harbor along the south coast of Antigua. Located near historic Nelson's Dockyard, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the latter is far from Antigua's more touristy main cruise hub in northerly St. John's.\n\nAs compared to cruises on mega-ships, a sailing on Royal Clipper is much more of a laid back affair. At many of the stops on this itinerary, the vessel offers just a handful of shore excursions. At two of the six destinations on the trip, there are no excursions at all.\n\nIndeed, a Caribbean sailing on Royal Clipper has more in common with a yachting trip than a traditional cruise. Sailing overnight from island to island, the ship anchors during the day in scenic coves and harbors where the main attraction is basking in the warm Caribbean sun, either on Royal Clipper's top deck or along the nearby shore.\n\nOften the ship offers a tender operation to a nearby beach, where its sports team sets up for the day with paddle boards, kayaks and other water toys available at no extra charge. One day even brings a beach barbecue. Royal Clipper also has a built-in marina at its stern that opens up while the ship is at anchor, offering passengers the chance to swim and kayak directly from the vessel. Passengers also can take out the ship's small sailboat.\n\nOn board, the diversions are limited. Entertainment consists of the occasional after-dinner talent or fashion show (with passengers encouraged to take part). One night a steel drum band comes aboard to play the outdoor Tropical Bar. But for the most part, passengers are left to make their own fun.\n\nThis isn't a cruise for the kind of people who need a lot of (on-board) entertainment like Broadway shows, says Larry Kleiman, 77, of Montreal.\n\nSpeaking moments after snorkeling on his own just off a Terre-de-Haut beach, Kleiman notes Royal Clipper is full of people who seem to prefer less-programmed vacationing. We'd rather be doing this.\n\nLike Kleiman, who owned a 30-foot sailboat for years, many Royal Clipper passengers are longtime sailing fans who know the difference between a jigger staysail and a lower-mizzen topsail. But demographically, the on-board crowd is a diverse lot. A bit over a third of passengers on this voyage (50 out of 136) are Americans, but there also are significant numbers of German, French and British travelers on board as well as a handful of Italians, Swiss, Austrians, South Koreans and New Zealanders. Announcements are made in three languages: English, German and French.\n\nThe diversity is part of the appeal, says Carol Donnelly, a 61-year-old psychology professor from Chicago who has sailed with Star Clippers twice before. But there's no getting around the main attraction of the ship: Its soaring sails and the wind-in-your-hair, slicing-through-the-waves cruise experience that they allow.\n\nThere is something about authentically sailing that makes this very special, Donnelly says, pausing to talk at a private reception for repeat passengers. I can't think of another type of vacation that I would rather be doing.\n\nIf you go ...\n\nRoyal Clipper sails out of Barbados from November through March. A seven-night Windward Islands itinerary features calls at St. Lucia, Dominica, Antigua, St. Kitts, Iles des Saintes and Martinique. Also available is a seven-night Grenadine Islands itinerary that offers stops at Grenadine, Grenada, Tobago Cays, St. Vincent, Martinique and St. Lucia. Fares for both routes start at $2,200 per person, based on double occupancy.\n\nA smaller Star Clippers vessel, Star Flyer, also sails in the Caribbean during winters. It operates cruises between Havana and Cienfuegos, Cuba that include stops in Cuba and the Cayman Islands. It also sails to the Leeward Islands out of St. Maarten.\n\nDuring summers, both Royal Clipper and Star Flyer move to the Mediterranean for a range of three- to 17-night trips. A third Star Clippers ship, Star Clipper, sails year-round in Asia. Information: 800-442-0551; starclippers.com.\n\nUSA TODAY Cruises: The 25 most beautiful cruise vessels in the world
AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Aiming to fill out their bullpen, the New York Mets are set to bring back a pair of important pieces from last year's playoff team.\n\nFree-agent relievers Jerry Blevins and Fernando Salas have agreed to contract terms with the Mets, according to a person with knowledge of the deals. The person spoke Friday night on condition of anonymity because the agreements were pending physicals and had not been announced.\n\nThe person also confirmed that New York has signed veteran left-hander Tom Gorzelanny to a minor league contract with an invitation to big league camp at spring training.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported the deals earlier Friday.\n\nBlevins and Salas both pitched in prominent roles for the Mets last year and helped them reach the National League wild-card game, which they lost to San Francisco.\n\nWith spring training only days away, New York needs to line up some viable late-inning options for the upcoming season. All-Star closer Jeurys Familia faces a possible suspension under Major League Baseball's domestic violence policy, and four members of the projected rotation are coming off surgery.\n\nReliable setup man Addison Reed, who has plenty of closing experience, could move to the ninth inning if Familia is unavailable for any length of time. But that would also open another hole in the seventh or eighth.\n\nRe-signing Blevins and Salas could go a long way toward solving that potential problem.\n\nA proven lefty specialist, the 33-year-old Blevins went 4-2 with a 2.79 ERA and two saves in 73 appearances last year during his second season with the Mets. He struck out 52 in 42 innings.\n\nBlevins missed all but the first two weeks of the 2015 season after breaking his arm.\n\nSalas was acquired from the Los Angeles Angels in an Aug. 31 trade last year and shored up the seventh inning for New York down the stretch. The 31-year-old right-hander went 0-1 with a 2.08 ERA in 17 games with the Mets, striking out 19 and walking none in 17 1/3 innings. He was 3-7 with a 3.91 ERA in 75 games overall, and all six of his saves came with the Angels.\n\nSalas saved 24 games in 2011 for the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nGorzelanny, 34, is 50-53 with a 4.40 ERA in 12 major league seasons. He struggled in seven outings for AL champion Cleveland last season.
Adam Shell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nU.S. stocks, still searching for stability after Monday's sell-off and a rocky start to the new year, surged Tuesday as volatile oil prices climbed 6% at one point and Wall Street shrugged off another stock rout in China overnight.\n\nInvestors were encouraged by a batch of better-than expected corporate earnings reports as several companies in the Dow Jones industrial average beat estimates, including 3M (MMM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG).\n\nThe Dow ended up 282 points, or 1.8%, its best one-day point-gain since Dec. 4. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 1.4% and the Nasdaq composite was 1.1% higher.\n\nStocks also got a lift from some solid economic data, with November home prices up 0.9% in November, topping forecasts, according to S&P Case Shiller. January consumer confidence also topped expectations, hitting a level of 98.1, above December's reading of 96.3. The strong reading on consumer confidence suggests consumers have not been totally freaked out by the financial markets' wild gyrations in 2016.\n\nHome prices up in Nov.; 4 cities at all-time highs\n\nPhil Orlando, chief investment strategist at Federated Investors, says the rally has been fueled by the rebound in oil prices, solid earnings and good economic data. But he believes the big reason for the rally is that Wall Street is betting that the Federal Reserve will signal Wednesday at the end of its two-day policy meeting that it may have to dial back its plans for four interest rate hikes this year due to market and economic volatility to kick off 2016.\n\nOrlando expects Fed chair Janet Yellen to use the policy statement to reset market expectations for fewer coming rate hikes this year.\n\nWe believe a March rate hike is off table and that the Fed will take a more cautious, dovish and data-dependent approach to its rate-hike cycle over the course of the year, Orlando told USA TODAY.\n\nThe turbulent year for stocks continues amid a jittery trading environment in which stock movements are increasingly tied to the direction of oil prices, the global economic outlook in the face of slowing growth in China and uncertainty over interest rate policy at home.\n\nU.S.-produced crude rebounded Tuesday and was up 6% to $32.23 a barrel in afternoon trading. Oil, which rallied sharply late last week, relapsed Monday, tumbling more than 5%.\n\nInvestors were again digesting a big market sell-off in mainland China, where the Shanghai composite fell 6.4% to its lowest level since December 2014.\n\nWall Street is also eagerly awaiting the policy statement on interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET at the end of the Fed's two-day January meeting. Investors will be closely looking for any clues that the Fed might suggest the U.S. central bank will be less aggressive on interest rate hikes this year than originally planned due to the persistent volatility in the energy and stock markets around the globe.\n\nWhen the Fed hiked short-term rates a quarter-point in December for the first time in nearly a decade, it forecast four more quarter-point moves this year. But Wall Street is pricing in one at the moment.\n\nThe fourth-quarter 2015 earnings season rolls on today, with Apple, the world's most-valuable company reporting results after the bell.\n\nResults before the opening bell were relatively solid, and included an earnings-per-share beats from drug giant Johnson & Johnson and consumer products maker Procter & Gamble. J&J shares were up 3.8% to $1100.02 and P&G shares up 2.4% to $78.70.\n\nIn Europe, stocks were off their earlier lows and closed higher. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 finished up 0.8%, the German DAX rallied 0.9% and the CAC 40 in Paris finished up 1.1%.
Anne D'Innocenzio\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nShopping for jewelry for a loved one ahead of Valentine's Day can be stressful. But learning some tricks should help anyone have an easier time finding the perfect gift. That means understanding a partner's tastes, shopping at reputable jewelry stores and learning what the wording means in terms of how gemstones are graded.\n\nAnd there's plenty of opportunities to haggle for the best price.\n\nIt is a big time to buy jewelry, says Amanda Gizzi, a spokeswoman at the Jewelers of America, a trade association with more than 8,000 retail members. There are some wonderful sales to be had. Look for the best pieces for your budget, but don't be dazzled by the discounts.\n\nAbove all, start researching with time to spare, figure out how much you want to spend, and shop to take advantage of post-holiday sales or limited-time Valentine's Day deals.\n\nThe median price for a piece of jewelry is $350, excluding engagement rings and wedding bands, the trade group says. But there's a wide range of jewelry sellers from Target to Tiffany. At Wal-Mart's Sam's Club, which says its jewelry is priced at a 25 to 40 percent discount over other jewelry retailers, Valentine's deals run from Jan. 25 to the holiday. Macy's jewelry sale, which includes 60 percent off 14-carat and 18-carat gold jewelry, starts Jan. 29 and ends Feb. 9.\n\nYou really do need to shop early if you are budget-minded, said Benjamin Glaser, features editor at DealNews.com, an online deal comparison site.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nKNOW YOUR LOVED ONE'S TASTE\n\nLook at what your partner is wearing and what's in the jewelry box. If your special someone likes small earrings, don't get big hoops. And if that person is active, don't buy rings with high settings, says Gizzi. Among the trends this year: updated classics like hoop earrings with diamond chips, or layering rings or bracelets. If you plan to buy diamonds, see if there's a way — subtly! — to find out if your partner would rather sacrifice size over quality or vice versa.\n\nDO RESEARCH AND LEARN THE LINGO\n\nCheck out sites like Jewelers of America and online retail sites like Blue Nile for help understanding key terms like what clarity means when you are talking about diamonds, or want to know more about how gemstones are graded. Bluenile.com, which has also begun opening in-person showrooms, offers tools to compare prices from 150,000 independently graded diamonds.\n\nTAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST FRAUD\n\nFirst, be cautious about a store always offering discounts of more than 50 percent. Consumers may find the discount price is actually the average retail price elsewhere, says the Jewelers of America. Buy from a trusted retailer. Ask friends for recommendations, or go to websites like the American Gem Society, which lets you search for reputable jewelry stores by ZIP code.\n\nAs for diamonds, consumers should insist a stone be accompanied by an independent grading report from a respected lab like the Gemological Institute of America, says Josh Holland, Blue Nile's director of brand experience.\n\nAlso, check out the return policy and find out whether you'd get your money back or would have to exchange an item for credit. And haggle — it's a common practice in the jewelry business, Glaser says.\n\nCONSIDER SYNTHETIC DIAMONDS\n\nIf you want something sparkly but want to avoid gems from conflict zones, synthetic or man-made diamonds are about 20 percent to 40 percent less expensive, according to DealNews. Produced in a laboratory, they are chemically the same as mined diamonds, as opposed to simulated diamonds, which are usually cubic zirconia or moissanite. Pure Grown Diamonds, the world's largest distributor of them, has a directory on its website of stores by ZIP code that offer lab-grown diamonds. While a gemologist wouldn't be able to tell the difference between mined and synthetic diamonds, a jeweler needs to tell buyers the origin.\n\nBE CREATIVE\n\nNot interested in spending a lot but still want good quality? Consider estate sales. Or if you think your partner would want to try out pieces for a while, there's a rental jewelry subscription service called Rocksbox.com. It allows shoppers to get three items per month based on their tastes, delivered to their doors. Rocksbox.com offers memberships of three months, six months and 12 months with a gift card that can be applied to a purchase. For example, a three-month gift membership plus a $10 gift card is $49. The retail price on the jewelry ranges from $50 to $150 and includes such designers as Kate Spade and Rebecca Minkoff.\n\nFollow Anne D'Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio
Ever dreamed of going on dates around the world, free of charge? Bumble is making that a nine-month-long reality for two lucky women this year.\n\nBrigette Muller and Juliana Jules Broste will be the company's first global connector bees.\n\nIn addition to going on dates around the world, they'll be in search of friendship and business connections – all the while documenting the experiences for Bumble through videos, blog posts and social media.\n\nMuller and Broste will visit designated locations together all over the world for about two weeks at a time, from Canada to Japan. In addition to free travel, they will also receive a salary (the company didn't say how much).\n\nThey'll showcase their lives while using Bumble. Following the Singapore launch of Bumble Bizz (the app's networking option), both women will travel to countries such as Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Germany, Mexico, United Kingdom, United States, Japan and more.\n\nWhat is Bumble and why this venture?\n\nBumble is a women-first social network and has 80 million users worldwide. Users can choose between three different modes: Bumble Date (for dating), Bumble BFF (for friendship) and Bumble Bizz (for networking). In opposite sex match-ups on Bumble, women must be the ones to initiate conversation.\n\nSo why go global this way with a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity? Chelsea Maclin, vice president of marketing at Bumble, tells USA TODAY that it's important for us to advance our on-the-ground research about dating culture worldwide so we can gear our product offerings toward new communities and future generations.\n\nMeet Bumble's global connector bees\n\nThe positions opened to Bumble users in summer 2019, and thousands of people applied before the June 14 deadline.\n\nMuller came up with an idea to create a travel dating show and wanted to partner with a dating app to do it. Then, eight months ago, she got a text message from a friend with a link to Bumble's new venture. Her plans changed: As soon as I saw the headline I was like, 'No, this is what I want to do,' Muller tells USA TODAY.\n\nBroste thought she'd be amazing at telling stories and traveling – and since she'd been neglecting dating, she thought she could kill two birds with one stone (as well as make friends and business connections).\n\nThe application process involved many steps: Everything from applying within the app to sending a resume to creating and sharing a video talking about Bumble and using all three app modes. Next came a phone interview and then a visit to Austin, where the company is headquartered.\n\nIt was originally supposed to be one job, but Maclin said in a statement that Bumble knew it had to hire both women after meeting them (the two will be traveling together). We felt that it was important to have two people who can speak to their individual experiences of making connections and cultivating their own relationships across cultures, all while traveling together, she added in the statement.\n\nMaclin tells USA TODAY that the finalists were made up of all genders and sexual orientations.\n\nJuliana and Brigette are real, authentic and genuine users of Bumble, Maclin says. They aren't 'influencers' in the sense that they don't have millions of social media followers or have a ton of brand sponsorships. When we were looking at the global connector bee applications, we really focused on choosing someone who the members of our community could relate to.\n\nMuller, 32, of New York was most recently a social media specialist at Etsy. She's been a content creator for almost a decade and has nearly 24,000 followers on Instagram. Broste, 36, is a video journalist who's worked with the Travel Channel, Lonely Planet and more, and has about 4,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nWait, they'll actually date across the world?\n\nYes. In addition to Canada and Japan, the women will head to Australia, Indonesia, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom and U.S., among others, plus Singapore.\n\nThe company partnered with the Singapore Tourism Board to start the program there; Bumble is also launching its Bizz option in the country. Muller and Broste arrive on Tuesday.\n\nWe're excited to welcome Bumble's Global Connector Bees as they start their worldwide journey in Singapore and invite them to discover all the possibilities Singapore has to offer – from our rich culture, vibrant culinary and nightlife scene, and warm hospitality of our people, Rachel Loh, regional director, Americas for the tourism board said in a statement.\n\nIs this job really about dating?\n\nYes and no.\n\nMuller is well-versed in the dating app world and is ultimately looking for a relationship. But that doesn't mean that's all she's looking for (though she is excited to date people in different countries). She wants to live her life and grow, too. I feel like one week of travel is like six months worth of living somewhere else.\n\nShe doesn't consider this her own personal dating reality show, either. I'm not viewing this as a dating reality show, it's more just like, this is my life and I get to document it, she says. We all know that reality shows aren't totally real. (Tell that to The Bachelor contestants.)\n\nBroste is relatively new to dating apps, but is single and ready to mingle.\n\nAre they nervous about dating abroad?\n\nYes, but not about what you might think. While Muller and Broste will get breaks in between traveling, they're concerned about the physical toll it will take.\n\nMuller wants to make sure her body has everything it needs to function at maximum capacity. Broste is scared of not sleeping enough. You gotta charge those batteries, you know? she says.\n\nAre either nervous about going on dates in foreign countries? Both were quick to highlight Bumble's safety features as something that alleviates their worries. According to its website, the app (like others of its kind) has block and report features for users to signal red flags, for example.\n\nMaclin says: We have a zero-tolerance policy toward racist, hateful language and have partnered with the Anti-Defamation League to ensure that hate speech is banned from our platform. Those who encounter harassment of any kind are encouraged to use our robust blocking and reporting system.\n\nAs any solo female traveler knows, you want to have some plans in place so that you're always safe, Broste added.\n\nMuller is happy Broste – who she didn't meet until last week, though they're becoming fast friends – will be by her side, too.\n\nBoth are open to the idea of making one of the destinations permanent if they find love.\n\nHell yeah, Muller says. If you find love, you find love.\n\nWill they find love in the hopeless place that is modern dating? We'll have to watch.
President Donald Trump reacted sharply to a New York Times report published Friday that said after he fired FBI Director James Comey, the bureau began to investigate whether Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow's influence.\n\nAre you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President? Fox News host – and vocal Trump supporter – Jeanine Pirro asked Trump during a phone interview Saturday night.\n\nI think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked, Trump replied. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing.\n\nThe article said, No evidence has emerged publicly that Mr. Trump was secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials. But Trump felt the Times' headline was unfair and attacked the disaster of a newspaper, which is a frequent target of his criticisms.\n\nReport:President Trump went to 'extraordinary lengths' to hide details of Putin meetings\n\nMore:Trump blasts Comey as 'total sleaze' in response to FBI probe reports\n\nIt was a great insult, Trump said of the Times article.It's a very horrible thing they said, and they've gone so far that people that weren't necessarily believers are now big believers because they said that was a step too far.\n\nThe Times reported that FBI officials first became suspicious of Trump's relationship with Russia during the 2016 campaign but did not initially act, in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude.\n\nBut the president's activities before and after Mr. Comey's firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the Times said, citing unnamed law enforcement officials.\n\nSeveral critics noted that for all his outrage at the report, the president never answered no when Pirro asked if he was working for Russia.\n\nThree White House aides told The Associated Press that they wished the president had more clearly and forcefully denied being a Russian agent when Pirro asked him.\n\nTrump asserted that I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else – probably any other president period, citing increased U.S. oil production, which is, obviously, not great for them, because that's where they get their money for the most part. But many other things.\n\nWhile Trump and his supporters tend to see the report as confirmation of a strong anti-Trump bias within elements of the FBI, Democrats say it shows how deep the concerns about the president's Russian ties run. They assert it underscores the importance of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise argued Trump's foreign policy record belies theories he is doing the bidding of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPresident Trump has taken more steps to stand up against Russia than anybody we've seen in a long time, the Louisiana Republican said Sunday on ABC's This Week. You've seen time and time again with sanctions, with other things, President Trump standing up against Russia.\n\nLook at what he's done with the Ukraine. Russia was running through Ukraine when Barack Obama was president, and Trump approved the sale of tank-busting missiles, which Obama had denied, Scalise said.\n\nScalise echoed the president's claim that he was a victim of a witch hunt.\n\nThey've put no facts on the table to show there's collusion, he said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation that the notion that President Trump is a threat to American national security is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nBut Democrats said there were many reasons to be concerned about Trump's behavior toward Russia.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, the ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, pointed to Trump's behavior during the campaign when you had Vladimir Putin policies almost being parroted by Donald Trump.\n\nYou had Trump say only nice things about Putin. He never spoke ill about Russia. The Republican campaign doctrines softened on Russia and decreased their willingness to defend Ukraine, the Virginia Democrat said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union.\n\nI think we all remember when Trump, in his bluster, basically said to the Russians, if you have got more emails, bring them on, he said. These are not actions of a traditional president of the United States.\n\nThe Virginia Democrat also cited a July 2018 meeting in Helsinki between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he called a frankly, pathetic, embarrassing encounter where Trump was kowtowing on the world stage.\n\nWarner added that he was troubled by the news that Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort shared polling data with a Russian agent and that Trump wants to lift sanctions on a Russian oligarch who is close to Putin.\n\nWhy is he so chummy with Vladimir Putin? asked Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. This man, who is a former KGB agent, never been a friend to the United States, invaded our allies, threatens us around the world, and tries his damnedest to undermine our elections, why is this President Trump's best buddy? I don't get it.\n\nDurbin and Warner both pointed to a Washington Post report that Trump tried to conceal details from his meetings with Putin.\n\nWhen he takes the interpreters' notes and wants to destroy them so no one can see what was said in written transcript, you know it raises serious questions about the relationship between this president and Putin, Durbin said.
WASHINGTON – The $20 million that have been donated to a GoFundMe page to help fund President Donald Trump's wall along the southern border are going to be refunded.\n\nAir Force veteran Brian Kolfage Jr., who started the campaign, announced on Friday he had formed a non-profit in Florida to receive money from GoFundMe contributions to build the wall himself with a team of officials without the help of the federal government.\n\nWe are better equipped than our own government to use the donated funds to build an actual wall on the southern border, Kolfage Jr. said in his announcement of the new plan. Our highly experienced team is highly confident that we can complete significant segments of the wall in less time, and for far less money, than the federal government, while meeting or exceeding all required regulatory, engineering, and environmental specifications.\n\nBut GoFundMe said due to a change in where the money would actually be going, from the federal government to a non-profit, the $20 million will be returned to the more than 337,000 who donated.\n\nThis means all donors will receive a refund, said Bobby Whithorne, a spokesman for GoFundMe. If a donor does not want a refund, and they want their donation to go to the new organization, they must proactively elect to redirect their donation to that organization. If they do not take that step, they will automatically receive a full refund.\n\nKolfage Jr. directed those who donated to a page where they can tell GoFundMe they're OK with their donation being given to his non-profit. Those people have 90 days to take action, he says, before donations will be returned.\n\nHe also announced a board of directors for his new non-profit organization, titled We Build the Wall, Inc.\n\nThose working on the project include Kris Kobach, who just lost a bid for Kansas governor, and David Clarke, a former Milwaukee County Sheriff and fierce supporter of Trump's immigration policy who works at a pro-Donald Trump super PAC.\n\nAs part of the rationale to refund money, GoFundMe cited Kolfage Jr.'s original statements on the campaign page when it was started, saying that 100% of your donations will go to the Trump Wall. If for ANY reason we don't reach our goal we will refund your donation. The campaign has a $1 billion goal listed on its page.\n\nMore:A GoFundMe campaign wants to raise money for a border wall. But it isn't that simple\n\nMore:Trump administration says 'walls work.' Here's what a full view of the border shows\n\nMore:Is Trump's border wall being built? Here are the facts\n\nKolfage Jr., in announcing the changes, said it was clear that the federal government won't be able to accept our donations anytime soon. When the campaign was started, Kolfage Jr. noted he was working with lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow funds raised in the campaign to go specifically to funding a border wall.\n\nBut construction of a wall is at the heart of a contentious disagreement between parties that has been at the center of the partial government shutdown that's now in its 21st day.\n\nHomeland Security, along with other government agencies, can't simply accept money without the explicit approval of Congress. In its policy, the agency cites a federal law that states gifts may not be accepted, used, or disposed of unless specifically permitted by Congress.\n\nMuch of the policy is wrapped around ethical concerns and aims to halt outside money from swaying the agency's decisions.
The College Football Playoff finale between Alabama and Ohio State featured two of the most decorated programs in the sport. So just how many national titles has each program won? Well, as the kids say nowadays, it's complicated.\n\nThe playoff in its current format is only seven years old, of course. An Alabama win is its third title in the playoff era, while Ohio State has one.\n\nBefore the playoff was the Bowl Championship Series, and before that was the Bowl Coalition/Bowl Alliance that attempted, not always successfully, to match the top two teams in the postseason to create a unified champion.\n\nAll of which is a roundabout way of saying that unlike nearly every other collegiate sport, the NCAA has never administered an actual championship tournament in football's top division. For several decades, the so-called national champion was determined by the polls – and they didn't always agree. Before the advent of the AP writers' poll in 1936, determining the No. 1 team was even more subjective. It was often done retroactively using mathematical formulas or awarded by various researchers.\n\nSo while the NCAA's collection of listed champions in its record book isn't officially official, the organization does recognize 15 seasons crediting Alabama with at least a share of a national championship and eight for Ohio State before Monday's game. There was, in fact, one year when both were voted a share of the title.\n\nSince the inception of college football in 1869, there have been 188 national champions crowned. These are the 10 teams who have more than five titles to their names.\n\nHere they are by year with a note or two on each.\n\nAlabama\n\n1925 – The first of three recognized titles for the Crimson Tide under coach Wallace Wade was the school's first undefeated campaign, culminating in a 20-19 Rose Bowl victory against Washington that helped launch the career of future movie star Johnny Mack Brown.\n\n1926 – The Tide went 9-0 in the regular season for a second consecutive year, but this time their Rose Bowl meeting with Stanford ended in a 7-7 tie. Both are recognized as national champions by the NCAA.\n\n1930 – Wade's third title team again went 10-0 with a Rose Bowl victory against Washington State. Notre Dame, also 10-0 that year, is recognized as co-champ.\n\n1961 – The first of six championship seasons under the legendary Bear Bryant concluded with a 10-3 win against Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. While the Tide were voted first in the polls, the Football Writers Association of America chose Ohio State.\n\n1964 – The 10-0 Tide, led by Joe Namath, were picked first in the final AP poll but lost the Orange Bowl to Texas. The resulting controversy led the AP to begin conducting a post-bowl poll the following year.\n\n1965 – The following season the Tide went 8-1-1 in the regular season but downed Nebraska in the Orange Bowl and were voted No. 1 by the AP and FWA.\n\n1973 – For the second time, the Tide's bowl outcome led to a policy change for a major poll. This time it was the coaches who voted 11-0 Alabama No. 1 before a Sugar Bowl loss to Notre Dame. The coaches joined the AP in conducting a final vote after the bowls a year later.\n\n1978 – A 14-7 Sugar Bowl victory against top-ranked Penn State earned Alabama a share of the title along with Southern California, who had accounted for the Tide's lone loss during the regular season.\n\n1979 – The Bear didn't have to share the last of his titles with anyone as the Tide wrapped up a 12-0 run with a Sugar Bowl victory against Arkansas.\n\n1992 – The Tide's lone title under coach Gene Stallings featured a 28-21 victory against Florida in the inaugural SEC championship game followed by a 34-13 domination of top-ranked Miami in the Sugar Bowl for a 13-0 finish.\n\n2009 – Nick Saban's first of, thus far, five titles with the Tide came under the auspices of the BCS. Heisman winner Mark Ingram capped off the perfect run with a two-touchdown performance in a 37-21 triumph over Texas in the Rose Bowl.\n\n2011 – Despite not winning the SEC, a crazy final weekend of the regular season resulted in Alabama getting a rematch with LSU in the BCS championship game, where a smothering defense held the Tigers to 92 total yards in a 21-0 shutout.\n\n2012 – This time the high-powered offense quarterbacked by A.J. McCarron and featuring then-freshman receiver Amari Cooper set the tone in the BCS final, rolling to a 42-14 win against Notre Dame.\n\n2015 – Alabam'as first championship of the playoff era began with a semifinal blanking of Michigan State, followed by a 45-40 classic final against Clemson in which the Tide executed a perfect onside kickoff in the second half to gain a critical extra possession.\n\n2017 – Alabama missed the SEC championship game but made the most of their inclusion in the playoff field, downing Clemson in the semifinal then upending Georgia 26-23 in overtime in the title game in Atlanta on Tua Tagovailoa's famous hook-up with future superstar DeVonta Smith.\n\n2020 – The Crimson Tide and Saban made history with a 52-24 romp over Ohio State. Alabama won its third title in six years and its fourth in 10, while Saban tied Paul Bear Bryant with his seventh national title, his sixth while at the helm in Tuscaloosa.\n\nOhio State\n\n1942 – Fielding a team was difficult with the country fully involved in World War II, but coach Paul Brown and standout wingback Les Horvath led the Buckeyes to a 9-1 season including a 21-7 win against Michigan to claim the Big Ten title and the program's first No. 1 finish in the AP.\n\n1954 – In his fourth season helming the Buckeyes, Woody Hayes coached the Buckeyes to a 9-0 campaign and the school's second AP title with a dominant defense that forced 35 turnovers. Howard 'Hopalong' Cassady, who would win the Heisman a year later, recorded a big interception return touchdown in the win against Wisconsin. The coaches voting in the UPI poll, however, picked UCLA No. 1 in their final rankings.\n\n1957 – The Buckeyes overcame a season-opening loss to TCU to post a 9-1 record and Big Ten crown. This time it was the coaches who made OSU No. 1, as the AP voters went with Auburn.\n\n1961 – Once again, an opening date with TCU provided the only blip on the Buckeyes' slate. OSU followed that 7-7 tie against the Horned Frogs with eight wins in a row. Though the major polls had Alabama No. 1, the FWAA awarded the title to the Buckeyes. The school's faculty council voted to turn down an invitation to the Rose Bowl following the conclusion of the season.\n\n1968 – Arguably the strongest of Hayes's six championship teams, the undefeated 1968 group featured quarterback Rex Kern and running back Jim Otis on offense and hard-hitting linebacker Jack Tatum on the defensive side. OSU knocked Purdue from the No. 1 spot early in the season, closed with a dominant triumph over Michigan, and capped the year with a 27-16 comeback win against USC in the Rose Bowl.\n\n1970 – The 1970 Buckeyes posted a 9-0 regular-season mark en route to another Big Ten title. The Buckeyes were voted No. 1 by the National Football Foundation in its final rankings, but OSU lost to Stanford in the Rose Bowl as other polls awarded the national championship to Nebraska and Texas.\n\n2002 – Perhaps the most improbable of the Buckeyes' eight titles, second-year coach Jim Tressel led OSU to a series of close calls through an undefeated Big Ten run and a Fiesta Bowl date with Miami for the BCS championship. Aided by a pass interference call in the first overtime that still has Hurricanes' fans seething, the Buckeyes survived 31-24 in double-OT.\n\n2014 – Urban Meyer's third season in Columbus began inauspiciously with a week two loss to Virginia Tech. But the Buckeyes rebounded to run through the Big Ten and entered the inaugural College Football Playoff as the No. 4 seed. A huge game from Ezekiel Elliott, including a back-breaking 85-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter, helped the Buckeyes past No. 1 Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl semifinal. A 42-20 win against Oregon and Heisman winner Marcus Mariota capped the program's eighth championship.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports colleges reporter Eddie Timanus on Twitter @EddieTimanus
AP\n\nGENEVA (AP) — Elite European soccer clubs will get even richer than rivals by cashing in on their global brands, UEFA has warned as it studies ways to help make the Champions League more competitive.\n\nA group of 12 clubs is best placed to attract sponsors and commercial deals that are driving up income faster than domestic broadcasting rights and UEFA prize money, according to the European soccer body's analysis of 681 clubs' accounts in the 2016 financial year.\n\nUEFA must remain vigilant and true to our values as top clubs' income grows fastest, President Aleksander Ceferin wrote in an introduction to the 126-page document that detailed another boom year for European soccer.\n\nAs the guardians of the game, UEFA must ensure that football remains competitive even as financial gaps are augmented by globalization and technological change, said Ceferin, who has stated his aim to keep a competitive balance on the field.\n\nThe annual UEFA research was released Tuesday, six weeks before Ceferin could expand on policy ideas to increase fairness when he addresses member federations at their congress in Slovakia.\n\nSalary caps, luxury tax and enforced squad limits have previously been raised by the UEFA leader, who has called on European lawmakers to look at waiving some business competition laws to help the sport.\n\nRestricting agent fees, clubs loaning out players, and owners having stakes in multiple clubs are also options put up for debate by Ceferin.\n\nThe UEFA research confirmed a rising trend for European clubs to see total income grow on average 10 percent year-on-year through a troubled decade for the world economy.\n\nA total of 48 clubs had income of at least 100 million euros ($122 million) in 2016 — topped by Manchester United's 689 million euros ($845 million).\n\nThe top 30 clubs — down to Aston Villa in 30th place — earned a combined 9.1 billion euros ($11.16 billion) in the last financial year, almost matching the other 651 clubs combined.\n\nStill, UEFA suggests just 12 of the most global clubs are in a different financial class.\n\nOnly the largest clubs have the scope to take full advantage of the increasing international media profiles of the top leagues, the report said.\n\nThe wealthy dozen have raised their income from sponsorship deals and commercial activities by 1.58 billion euros ($1.94 billion) since 2010. All other European top-tier clubs combined for a 700 million euros ($858 million) increase, UEFA said.\n\nUEFA has compiled the annual study since 2009 when it launched the Financial Fair Play project to monitor, regulate and sanction clubs for overspending on buying and paying players.\n\nParis Saint-Germain is currently under investigation after lavish spending including a world-record 222 million euros ($272 million) on buying Neymar from Barcelona.\n\nTotal net losses in 2016 of 269 million euros ($330 million) are one-sixth of the sum when FFP took effect in 2011.\n\nThough 10 clubs, including five English teams, had wage bills of more than 200 million euros ($245 million), all were below UEFA's recommended wages-to-revenue ratio of 70 percent.\n\nOther details in the report, which analyzed all aspects of clubs' business, included:\n\n(asterisk)Zenit St. Petersburg reported the largest bottom-line profit of 77 million euros ($94 million) in 2016.\n\n(asterisk)Of 96 players transferred for at least 15 million euros ($18.4 million) last summer, only four went to clubs outside the big-5 leagues. Three went to Zenit and one to Porto.\n\n(asterisk)In 32 transfers where the player cost at least 1 million euros ($1.2 million), the agent was paid a higher fee.\n\n(asterisk)Bournemouth was 20th in a league table of European clubs with highest TV revenue — 99 million euros ($121 million).\n\n(asterisk)Just 15 percent of top-tier European clubs own their stadium.\n\n(asterisk)Gambling firms are the most common shirt sponsor — 19 percent of 268 clubs across top leagues.\n\n(asterisk)Young Boys of Switzerland sold the most expensive replica shirt on any club website — the equivalent of 102 euros ($125).
Daniel B. Kline\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nAmericans seemingly have no fear of debt. We borrow to buy cars, houses, to pay for school, and, in many cases, for reasons that are a lot less justified. In fact, the average American household has $137,063 in debt, according to the Federal Reserve's latest numbers.\n\nOf course, a lot of that debt is mortgage -- a type of debt most are forced to take on if they want to own a home. Still, the average American household has $15,654 in credit card debt, $27,669 in auto loans, and $46,697 in student loans, according to a recent NerdWallet study.\n\nIt's the credit card debt that's the biggest problem for most people. It's generally the most-expensive debt anyone carries, and you can minimize what you pay by paying off what you owe faster.\n\nThe good news is that many people know they have a problem. More than half of the 1,000 people who tried to pay off debt in 2017 surveyed by CompareCards succeeded.\n\nWhat did the survey say?\n\nThe most important thing when it comes to paying off debt is making a conscious decision to do so. Well-over-half (64%) of those who made cutting their debt a goal in 2017 were able to do so by an average of $7,500. Nearly half of those surveyed (47%) made paying off debt a New Year's resolution and 60% of those surveyed admitted this was not the first time they tried to pay down what they owe.\n\nMore:3 months, 3 housing trends: Buyer prep, loan rates, taxes\n\nMore:How do you pay off all that credit-card debt?\n\nMore:Are your college loans still hanging around?\n\nHow did people do it?\n\nNot surprisingly, cutting spending was the most popular method those surveyed cited as to how they paid off debt at 61%. Getting additional work through the gig economy came in second at 20%.\n\nSeventy-five percent of people who succeeded paying off their debt developed a specific plan to pay off debt last year, according to the survey, wrote CompareCard's Kira Brecht. By comparison, just a little over half (51%) of those who tried to pay down debt but failed said they had a plan.\n\nIt's also worth noting that those working to pay down debt practiced another smart personal finance policy. The majority of them (64%) also had an emergency fund. Generally, it's recommended that your emergency fund equals six months of living expenses. That may sound excessive, but it's an important defense against adding credit card debt should there be a disruption (think job loss, illness, or unexpected household repair) in your finances.\n\nYou have to get started\n\nWhen it comes to paying off debt, intent is clearly a key part of success. It's important to make a specific declaration that you plan to cut your debt, then create a plan to put it in motion.\n\nIn many ways, it's not that different from deciding to lose weight. It's easier to do when you hold yourself accountable and have a very specific plan to make it happen.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

WASHINGTON – Unrest in Iran gives President Trump another chance to show he is the anti-Barack Obama.\n\nAs with Obama, however, Trump may also discover his ability to affect events overseas is limited at best.\n\nIn expressing support via Twitter for anti-government protests that have flared in Iran, Trump took the opportunity to criticize Obama and, in particular, a cornerstone of his predecessor's foreign policy: The Iranian nuclear agreement.\n\nThe people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime, Trump tweeted Tuesday, the morning after he returned to the White House from an end-of-the-year vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nBashing the deal the Obama administration struck with Iran in 2015, Trump went on to say that all of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their 'pockets.' The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!\n\nThe United States and its allies agreed to reduce economic sanctions on Iran as it gave up the means to make nuclear weapons as part of the deal. Yet Trump has accused the Iranians of cheating and said he may pull the U.S. from the agreement and revive some sanctions, though those actions risk alienation of allies.\n\nWhile Trump has not made final decisions on how to proceed, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, we certainly keep our options open in terms of sanctions.\n\nStressing the difference between this administration's response and the last, Sanders also said that President Trump is not going to sit by silently like President Obama did.\n\nMore:Everything you need to know about the Iran protests\n\nProtesters in Iran hit the streets for a sixth straight day Tuesday, criticizing the economy and lack of political freedoms from the Islamic leadership in Tehran. While President Hassan Rouhani called for calm, Iran security forces have arrested people and are vowing further crackdowns. At least 20 people have died and 450 people arrested in clashes between police and protesters.\n\nTrump's aggressive approach to Iran – he appeared to allude to the possibility of regime change in a New Year's Day tweet of his own – is in contrast to the more cautious comments made by Obama and his aides during their administration.\n\nAmid similar protests on Iranian streets in 2009, Obama did back demonstrators' demands for a more open society, and condemned violence perpetrated by the government. But he did so in a more low-key way, concerned that the Iran regime would accuse the United States of meddling in the country's affairs and mount an anti-American campaign to rally its supporters.\n\nIt is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be, that we respect Iranian sovereignty, Obama told reporters in 2009, adding that sometimes the United States can be a handy political football. Islamic fundamentalists did that very thing in seizing power from the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran in 1979, making Death To America a theme of their revolution.\n\nDespite Trump's strong tweets, foreign policy analysts cautioned that his potential to influence what happens in Iran is limited – just as past presidents eventually discovered.\n\nOur capacity to shape events ... is very, very limited, said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East adviser for past Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nDavid Rothkopf, a senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said Iran presents a moment in which engaged leadership by a U.S. committed to effective, forceful diplomacy is vital.\n\nAnd yet, Rothkopf added, that is tougher in the Trump era, given the gutting of the State Department and his alienation of allies through policies like the threat to bolt from the Iran deal. His tweets may be a show of support for the protesters, he added, but they also reveal the inherent and growing weakness of U.S. foreign policy at the moment.\n\nThe protests in Iran take place as Trump faces a series of decisions on the nuclear deal: The Obama-era agreement requires U.S. presidents to certify every 90 days whether or not they believe Tehran is in compliance. The next certification deadline is Jan. 11.\n\nWhile international monitors said Iran is in compliance, Trump said in mid-October he would not certify the agreement, and said he would eventually withdraw unless Congress takes steps to strengthen it. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump threatened to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran, one of several Obama foreign policies he pledged to undo.\n\nEven as the protests in Iran continue, U.S. partners in Europe and China remain much more supportive of the nuclear agreement. Some of those nations fear that Iran may well seek nuclear weapons if the U.S.-backed agreement falls apart.\n\nOne country in particular, Russia, has sent the United States a Twitter warning about Iran.\n\nCiting a statement by its Foreign Ministry, the Russian embassy in the United States sent a New Year's Day tweet that said: We express the hope that the situation in Iran won't develop under the scenario of bloodshed and violence. This is Iran's internal affair. External interference destabilizing the situation is inadmissible.\n\nRothkopf said Trump might actually lose influence if he guts the Iran nuclear deal. No one else in the international community would go along with it and the U.S. would be isolated, he said. It's possible he could have more influence were he to get involved in a shooting war in the Persian Gulf but that seems a remote and undesirable possibility at this point.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is seeking to put political pressure on the Iranian regime. On Tuesday, the State Department called on Iran to stop blocking Instagram and other social media sites.\n\nMore:Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini blames 'enemies' for meddling in protests\n\nMeanwhile in Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini has accused the country's enemies of seeking to create problems for the Islamic system, though he has not named names.\n\nAs he confronts this new challenge, other aspects of Trump's foreign policy may make it more difficult for the administration's ability to get other countries to confront Iran, analysts said.\n\nTrump has heavily criticized international agreements. He has threatened to rip up trade pacts, withdrawn from a global climate change agreement, and recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital over the objections of some allies.\n\nThe moves, Miller said, seem driven by domestic politics and the desire to demonstrate, 'I am not Obama.'\n\nThat's one reason building a coalition on the Iran front may be difficult, Miller said.\n\nAnd Iran isn't Trump's only exercise in nuclear diplomacy. He is also trying to get other countries to apply economic pressure to North Korea in hopes it will give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump himself seemed cautiously optimistic about that challenge on Tuesday. Sanctions and 'other' pressures are beginning to. have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!
Andrew Joseph\n\nThe Vikings' $1.1 billion U.S. Bank Stadium doesn't have a retractable roof, but it still has the capability to bring the open air into the stadium with massive doors at the stadium's west end.\n\nAhead of Sunday's game against the Saints, the Vikings entertained the idea of opening those doors and making the Saints uncomfortable. The forecasted high for Sunday in Minneapolis is 13 degrees with a low in the negatives.\n\nAs great as the gamesmanship would have been, the Vikings will keep the doors closed at U.S. Bank Stadium. Head coach Mike Zimmer explained why on Wednesday.\n\nI guess that's a decent point. They can't risk damaging next month's Super Bowl venue.\n\nPlus, would it have even made a difference to the Saints? Though the doors are huge, the fans in the concourses would have been the ones suffering had the doors been opened. The Vikings have to make an official announcement about the doors 90 minutes before the game, per NFL policy.\n\nIt was a fun idea, though.\n\nMORE:\n\nJerry Rice has a warning for Raiders players about Jon Gruden\n\nLane Kiffin on why it's silly to say Jalen Hurts should play another position\n\nSamantha Busch hilariously rides Kyle down a giant slide in Cabo\n\nWhy Alabama DB Minkah Fitzpatrick missed the championship-winning TD\n\n5 videos of Georgia fans completely melting down after Alabama's comeback
Christy Bieber\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nThe start of a new year is an optimum time to get your finances in order. While studies have shown that making financial resolutions actually makes a difference in your financial life, it's important to have a plan for concrete action.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start improving your finances, here are 12 things you can do this year -- one for each month of 2018.\n\nJanuary: Automate contributions to savings\n\nAccording to Vanguard's report How America Saves 2017, more Americans are contributing to 401(k)s because more companies auto-enroll workers, and many auto-enrolled workers make the default contributions set up for them. The tendency to stick to the status quo can be used to your advantage, especially if you set up automatic contributions to a retirement account and to savings accounts.\n\nTalk to your human resources or payroll department about setting up a 401(k) and contributing from each paycheck, if you have the option and aren't already doing so. If you don't have a 401(k) at work, set up an IRA with a brokerage firm and use your broker or your bank's online features to set up an automatic contribution on payday.\n\nIf you're already contributing to a 401(k) or IRA, increase your contributions. Increasing the amount you contribute by just $1,000 annually -- about $40 if you're paid biweekly -- could give you an extra $110,218 in your 401(k) by age 65, assuming you started at age 35 and earned a 7% return. Try to increase contributions over time until they reach around 15% to 20% of income -- though any amount you contribute is better than nothing.\n\nWhile you're automating contributions, set up an automatic transfer to a savings account for an emergency fund, a house fund, a vacation fund, or any other goal you're hoping to achieve. If you transfer money on payday, you won't spend it and you'll quickly adjust to living without it. You could also use an app like Acorns or Digit to transfer small amounts automatically to savings without you even thinking about it.\n\nThe key is to set up some plan so you're automatically paying yourself first, instead of trying to save what's left over at the end of the month and finding nothing left.\n\nFebruary: Create a spending plan\n\nAccording to the Willis Tower Watson 2017 Global Benefits Attitudes Survey, although budgeting and monitoring spending are closely correlated to feelings of financial security, only 35% of workers are budgeters who follow a strict spending plan. By contrast, around 44% of workers are reactive or impulsive spenders, and this group tends to live paycheck to paycheck, have credit card debt, and struggle financially.\n\nHaving a plan for where your money is going can give you peace of mind and help you use funds wisely. There are a number of approaches to creating a spending plan. You could take a simple approach by allocating 20% of your money to savings, 30% to optional spending on things like entertainment, and 50% to needs, such as housing. You could also create a detailed budget and allocate every dollar to a specific category, such as rent, utilities, savings, debt repayment, groceries, and more.\n\nWhichever approach you take, track your spending for at least 30 days to see where your money is going, and make adjustments to create a realistic spending plan that works.\n\nMore: The widow or widower's guide to Social Security benefits\n\nMore: How to lower your housing costs, whether you rent or own\n\nMore: How to save money on entertainment and still have fun\n\nMarch: Tackle your credit card issues\n\nThe average credit card debt for U.S. households is $15,654, according to a 2017 survey by Nerdwallet. If you have credit card debt, explore options for reducing your interest rate. There are balance-transfer cards offering special 0% promotional rates -- usually for around 12 to 18 months -- that you could transfer the existing balance on your credit cards to. You'll typically pay a small fee of around 3% of the transferred balance, but won't have to pay interest throughout the year.\n\nIdeally, make a plan to have the balance transfer debt paid off by the time the promotional period ends, since the rate typically goes up dramatically after the 0% interest expires. You could also consider consolidating your credit card debt using a personal loan with a lower interest rate.\n\nIf you don't have credit card debt but do use cards, make sure you're not among the 20% of people using a card that doesn't match your spending patterns. Look for a rewards credit card that gives you the most generous rewards for spending on the things you buy. Understand how the rewards work, and claim all you're owed.\n\nAnd if your card has an annual fee, call and ask to have it waived or reduced. According to a poll conducted by CreditCards.com, 82% of people who asked were successful in getting their fees either waived or lowered.\n\nApril: Get smart about your tax refund\n\nThe average individual income tax refund in 2016 was $2,795, according to the IRS. If you receive a tax refund, use the cash wisely.\n\nIf you have high-interest debt, putting your refund toward paying it off should be a top priority. If you were making $300 monthly payments on a credit card with a 15% interest rate and a $15,654 balance, using a $2,795 tax refund to pay down this card would allow you to repay the debt in 62 months instead of 86; you'd pay $4,180 less in interest.\n\nIf you're not in debt but don't have an emergency fund, start one with your tax refund. You could also put your refund into a retirement account -- with an average-sized refund, you'd be more than halfway toward maxing out an IRA -- or invest it to accomplish other goals like buying a house, or taking a course that sets you up for advancement at work.\n\nWhile there are lots of smart ways to spend a refund, you'd actually be better off if you didn't get a refund at all. Don't pay in more than you owe; instead of giving the IRS an interest-free loan, you want to keep your money available to invest or pay down debt throughout the year. Your employer withholds money based on the W-4 you filled out when you started working, so if you've been getting a big refund, change your withholding information. You may have to update this form due to tax reform anyway, so now's the optimum time to make sure you're getting your money to use when you need it.\n\nMay: Do some financial spring cleaning\n\nThe arrival of spring is a great time to not only do some spring cleaning at home, but also to get your finances in order by sorting through old paperwork, digitizing as much as possible, and disposing of items you no longer need.\n\nHaving your paperwork in order ensures you're ready in case of a tax audit. Audits can go back around seven years, so keep paperwork that supports your deductions for at least this length of time. As for credit card statements and bank statements, if they're more than a year old they can usually be thrown away.\n\nIn addition to sorting through paperwork, take steps to organize the rest of your financial life:\n\nSet up automatic bill payments, so you never have to worry about missing a big payment.\n\nClose old bank accounts or investment accounts you no longer use.\n\nRoll over 401(k)s from your old job if you're not happy with what they're invested in.\n\nMake sure the bank and savings accounts you're using aren't charging exorbitant fees, or paying less in interest than the going rate. If your accounts aren't working for you, shop around to find a different bank.\n\nJune: Institute no-spend days\n\nAccording to Gallup, the average American spends around $100 daily, not counting money spent on a home, motor vehicle, or normal household bills. Many of us spend without really thinking about it, buying a coffee before work, grabbing lunch, and picking up a few things from the grocery store on the way home. If we skipped just a few days of spending, they could make a big difference.\n\nTo stop mindless spending, try a few no-spend days over the month of June. When you commit to a no-spend day, buy nothing; make do with what you have available. No-spend days get you out of the habit of buying, and force you to find other ways to entertain yourself and solve problems. Not only will you save money during each no-spend day, but changing your mind-set could also inspire you to make long-term changes.\n\nJuly: Turn your unwanted items into cash\n\nSummer is a prime time for garage sales, but you don't have to set up shop on the curb to turn unwanted items into cash. Sites like Craigslist and eBay provide opportunities for you to get rid of things you no longer need.\n\nYou can find out what your items are worth by searching one of these sites, or visiting some consignment stores; set a goal of selling as much as you can. Use the money earned to add to your savings, or to cover the costs of a fun summer activity you'd otherwise dip into your checking account to pay for.\n\nAugust: Review your investment strategy\n\nIf you upped your investments in January, you're hopefully on your way to building a bigger nest egg. No matter how much you're investing, now's a great time to make sure your hard-earned cash is working for you.\n\nEnsure you're taking the right level of risk based on your age, as investing too conservatively could mean you're not going to earn enough, while investing too aggressively puts you at risk of losing everything. One guideline for determining how much to invest in the stock market is to subtract your age from 110. If you're 35, you'd invest 75% of your portfolio in stocks.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start, buying exchange-traded funds or mutual funds is a simple option. You can also learn how to value stock for future purchases. And you can research investment strategies such as dollar-cost averaging or value averaging to find a system that works for you.\n\nSeptember: Hack your meal planning\n\nWith September arriving and kids heading back to school, you might find yourself buying lunches for your children and yourself, and you might eat out more because you're busy. The problem is, eating out can quickly get expensive -- and it may mean the food you buy for use at home doesn't get consumed.\n\nThe average American family spent $3,154 on food away from home in 2016, and the average American tosses out $1,365 to $2,275 in wasted food every year. If you diverted half your eating-out budget and most of what you're currently wasting, you could invest somewhere around $3,000 annually -- which, if you started at 35 and invested in an IRA at 7% returns, would turn into around $283,000 by age 65.\n\nTo make sure you're smart about not wasting food, make a weekly meal plan. Schedule meals you'll eat out and meals you'll eat at home, and buy only the ingredients you need. Take leftovers for lunch the next day so they don't go to waste, and plan to dine out when it's less expensive, such as going for a late lunch instead of an expensive weekend dinner.\n\nOctober: Evaluate your insurance coverage\n\nWhen was the last time you actually looked at your coverage from your auto insurance, health insurance, or homeowner's insurance?\n\nMany people have policies that aren't working for them and don't even realize it. For example, a study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that many employees overpay for health insurance -- by as much as 24% of plan premiums -- by choosing low-deductible, high-premium plans when they don't need that kind of coverage. You may also be paying for auto insurance you don't need, such as collision coverage on a car that's now old and not worth very much.\n\nTake the time to review your policies to ensure you have the right coverage. If you have an emergency fund, for example, you may want to raise your deductibles to lower your premiums. Drop coverage you no longer require and, if your circumstances have changed, let your insurer know. If you're working from home and driving much less, you may be eligible for a discount on auto insurance.\n\nYou also want to check that you aren't underinsured. Consider an umbrella insurance policy, which kicks in if you're sued for more than a primary policy covers, especially if you have substantial assets or a high income.\n\nNovember: Spend smarter for the holidays\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, you may be considering going into debt for gifts. In fact, a Nerdwallet study of consumer holiday spending found that 56% of those who shopped during the 2016 holiday season incurred credit card debt, and many were planning to go into debt again in 2017 -- including some who hadn't yet paid off last year's bills.\n\nIdeally, you'll have been budgeting for the holidays all year, so you have money saved to fund your gift-giving. But, whether you have money set aside or not, be smarter about how you handle the holidays. Talk to your coworkers and your adult family members and friends -- perhaps you could try a Secret Santa approach, rather than buying individual presents for every person. You'll save a fortune and end up with less clutter.\n\nIf you'll be shopping for holiday gifts on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, carefully research to ensure you're actually getting good deals and not being stuck with off-brand and low-quality items. And take advantage of coupons and discount codes whenever you buy, whether online or in a store.\n\nDecember: Get your healthcare services before year's end\n\nIf you have a health plan with a deductible that ends at the close of the calendar year and you've already met your deductible, consider taking care of any medical issues now so the costs will be paid for. This could mean pushing up a physical or getting that comprehensive exam you've been waiting for.\n\nThis month may also be your last chance to spend the money you've invested in a flexible spending account (FSA), as many flexible spending accounts offered through employers require you to use money by the end of the year or lose it. Unless your plan gives you an extension or allows money to roll over, make sure you're not wasting the pre-tax amount you set aside to cover care costs.\n\nYou can spend your FSA funds on prescription medications, as well as some over-the-counter medications with a doctor's prescription. Insulin, medical equipment, and prescription eyeglasses can all be purchased with money in an FSA, so find something you can buy rather than losing the money.\n\nMaking smart financial choices all year long can leave you better off\n\nBy following these tips and making smart financial choices throughout the year, you can end 2018 with more money invested, your money working harder, and your financial life in order. Get started now, and make a few small changes every month, so you can ring in the next New Year as a more prosperous you.\n\nChristy Bieber has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Jefferson County is preserving what's left of the lockup where officials say Martin Luther King Jr. served his final time behind bars just months before his assassination. County commissioners unanimously approved a resolution Thursday to memorialize and preserve an area on the seventh floor of the county courthouse that used to be a jail. Much of the floor is now used for storage and mechanical equipment. Sheriff Mark Pettway said the civil rights leader was held on the floor in 1967, when he served three days for contempt after losing an appeal on his conviction for demonstrating without a permit years earlier. A small area including two pale-green cells, an isolation chamber, a shower and mechanical equipment are all that remain from the old jail. The county doesn't know whether King was held in that exact section or another section that has since been removed.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A judge ruled Friday that an effort to recall Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy may proceed, a decision that is expected to be appealed. The decision by Superior Court Judge Eric Aarseth in Anchorage followed arguments in the case Friday and came two months after Gail Fenumiai, director of the state Division of Elections, rejected a bid to advance the recall effort. Fenumiai said her decision was based on an opinion from Attorney General Kevin Clarkson that found the reasons listed for recall were factually and legally deficient. The Recall Dunleavy group has argued that Clarkson's analysis was overreaching and that the recall effort should have been allowed to move to a second, signature-gathering phase. Among its claims, the group said Dunleavy violated the law by not appointing a judge within a required time frame, misused state funds for partisan online ads and mailers, and improperly used his veto authority to attack the judiciary.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Tonto National Forest officials say workers plan to begin installing 4 miles of steel fencing along and near the lower Salt River east of metro Phoenix to prevent wild horses from crossing the Bush Highway and to keep livestock from mingling with the horse herd. Forest officials say the fence work starting Monday is the second phase of a project that saw workers complete installation Friday of 10 miles of barbed wire fencing. That work began in November. Forest Service and state Department of Agriculture officials said previous fences didn't prevent horses from getting onto the highway, resulting in the deaths of 20 or more horses annually. The Forest Service said the project includes installing 35 gates at designated trails and historically used access points.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Friday said he won't stay his order reinstating a police officer fired for fatally shooting a black motorist. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox denied the city of Little Rock's request to stay his order regarding Officer Charles Starks, who was fired over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February. Starks and another officer were attempting a motor vehicle stop at the time. Police commanders fired Starks in May, saying he violated department policy. Fox had previously upheld a city commission's ruling that Starks violated policy prohibiting officers from voluntarily placing themselves in front of an oncoming vehicle where deadly force is the probable outcome. But the judge said a 30-day suspension and reduction to an entry-level officer salary are more appropriate sanctions, and he ordered the city to comply by Jan. 16.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: It was a bad week for robots in the Bay Area. A Silicon Valley company that used robots to make its pizzas closed last week, and three coffee shops in downtown San Francisco that used robots as baristas also shuttered. Zume Pizza said it is cutting 172 jobs in Mountain View and eliminating another 80 at its facility in San Francisco. The Mountain View startup, which first began delivering pizzas in 2016, said it intends to focus on its food packaging and delivery systems, the Mercury News in San Jose reports. In San Francisco, Cafe X closed three of its coffee shops in the financial district. The startup's founder, Henry Hu, said the downtown cafes helped develop the newest machine being used at shops at San Francisco International Airport and Mineta San Jose International Airport, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: Northern Colorado commuters will have to say goodbye, at least for now, to Equinox, the giant sculpture of three horses galloping along a ribbon of railroad tracks at the intersection of Interstate 25 and U.S. Highway 34. The five-story-tall sculpture, put in place in 2014, will be taken down in the next couple of weeks, according to the city. The interchange is being redesigned as part of an interstate-widening project. The sculpture will be placed in storage until a new location can be selected, according to a city news release. Equinox was created by three Loveland residents – figurative sculptor Jack Kreutzer, structural engineer and artist Doug Rutledge, and artist and philanthropist Doug Erion – and was inspired by the art of Arapaho and Cheyenne Plains Indians. Loveland says it's the biggest public art project in city history. It cost $225,000.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An agreement reached Friday in a long-running school desegregation case in the capital city will put the district on a path to ending 30 years of litigation, state officials said. The settlement includes new measures to reach diversity goals and allows for judicial oversight to end once the effort is shown to produce opportunities in diverse school settings for all Hartford families. The Sheff v. O'Neill case began in 1989 with a lawsuit challenging racial and economic segregation and inequalities between Hartford schools and suburban schools against then-Gov. William O'Neill. The plaintiffs were black, Latino and white families from Hartford. The case was named after Milo Sheff, one of the main plaintiffs, and his mother, Elizabeth Horton Sheff. In 1996, the state Supreme Court ruled the extreme racial isolation of Hartford students violated the state Constitution.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Seaside Jewish Community celebrated a milestone 23 years in the making this month, the Delaware State News reports. The groundbreaking group began meeting in 1997 when strangers responded to an advertisement in the Cape Gazette newspaper requesting fellowship for a Passover Seder feast to celebrate the beginning of the holiday with fellow Jewish community members. Nearly 100 members responded. By 2006, Seaside Jewish Community had grown to 200 members, prompting them to purchase their current facility after renting it for several years. Fourteen years later, the community had another need based on growth – expansion. They are now about 600 members strong and need more space so their community can continue to thrive. The need for an expansion was demonstrated as community members who attended the Jan. 5 groundbreaking had to sit in an overflow room where the ceremony was streamed live online because the sanctuary was full.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A group in D.C. is extending the fight to decriminalize drugs beyond cannabis to magic mushrooms, WUSA-TV reports. Spokesperson Melissa Lavasani says she suffered with postpartum depression and found relief when she gave the psychedelic substance a try after listening to a Joe Rogan podcast on which mycologist Paul Stamets discussed the benefits and uses of psilocybin mushrooms. She says it made all the difference for her, but the fear didn't leave her – she was, after all, still using an illegal Schedule I substance. In an effort to alleviate those fears and help others struggling with similar situations, she joined the group Decriminalize Nature DC to bring the fight to politics. The group has submitted a ballot initiative to the D.C. Board of Elections to decide whether it can move forward. A hearing will be held Feb. 12.\n\nFlorida\n\nSunrise: Miami's upcoming Super Bowl will mean death for dozens of invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades – and wildlife officials say that's a good thing. The game's organizing committee is working with the state to promote the Python Bowl, a 10-day contest that began Friday that will give out all-terrain vehicles and cash to the hunters who kill the most and biggest of these non-native snakes. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations. Kristen Sommers, a wildlife impact manager for the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, says officials understand the number of pythons caught during the contest won't even make a dent in the population, which might exceed 100,000. But the goal is to raise the public's awareness of the problem.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: A project to repair erosion to the state's largest public beach is underway east of Savannah. Crews have been pumping sand onto the beach at Tybee Island since early December. Tybee Island City Manager Shawn Gillen told WTOC-TV work is about a week behind schedule, but crews should be done pumping new sand onto the beach around Jan. 20. The state and federal governments are spending $13.8 million to renourish Tybee Island's beach. The project has been in the works since hurricanes Mathew and Irma pushed damaging storm surge onto the Georgia coast in 2016 and 2017. The repair work includes building a new stretch of dune to help protect beachfront structures from future surge, as well as rebuilding several crossover walkways onto the beach that suffered storm damage.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Air National Guard will start selecting candidates in April for one of four space control squadrons in the country in the Air National Guard, military officials said. The state Air Guard would select 88 military members for the 293rd Space Control Squad based at the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Operations by the new squadron are classified, but its main objective is to protect and defend the nation's satellite communication systems, Hawaii Air Guard commander Brig. Gen. Ryan Okahara says. The announcement comes after President Donald Trump signed the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act in December funding the military and creating the Space Force, the first new armed service since 1947.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A Clean Water Act lawsuit filed by the Nez Perce Tribe that seeks to force a Canadian gold mining company to acquire permits for pollution discharged from its central Idaho facility will be allowed to continue, a federal judge decided. Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Boise forwarded the lawsuit first filed by the tribe in August against Midas Gold Corp. and its subsidiary, Midas Gold Idaho, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Midas Gold's motion to stay the Tribe's litigation was simply a delay tactic, Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee chairman Shannon F. Wheeler said. The company is discharging water polluted with arsenic, cyanide, mercury and other heavy metals into streams of the Salmon River, home to several species of fish protected by the Endangered Species Act, Nez Perce Tribal leaders say. The streams also run through traditional territory where tribal members fish, tribe officials say.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: DNA tests to determine if a coyote captured on the city's North Side is the same animal that attacked a 6-year-old boy will take weeks to complete, a city animal control official said Friday. Kelley Gandurski, executive director of Chicago Animal Care and Control, says the coyote will eventually be relocated outside the city. The agency's Jenny Schlueter says another coyote was spotted in the same area Thursday night but eluded capture. Animal control officers have continued to search for coyotes in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and downtown. Experts say the majority of cases in which people suspect coyotes turn out to have been attacks by dogs, but Chicago officials remain confident the animal that attacked the boy Wednesday was a coyote. If so, it would be the first confirmed coyote attack on a human in Illinois, according to a wildlife biologist with the Urban Coyote Research Project.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Whitley: A northern Indiana dam that was the scene of a deadly 2017 kayaking accident has been demolished, making the region's Eel River safer for recreation and removing a barrier to migrating fish. A crew that began demolishing the Collamer Dam on Wednesday finished removing the last of the concrete structure Thursday, said Jerry Sweeten, a retired Manchester University biology professor. The dam's removal means the Eel River now includes about 95 miles of free-flowing open waterway that will promote both safer recreation and the river's ecological health, Sweeten said. This is a remarkable thing, to open up this much of the river, he told The Journal Gazette. There's now no barrier to migrating fish, including small-mouth bass and several species of suckers, including the great red horse sucker, which is an endangered species in Indiana, Sweeten said. The river has 52 fish species, 43 of which migrate upstream, he said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State Supreme Court Acting Chief Justice David Wiggins announced Friday that he's retiring. Wiggins, 69, said he will retire March 13. He was appointed to the court by Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack in 2003. He was named acting chief justice in November after the unexpected death of Chief Justice Mark Cady, who had named Wiggins as his replacement if he were to be unable to act. Wiggins' departure will give Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds an opportunity to replace one of the two remaining Democratic appointees on the seven-member court. She just received the names of three nominees Thursday to fill Cady's vacant seat. Wiggins could have served until 2023, when he turns 72, the mandatory retirement age for state judges in Iowa. His current term is to expire in December.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The state's farmers have seeded an estimated 6.9 million acres into winter wheat, the National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Friday. The state's winter wheat acreage is equal to the area planted a year earlier, the agency said. Winter wheat is planted in the fall for harvest the following year. Kansas is the nation's biggest producer. Separately, the agency also reported that about 394 million bushels of wheat are now stored in the state, down 13% from the amount in storage at this time a year ago.\n\nKentucky\n\nCovington: A homeless shelter in northern Kentucky is moving to a bigger facility and will offer more services, officials said. The Northern Kentucky Emergency Shelter in Covington will move to a building on West 13th Street later this year that includes space for a medical clinic, lockers and laundry services. The building can house up to 55 more people in need, says Kim Webb, executive director of the Emergency Shelter of Northern Kentucky. The shelter worked with Kenton County officials and St. Elizabeth Healthcare, which bought the building, to provide services for the homeless in the region. More than 1,500 people experienced homelessness in Boone, Kenton and Cambell counties between July 2018 and June 2019, according to a report from the Northern Kentucky Homelessness Working Group.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Southern University at New Orleans will suspend all of its athletics programs at the end of the academic year, trying to save money and dig itself out of years of financial problems. The Southern University Board of Supervisors approved the move Friday without objection, at the request of SUNO Interim Chancellor James Ammons. This is one of the most difficult decisions I've made as an administrator, Ammons said. He said while he understands the importance of athletics programs to attracting students and drawing alumni support, the campus must focus on protecting its academic programs rather than continuing to steer money to sports. The historically black public university is on probation by its accrediting agency amid continuing financial woes that have stretched over years as enrollment has fallen.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: A sign welcoming people crossing the bridge into this coastal town has been stolen, police said. In a Facebook post Friday, police said the Welcome to Kennebunkport sign posted off the side of the Lanigan Bridge is missing, though it was unclear when it was removed. The bridge is a popular spot for visitors and tourists to take photos, often with the sign in the background, CentralMaine.com reports. The sign, which shows some of town's skyline, is made of copper and aluminum, but police don't think it was stolen for scrap. I believe it's a trophy sitting in somebody's living room, Kennebunkport Police Deputy Chief Kurt Moses told WGME-TV, and we just want to get the word out that we would like our sign back. It must have taken some effort to dismantle the sign, as it was secured with several bolts on a railing over the river, the chief said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: This coastal community has playfully invited Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan to vacation there after the couple said they would step back from royal duties. The city tweeted Wednesday that the couple is welcome to come for a visit any time! and that our castles may not be as grand as those back home, but it's a great place for any family looking to take a break from it all. City officials weren't available to comment on whether the couple responded to the offer. Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan say they intend to become financially independent and to balance their time between the U.K. and North America.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is warning international students that federal immigration officials may visit their work sites to verify that their employment is directly related to their studies. School officials sent a memo to faculty Thursday saying the Department of Homeland Security has been making site visits to employers of foreign students in science, technology, engineering and math fields. The school is notifying students separately and telling them what to expect from the visits. MIT spokeswoman Kimberly Allen said the memo was not prompted by any visit to the institute. Immigration officials announced last year that they would begin workplace visits for some students in the federal Optional Practical Training program, which allows those with student visas to take temporary jobs related to their studies. Students in STEM fields can get their visas extended by two years, while others can get one-year extensions.\n\nMichigan\n\nMadison Heights: An industrial site in suburban Detroit from which a greenish stream of contaminated water leaked onto a freeway will be considered for the federal Superfund cleanup program, state officials said Friday. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said an evaluation of the Electro-Plating Services Inc. site will be completed this spring. It will be based on dozens of soil and water samples being taken by the department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The chrome plating company in Madison Heights was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. An EPA cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. The leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. It found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minneapolis VA Health Care Center has been cited for failures in connection with the 2018 suicide of a veteran in its care. It's the second time in 16 months that a federal watchdog has cited the medical center after a suicide. In a report last week, the VA Office of Inspector General found the Minnesota veteran said he wanted to die after he was admitted in spring 2018. A nurse also overheard him telling someone on the telephone that he would die at the hospital. Hours after that call, he attempted suicide and couldn't be revived. The inspector general found that staff members failed to share the man's suicidal thoughts with others on the treatment team, which might have prevented his death, the Star Tribune reports. His death came weeks after another veteran killed himself in the center's parking lot, less than 24 hours after he was discharged from the mental health unit.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Phil Bryant is leaving office Tuesday after serving his limit of two terms. The Republican says he believes the state's economy is stronger, vulnerable children are better protected, and students are showing stronger academic performance. He also says a recent outburst of violence in Mississippi prisons is not something he would have wanted as part of his legacy. Five inmates were killed, an undisclosed number were injured, and facilities at the State Penitentiary at Parchman were so damaged that the state set an emergency contract to move 375 inmates to a private prison. Bryant's predecessor, fellow GOP Gov. Haley Barbour, pardoned nearly 200 people as he finished his second term in 2012. People protesting prison conditions last week called on Bryant to release some nonviolent inmates to ease prison crowding, but the onetime deputy sheriff says he will not issue any pardons or commute any sentences and does not think of inmates as victims.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Getting legal representation will take longer for hundreds of criminal defendants in the state's largest county now that its judicial circuit has instituted a waiting list that supporters say is the only way to reduce the massive caseloads its overworked public defenders have been handling. St. Louis County's waiting list went into effect Jan. 2 following an order by the county's presiding judge, Gloria Reno. Her review last fall found that public defenders – lawyers who are assigned to defendants who can't afford private attorneys – were juggling far more cases than they could logically handle. The list was requested by the St. Louis County public defender office and had the support of Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, who in a November court filing called it the least-bad alternative available.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: NorthWestern Energy has donated $15,000 to efforts to memorialize Judy Martz, who served as the state's first female governor and lieutenant governor. The donation for a statue was announced last week by Lisa Perry, NorthWestern Energy's community relations manager for the Billings division, at the Montana Chamber of Commerce's 20th annual Business Days at the Capitol luncheon. Martz, 74, died in Butte in Oct. 30, 2017, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. In 2019, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 275, by Sen. Al Olszewski, R-Kalispell. It gives a committee five years to raise funds to put a museum-quality statue or bust in honor of the Republican governor on the Capitol grounds. The committee must raise funds, and the statue design must get approval from the Capitol Grounds Advisory Committee and the Montana Historical Society.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Requests for early ballots can be submitted starting this week, the Nebraska Secretary of State's office reports. The office said in a news release that the first day to submit applications for an early ballot at county offices is Monday. Counties receiving early voting requests will keep a list of the requests, Secretary of State Bob Evnen said. Those requests will be among the first ballots mailed staring April 6, he said. Nebraska's primary election this year is May 12. Some counties maintain a permanent early voting list, which allows counties to reach out to voters who have indicated an ongoing preference to vote by mail. Each voter on the list will receive a postcard, which the voter can return indicating he or she would like to receive a ballot by mail.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Two human skulls and two human jawbones were discovered in archival storage boxes by a volunteer, prompting an investigation, Clark County Museum officials say. The 50-year-old museum grew from a collection of items from the Las Vegas Valley's first female mortician, Anna Roberts Parks, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. This was the first time human remains were found in Parks' collection, museum registrar Cynthia Sanford says. She had lots of animal bones and things along those lines, but we've never found human remains before, Sanford says. She was a mortician, so it seems like that would be kind of a weird line to cross. A volunteer was going through archival boxes Dec. 5 when the four bones were found, Sanford says. The bones were brought to the Clark County coroner's office for investigation, officials say.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Woodstock: Organizers of annual hand-crafted ice castle sculptures in the state opened the popular tourist attraction over the weekend as planned, despite warmer weather. The frozen attraction is located in six places across North America, including in North Woodstock. The castles include LED-lit sculptures, frozen thrones, ice-carved tunnels, slides and fountains. The winter wonderland is built from scratch when the cold conditions allow the ice to sprout from the barren ground. Warming weather is always a threat for the Ice Castles. In years past, some locations occasionally have had to cut their seasons short due to warmer winters. The attraction, which moved last year from neighboring Lincoln, draws tens of thousands of visitors each season.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Hundreds of protesters turned out Saturday as part of an effort to save one of Liberty State Park's waterfront vistas from a billionaire developer bent on expanding a prestigious golf club into the natural preserve. Chants of Whose park? Our park reverberated along the edge of the state park overlooking the Statue of Liberty as demonstrators gathered to fight a proposed three-hole expansion of the exclusive Liberty National Golf Club at Caven Point – a protected peninsula of the adjacent state park in Jersey City – and back a bill before the Legislature that would ban further development in the area. The peninsula is a prime habitat for migrating birds and has marshland and a sandy beach, where fish, crabs, seahorses and other marine life are found in local waters.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A nonpartisan group says targeted mailings that encourage voter registration are going out to 1 in 8 state residents. The nonprofit, Washington-based Voter Participation Center says it will attempt to reach more than 248,000 people in New Mexico by mail in January as part of a new national campaign to reach populations that are statistically underrepresented in elections. The effort seeks to narrow the gap between those eligible to vote and those who are registered to vote – a gap that is especially pronounced among Latinos, says center founder and president Page Gardner. New Mexico has the highest percentage of Latino residents of any state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, estimated at well above 40% of the population. Young adults and single, unmarried women are another focus of the drive intended to increase overall voting.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city will install 100 new security cameras in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in an effort to prevent anti-Semitic attacks, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday. Fear has gripped the city's Orthodox Jewish community since the the fatal Dec. 10 attack at a kosher grocery store across the Hudson River in Jersey City and the Dec. 29 stabbings at a Hanukkah celebration in suburban Monsey. The new cameras will be installed in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Crown Heights and Borough Park, where Hasidic Jewish residents have reported attacks ranging from someone pulling off a wig or hat to more violent assaults. An attack on the Jewish community is an attack on all New Yorkers, de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. Police officials say anti-Semitic crimes in New York City jumped 21% in 2019 compared with 2018.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The FBI is asking for the public's help in catching a so-called bad wig bandit who's been robbing banks in the state. The FBI said in a statement Thursday that the suspect wore a different wig during each heist in the Charlotte area. One wig was blonde. Another was black. The third was red. The FBI says he robbed a BB&T in Huntersville on Dec. 13. He then robbed two banks Jan. 7. The first was a New Horizon Bank in Belmont. The second was a Wells Fargo in Gastonia.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A man who allegedly told a neighbor he had a bomb and indicated he would harm anyone who tried to enter his condominium died after he was shot by tactical officers in an exchange of gunfire, police said. Authorities identified the man Friday as Cody Carnes, 30, of Bismarck. Officers responded to the residence after getting a call from a neighbor about 10 p.m. Thursday. The neighbor reported noisy sawing and hammering coming from Carnes' residence and said Carnes stated that he had a bomb. Two other calls were made earlier in the evening, including one from a caller who said Carnes stated he had weapons and would use them if anyone tried to enter his home. Another call came from a delivery employee who said Carnes displayed a handgun and said he had several more firearms. West Dakota SWAT officers tried to get the man to surrender, but he refused.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: There's limited evidence that expanding the electronic monitoring of inmates in the state would reduce the rates at which ex-offenders commit new crimes or that it would enhance public safety, according to a new report. In addition, creating a system that would allow real-time monitoring of inmates in the hopes of placing them near crimes would still do nothing to prevent such crimes from happening, though it could help aid investigators and parole officers, according to the report released last week. Such a system is known as crime scene correlation technology. The daily operations required for such a system are exceedingly complex and would require careful planning and consistent oversight, according to the report, which was given to a state task force looking at all aspects of supervising inmates upon release. Additionally, the costs associated with developing and operating such an initiative would be substantial and recurring.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A woman has pleaded guilty to spray-painting racist, anti-gay and anti-Semitic graffiti on Democratic Party offices and other properties in central Oklahoma in 2019. Allison Christine Johnson, 46, of Norman, pleaded guilty Thursday to a felony charge of malicious injury to property, three misdemeanor counts of malicious injury to property, and one misdemeanor count of malicious intimidation or harassment as part of a plea deal. My actions do not reflect how I really feel, Johnson told District Judge Michael Tupperman. It was out of character. In exchange for her plea, the charges will be dismissed if Johnson completes a mental health program. The graffiti included racial slurs and swatiskas outside the state Democratic Party headquarters in Oklahoma City and a Chickasaw Nation office. Similar graffiti was found at the Cleveland County Democratic Party headquarters and an elementary school in Norman.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Federal authorities suggested the environmental impact of a proposed liquefied natural gas terminal and pipeline in southern Oregon would be minimal, saying the contentious project wouldn't jeopardize protected species or adversely change their critical habitat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said its review shows that the effects of the proposed Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas terminal and a 230-mile feeder pipeline along Coos Bay would be short-term or on a small scale, dispersed broadly across 250 miles. The biological study done by NOAA scientists reviewed 17 species listed under the Endangered Species Act and their critical habitats, including whales, sea turtles, salmon and other fish species. In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's staff in its final environmental analysis concluded that the contentious project would likely have an adverse affect on wildlife, including 18 federally listed or proposed threatened and endangered species.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Manchester Township: Shiloh Water Authority has started the process to remove fluoride from the township's water supply. Shiloh is one of the last water companies in York County to add fluoride. According to a database by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the others are Hanover Municipal Water Works, Red Lion Municipal Authority and the West Manheim branch of the York Water Company. Adams County is one of 19 counties in Pennsylvania that does not have a supplier that adds fluoride or purchases fluoridated water. Franklin has three authorities, and Lebanon has two that add fluoride to their community's water. Chairman James Bentzel says Shiloh started to add fluoride to the water in the mid-1960s. In the past few years, some of its customers requested that the company stop.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A fund has been created to accept donations to support public education in the state. Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green announced Friday that the nonprofit Rhode Island Foundation established the Fund for Rhode Island Public Education to accept donations from individuals, corporations and foundations interested in improving public education statewide. The Rhode Island Foundation will manage and distribute the money according to the education department's priorities and the donor's intent. Donors could invest professional learning opportunities for educators, advanced coursework for students and upgrades to school facilities, for example, the department said. The fund launched with a $20,000 commitment from the Rhode Island Commodores, a nonprofit that promotes economic development.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nEastover: Officials at McEntire Joint National Guard Base are warning neighbors that nighttime training scheduled for the next several days may create a lot of noise. The training will run Monday through Thursday at the air base east of Columbia. The South Carolina Air National Guard's 169th Fighter Wing is hosting jets from the 4th Fighter Wing stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina for the exercise, 169th Fighter Wing commander Col. Akshai Gandhi said. The base in Richland County has a large airfield and provides realistic training for a number of military units, Gandhi said in a statement. Base officials will do everything they can to minimize noise from the nighttime training and appreciate the understanding of their neighbors, Gandhi said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge has ruled that a new state law that requires ballot petition circulators to register and be included in a directory is unconstitutional. The organization SD Voice, a grassroots ballot question committee, filed the lawsuit in federal court. There was a one-day trial in Aberdeen last month. The law required petition circulators to apply with the secretary of state for an identification number, provide personal information and be included in a directory. Attorneys for the state say the law is aimed at preventing fraud. In a written ruling Thursday, Judge Charles Kornmann declared the measure a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A new pilot program starts this month with the goal of helping youth in Memphis and Shelby County lead healthier lives. The Craigmont High School Healthy Habits Program is a new curriculum designed to educate ninth graders participating in the school's Lifetime Wellness classes about the importance of living a healthy lifestyle. The comprehensive program will present a three-component approach that details the 8-5-2-1-0 (8 hours or more of sleep, 5 fruits and vegetables, 2 hours or less of screen time, 1 hour or more of physical activity, and 0 sugary drinks every day) recipe that incorporates proper nutrition and adequate exercise into daily activities. Students in the program will also participate in FitnessGram, an evidence-based fitness evaluation program.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Shriners Hospital for Children in the Texas Medical Center will close in 2021 to consolidate area care at its larger Galveston hospital. The decision, made last fall, was driven by a desire to build one premier hospital, according to the Houston Chronicle. It was not based on financial concerns. Though the closure will end Shriners' 100-year presence in Houston, it will mean all four specialty care departments – acute burns, orthopedic conditions, spinal injuries, and cleft lip and palate abnormalities – will be provided in Galveston. This will make more efficient use of resources and enable us to provide our patients who need more than one type of care to receive it all in one place, said Mel Bower, director of marketing at the Shriners national offices in Tampa. It makes more strategic sense.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Rare salt formations have been documented for the first time on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, and they could yield insights about salt structures found on Mars before they disappear for good. They're showing up now in part because water levels at the largest natural lake west of the Mississippi have been lowered by drought and water diversion, exposing more shoreline. That means there are more places where water can bubble up to the surface from warm, sulfate-rich springs. When it hits the cold air, a mineral called Glauber's salt, or mirabilite, separates out. The tiny crystals have built up over the past several months, eventually creating flat terraces stacked atop one another like the travertine rimstone and dam terraces at Yellowstone's Mammoth Hot Springs. From above, though, the cascading terraces are like an enormous piece of lace laid over the sandy earth. There are now four mounds at the Great Salt Lake beach, growing up to 3 feet tall.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The governor has reaffirmed the state's commitment to accepting refugees from across the world and says he would like to return the number of people arriving in the state to the levels before President Donald Trump took office. In a letter to the president and U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said the state has welcomed almost 8,000 refugees since 1989, and before Trump took office, it was accepting about 325 to 350 a year. In fiscal 2019, Vermont took in 115 refugees, said Amila Merdzanovic, of the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Vermont's refugee communities have made countless contributions to our state, said Scott's letter to the president. Refugees help ensure a healthy sized and diverse student population. They help employers fill open positions, contributing to the community and local economy, and pay federal, state and local taxes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers voted Friday to ban firearms at the state Capitol, the first in what's expected to be many contentious gun votes in coming weeks. Newly empowered Democrats who made up a majority of a special rules committee voted to ban guns at the Capitol and a legislative office building despite bitter protests from Republicans, saying the move was needed to protect public safety. Our focus here is to keep everybody safe, said House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn. These are policies and rules that should have passed a long, long time ago. Public officials have expressed concerns about planned Jan. 20 rallies that are set to draw huge crowds of pro-gun and gun-control advocates. Gun advocates from around Virginia and even out of state have pledged to turn out in force to highlight their resistance to proposed gun-control measures.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Wolf advocates seeking to halt the state Department Fish and Wildlife from shooting wolves to protect livestock have suffered another legal setback. The Capital Press reports King County Superior Court Judge John McHale on Friday dismissed claims that Fish and Wildlife's lethal-control policy violates the State Environmental Policy Act. McHale's ruling mirrored one in November by a Thurston County judge presiding over a similar lawsuit. Fish and Wildlife wolf policy lead Donny Martorello said that the department prefers to develop wolf policy outside courtrooms and that this decision lets it continue to do that. Jonathon Bashford, an attorney for the wolf advocates who brought the lawsuit, said they are reviewing the ruling and exploring their options.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The governor says a technology company has agreed to open a research facility in the state to look into using coal to make carbon-based products. Gov. Jim Justice gave additional details about the agreement with Ramaco Carbon on Thursday after mentioning the research center in his State of the State speech. We absolutely need to continue doing all we can to harness the power of coal in every way possible, and having this facility to test new ways to convert this dynamic resource is a great opportunity for all, the Republican governor said. Ramaco Carbon has received more than $5 million in federal grants to support its research, Justice said in a news release. One of the projects the company is working on revolves around using coal as a precursor to manufacture carbon fiber for the automotive industry.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: High winds, towering waves and flooding have caused millions of dollars in damage to Port Milwaukee on Lake Michigan, the port's director said Sunday. Wild weather Saturday forced the port to prohibit public access to Jones Island and caused flooding on all major roadways at the port. Winds gusted up to 50 mph, and waves reached 6 to 8 feet high. Port Director Adam Schlicht called it an unprecedented event at Port Milwaukee and said the port's international docks, which are closed for the season, sustained significant damage. Floodwaters were receding Sunday, he said. The inner harbor is expected to reopen early Monday. The wind and water stripped off dock wall material and pushed it inland, and frozen floodwaters covered railroad tracks in a foot of ice, Schlicht said. Water levels on the Great Lakes have been at or near all-time highs for much of the past year, the City of Milwaukee said.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An annual elk hunt in Grand Teton National Park doesn't draw in and concentrate large numbers of grizzly bears, scientists have concluded. The November to December hunt probably takes place too late in the year for grizzly bears to seek out animal remains that hunters leave behind, according to researchers with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Many grizzly bears have denned up for winter hibernation by the time a significant number of elk remains have accumulated, study team leader Frank van Manen wrote recently in the academic journal Ursus. The park holds the hunt to control elk numbers. Most national parks don't allow hunting, but the law establishing Grand Teton decades ago provides for the hunt.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Steven Berkowitz and Alisa R. Gutman\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nThe Trump administration is knowingly putting vulnerable children in harm's way. Disturbing reports from the border are revealing the human consequences of the administration's Remain in Mexico policy, which forces children and families seeking asylum in the United States to wait for their court hearings in Mexican border towns — some of the most dangerous places on earth.\n\nHorrific stories of the dangers children face in these towns have surfaced in the last month. A recent New York Times story described a 3-year-old boy who witnessed his father being beaten by kidnappers holding them ransom, and another 3-year-old boy forced to watch as multiple attackers repeatedly raped his mother. These are not rare, isolated incidents: Since January, according to a Dec. 5 Human Rights First report, there have been at least 636 documented cases of violent attacks, including kidnapping and rape, against migrants sent back to Mexico by the U.S. government — and 293 of the attacks were in November alone.\n\nAs psychiatrists, we know this kind of trauma carries profound consequences for these children and we cannot stand idly by while the Trump administration forces the most vulnerable among us into unthinkable situations. The children whom the Trump administration is sending back to unspeakable violence in Mexican border towns are at risk for serious traumatic reactions and dysfunction that could impact them for the rest of their lives.\n\nTrauma and regression at the border\n\nDecades of research have catalogued the neurobiological and psychological consequences of trauma on children's brains. It is estimated that 1.8 million synapses are formed on average per second in infants and toddlers. This stage of life is a critical time of development for children, during which the foundation for emotional and behavioral regulation and learning is built.\n\nImmigration lawyers:We saw what's happening at the US-Mexico border. It's a tragic farce.\n\nExposing these children to brutal attacks on their family members, while they are living in stressful and traumatizing shelter environments, makes them prone to regress to earlier developmental stages and potentially lose bladder control, stop speaking, cry uncontrollably and even lose touch with reality. And the consequences of such trauma will continue into adulthood when they will be more likely to become angry, anxious, aggressive and dysfunctional adults.\n\nIndeed, trauma during this developmental stage essentially causes brain damage and results in a two-fold increase in the risk of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as adults. Furthermore, as adults, these children are more likely to experience poor physical health and substance dependence and are more likely to be unemployed and incarcerated.\n\nEnding policy would help children heal\n\nBut there is hope for these children if the Trump administration changes course. We know that the key to healing traumatized children is a safe and stable living environment and the support of a caring parent or adult. Ending the Remain in Mexico policy and allowing children and families seeking asylum to wait in the United States for their court hearings would prevent any more harm as a result of U.S. government policy and offer these children a chance at healing. If we remember our humanity, we may be able to undo some of the damage done.\n\nBut as long as the Trump administration continues to send asylum seekers back to dangerous border cities in Mexico and other unstable locations, children's lives are at risk. As physicians and human beings, we are compelled to speak up and demand that our government stops forcing children and families into danger that will haunt them, and us, for the rest of their lives.\n\nMore:For undocumented immigrants, our enforcement policies drive a public mental health crisis\n\nWhile some might blame the parents of these children for trying to bring them to the United States in the first place, the reality is that most of these families are facing dire circumstances in their home countries — and that no parent risks a journey this dangerous unless they are running from a situation that is even more dangerous.\n\nAs these children and parents arrive at our doorstep seeking asylum, as is their legal right, it is wrong for this administration to knowingly place them in dangerous environments when safe alternatives exist and their presence in the United States has no negative impact on our society. It is our duty to protect them.\n\nDr. Steven Berkowitz, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, is a professor of psychiatry and the director of the Stress, Trauma, Adversity Research and Treatment Center at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

Gutman is an adult psychiatrist and a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and the founder and medical director of the Philadelphia Human Rights Clinic, which serves asylum seekers.

AP\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) — The memory of a blown lead in the closing minutes to Arkansas two weeks ago was still fresh on the minds of Vanderbilt on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Commodores certainly played like they wanted to make amends for that disheartening defeat, jumping out to a 25-4 lead and never looking back on their way to a 72-59 win over the Razorbacks.\n\nWith leading scorer Matthew Fisher-Davis out because of disciplinary reasons, Vanderbilt (12-12, 5-6 Southeastern Conference) set the tone from the outset — hitting seven of its first nine 3-pointers on the way to a 39-18 halftime edge.\n\nFive players scored in double figures for the Commodores, with Nolan Cressler leading the way with 13. Riley LaChance, Jeff Roberson and Luke Kornet added 12 point each and Joy Toye had 11 for Vanderbilt — which finished 12 of 23 on 3-pointers and shot 52.2 percent (24 of 46) overall in the win.\n\nArkansas got us at our place, and it definitely left a sour taste in our mouth, Vanderbilt coach Bryce Drew said. ... They were really excited to have the chance to come back and right that wrong.\n\nThe 3-point barrage marked the 11th time this season the Commodores have finished with 10 or more makes from behind the arc. They were at their best in the first half, hitting 10 of 15 3-pointers and leading by as many as 24 points while the Razorbacks (17-7, 6-5) hit just 7 of 28 (25 percent) shots.\n\nLaChance had three of the 3-pointers for Vanderbilt as did Toye, and all five starters made at least one shot from behind the arc while atoning for the 71-70 loss two weeks ago — a defeat in which Arkansas rallied from 15 points down with six minutes remaining.\n\n(The loss) was a huge punch to the gut, being at home and giving up that kind of lead, Cressler said.\n\nThe loss is the second straight and third in the last four games for the Razorbacks, who were led by Dusty Hannahs' 24 points. Moses Kingsley also finished in double figures with 11 points for Arkansas, which is 3-3 at home in SEC games this season.\n\nIt was one of those train-wreck type games, Hannahs said.\n\nVanderbilt shot 56 percent (14 of 25) in the first half, with its first seven field goals coming on 3-pointers on its way to the early 25-4 lead and comfortable win.\n\nWe just had no answer for them tonight, Arkansas coach Mike Anderson said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nVanderbilt: Fisher-Davis, who is averaging 15.6 points per game this season, didn't make the trip to Fayetteville because of what the school called a violation of athletic department policy. Despite the absence of Fisher-Davis, and only suiting up eight players, Vanderbilt had no problems closing out an Arkansas team it lost to two weeks ago. Drew said he expects Fisher-Davis to only miss the one game.\n\nArkansas: The Razorbacks entered Tuesday ranked 36th nationally in the RPI, despite a loss at lowly Missouri last week. However, that coupled with the blowout loss to the Commodores could put an end to any NCAA Tournament hopes for Arkansas.

ABOARD THE USS FARRAGUT IN THE PERSIAN GULF – In the darkest of darkness, surrounded by a glass-smooth sea – thousands of miles from home – an American voice reads a statement over a VHF radio frequency primarily used for international distress calls.\n\nSécurité, sécurité, sécurité: Good morning all ships. This is a coalition warship conducting maritime operations in the (Persian Gulf) in support of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce. If you observe any suspicious or illegal activity, or require assistance, contact the nearest coalition warship.\n\nThe announcement, repeated at regular intervals throughout the night and day, is read by a U.S. Navy officer from the bridge of the USS Farragut, a 510-foot Arleigh Burke-class destroyer named after America's first admiral, David Farragut.\n\nFarragut served in the War of 1812. He helped secure victory in the Battle of Vicksburg in 1863, and a year later he led a successful attack with the now-iconic order: Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead! according to the U.S. Navy, although there appear to be some conflicting accounts about in which campaign he uttered the phrase.\n\nMiddle East tensions:Iran OKs bill calling U.S. military, Pentagon terrorists\n\nThe U.S. Navy's statement is aimed at any number of troublemakers who operate here, from modern-day pirates to Houthi insurgents from nearby Yemen.\n\nBut really its intended audience is Iran.\n\nIn particular, the network of heavily armed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels the country has used to obstruct commercial shipping and seize foreign oil tankers in the Persian Gulf after increased friction between Tehran and Washington after the Trump administration withdrew from a nuclear accord between Iran and world powers and reimposed economic sanctions. Tensions have intensified in recent days after the Pentagon killed a senior Iranian general in a drone strike in Iraq and Iran responded by launching a missile attack on two bases in Iraq that are home to U.S. troops.\n\nAdditionally, Tehran admitted Saturday that its military may have accidentally shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner around the time of the attack.\n\nFor now, the White House has appeared to indicate it won't be seeking immediate military retaliation, and amid the fallout the House of Representatives approved a resolution to limit the White House's ability to take further military action. A similar resolution is expected to be considered for a vote in the Senate next week. The Trump administration issued additional sanctions on Iran on Friday, in its first official retaliation for Iran's ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases.\n\nTrump warns Iran: The question now: What happens next?\n\nThey hardly ever answer. But we know they're out there, said Cmdr. Eric E. Meyers, the Farragut's executive officer – Meyers is second-in-command – as he surveyed the Persian Gulf's coal-black horizon from the ship's bridge one evening late last year.\n\nDuring hours of darkness, the Farragut turns off most of its external lights to help avoid detection, adding to the impression of total darkness as far as the naked eye can see. Below deck, only red light is used because it doesn't travel as far as white.\n\nUSA TODAY spent a few days aboard the state-of-the-art, combat-ready destroyer as it patrolled the front lines of U.S. efforts to thwart Iranian aggression at sea in a body of water in western Asia that is in the heart of the Middle East. It is also one of the world's most strategically important choke points for transporting oil.\n\nMore than 9,000 vessels operate in the area each day, and one-sixth of global oil production and one-third of the world's natural gas passes through the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf that Iran claims as its territory.\n\nVideo:U.S.-Iran tensions: How close are we to war?\n\nFor the past few months, these waters, an extension of the Indian Ocean to the southeast, bordered to the north and east by Iran, north and west by Iraq and Kuwait, and to the south and west by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Gulf states, have been relatively quiet. That's because, according to the U.S. Navy, since late last year the U.S. has partnered with six countries – the United Kingdom, Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Albania – to form the International Maritime Security Construct, or IMSC. The 290 officers and enlisted sailors of USS Farragut are part of this construct, which provides escorts and various forms of sentry assistance to some of the approximately 42,000 ships that transit through the area every year. The IMSC says that since its establishment in September there have been no recorded incidents at sea of what the U.S. Navy calls malign activity or kinetic actions by Iran.\n\nRear Adm. Alvin Holsey, the U.S. commander of the IMSC, said in emailed comments that the unit is designed to be defensive ... conducting benign surveillance and documentation of nefarious activity, with ... intentions transparent to all mariners.\n\nIMSC represents a stabilizing and de-escalatory presence, he said.\n\nIran out of nuke deal: Tehran abandons accord after Soleimani killing\n\nWhile analysts say Iran may feel satisfied that it has exacted its revenge for the killing of its general while at the time avoiding U.S. deaths, the situation remains fluid. The U.S. has about 62,000 military personnel spread across land and sea in the broader Middle East region, and Iran has repeatedly said they remain a target. (In an unrelated incident Friday, the U.S. Navy said a Russian warship aggressively approached the Farragut, ignoring warnings and risking a collision. The Russian vessel eventually altered course.)\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed severe reprisals after the U.S. killed Qasem Soleimani, a commander of the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guards Corp, a powerful organization that wields control over Iran's economy, security and intelligence apparatus and finances and trains pro-Iran militant groups in the Middle East such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq.\n\nThe Trump administration considered Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis – the Iraqi leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces, killed alongside him – terrorists. Since his killing, the Pentagon has deployed more troops to the Middle East to protect U.S. assets in the region: bases, embassies, ships, contractors.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the U.S. Maritime Administration warned that there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests, such as the USS Farragut, across the Middle East as a result of the Soleimani operation.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has issued emergency commercial airspace restrictions over the Persian Gulf amid the downing of the Ukraine plane.\n\nTragedy while mourning:Stampede at Qasem Soleimani's funeral kills 56\n\nRetired Navy Adm. James Stavridis, NATO's supreme allied commander from 2009 to 2013 and who served at every level in the Persian Gulf, including commanding an aircraft carrier, said U.S. military personnel and installations in the region are now more at risk of attack because of Trump's maximum pressure policy toward Iran.\n\nThe one line the Iranians haven't crossed yet is they haven't killed anyone. But they are going to continue to escalate because they feel they are in a box.\n\nStavridis said the standoff between the U.S. and Iran was unsustainable.\n\nStill, American Navy ships such as the Farragut are often shadowed by Iranian ships, and the two nations' vessels come into contact on a near-daily basis. In July last year, U.S. Marines jammed an Iranian drone Washington said was swooping near the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship in the area that, like the Farragut, was operating out of the U.S. Fifth Fleet base in Manama, Bahrain. In May, four commercial ships were sabotaged with mines in the United Arab Emirates port of Fujairah. A month later, two oil tankers were damaged by explosives in the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. blamed Iran for the attacks. Iran disputes the claims. The evidence is not conclusive either way.\n\nThe U.S. Navy also recently confirmed that multiple small Iranian boats sailed alongside the Nimitz class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships from a U.S. strike group as they sailed through the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf of Oman in December.\n\nIranian Americans aren't mourning:They're glad Soleimani's dead. Now what?\n\nIn 2016, 10 U.S. sailors were detained by Iran after their small patrol boats drifted into Iranian waters during training. They were held overnight and released.\n\nUSA TODAY did not see any Iranian ships while aboard the Farragut, whose motto on its coat of arms is prepared for battle. The ship is designed to operate in what the U.S. Navy calls extreme air, surface and undersea threat environments.\n\nUSS Farragut has 96 missiles aboard and a large gun mount that can accurately fire 16 to 20 rounds a minute to ranges in excess of 13 miles and a shorter-range weapons system that can fire 4,500 rounds a minute to ranges in excess of 2 miles.\n\nBelow, the ship has systems that enable it to make potable water and compress air for missions or repairs that require scuba divers and a series of airlocks between decks to guard against biological or chemical attacks. It is outfitted with a small emergency medical room, a barbershop, a U.S. Post Office, a bank, a ship's store, a laundry and a gym.\n\nTrump's threats against cultural sites: They could may unite Iran\n\nEvery deployment is different, and everyone finds out something different about themselves, as a man, as a person, said Roy T. Garcia, the Farragut's senior enlisted sailor – his formal title is command master chief – in response to a question about what it's like to spend so much time at sea preparing to fight an enemy who might be minutes away or never materialize.\n\nCmdr. Jason N. Lester, the Farragut's captain and commanding officer, said he was confident that the Iranians don't have anything that can touch us, and he was not worried, for example, about Iranian submarines or other advanced craft.\n\nWe have more missiles than some nations have in their entire arsenal, he said.
AP\n\nMOSCOW (AP) — Russia's deputy prime minister, responding to calls for the nation's sports teams to be excluded from all international competitions because of doping, said Wednesday that the country is among the cleanest in the world.\n\nFollowing a summit this week, leaders from 19 national anti-doping organizations also called for Russia to be stripped of the right to host major sports events, a measure which would affect next year's World Cup.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who oversees sports policy in the country, accused the group of meddling in politics.\n\nThe people who should be analyzing urine have started pressuring the people who take political decisions, Mutko said in comments to Russian news agency R-Sport. Russian sports are among the cleanest in the world.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE:\n\nAnti-doping leaders say FIFA World Cup should be pulled from Russia\n\nThe British anti-doping agency is in charge of collecting samples in Russia, and the number of positive tests in the country dropped last year. The Russian anti-doping agency remains suspended following allegations of corruption.\n\nRussian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov accused the foreign anti-doping agencies of trying to usurp the powers of international sports bodies.\n\nFederations and Olympic committees, as you know, develop sports, Kolobkov told state news agency Tass. So I'd ask people to do their own jobs and not to put themselves in the position of various sports organizations.\n\nThe call for extra sports sanctions on Russia follows last month's publication of a report by anti-doping investigator Richard McLaren. The report accused Russia of operating a wide-ranging doping cover-up which included illicit sample swaps at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\nThe Russian government strongly denies ever having supported performance-enhancing drug use.\n\nThe national anti-doping agencies for the United States, Germany and Japan were among those who recommended the extra sanctions on Russia, though the British agency was not listed as a signatory.\n\nWhile arguing for Russian teams to be banned, the agencies said individual Russian athletes could compete as neutrals if they can show they are clean. A similar system is already used in track and field, where Russia has been suspended since November 2015.\n\nNational anti-doping agencies do not have the power to exclude Russian teams or move competitions from Russia, though some, such as the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, are influential voices in global sports administration.
Eddie Timanus\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nWith conference play well underway in college hoops, the contenders are beginning to separate themselves from the field.\n\nThere's still a long way to go, of course, with plenty of challengers awaiting their chances to reel in the front-runners. Here are a few matters worthy of your attention this weekend as January rolls along.\n\nGame of the weekend\n\nNo. 13 Arizona at No. 3 UCLA, Saturday, 4 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nThe Wildcats wrap up their L.A. road trip at legendary Pauley Pavilion, where the Bruins' faithful will be a lot happier than they were at this time a year ago. Though Arizona's résumé to date has no glaring losses, it could also use a boost from a quality road win. But this one won't be easy to get. The Wildcats' bench is dangerously thin with four starters averaging more than 30 minutes a game, and the Bruins love to push the pace with freshman sensation Lonzo Ball setting the tempo.\n\nPlayer to watch\n\nSindarius Thornwell, South Carolina\n\nConspicuous by his absence during a six-game stretch in which the Gamecocks went 3-3, the senior guard is back in the good graces of the university and coach Frank Martin. Suspended for what the school would only say was a violation of athletic department policy, Thornwell was reinstated as South Carolina began SEC play.\n\nHe is the Gamecocks' leading scorer at 18.2 points a game, and his defensive presence was on display as well Wednesday night as the Gamecocks held Florida without a made three-pointer in a 57-53 South Carolina victory. The Gamecocks are 12-0 with Thornwell in the lineup, a streak that will be severely tested Saturday when they visit No. 5 Kentucky (6 p.m. ET, ESPN).\n\nMORE HOOPS:\n\nPreviewing the top 10 college basketball games this weekend\n\nNo trick shot: Markelle Fultz rises from JV team to national star\n\nConference to watch: Big Ten\n\nIt's fair to wonder as March draws closer just how deep the NCAA selection committee will go into what is usually one of the leagues that gets the most tournament bids. Fans of several teams around the B1G undoubtedly are quite nervous, including followers of usual powers Michigan State and Indiana. Those two projected standard bearers struggled in the pre-conference portion of their schedules and find themselves in need of every win they can get as they prepare to square off Saturday in Bloomington (4 p.m. ET, ESPN). The Spartans are coming off a damaging loss to Ohio State, and the Hoosiers narrowly avoided one thanks to a buzzer beater at Penn State.\n\nThe Nittany Lions, meanwhile, have to bounce back quickly as they head to No. 22 Purdue Saturday (noon ET, BTN), and Wisconsin, the league's highest-ranked team according to the USA TODAY Sports coaches poll voters, faces a road test at Minnesota (4:30 p.m. ET, BTN).\n\nOn the Sunday slate, Northwestern, still seeking that elusive first NCAA tourney appearance, must avoid a stumble at Ohio State (1 p.m. ET, BTN).\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE WEEK IN COLLEGE HOOPS
Electronic toymaker VTech Technologies got a costly learning experience Monday — a $650,000 penalty for failing to get verifiable parental consent before collecting and using personal information from hundreds of thousands of U.S. children.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based company and its North America subsidiary in Arlington Heights, Illinois were also ordered to comply with a U.S. privacy law, strengthen its data security safeguards, and submit to outside security audits, the Federal Trade Commission said in the federal regulator's first privacy and security case involving electronically connected toys.\n\nAs connected toys become increasingly popular, it's more important than ever that companies let parents know how their kids' data is collected and used and that they take reasonable steps to secure that data, Acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen said in a statement issued with the settlement. Unfortunately, VTech fell short in both of these areas.\n\nCorporate parent firm VTech Holdings issued a statement saying it was pleased with the settlement.\n\nFollowing the cyber attack incident, we updated our data security policy and adopted rigorous measures to strengthen the protection of our customers' data. We also took steps to address the technical notice and consent issues,  said Allan Wong, the company's chairman and group CEO.\n\nThe settlement capped a nearly two-year investigation that focused on privacy concerns about collection and safety of children's personal data in the growing digital toy sector. Sales of smart toys are projected to reach $15.5 billion in revenues by 2022, Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau, said during a conference call with news reporters.\n\nThe FTC has received complaints about similar problems with other companies but is barred from discussing ongoing investigations, he said.\n\nVTech facing fallout from data breach\n\nThe FTC started investigating VTech in late 2015 after the company disclosed details of a cyberattack that exposed the name, gender, birth date and other personal data for an estimated 6.4 million youngsters who used the subsidiary companies' interactive easels, online games, electronic tablets, and other popular digital products marketed for children of ages 3 to 9.\n\nAlthough the breach affected data of children in many countries, the U.S. accounted for the largest group of children affected by the breach.\n\nVTech also said the breach exposed identifying data for an estimated 4.9 million adults, including many parents who registered their children for the company's digital toys.\n\nFTC investigators determined that the company violated the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act by failing to provide direct notice to parents or obtain verifiable consent about the VTech's data collection practices.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Money and Tech on Facebook\n\nAn FTC complaint filed in Illinois federal court said the company collected personal information from parents on its Learning Lodge Navigator online platform, where VTech's Kid Connect app was available for downloads. The company collected similar information from its now-closed web-based gaming and chat platform known as Planet VTech, the complaint charged.\n\nKid Connect enables children to communicate with other youngsters who also have the app, or with adults who download the adult version of the app, the complaint charged. Parents who wanted Kid Connect access for their children had to submit their full name, physical address, email address, and password, along with their children's names, birth dates, and gender.\n\nAs of Nov. 2015, approximately 485,000 U.S. consumers had created Kid Connect accounts for nearly 638,000 children, the complaint alleged. Approximately 134,000 U.S. parents similarly had created Planet VTech accounts for 130,000 children by Nov. 2015, the complaint charged.\n\nAlong with failing to get verifiable parental consent about VTech's data collection and usage practices, the company falsely stated that most personal information collected through Learning Lodge and Planet VTech would be encrypted for security purposes, the FTC alleged. None of the information was encrypted, the court complaint alleged.\n\nAdditionally, VTech failed to protect the data with reasonable security safeguards, the FTC alleged.\n\nThis case shines a light on the growing market for children's electronic products and services, said Pahl. As parents buy these products and services this holiday season and beyond, they have the opportunity to compare not only the prices and services offered but also the companies' stewardship of their kids' data.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc
In a remarkable 11th hour decision, the Trump administration designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terror on Monday, reversing an Obama-era decision to remove the communist country from the list as part of its broader rapprochement between Washington and Havana.\n\nThe move, announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo comes just nine days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Bloomberg first reported the Cuba policy decision.\n\nWith this action, we will once again hold Cuba's government accountable and send a clear message: the Castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of U.S. justice, Pompeo said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to label Cuba as a state sponsor of terror will add to the next administration's already long list of foreign policy challenges, which stretch from Iran to North Korea.\n\nA Biden transition official, who was not authorized to speak about the matter on the record, said the president-elect's team has taken note of this and other recent steps by the outgoing Trump administration.\n\nThe transition team is reviewing each one, and the incoming administration will render a verdict based exclusively on one criterion: the national interest, said the Biden official.\n\nThe Trump administration has issued a blizzard of sanctions and other policy steps since the Nov. 3 election, with many seemingly aimed at stymieing Biden's foreign policy priorities or otherwise complicating his first days in office. Late Sunday evening, for example, the State Department announced it would designate an Iranian-backed rebel group as a terrorist group, which critics fear could make it harder for aid groups to deliver humanitarian assistance to war-torn Yemen.\n\nThe Cuba policy shift is one final hardline decision that likely will please Trump's Republican base in Florida, where Cuban Americans overwhelmingly supported him. And it's a slap at Biden, who struggled to win over Hispanic voters in that key swing state.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would urge Biden to reverse Trump's decision.\n\nFor four years, the Trump Administration's policy towards Cuba has been focused on hurting the Cuban people – from drastically reducing remittances in the middle of a pandemic to limiting the ability of Americans to travel to the island, Meeks said in a statement. It is essential that the state sponsor of terrorism list be used judiciously to maintain its seriousness and integrity and that a country is never added to the list unless it meets the legal standard. I urge President-elect Biden to add the reversal of today's foreign policy failure to his long 'to do' list when he takes office.\n\nPresident Barack Obama moved to take Cuba off the terror list in 2015 as part of his historic effort to thaw relations with the island nation after more than 50 years of diplomatic isolation. In a formal notice to Congress in that year, Obama said a State Department review determined that Cuba — which was added to the terrorism list in 1982 — met the requirements for removal.\n\nCuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period, and has offered assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, Obama's 2015 statement said.\n\nIn his statement on Monday, Pompeo said the decision was based in part on Cuba's refusal to extradite members of a Colombian rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or the ELN. The ELN was in peace talks with the Colombian government but those ended after the group claimed responsibility for the deadly 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy.\n\nCiting peace negotiation protocols, Cuba has refused Colombia's requests to extradite ten ELN leaders living in Havana after the group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy that killed 22 people and injured more than 87 others, Pompeo said in announcing Monday's action. Cuba also harbors several U.S. fugitives from justice wanted on or convicted of charges of political violence, many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades.\n\nThe Obama administration unveiled sweeping changes in U.S.-Cuba policy in 2014, expanding trade with the regime, easing travel restrictions and paving the way for an exchange of embassies in Havana and Washington.\n\nDuring his four years in the White House, President Donald Trump has rolled back many elements of Obama's Cuba policy. Monday's action is a capstone of that and it's likely to provoke the ire of Biden, who has vowed to revert to the Obama-era policy.\n\nThe administration's approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to democracy than it was four years ago, Biden said during an Oct. 5 campaign visit to Florida.\n\nContributing: David Jackson
Joseph A. Esposito\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nAs 2019 dawns, chaos reigns in the federal government. The latest senseless shutdown underscores the disregard so many politicians have for government and its positive impact. It also seeks to diminish the vital role of public service.\n\nAfter the deaths of Sen. John McCain and former President George H.W. Bush, there have been post-mortems on the decline of what is considered a quaint view of public service or, certainly in the case of the 41st president, the death knell of noblesse oblige. But what we need is not eulogizing but encouragement of public engagement among people of all stations.\n\nI was fortunate to meet John F. Kennedy in 1960. We all know of the admonition he gave in his inaugural address. Ten days after that memorable speech, he delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. In addition to surveying the challenges ahead, he devoted one paragraph to government service.\n\nRead more commentary:I lost my job because of the government shutdown, and my family isn't the only one at risk\n\nTrump's 'border security' shutdown: Cut off cash to people and agencies that protect us\n\nI was the youngest woman in Congress. Here's my advice to those who have taken my place\n\nHe said, Let every public servant know, whether his post is high or low, that a man's rank and reputation in this administration will be determined by the size of the job he does, and not by the size of his staff, his office or his budget. Let it be clear that this administration recognizes the value of dissent and daring — that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change.\n\nAnd then he added, Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our national government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with pride and with honor in future years: 'I served the United States government in that hour of our nation's need.' \n\nPublic service is an exhilarating, noble calling\n\nHe inspired me. Years later, I worked on George H.W. Bush's first presidential campaign, impressed by his years of dedication to public service. Once the candidate and I had a private discussion, and he told me about how his father, the late Sen. Prescott Bush, had provided him with a desire to serve.\n\nI worked in state government and served in three presidential administrations, holding positions from special assistant to deputy undersecretary. While I've also been a writer, professor and nonprofit employee, nothing has given me as much satisfaction as working in the public sector.\n\nThe reason for my bullishness on public service is obvious: Being able to engage great public policy challenges for the betterment of the country and its people — and, indeed, the world — is exhilarating, if at times frustrating. Public service is a noble calling.\n\nIt has become politically fashionable to attack Washington. But wherever you live, Washington stands for all the people because everyone is represented there, some better and some worse. The nature of a democracy is to ensure that representation is the most effective it can be.\n\nThank a public servant for his or her work\n\nI have seen and worked with some political appointees who have limited ability and commitment to public service. Their stint in the government is sometimes a lark, a way station en route to something else. As we welcome the 116th Congress, let's demand more from our elected representatives. Better yet, consider running for the next Congress or for positions at every level.\n\nDuring my service, I came to have a tremendous regard for the ability and commitment of civil servants, who are largely among the most intelligent and hardworking professionals I have ever encountered. We need to support and encourage them because most are toiling for our good.\n\nThere have been so many inane catchphrases crafted over the past few years, but one of the most ridiculous is the conspiracy-laden deep state. If that term means a body of people who believe that government has a vital role and that people who work for it have an important responsibility, call me an adherent.\n\nAmid this latest shutdown, thank a public servant for his or her work — as you would a soldier or first responder — and reflect on the role of government in our lives. And while you're at it, consider how you can serve your nation at a time when democracy's survival is a stake.\n\nJoseph A.

AP\n\nROME (AP) — A series of drunken, live Instagram postings on New Year's Eve has resulted in midfielder Radja Nainggolan being fined and dropped from Roma's squad for Saturday's match against Atalanta.\n\nCoach Eusebio Di Francesco says that In line with the club's code of conduct, which I fully endorse and the player himself accepts, Radja Nainggolan will not be selected for tomorrow's game against Atalanta.\n\nDi Francesco adds, This is a policy that applies across the board, should anyone from AS Roma or representing Roma make certain mistakes that are no longer acceptable. ... Nainggolan knows what he did. After all, he made the video by himself and he has assumed responsibility.\n\nMORE SOCCER:\n\nNainggolan later issued an apology for the videos, in which he is seen drinking, smoking and playing paddle tennis. At one point in the videos, Nainggolan says he's completely drunk.\n\nDetails of the fine were not disclosed.\n\nNainggolan has been a key player for Roma for five seasons, known for both his offensive and defensive skills and his stamina. His absence against Atalanta is problematic because captain Daniele De Rossi is unavailable in midfield due to a minor muscular injury.\n\nFourth-place Roma needs a win over Atalanta to get back into the title race.\n\nPHOTOS: Best of the English Premier League season
USA TODAY\n\nIn today's fast-paced news environment, it can be hard to keep up. For your weekend reading, we've started in-case-you-missed-it compilations of some of the week's top USA TODAY Opinion pieces. As always, thanks for reading, and for your feedback.\n\n— USA TODAY Opinion editors\n\nBy James S. Robbins\n\nQasem Soleimani was a violent man who lived a violent life. ... According to the Pentagon, Soleimani was actively planning attacks against American forces, something he had done many times. Those politicians who question whether President Donald Trump had the legal right to conduct the strike can suggest adding it as another article of impeachment, if they dare.\n\nBy Joe Biden\n\n(President Donald) Trump knows that in a fair election, if I am the nominee, it will be a tough fight. ... That's why he's trying to smear me now. ... I have already proved I can withstand his dirty tricks. Despite months of lies and vicious attacks against me, my only surviving son, my entire family — my campaign is gaining strength, because the truth is not up for debate.\n\nBy Marilyn J. Mosby and Kimberly Foxx\n\nLamar Johnson, 45, has spent more than half of his life behind bars. And now, even though there is overwhelming evidence of his innocence, he remains incarcerated. ... Tragedies like Johnson's are sadly all too common in our legal system, the inevitable casualties of a failed tough-on-crime playbook that for too long prioritized winning at all costs over seeking justice.\n\nBy Aaron David Miller\n\nIran now presents Donald Trump with the first real-time crisis of his presidency. ... Not surprisingly, he is handling it in a way that embodies all the worst elements of his management of national security issues. Unfortunately, Trump also seems to have abandoned one of the more positive aspects of his approach to foreign policy: a reluctance to get into new and unwinnable conflicts in the Middle East.\n\nBy Tim Kaine\n\nWhy is there a requirement that senators, but not House members, pledge to do 'impartial justice' in an impeachment proceeding? I have grappled with this question as I have heard some colleagues promise that they will not be impartial. ... How can a promise of partiality and a guarantee of unfairness, publicly stated before the trial even begins, be squared with the oath we must take?\n\nBy Jayne O'Donnell\n\nMost everyone I talk to — even some doctors — say nicotine vaping and Juul, especially, is what's clogging kids' lungs. If it is, it hasn't been identified by any of the many state or federal scientists who have reported on their findings. They have only been able to find vitamin E acetate from THC oil in patients' lungs. ... What if the purported problem is something advocates have been trying to get mandated or legalized for years?\n\nBy Benjamin H. Friedman\n\nThe reckless decision to kill Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani ... cannot be undone. But it can be an impetus for the belated exit of U.S. forces from Iraq, who may still avoid needless trouble. Iraq's parliament passed a resolution calling for the U.S. military forces (along with other foreign units) to be expelled. Washington should accept the invitation.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at an all-time high Wednesday despite riots by Trump protestors in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, as inventors piled into economically-sensitive companies on bets that a Democrat-controlled Congress would lead to more stimulus and infrastructure spending.\n\nThe rally lost momentum in late trading after the Capitol went into lockdown after pro-Trump rioters stormed the building. Both houses of Congress abruptly went into recess, interrupting debate over the Electoral College vote that gave Joe Biden the presidency.\n\nStill, stocks were mostly higher after Democrats won two runoff elections in Georgia. A sweep gives Democrats control of Congress and the power to enact President-elect Joe Biden's policy goals.\n\nAlthough the takeover of the Capitol is shocking, it's widely perceived to be temporary and contained in scope, at least in the immediate term, says Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist and managing director at BMO Wealth Management.\n\nThis is going to be dealt with pretty swiftly and won't have lasting repercussions in terms of disruptions to the government, Ma added. It won't change the trajectory of a Biden presidency in the coming weeks.\n\nCoronavirus lawsuits:COVID-19 sparks more than 1,000 workplace-related lawsuits in 2020 as employees complain about safety, wages\n\nBase pay:Minimum wage set to rise in 20 states, 32 localities as growing number adopt $15 an hour\n\nThe Dow climbed 437.80 points to finish at a new all-time high of 30,829.40 after earlier rising as much as 631 points.\n\nThe broader S&P 500 stock index, which touched a fresh intraday high, rose 0.6% to end just shy of a new record at 3,748.14.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite slumped 0.6% to 12,740.79, as investors shifted away from large technology companies -- winners of the stay-at-home economy -- and rotated into other corners of the market that were hit hard by the pandemic. Those include banks, industrial stocks and small companies that would benefit from another round of stimulus for the economy and a boost in infrastructure spending.\n\nInvestors tend to ignore political drama that typically doesn't impact the market. A single-day event in Washington won't impact anything, says Tim Bray, senior portfolio manager at GuideStone Capital Management. What has pushed markets higher is a Congress controlled by the Democrats, which increases the likelihood of further fiscal stimulus with a Biden presidency.\n\nDemocratic control of Washington could also lead to higher tax rates for businesses, which would crimp profits and add downward pressure on stocks broadly.\n\nAnalysts, though, also caution that no big changes may ultimately come from Washington given how slim the Democratic majority may be. The Democrats appear to have a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Democratic Vice President-elect Kamala Harris providing a tie-breaking vote.\n\nWhile the Republicans may have lost the leadership of both houses, they still have commanding minorities that can block anything out of the mainstream, Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of investment adviser Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note. In that sense, nothing has really changed in terms of what policies can be passed.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is used as a reference for everything from auto loans to mortgages, topped 1% for the first time since March as bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, fell. A rise in infrastructure spending could trigger more borrowing by the U.S. government and could lead to higher inflation. Those factors helped push up the yield on the 10-year Treasury to 1.04% from 0.94% late Tuesday.\n\nThe rise in yields helped propel shares of large financial firms higher. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, for instance, rose more than 4.5% apiece. Banks typically benefit from a rise in borrowing costs because it often boosts margins.\n\nOn the other end of the market was Big Tech. A Democratic-controlled D.C. could mean tougher regulations are on the way for the group, which already has been facing increased scrutiny.\n\nSeveral Big Tech stocks were lagging, including a 3.3% drop for Apple and a 2.8% fall for Facebook. These are among the biggest companies on Wall Street, which gives their stock movements outsize weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\n\nA report on Wednesday underscored how fragile the economy is because of the worsening pandemic. Payroll processor ADP said private employers cut 123,000 more jobs last month than they added. It was much worse than economists' expectations for job growth, and it was the weakest such report since April. The Labor Department's more comprehensive report on jobs growth is due on Friday.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
Samuel Stebbins and Evan Comen\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe United States is the most popular destination for immigrants in the world. As such, the nation's demographic composition is anything but static. Comprising over 17% of the total U.S. population, Hispanics and Latinos are one of the largest and fastest growing groups in the United States.\n\nImmigration trends in the United States, which have often been shaped by federally imposed immigration restrictions and quotas, can be broken down into discrete periods. From about 1815 to 1865, the majority of immigrants to the United States hailed from countries in Northern and Western Europe. Between 1880 and 1920, the majority of new arrivals came from Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe. Today, the majority of immigrants to the United States come from Latin America.\n\nAs recently as 1980, the United States was home to some 14.8 million people of Hispanic or Latino descent. Today, more than 55.9 million Americans identify as Hispanic and Latino. Even as the Hispanic and Latino birth rate has slowed in recent years, the demographic accounted for 54% of the total U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2014 — according to the nonpartisan think tank, Pew Research Center.\n\nMore:America's 24 dying industries include sound studios, textiles, newspapers\n\nEvery ethnic group faces challenges upon settling in the United States. Cultural differences, language barriers, and xenophobia can all hinder socioeconomic progress for the newest Americans — and Hispanics and Latinos are no exception.\n\nNationwide, Hispanic and Latinos are more than twice as likely to live below the poverty line than white Americans and are less than half as likely to have a bachelor's degree. These outcomes are not uniform coast to coast, however, and in some states, inequality between whites and Hispanics is far more pronounced. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed a range of data related to income, homeownership, education, and incarceration to identify the worst states for Hispanics and Latinos.\n\nHere are the worst 20. For the full list, click here.\n\n20. Idaho\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 12.0% (16th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 47.7% (Hispanic), 71.3% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 4.7% (Hispanic), 3.8% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 1,026 (Hispanic), 656 (white)\n\nAmericans with a college education are far more likely to earn higher incomes than those with only a high school diploma. In Idaho, only 9.1% of adults of Hispanic and Latino descent have a bachelor's degree or higher, the smallest share of any state in the country. Meanwhile, some 29.4% of white adults have earned a four-year college degree.\n\nDespite the educational disparity, the income gap between white and Hispanic households in Idaho is not as dramatic as it is nationwide. The typical Hispanic household in the state earns $40,802 a year — about $13,000 less than the median income among white households. Nationwide, Hispanic households earn $46,882 a year — about $16,000 less than the typical white household.\n\nMore:25 cities adding (and losing) the most jobs in 2017\n\n19. California\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 38.6% (3rd highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 42.1% (Hispanic), 62.4% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 6.6% (Hispanic), 5.4% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 757 (Hispanic), 453 (white)\n\nHispanic and Latino Americans comprise 38.6% of the population of California, the third largest share of any state after Texas and New Mexico. Hispanics in California still lag behind the white population in a number of important socioeconomic measures. Just 12.1% of Hispanic adults in the state have a bachelor's degree, 31 percentage points below the 43.1% of white adults who do — the largest college attainment gap of any state. Similarly, the median household income for Hispanics of $52,403 a year is nearly $27,000 lower than the median income for white households of $79,353 — the sixth largest such disparity.\n\nDespite the large disparities in education and income, California has smaller gaps in poverty and homeownership rates between the two demographics than a majority of states.\n\n18. Oklahoma\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 9.8% (21st highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 48.8% (Hispanic), 70.2% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 5.1% (Hispanic), 4.2% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 1,876 (Hispanic), 767 (white)\n\nAbout 1 in 4 Oklahoma residents who identify as Hispanic or Latino live below the poverty line, more than double the poverty rate among the state's white residents of 12.3%.\n\nNot only are Hispanics far more likely to face serious financial hardship in Oklahoma than white residents, but also they are far more likely to be incarcerated. For every 100,000 Hispanics in the state, 1,876 are in jail or prison, a far greater share than the incarceration rate among the white population of 767 per 100,000 white residents.\n\n17. Kansas\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 11.3% (17th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 52.8% (Hispanic), 70.0% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 6.5% (Hispanic), 3.7% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 873 (Hispanic), 418 (white)\n\nWhile the unemployment rate for white workers in Kansas of 3.7% is lower than the national rate of 4.3% for the demographic, Hispanic workers are more likely to be unemployed in Kansas than in nearly any other state. The Hispanic unemployment rate in Kansas of 6.5% is far higher than the 5.8% national figure and 2.7 percentage points above the jobless rate for whites — the seventh largest such gap of any state.\n\nKansas also has one of the worst gaps in education between the two demographics of any state. Just 63.6% of Hispanic adults in Kansas have graduated from high school, over 30 percentage points less than the comparable attainment rate among white adults of 93.8% — the eighth largest disparity of any state.\n\n16. Iowa\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 5.6% (18th lowest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 47.4% (Hispanic), 73.9% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 5.3% (Hispanic), 3.6% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 692 (Hispanic), 324 (white)\n\nIowa has one of the largest gaps in education of any state between Hispanic and white state residents. Just 60.9% of Hispanic adults have graduated from high school, compared to the 93.7% of whites who have — the third largest disparity of any state. In most other major socioeconomic measures, Iowa is fairly typical of the disparities that exist between the two demographics nationwide.\n\nFor example, Hispanics are overrepresented in the U.S. prison population. While Hispanic Americans comprise 17.3% of the U.S. population, they account for 19.0% of the nation's prison population.\n\n15. Washington\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 12.1% (15th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 43.4% (Hispanic), 67.2% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 7.6% (Hispanic), 5.3% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 601 (Hispanic), 392 (white)\n\nThe income gap between the typical white household and the typical Hispanic household nationwide is about $16,000. In Washington, the gap is far greater. The typical white household in the state earns about $70,500 a year, nearly $20,000 more than the typical Hispanic household.\n\nIncomes tend to increase alongside educational attainment, and in Washington, white adults are far more likely to have at least a bachelor's degree than Hispanic adults. Some 36.7% of white adults have a bachelor's degree, 21.4 percentage points above the bachelor's degree attainment rate among Hispanic adults.\n\nMore:10 states where the most people are moving (and leaving)\n\n14. Mississippi\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 2.9% (4th lowest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 48.1% (Hispanic), 76.7% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 7.8% (Hispanic), 4.5% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 4,869 (Hispanic), 600 (white)\n\nMississippi is one of the worst states in the country for Hispanics and Latinos. The state has the highest Hispanic incarceration rate in the country with 4,869 Hispanics in jail for every 100,000 residents — more than eight times the state's white incarceration rate and well above the U.S. Hispanic incarceration rate of 831 per 100,000.\n\nHispanics in Mississippi are also far more likely than the state's white residents to struggle to secure a job. The 7.8% unemployment rate among Hispanics is 3.3 percentage points higher than the 4.5% white unemployment rate — a difference more than double the 1.5 percentage point disparity nationwide.\n\n13. Arizona\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 30.5% (4th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 52.1% (Hispanic), 70.0% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 7.1% (Hispanic), 5.1% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 1,453 (Hispanic), 633 (white)\n\nAn estimated 30.5% of Arizona residents are Hispanic, the fourth largest share after California, Texas, and New Mexico. Arizona lawmakers have garnered criticism for the passing of Arizona SB 1070, a law requiring aliens over the age of 18 to carry identification, which according to some critics encourages racial profiling. Arizona has one of the largest disparities in incarceration between whites and Hispanics of any state. Nationwide, Hispanic Americans comprise 17.3% of the population and 19.0% of the prison population. In Arizona, Hispanics comprise 30.5% of the state population and 41.0% of the prison population. The state also has larger disparities between the demographics in college attainment and unemployment than a majority of states.\n\n12. Nebraska\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 10.2% (19th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 45.1% (Hispanic), 69.6% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 4.7% (Hispanic), 2.7% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 867 (Hispanic), 282 (white)\n\nOnly 55.6% of Hispanic adults in Nebraska have a high school diploma, the lowest high school attainment rate among Hispanics and Latinos of any state. Meanwhile, nearly 95% of white adults in the state have a high school diploma, nearly the largest share among states.\n\nA high school education is utmost important for financial stability, and the difference in educational attainment rates appears to have a meaningful impact on poverty rates between whites and Hispanics in the state. Some 22.7% of Hispanics in Nebraska live below the poverty line compared to 8.5% of white residents.\n\n11. South Dakota\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 3.4% (9th lowest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 36.2% (Hispanic), 71.4% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: N/A, 1.5% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 1,727 (Hispanic), 508 (white)\n\nSome 25.2% of the South Dakota Hispanic population lives in poverty, the 10th largest share of any state and far higher than the 8.4% white poverty rate. The gap of 16.8 percentage point in poverty rates between the two demographics is the fifth largest of any state and much larger than the 11.0 percentage point gap nationwide between the white and Hispanic poverty rates of 21.0% and 10.0%, respectively.\n\nSouth Dakota also has one of the largest disparities in incarceration rates in the country. Hispanic residents in South Dakota are incarcerated at more than three times the rate of white residents — while 508 in every 100,000 white residents in the state are in prison, over 1,700 in every 100,000 Hispanic residents are incarcerated. Only three states have larger disparities.\n\n10. Rhode Island\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 14.1% (12th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 25.9% (Hispanic), 65.4% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 8.7% (Hispanic), 5.1% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 697 (Hispanic), 210 (white)\n\nWhile Rhode Island has one of the larger and more active Hispanic communities — the state has a long history of Latino social activists, and Providence elected its first Hispanic mayor in 2010 — it is still one of the worst states for Hispanics by a number of measures. Some 8.7% of Hispanic workers in Rhode Island are unemployed, the second largest share of any state and much higher than the 5.1% white unemployment rate. Only Pennsylvania has a larger disparity in unemployment between the two demographics.\n\nIncome inequality between white and Hispanic earners is worse in Rhode Island than in nearly any other state. The median household income for Hispanics in Rhode Island of $36,877 a year is $28,608 less than the median income for white households of $65,485 — the fifth largest gap of any state.\n\nMore:These are the 5 worst cities for black Americans\n\n9. New Jersey\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 19.3% (8th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 34.6% (Hispanic), 76.2% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 5.5% (Hispanic), 4.4% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 609 (Hispanic), 218 (white)\n\nWhile New Jersey has one of the larger and more engaged Hispanic communities — the Hispanic population accounts for 19% of the population and 9% of the state legislature, some of the largest shares shares nationwide — it has larger disparities in income, college attainment, and homeownership than nearly any other state.\n\nWhile the median household income for Hispanics in New Jersey of $52,599 a year is higher than the comparable $46,882 national figure, it is nearly $34,000 below the median among white households of $86,361 — a greater disparity than any state other than Connecticut and Massachusetts.\n\n8. Colorado\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 21.1% (7th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 48.3% (Hispanic), 70.0% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 4.7% (Hispanic), 3.2% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 1,280 (Hispanic), 509 (white)\n\nIn Colorado,15.7% of Hispanic adults have a bachelor's degree, compared to the 46.0% of white adults in the state who do — the largest disparity in college attainment of any state other than California.\n\nIncome inequality in Colorado among the worst in the country. While the median household income for Hispanics of $49,201 a year is higher than the comparable $46,882 national figure, it is more than $22,000 below the median among white households in the state of $71,406 — a greater disparity than the comparable national gap of $16,273.\n\n7. North Dakota\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 3.1% (5th lowest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 41.1% (Hispanic), 66.9% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: N/A, 2.6% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 1,032 (Hispanic), 245 (white)\n\nHispanics are vastly overrepresented in the North Dakota prison population. Adjusted for population, Hispanics in North Dakota are incarcerated at a rate of 787 more prisoners per 100,000 residents than whites in the state, more than twice the national disparity.\n\nNorth Dakota has a greater degree of income inequality between whites and Hispanics than nearly any other state. The typical Hispanic household in North Dakota earns just $37,239 a year, the fourth least of any state and nearly $27,000 less than the median household income among whites in the state of $64,084. By comparison, the typical Hispanic household nationwide earns about $16,000 less than the typical white households.\n\n6. New York\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 18.6% (9th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 23.9% (Hispanic), 66.5% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 6.5% (Hispanic), 4.2% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 607 (Hispanic), 219 (white)\n\nRoughly 66% of Hispanics in New York state live in New York City. Many of the factors depressing homeownership rates for minorities nationwide — discriminatory lending practices, income inequality, and rising home prices — are amplified in New York City. New York is the only state in which fewer than 1 in 4 Hispanic heads of household own their homes. The Hispanic homeownership is just 23.9%, far less than the 66.5% white homeownership rate. The 42.6 percentage point gap in homeownership is the largest of any state other than Massachusetts.\n\n5. Minnesota\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 5.1% (16th lowest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 45.0% (Hispanic), 76.1% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 5.3% (Hispanic), 3.0% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 959 (Hispanic), 216 (white)\n\nMinnesota has one of the worst disparities in high school attainment between whites and Hispanics of any state. While the high school diploma attainment rate for white adults in Minnesota of 95.7% of is the fourth highest high school attainment rate of any state, the comparable attainment rate for Hispanics of 62.6% is the ninth lowest. The 33.1 percentage point gap is the largest of any state after only Nebraska.\n\nMore:Least livable: 50 worst cities to live in\n\n4.

Some 24.5% of the Hispanic population in the state lives in poverty, 16.9 percentage points above the 7.6% white poverty rate — the fourth largest disparity of any state.\n\nIncome inequality, as well factors such as discriminatory lending practices and rising rents, can make it difficult for minorities to own homes. While 79.6% of white heads of household in Delaware own their homes — the largest share of any state — just 38.4% of Hispanic heads of household do — the eighth lowest Hispanic homeownership rate nationwide. The 41.2 percentage-point gap in homeownership is the fifth largest disparity of any state.\n\n3. Connecticut\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 15.0% (11th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 32.6% (Hispanic), 74.8% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 7.6% (Hispanic), 4.7% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 1,195 (Hispanic), 241 (white)\n\nWhile Connecticut is one of the most wealthy states, it has some of the worst income inequality in the country. The median income for white households of $84,030 a year is more than $37,000 greater than the median income for Hispanic households of $46,808 — the largest gap of any state other than neighboring Massachusetts.\n\nIncome inequality, as well as discriminatory lending practices and rising rents, can make it difficult for minorities to own homes. Just 32.6% of Hispanic heads of household in Connecticut own their homes, the fourth smallest share of any state and 42.3 percentage points below the white homeownership rate of 74.8%. The disparity in homeownership between whites and Hispanics is larger in Connecticut than in all but two states.\n\n2. Pennsylvania\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 6.6% (21st lowest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 40.3% (Hispanic), 74.0% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 11.9% (Hispanic), 4.9% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 2,001 (Hispanic), 375 (white)\n\nPennsylvania has one of the largest disparities in incarceration between white and Hispanic residents of any state. In 2011, the city of Philadelphia — where approximately one quarter of the state's Hispanic population lives — agreed as part of settlement of a class action lawsuit to reform its police department to reduce racial profiling. As of 2014, blacks and Hispanics were the subject of 80% of all police stops and 89% of all frisks in Philadelphia, despite accounting for just 51% of the city population. Across the state, Hispanics are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of whites — a larger disparity than any state other than Mississippi and West Virginia.\n\nPennsylvania also has some of the worst income inequality in the nation. Some 30.0% of the Hispanic population lives in poverty, the third largest share of any state and far more than the white poverty rate of 9.2%. The 20.8 percentage point gap in poverty is the largest of any state.\n\nMore:The fastest growing (and shrinking) states: A closer look\n\n1. Massachusetts\n\nPct. residents Hispanic: 10.9% (18th highest)\n\nHomeownership rate: 26.0% (Hispanic), 69.3% (white)\n\nUnemployment rate: 6.5% (Hispanic), 3.5% (white)\n\nIncarcerated people per 100,000: 928 (Hispanic), 241 (white)\n\nBy a number of socioeconomic measures — poverty, income, educational attainment, unemployment, and incarceration — Massachusetts has the worst inequality between its white and Hispanic residents of any state. While the typical white household in Massachusetts earns $82,029 a year — the fifth most of any state — the median income for Hispanic households is just $39,742. The gap of more than $42,000 is the largest of any state and nearly three times the national gap.\n\nIncome inequality, as well as factors such as discriminatory lending and rising rents, can reduce the difficulty of owning home for minorities. Just 26.0% of Hispanic heads of household own their homes, far less than the 69.3% white homeownership. The 43.3 percentage-point gap in homeownership is the largest of any state.\n\nMore on the findings\n\nHispanic and Latino is a blanket designation that covers a wide range of Spanish-speaking and Latin American countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, and Spain, to name a few.\n\nIn an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Valerie Wilson, director of the Director, Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy for the non-partisan think tank Economic Policy Institute, explained that the composition of the Hispanic and Latino population in a given state varies widely based on the region of the country. [In] the West, Southwest we're talking largely about Mexican Americans. If we're looking in Florida we're largely going to be looking at Cuban Americans. If we're in the Northeast, we're looking at a larger percentage of Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, other possible variations.\n\nIn every state in the country, white residents are better off overall than Hispanic and Latino residents. In some states, however, the gaps in income, educational attainment, and incarceration are relatively small. This is often due in part to public policy designed to help integrate Spanish-speaking citizens.\n\nIn New Mexico, for example, 47.8% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, the largest share of any state. Due to the prevalence of Hispanics, the state government has enacted multiple protections for Spanish speakers. For one, all ballots and voting forms in the state are printed in Spanish and English, and the inability to speak English cannot restrict anyone from serving on a jury or holding elected office. Perhaps not surprisingly, New Mexico ranks better on this list than all but one other state. To be sure, four of the six states with the highest concentration of Hispanics and Latinos rank in the top half of this list.\n\nWhile some states with large Hispanic populations, such as New Mexico, exhibit less social and economic inequality, a small Hispanic population by no means will have greater inequality. In fact, three of the states with the smallest Hispanic populations, Vermont, West Virginia, and Maine, rank among the least unequal in the country.\n\nIn many of the states with smaller gaps between white and Hispanic residents, socioeconomic outcomes for white residents are not especially good. In West Virginia, for example, 17.4% of white residents live in poverty, the highest white poverty rate in the country. Due in part to a high white poverty rate, the poverty gap between the state's white and Hispanic residents is only 5.4 percentage points, nearly the smallest in the country. West Virginia is one of several states that ranks as better for Hispanics in which socioeconomic outcomes are poor across the board.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the worst states for Hispanic and Latino Americans, 24/7 Wall St. created an index of nine measures to assess gaps between the two demographic groups in each state. Creating the index in this way highlights disparities between racial groups rather than what may be a particularly poor socioeconomic climate in a state for both whites and Hispanics. For each measure, we constructed and normalized an index from the disparities between white and Hispanic Americans.

AP\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — First the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights. Soon, maybe, the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nOnce looked on with disdain by major sports leagues, this gambling city is now just 24 votes away from cashing in on one of the biggest sports jackpots ever.\n\nThe Raiders made it official Thursday by filing for relocation from Oakland to Las Vegas, the culmination of a whirlwind romance to bring an NFL team to a city that the league had previously gone out of its way to shun because of sports betting fears.\n\nLeague owners are expected to vote on the move in March, and it's hard to find anyone betting it won't happen.\n\nI don't know how you can put a price on this, said Steve Sisolak, a county commissioner who has been involved in the efforts to land the team. There are only 32 cities that can say they have an NFL team and we will be one of them.\n\nActually, there is a price on it. Tourists will pay increased room taxes to fund $750 million of the cost of a new $1.9 billion stadium as part of a deal rammed through a special session of the Nevada Legislature by powerful casino owner Sheldon Adelson's family.\n\nThe stadium will be just off the glittering Las Vegas Strip, where the Golden Knights will begin play this fall in a new arena of their own. The expansion hockey team is the first major sports franchise to call the city home.\n\nWithout the Golden Knights I don't know if the Raiders would have thought this was a viable market, Sisolak said. They kind of broke the glass ceiling.\n\nIf approved, the move would be the third announced by an NFL team in a year as the league undergoes a geographic shift unlike any in recent history. The Rams returned to Los Angeles from St. Louis this season, while the San Diego Chargers will begin play in LA next season.\n\n(Raiders owner) Mark Davis is a man of his word and the filing of the Raiders' application for relocation of the franchise with the NFL is a significant step in bringing the team to Las Vegas, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said.\n\nThe NFL has long been opposed to any association with Las Vegas, to the point where just a few years ago it refused to allow the city to advertise on the Super Bowl telecast because it offered legal betting. But the league's opposition has softened, and so has the stance of Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nI think there are some real strengths to the Las Vegas market, Goodell said at an owners' meeting last month. It's clear the Las Vegas market has become a more diversified market, more broadly involved with entertainment, hosting big events. And there's a growth to the market.\n\nLas Vegas, which has about 2.5 million people in the metropolitan area, would be a smaller market than the Bay Area. But fans from other cities are expected to fill a third of the proposed 65,000-seat stadium, and the team will also be able to draw on Raiders fans from throughout California.\n\nInfluential owners like Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots have spoken favorably about the prospects of a move, and Raiders owner Mark Davis has been lobbying behind the scenes to secure the votes of three-fourths of the 32 owners needed for relocation.\n\nThe vote is expected to take place during league meetings March 26-29 in Phoenix.\n\nDavis did not comment Thursday on the relocation application, but has made no secret of his commitment to Las Vegas. At a stadium meeting last year in the city he brought along a program from a 1964 American Football League exhibition game in the city where the Raiders beat the Houston Oilers.\n\nDavis has said the team will continue to play in Oakland until the Las Vegas stadium is finished, likely by the 2020 season. There are two sites currently being looked at for the stadium, both adjacent to the Strip.\n\nOne possible hang-up could be Adelson's participation in the project. He's the one who initiated conversations with Davis last January, and was instrumental in getting a tax increase passed by the state legislature in October.\n\nAdelson's family has offered $650 million toward the stadium, but has reached no deal with the Raiders yet. Team representatives say they have secured the funding to replace Adelson's investment in case a deal isn't reached. NFL rules prohibit casino operators from having ownership roles in teams.\n\nAndy Abboud, the executive working on the project for Adelson, called the filing one of those moments that makes it real and vowed that necessary negotiations will be completed.\n\nThe people of Las Vegas should be excited that the NFL is coming to town, Abboud told AP. Business deals take time to work out, but everything will work out in the end.\n\nThe Raiders have two one-year options to play at the Oakland Coliseum in 2017 and 2018 and are already taking season ticket renewals for next season. But the Raiders have largely ignored a proposal by former player Ronnie Lott to build a new stadium in Oakland to keep the team permanently.\n\nWe are in this game and we are playing to win, Lott's group said in a statement, vowing to push ahead.\n\nUnder Davis' father, Hall of Fame owner Al Davis, the Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982 then returned to the East Bay in 1995.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Ken Ritter in Las Vegas and AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
Conversations about police brutality reached a fever pitch last summer after the death of George Floyd, and a new Dateline NBC special Thursday aims to further that conversation.\n\nThe families of three Black men – Floyd, Eric Garner and Jacob Blake, who died or were injured at the hands of police – are speaking out in the new special, Journey for Justice (10 EST/PST), hosted by NBC News anchor Craig Melvin. The special coincides with complaints by civil rights leaders that law enforcement aggressively pushed back on Black Lives Matter demonstrations but failed to curb Wednesday's attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThursday night, we devote just as much time talking about potential solutions as we do to talking about the problems, Melvin says. The special features interviews with Floyd's siblings, Blake's father and sister, and Garner's mother and son.\n\nThe death of Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck, ignited protests of racial injustice across the country, including a March on Washington in late August.\n\nMelvin chronicled the aftermath of George Floyd's death, from his funeral proceedings to protests.\n\nWhen you're covering a story like that, day in and day out for a couple of months, it's easy to lose sight of the big picture – whether it's policy implications or cultural implications, because you get so caught up in the day-to- day, he says. Dateline producers approached him about advancing coverage of racial injustice. He thought about Gwen Carr, Garner's mother, whom he had come to know over the years through interviews and funerals. Garner died in 2014 after a police officer put him in a choke hold.\n\nI would interview Gwen when an unarmed black man was shot and killed or died at the hands of police. (Carr) would be at the funeral, Melvin says. She agreed to join him on the show.\n\nI knew that once we got these families in a room together, it was going to be emotional and raw, Melvin adds. We wanted them to talk about being a part of this club that no one wants to be a part of, but we also wanted the conversation to be an impetus for a larger conversation about solutions.\n\nThe first segment of the hourlong special focuses on the families' stories, and how they were thrust into a sudden spotlight that most people can't fathom. But it goes beyond that.\n\nIt was important to us to not just focus on the retelling of stories that we've become familiar with, but to focus on solutions to problems that we can all acknowledge exist, Melvin says.\n\nThe segment also features perspectives of Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), civil rights attorney Ben Crump; Jim Palmer, the executive director of Wisconsin's Professional Police Association; and Yale University professor Phillip Goff.\n\nBlake's father, Jacob Blake Sr., grows visibly emotional discussing his son's case. In August, a police officer shot him in the back, leaving him paralyzed. Kenosha County, Wisconsin, district attorney Michael Graveley said earlier this week the officer, Rusten Sheskey, will not be charged.\n\nThe families also discuss last summer's March on Washington. It's one thing to talk to one or two people about your loss and what that person meant to you, Melvin says. Or in Jacob Blake Sr.'s case, not your loss, but having (your child's) life changed in a dramatic way in a few seconds. But it's another thing entirely when you are surrounded by other people who have similar stories.\n\nIn a preview moment shared on the Today Show, Blake Sr. can be seen breaking down in tears. Melvin approaches situations like these with grace.\n\nWhen someone is talking about the death of a loved one, or someone's talking about a loved one being injured in an unimaginable way, I never interrupt or stop a mother or father, sister, brother, a child from grieving during an interview, he says.\n\nHe has found over the years that for these people, it's cathartic. Sometimes I'm just a vessel that allows them to grieve, and to say things that they've been wanting to say, he says.\n\nMelvin wants audiences to empathize with them and to comprehend the humanity of some of the people that we've lost, who've been injured in police custody, that they understand a little bit more about who these people were, he says.\n\nHe's also eager for viewers to listen to solutions that family members, lawmakers and police unions are proposing – and it's not about defunding the police.\n\nThese families didn't spend two hours talking about how defunding the police would have kept their loved ones alive. That's not the focus, he says.\n\nAwful:'Today' anchor Craig Melvin's brother Lawrence Meadows dead at 43 of colon cancer\n\nIn case you missed:No charges against Kenosha police in Jacob Blake shooting, DA says; officer 'felt he was about to be stabbed'
Steve King, the Iowa Republican who has been at the center of controversy for months, took the House floor on Friday to address criticism he's faced on statements he made about white nationalism and white supremacy in a New York Times article.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, yielded his time to King as the House debated the southern border wall funding impasse. King used the time to say he made a freshman mistake talking with a New York Times reporter without recording the interview.\n\nBut one phrase in that long article has created an unnecessary controversy, King said. That was my mistake.\n\nThe quote that King said sparked heartburn appeared in the article published Thursday about King's role in the U.S.-Mexico border wall discussion and President Donald Trump's immigration policy.\n\n► More:\n\nWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? King told the Times reporter. Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\n\nOn the House floor, King said the quote was taken out of context. King argued he was saying terms like white supremacist, white nationalist and Nazi were almost always unjustly labeling otherwise innocent people.\n\nIt was about how those words got plugged into our dialogue, not when the words became offensive, which is what the technical interpretation of it is, King said. It's how did that offensive language get injected into our political dialogue.\n\nThe 4th district representative also issued a news release Thursday denouncing white nationalism and white supremacy. However, that has not stopped the barrage of condemnations from Republicans and others over the controversial quote.\n\nKing told reporters that he wasn't told by Republican leadership that they were condemning his comments, but he also hasn't received signals that further punishment is coming.\n\nFellow Republican Sen. Tim Scott penned a scathing opinion piece for the Washington Post criticizing King's comments and arguing that Republicans can't be silent when it comes to bigotry. The South Carolina senator also told Fox news that King should take a step back from the damage that he is doing to our country and frankly to our party.\n\nFellow conservatives have been condemning King for months, even prior to the 2018 midterm election where King narrowly beat Democrat challenger J.D. Scholten.\n\nLast October, U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, disavowed King in a statement on Twitter. Three major U.S. companies also announced they will no longer donate campaign money to King.\n\nNow, King faces two primary challengers, Iowa Sen. Randy Feenstra and Bret Richards.
Senate Approves Haley as US Ambassador to UN\n\nThe Senate has voted decisively to approve President Donald Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Senators confirmed South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for the post, 96-4, despite her lack of foreign policy experience. (Jan. 24)
During his first round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship on Thursday, Jordan Spieth found himself on the wrong side of the European Tour's new bulked-up slow play policy.\n\nAfter his group fell behind, Spieth and his playing partners were placed on what golf fans know as the clock. Since Spieth's group was out of position relative to the group ahead of it, each player in the group was given 40 seconds to hit their shots in an effort to get the group back into position. Spieth took more than his allotted time thinking he had enough to spare and was issued a warning for it. If he does it again at anytime during the rest of the tournament, he'll get a fine.\n\nThis may seem excessive and the truth is, it's completely reasonable to think the European Tour is trying to make an example out of Spieth. Slow play has been a persistent issue across golf that always culminates in the majors when the pressure is at its highest and players take extra long to hit their shots. And that's hardly the best time for something as ponderous as slow play to at it's height, considering that's when the most eyeballs are on golf.\n\nPGA Tour should not only reveal slow-play fines, it should keep a running fine-list leaderboard. Use peer pressure, public opinion. — Gary VanSickle (@GaryVanSickle) January 21, 2016\n\nSo know the European Tour is upping the stakes. It's starting to enforce penalties to get pros moving faster. Truth is, fans would probably be fine should rules officials choose to be overly-harsh if it means pros finish their rounds faster. Rounds have gotten increasingly slower, and the PGA Tour hasn't awarded penalty strokes for slow play since 1995.\n\nSo bravo European Tour! Let's hope they keep bringing the muscle.
Major League Baseball's desire to bring uniformity to even the darkest corners of its game frequently runs head-on into the unwritten rules and accepted practices of its players.\n\nA defamation lawsuit brought by a middleman in this tango lays this conflict bare, ensnaring some of the biggest pitchers in the game.\n\nIn court filings opposing MLB and the Los Angeles Angels' motion to dismiss his lawsuit, former Angels visiting clubhouse manager Brian Bubba Harkins revealed in specific detail the long-accepted pitchers' use of foreign substances on baseballs to maintain a better grip, a practice rooted in safety but now facing greater scrutiny for its benefit in helping pitchers spin the baseball.\n\nHarkins, hired as an Angels batboy in 1981, was the club's visiting clubhouse manager from 1990 until his March 3, 2020 firing, less than a week after MLB distributed a memo noting team employees were banned from facilitating the use of foreign substances by players.\n\nHarkins admits to providing pine tar-like mixtures to both Angels and visiting players but his suit contends he did not doctor baseballs, and notes that the club's firing framed him as a turncoat for providing substances both to Angels pitchers and opponents – a practice his own club was well aware of.\n\nHarkins' firing startled many in the game, including at least one future Hall of Famer, and opposition briefs filed Thursday revealed a stable of pitchers with career earnings that will approach $1 billion who relied on Harkins for substances to aid their craft.\n\nBubba, it's JV, two-time Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander said in a March 6, 2020 text message to Harkins according to court filings obtained by USA TODAY Sports. Firstly, I'm so sorry to hear about this. Please give me a shout whenever you can.\n\nIn a subsequent phone conversation, Harkins recounts Verlander confirming that the league has let this go on for 100 years, that it was (expletive) that Harkins' name was circulated in the media and reiterated a longstanding complaint that baseballs are wound too tightly.\n\nHe also said MLB had learned teams hired chemists and commissioned studies to come up with stuff more advanced to create spin rate, using that proprietary information to lure free-agent pitchers.\n\nMLB and the Angels both declined comment, citing the ongoing litigation.\n\nThe Houston Astros, already in MLB's crosshairs thanks to their sign-stealing scandal, have long been a target of not-so-subtle accusations that they were pushing the margins of acceptable practice in boosting their pitchers' spin rate. Verlander and Gerrit Cole's uptick in performance upon joining the Astros in 2017 and 2018, respectively, drew particular scrutiny.\n\nHarkins' filing produced a January 2019 text message from Cole, referred to the sticky situation he was in, complete with winking eye emoji, noting that the Astros would not visit Anaheim until May and played road games in cold-weather series before then.\n\nThe stuff I had last year seizes up when it gets cold, Cole said, before apparently requesting a fresh supply of Harkins' mix.\n\nVerlander and Cole finished 1-2 in 2019 AL Cy Young voting, after which Cole signed a $324 million contract with the New York Yankees. In subsequent interviews, Cole cited Astros pitching coach Brent Strom's plans of attack, and not foreign substances, to explain his success in Houston.\n\nTrevor Bauer, the 2020 National League Cy Young winner and a current free agent, frequently jabbed at the Astros for their mysterious, and ostensibly nefarious, improvements in pitcher performance. Three days after he appeared on HBO's Real Sports and estimated some 70% of pitchers were using foreign substances, MLB's Feb. 28, 2020 memo from Young was distributed, stating: Although not expressly addressed in the Official Baseball Rules, under the policy of our office, Club personnel are strictly prohibited from providing, applying, creating, concealing, or otherwise facilitating the use of foreign substances by players on the field. Any persons employed by or acting at the direction of the Club, including but not limited to players, coaches, uniformed personnel, dugout staff, clubhouse staff, and equipment staff found to have assisted players in the use of foreign substances in violation of the Official Baseball Rules will be subject to discipline by the Commissioner, including suspensions without pay.\n\nHarkins was fired later that week, a move startling enough that Angels bench coach Mike Gallego, who knew Harkins as a staffer and a player, texted him: I just wanted to say I am sorry that this game is using you as a scapegoat!! You have been a PRO all these years and will always be a brother to all of us in this fraternity!\n\nHarkins' fraternity spanned the entire major leagues. Former Angels closer Troy Percival, Harkins said, developed the substance that Harkins distributed, and cited a swath of Angels pitchers spanning several eras that used it, from Percival to Brendan Donnelly to active big leaguers Cam Bedrosian, Keynan Middleton, Yusmeiro Petit, Matt Andriese and Dylan Bundy.\n\nVisiting players, the filing stated, who obtained the substance upon visiting the affable Harkins' quarters included Cole and Verlander, and various All-Star or veteran stalwarts like Max Scherzer, Felix Hernandez, Edwin Jackson, Cory Kluber and Adam Wainwright.\n\nHarkins' filing in opposition to strike MLB's attempt to dismiss the lawsuit includes testimony from former major leaguers Wally Joyner and Mike Sweeney, who recount several anecdotes from their playing careers in which umpires blatantly ignored Rule 6.02, which bans foreign substances.\n\nBrian Harkins did not distribute an 'illegal substance' to anyone, Joyner and Sweeney state. There was nothing 'illegal' about what Brian Harkins did nor the substances he mixed for them. He was just doing his job.\n\nHarkins' filing contends that umpires' failure to enforce Rule 6.02 – and players' general acceptance of flouting it – rendered it irrelevant. And it perhaps unintentionally distills why the Astros' sign-stealing provoked such outrage within the game and among its fans – while a firing of a rules-flouting employee was viewed as scapegoating.\n\nBaseball, the filing states, is a game; it can be played however the players and umpires see fit.
WASHINGTON — Lawmakers quickly reacted after Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at U.S. troops and coalition forces in Iraq on Tuesday, an apparent retaliation for a U.S. drone strike days earlier that killed one of Tehran's most powerful generals, Qasem Soleimani.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was gathered with Democrats discussing impeachment and the House's agenda Tuesday evening when a staff member brought in a note, informing her of the strike.\n\nMore:Pentagon: Iran launched 'more than a dozen' missiles at bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops\n\nPelosi paused, told members what had happened and said we've got to pray, according to Rep. Debbie Dingell who was present for the meeting.\n\nShe's a Catholic woman like me, Dingell said. We all care deeply about our military men and women that are serving this country.\n\nSoon after, Pelosi tweeted that she was Closely monitoring the situation following bombings targeting U.S. troops in Iraq. We must ensure the safety of our servicemembers, including ending needless provocations from the Administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence. America & world cannot afford war.\n\nVice President Mike Pence briefed top Democrats in Congress on the Iranian strikes, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe New York Democrat did not release a statement Tuesday night, but spoke on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, saying that We commend the professionalism and bravery of our service members and other personnel in harm's way.\n\nHe continued that he condemns the attack by the Iranian government and remain concerned about the risk of a further escalation of hostilities in the Middle East.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was briefed by the White House tonight, too, and tweeted that we must be united in the fight against terrorism and those who would do our country harm. America's full support is with our courageous service men and women standing the watch.\n\nWith reports of missile strikes launched by Iran against U.S. bases in Iraq, my thoughts and prayers are with our service members, diplomats and other personnel at risk, and with their families, Judiciary Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted.\n\nOn Fox News, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., stated that he just got off the phone with Trump about the situation and that if Iran continues this crap they are going to wake up one day out of the oil business.\n\nThis was an act of war, Sean, by any reasonable definition, Graham continued, before declaring that the President has all the authority he needs under Article II to respond. How he responds is yet to be determined.\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul, who has been critical of the airstrike and escalation against Iran, tweeted that he is praying for the safety of our troops in Iraq tonight. While I would have preferred they come home long ago, there is also no excuse for this action by Iran.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that #Iran is now openly calling for American's to turn on each other. The time will come to debate U.S. policy. Tonight American & allied troops have come under direct attack by a nation-state & Americans must come together to support & protect them & respond appropriately.\n\nBoth Sens. Kamala Harris, D-CA, and Amy Klobuchar, D-MN, tweeted they were monitoring the situation and thinking of the servicemembers.\n\nFor everyone's sake, I pray there are no casualties and that #Iran does not continue its escalation, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., posted.\n\nFreshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., tweeted that War doesn't have a reset button, I learned this lesson at the age of Eight. Lives will be lost, many innocent lives will be lost and the future of generations will be impacted. Let's call for peace.\n\nSpeaking at a 2020 campaign rally tonight in Brooklyn, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts stated, At this moment, my heart and my prayers are with our military and with their families in Iraq and all around the world. This is a reminder why we need to deescalate tension in the Middle East. The American people do not want a war with Iran.\n\nRep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., tweeted, As we pray for our troops & civilians, there is still no coherent strategy from @realDonaldTrump. The White House can't adequately answer simple questions like, what are our goals with Iran? Did a drone strike advance those goals? Does Iraq voting us out advance those goals?\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, Tom Vanden Brook, John Fritze
Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields is expected to play in the College Football Playoff championship game against Alabama after suffering an injury to his torso in a 49-28 win against Clemson, Ohio State coach Ryan Day said Monday.\n\nDay would not say if Fields's ribs were broken or bruised.\n\nWe don't get into specifics on injuries, Day said. We give our availability report at the end of the week, and that's always been our policy.\n\nFields was scheduled to attend a news conference Monday in advance of next week's game in Miami Gardens, Florida. But then he was said to be unavailable and replaced by running back Trey Sermon.\n\nDay did say that Fields told him he felt better waking up in the morning (Saturday) than he expected, one day after the Buckeyes won the Sugar Bowl.\n\nFields, a transfer from Georgia, suffered the injury in the second quarter of his team's victory in the national semifinal. Clemson linebacker James Skalski smashed into the right side of Fields' torso with the crown of his helmet – a collision that was deemed to be illegal targeting by Skalski, causing his ejection from the game.\n\nFields, 21, left the game for one play but grimaced in pain the rest of the night. He still completed 22 of 28 passes for 385 yards and six touchdown passes, four of which came after the injury, including a 9-yard pass on the first play after Fields returned to the field and then two long touchdown in the second half of 56 and 45 yards.\n\nI thought that was one of the gutsiest performances I've ever seen, Day said Monday.\n\nAfter the game, Fields said he received an injection in the medical tent to help him return to action. He said he felt pain after every throw and that my whole right torso was messed up. He said at the time he did not know the diagnosis of his injury.\n\nI leave all that stuff up to our medical people who are the best in the country, Day said Monday. Justin is such a competitive guy. He wasn't going to come of the field. That's just the way he's wired. You were going to have to pull him off the field. It was pretty amazing performance.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer. E-mail: bschrotenb@usatoday.com
Timothy Meinch\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nBen Carson won applause from a crowd of supporters Monday night when he announced he's sticking in the presidential race with intensified opposition to dirty tricks from other campaigns.\n\nI'm not going anywhere, the Republican presidential candidate said around 9:15 p.m. at his caucus night party in West Des Moines. Results showed the Republican candidate in a secure fourth place.\n\nBut the campaign expressed frustration after early rumors circling that Carson would drop out of the race. The rumors swirled on social media before Iowans even started caucusing, and campaign staff said they received texts and emails from precinct chairs who said Cruz supporters perpetuated the rumor in their caucus site speeches.\n\nCarson leaves Iowa for 'fresh set of clothes'\n\nTed Cruz gets major win over Donald Trump in Iowa\n\nThe Cruz campaign denied any involvement when asked by The Des Moines Register Monday.\n\nOur campaign hasn't been pushing this whatsoever. If any surrogate said anything it would have been based on something else someone reported, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said.\n\nCarson called out the tactic during his speech to supporters.\n\nThis latest set of dirty tricks just intensifies my desire to work extremely hard to break down the ugliness in this system and bring it back, Carson said.\n\nThe campaign said Carson was flying to Florida on Monday night only to pick up clean clothes before resuming his campaign in New Hampshire later this week.\n\nCarson, who has repeatedly declined to attack rival GOP candidates, touted a conservative message aimed at dismantling political correctness and progressive left values. His platform focuses on reducing the national debt for the next generation, bolstering the military and preserving Christian values. Carson's campaign also centered on his personal story of faith and leveraging education to overcome inner-city poverty, which earned him a storybook career as a globally-known neurosurgeon.\n\nCarson in the fall briefly commanded the lead in Iowa among Republican caucusgoers.\n\nBut his slide in polling came along with criticism his knowledge of foreign policy when the threat of ISIS became a centerpiece in the presidential race.\n\nIn early January, Carson's campaign manager and several top staffers resigned. Barry Bennett went on to serve as an informal adviser for the Donald Trump campaign.\n\nCarson described the staff transition as a much-needed staff shakeup that placed a retired Army General, Maj. Robert Dees, in charge.\n\nThis is just the beginning, he told the crowd of supporters in West Des Moines Monday.\n\nContributing: The Des Moines Register's Matthew Patane
AP\n\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Golfers on the European Tour have a new item of clothing to pack in their suitcases.\n\nThe tour said Wednesday it will allow players to wear shorts during practice rounds and pro-ams after the policy was passed unanimously by a tournament committee in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIan Poulter backed the move, tweeting on Wednesday: Its 2016 not 1990. Get rid of the stuffy old rules that hold golf back. Make it more fun (for) everyone.\n\nPlayers must still wear long pants in tournament play, although Rory McIlroy is open for that to change, too.\n\nMaybe. Why not? McIlroy said. It really depends if guys are comfortable or not. I don't think it takes anything away from the tradition of the game or etiquette or how guys look on the course.\n\nWe're not going to go out in shorts at the British Open if it's 10 degrees (50 degrees F) and raining. But at the same time, if we're playing in a hot country and it's more comfortable for guys to wear shorts, then there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to.\n\nLee Westwood and European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke played practice rounds in shorts at the Abu Dhabi Championship on Tuesday. Westwood was among the European players to wear shorts in humid conditions at the EurAsia Cup in Malaysia last week.\n\nCaddies can wear shorts on the PGA Tour, but not players.\n\nIt's awesome. It will be something that I would love to see on the PGA Tour, as well, said top-ranked Jordan Spieth, who is competing in Abu Dhabi. Guys seem to all love it over here. I've not heard one person, one tour player complain about it.\n\nSpieth was just annoyed he didn't get the memo ahead of his practice round Wednesday.\n\nI just wish that my hotel was closer, said Spieth, who was wearing long pants. I would have gone back.\n\nThe European Tour also announced a new Pace of Play policy on Wednesday, which CEO Keith Pelley hopes will cut rounds by at least 15 minutes.\n\nInstead of being warned initially for slow play, players will be monitored by a referee. If they still exceed the time permitted of 40 seconds (plus 10 seconds if playing first in a group), they'll receive a monitoring penalty and be timed from the next tee. Two monitoring penalties or bad times will earn a player a fine of 2,600 euros ($2,840).\n\nIs this the emphatic answer? No, said Pelley, who has made slow play a key issue since joining the tour last year. Are we going to continue to monitor it and look for other ways? Absolutely.\n\nJohn Paramor, the tour's chief referee, said the reaction to the revised policy has been extremely positive.
WASHINGTON – Nancy Pelosi, who took the gavel as House speaker Thursday, told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview that President Donald Trump can expect a different world from the first two years of his presidency when the GOP controlled both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe California Democrat plans to confront Trump on many fronts, from investigating the deaths of immigrant children in U.S. custody to demanding Trump's tax returns and protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nThose clashes loom as Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues remain locked in a budget and border security battle with Trump that has left parts of the federal government shut for nearly two weeks.\n\nThe election of speaker was one of the first orders of business for the new Congress sworn in Thursday, when Democrats took control of the House for the first time in eight years.\n\nTrump warned that investigations of him and his administration would lead to a war-like posture in Washington. The new speaker made clear she won't shrink from a fight.\n\nHe was used to serving with a Republican Congress, House and Senate that was a rubber stamp to him. That won't be the case, Pelosi said in the USA TODAY interview just before the holidays. Oversight of government by the Congress is our responsibility.\n\nThat's the role that we play.\n\nDespite calls from some on the left wing of her party to try to remove Trump from office, Pelosi said the efforts to serve as a check on Trump's power don't extend to impeachment – at least not yet. She remains intent on protecting Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nMore:In Trump era, Nancy Pelosi admits to nostalgia about George W. Bush. Here's why\n\nMore:Nancy Pelosi and Jim McGovern: House Democrats will restore transparency, ethics, unity\n\nMore:Here's what Democrats will do to immediately change the House\n\nIf there's to be grounds for impeachment of President Trump – and I'm not seeking those grounds – that would have to be so clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it before I think we should go down any impeachment path, Pelosi said.\n\nI keep coming back to the same word: the facts, she said. The facts will indicate a path, and I don't think we should impeach a president for any political reason, but I don't think we can ignore any behavior that requires attention and that was all based on the facts.\n\nOne of the first moves Democrats will take to try to check the power of the White House and Republicans will be the unveiling of an anti-corruption bill designed to ease obstacles to voting, curb the role of big money in politics and hold politicians and government officials to higher ethical standards. The plan's supporters want to require presidents to release their taxes – something Trump has refused to do.\n\nNewly armed with subpoena power, Democrats are likely to investigate potential conflicts of interest between Trump's businesses and his role in setting policy for his administration, as well as possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether Trump and his family have financial ties to Russia. Democrats are also likely to subpoena Trump's tax returns.\n\nJim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, said oversight of the Trump administration will be a target-rich environment, but as speaker, Pelosi will have an important role in guiding the broad parameters of the investigations.\n\nShe'll give the chairmen wide latitude, don't get me wrong, but it's all going to be coordinated by the leadership, Manley said. That's just how she rolls.\n\n'War room-style effort'\n\nFor the past two years, members of Pelosi's team have held weekly strategy meetings with top policy and communication staffers from several committees with oversight powers. They have focused on exposing scandals among administration officials who have since left their positions, allegations of Trump's conflicts of interests, the handling of security clearances and aspects of the Russia investigation.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the corruption, cronyism and incompetency in this administration, it's definitely a war room-style effort, said Ashley Etienne, a Pelosi spokesperson who leads communication work on oversight for Democrats.\n\nAs House speaker from 2007 to 2011 and as minority leader before and after that, Pelosi, 78, named close allies to the House Intelligence Committee, the only committee whose membership is controlled by party leaders and the committee that's the central player in the Russia investigation.\n\nShe is a former ranking member of the committee, and she may be more deeply involved in its work than any other, said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the incoming chairman.\n\nHer involvement isn't at the level of specific investigative threads or witnesses, he said. It's more at the level of the Gang of Eight, the intelligence committee and party leaders who are briefed on covert actions.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting the Mueller investigation, her position is part of a consensus, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the incoming House Judiciary Committee chairman.\n\nNancy certainly agrees with that, and she pushed that, Nadler said.\n\nCaution on impeachment\n\nPelosi's own caution about impeachment hasn't stopped some Democrats from twice voting for impeachment. A House resolution was defeated 355 to 66 on Jan. 19, 2018.\n\nThe group Need to Impeach, which is headquartered in her district and funded by billionaire activist Tom Steyer, gathered 6.5 million signatures in support of impeachment – and expects Pelosi to come around.\n\nThe Democrats nationally want action around Trump, said Kevin Mack, lead strategist for Need to Impeach. We as a party have to prove that we can represent Democratic values. So I don't think Nancy Pelosi can be a speed bump on impeachment forever.\n\nOthers said part of her caution about impeachment comes from watching Republicans go after President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal – and lose House seats in 1998. The House, then dominated by Republicans, voted to impeach Clinton after the election, but he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nGOP pollster Frank Luntz said Americans could welcome the oversight of the Trump administration if they feel it is being done for the right reasons.\n\nOn the flip side, Luntz said, If they think it's oversight for political gain, they will reject it.\n\nTrump has sought to rally his political base by portraying Democrats as intent on taking him down. Alex Conant, a former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Clinton benefited from overzealous Republicans during the Lewinsky scandal.\n\nBecause of that, Conant said, Pelosi will need to walk a fine line.\n\nPelosi's role will be to negotiate big policy matters with the White House ... and then to try to limit and guide the investigations behind the scenes, said Conant, a White House spokesman during President George W. Bush's second term. Clearly, the Trump administration would love nothing more than for Democrats to overreach and go on fishing expeditions.\n\nPelosi is not only the first woman to become House speaker but she is one of just a handful of people who won multiple terms in the post.\n\nShe is admired by some in the party for her legislative prowess. Getting Obamacare over the finish line is one example of that.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said in November on The Axe Files podcast that Pelosi isn't always the best on a cable show or with a quick soundbite, but he called her an extraordinary partner and praised her as one of the most effective legislative leaders that this country's ever seen.\n\nCoastal elite caricature\n\nShe's seen by Republicans and some Democrats as the personification of a coastal elite. Her Hawaii trip during the government shutdown fed into that criticism.\n\nDuring the 2018 midterm campaign, the GOP ran constant ads hammering her, pointing out that her favorability rating was underwater. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from mid-December had her at 41 percent unfavorable, 28 percent favorable. That same poll had Trump at 52 percent unfavorable, 37 percent favorable.\n\nThe campaign featured scathing attacks on Pelosi from Trump and Republicans. Even some Democrats sought to distance themselves from Pelosi. She worked on strategy behind the scenes and hauled in $135.6 million for Democrats this cycle, including $129 million directly for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to her office. She prevailed, and Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats.\n\nPelosi has historically appeared to be proper and relied on this grandmother image, but she's actually a very strong, determined woman, said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. Her relationship with Trump will be a stunning dynamic to watch, Speier said, because Trump hasn't had to deal with anyone like her before – a mother of five children who knows how to deal with bratty behavior.\n\nThe president has been successful in bullying people into doing things – that's how he makes his deals, she said. He's got to change his strategy, or he will fail.\n\nAfter Democrats won the House, Pelosi faced opposition in her bid for speaker, but she stamped out a centrist rebellion by agreeing to limit her term to just four more years. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, considered challenging Pelosi for the top spot – until Pelosi announced that Fudge would chair a subcommittee focused on elections and voting issues, one of her signature issues.\n\nRepublicans grudgingly admire her toughness and ability to hold her caucus together. Pelosi plays the blood sport of politics better than the past three GOP speakers, said Tim Cameron, a Republican strategist who worked for the House GOP conference under Speaker John Boehner.\n\nHer ability to dispel potential rivals is literally unrivaled, Cameron said.\n\nI think every Republican speaker since 2010 has been jealous of what she was able to get done from 2006 to 2010. She never really had the issues that we had with the conservative wing of the party, Cameron said.\n\nLecturing Trump\n\nThough much of Pelosi's legislative dealmaking is done behind the scenes, the country witnessed her latest toe-to-toe battle with Trump on government funding during a televised meeting Dec. 11 in the Oval Office.\n\nRepublicans pounced on Pelosi for saying the GOP didn't have the votes in the House for a border wall. The House passed $5.7 billion in funding for the wall Dec. 20, but the bill didn't get a vote in the Senate, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Trump to abandon the wall.\n\nPelosi told USA TODAY that the House vote was another example of Trump's rubber stamp Congress.\n\nI know that many of them did not really believe in that, but they gave him the vote anyway, for whatever reason, she said.\n\nPelosi's allies pointed to that Oval Office meeting – when the president said he'd be proud to shut down the government – as the latest example of Pelosi holding her own. She lectured Trump on negotiating with Congress, then donned sunglasses as she left the White House, in a moment that lit up the internet.\n\nSpeier recalled attending a holiday party with Pelosi the weekend after the meeting with the president. Women approached the pair to thank them for their work and compliment Pelosi for standing up to Trump.\n\nI said, 'We're sassy,'  Speier recalled to USA TODAY. And then Nancy says, No, we're badasses.' 
Ron Barnett\n\nThe Greenville (S.C.) News\n\nClemson University denies allegations that it owed a duty of care to a fraternity pledge who died during a fraternity run in September 2014.\n\nIn court documents filed this week, the university answered allegations made in a lawsuit brought by the parents of Tucker Hipps, including that he was forced to walk along a narrow railing of the State 93 bridge over Lake Hartwell. The university argued that Hipps may have contributed to his own death during the 2014 run.\n\nHis body was found in the water below the bridge late that afternoon, and the coroner said he died of head injuries which could have been caused by falling from the bridge onto large rocks in shallow water.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in April, but amended in November to include allegations drawn from testimony of someone who said he saw Hipps walking on the rail.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities have dismissed the alleged witness' statements as inconsistent with known facts.\n\nClemson was named as a defendant along with Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and three members of the fraternity.\n\nThe university denied that a member of the fraternity contacted a Clemson official asking permission to go for a pre-dawn run on Sept. 22, 2014. The lawsuit alleged that fraternity members got no reply to the emailed request and took that as acquiescence by the university.\n\nThe university also denied that such a run was a violation of its hazing policy.\n\nFraternity: Tucker Hipps' 'negligence' caused death\n\nClemson had no knowledge of Hipps being forced to walk the bridge rail, or that SigEp had a long tradition of requiring pledges to jump off the bridge and swim to shore as alleged in the lawsuit, its lawyers said in the filing.\n\nThe university also denied that it terminated abruptly Gail DiSabatino, its vice president of student affairs and said her termination of employment with Clemson University was not specifically related to the incident and/or death of Tucker Hipps.\n\nThe university announced her departure, without giving any reason, about two months after Hipps' death and the subsequent suspension of the fraternity. Her office oversees all student organizations, including fraternities.\n\nClemson denied that it knew or should have known that the acts or omissions of the (fraternity members) were dangerous, negligent, grossly negligent, or in contravention of the policies and expectations of the Defendant.\n\nIt also denied that Hipps' death resulted from the university's failing to communicate with fraternity members before the run and prohibiting it.\n\nThe Hipps family filed two lawsuits, one claiming wrongful death and the other personal injury. Both seek damages of at least $25 million.\n\nClemson's lawyers asserted the university couldn't be held liable for such monetary damages because of the state's tort claims law and asked that the case be dismissed.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump sought to lower tensions with Iran Wednesday, a day after Tehran fired more than a dozen rockets at Iraqi bases hosting U.S. troops, a move that raised fears the two countries were hurtling toward war.\n\nTrump used a nine-minute televised address to announce new sanctions on Iran and tout the might of U.S. armed services. But just as remarkable was what his address did not include: a direct threat to respond militarily to Iran's action, which was a retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.\n\nA U.S. official told USA TODAY that there were indications that Iran's attack on the bases was intended to send a message rather than to kill U.S. soldiers. Iran appears to have fired its missiles into areas of the bases that were unpopulated and where significant damage would be unlikely, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nStill, Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pushed back on the notion that Iran deliberately sought to minimize damage. Milley told reporters he believed the attacks were designed 'to kill personnel,' according to The Associated Press.\n\nFlanked by top military officials and members of his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, the president said there were no casualties from the attack and told Iran he saw a possibility for negotiation.\n\nWe want you to have a future and a great future – one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world, he said. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.\n\nTrump's speech:President warns Iran but says US 'ready to embrace peace with all who seek it'\n\nIran crisis:What you need to know about rising U.S.-Iran tensions after Soleimani's death\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif framed the attack as a measure of self defense in a tweet after the missiles landed.\n\nWe do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression, Zarif wrote.\n\nThe potential for mass casualties from Iran's attack was real: There are about 1,500 U.S., coalition and Iraqi troops at al Assad air base in Western Iraq, one of the sites Iran targeted. Precision drone and missile strikes by Iranian-backed forces in September that severely damaged oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia supported the belief that Iran has the capability to strike targets with lethal force.\n\nBut given the limited damage, the U.S. official said the attack appeared designed mainly for a domestic audience to show Iranians that the regime was responding to the killing of Soleimani. Iran has also repeatedly called for the U.S. to leave Iraq.\n\nThe Iranians know how to hit a target when they want to destroy it, said a second U.S. official with knowledge of Iranian capabilities who was not authorized to speak publicly. Such an attack would have caused grave damage, the official said. It is possible that more moderate elements in the Iranian government are pushing for restraint, the official said.\n\nA senior staff member on Capitol Hill said the Iranians appeared to deliberately choose their targets as a warning, not to inflict major damage.\n\nThe dizzying series of events this week marked a critical moment in Trump's presidency, testing a foreign policy that has rested on unwinding President Barack Obama's effort to reach out to Iran through a multination nuclear agreement that offered sanctions relief in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. Trump has long argued that agreement was too lenient on Iran.\n\nTo underscore the point, Trump vowed Iran would never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon during his presidency even before he said good morning in his remarks Wednesday.\n\nTrump, who has pledged to keep the U.S. out of foreign entanglements but also has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, said he would encourage NATO allies to become much more involved in the Middle East process.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran, already on the rise for the months, escalated dramatically after the U.S. killed Soleimani in a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport last week. Soleimani was the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force and one of the country's most powerful leaders.\n\nAdministration officials said Trump ordered the drone strike because Soleimani was plotting attacks on Americans in the Middle East and that he presented an imminent threat, though they have not detailed the extent of that planning.\n\nIran struck back late Tuesday – just before dawn in Iraq – firing more than a dozen missiles at U.S. troops and coalition forces in Erbil and at the al Assad base.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers expressed relief that Trump did not order further military action.\n\nIt's still a volatile situation, but I'm glad it hasn't escalated and there's still a chance at a resolution, said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who had introduced legislation to limit military action.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of the president, said Iran should heed Trump's words.\n\nTo the Iranian people and the regime: He's giving you a chance to end this peacefully, Graham said. He's given you a chance for peace and prosperity. You should take it.
AP\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Chris Boswell's pinpoint right leg and Le'Veon Bell's two dancing feet.\n\nThey do call it football, after all.\n\nIndeed, Bell spent much of Sunday watching the film Happy Feet.\n\nI wasn't nervous about the game, Bell said. I don't watch ESPN or NFL Live, because I know they'll talk about the game. I don't necessarily want to think about the game.\n\nI watch stuff like 'Happy Feet.'\n\nWho needs to reach the end zone when you have Bell chewing up yards and the clock, and Boswell setting an NFL playoff record with six field goals? Throw in a stingy Pittsburgh defense for most of Sunday night, and a multitude of mistakes by Kansas City, and the Steelers' 18-16 victory sent them into the AFC championship game.\n\nThe Steelers (13-5) needed to hold off a last-ditch threat by the Chiefs (12-5) before advancing to face New England next Sunday night for a spot in the Super Bowl. The Patriots won at Pittsburgh 27-16, but Ben Roethlisberger was injured and didn't play.\n\nI think it's going to be a showdown, Bell said. Two great quarterbacks going head to head. Two of the best teams in the AFC. It's time to settle it next week.\n\nSince 2001, the Patriots and Steelers have combined to win nine AFC titles.\n\nSpencer Ware's 1-yard touchdown run took Kansas City within 18-16. The Chiefs at first converted the 2-pointer to tie it, but tackle Eric Fisher — the first overall selection in the 2013 draft — was penalized for holding. The next try failed.\n\nWith 2:43 remaining, Justin Gilbert misplayed the kick return and was tackled at the Pittsburgh 5. Roethlisberger hit Antonio Brown for 7 yards on third down and Pittsburgh then ran out the clock, securing a ninth straight victory for the Steelers. The Chiefs have not won a home playoff game since 1994, losing five in a row.\n\nI feel like we left a lot of plays on the field that we should have made, linebacker Justin Houston said. We didn't; it's the playoffs, every play counts.\n\nThe scoring started furiously in the opening minutes, then the game became a kicking exhibition by Boswell, who also had six field goals in the regular season against Cincinnati. And Bell put on a virtuoso running performance, patiently finding holes and then exploding through them. He added a team-record 170 yards rushing to the 167 he had in a win over Miami last week.\n\nThe coaches put a lot of trust in me to get the job done, Bell said of his 30 carries. Just run hard. Just picked my spots where I could and run hard.\n\nThe Steelers became the first team to win a playoff game without a TD since eventual Super Bowl champion Indianapolis in the 2006 AFC divisional round at Baltimore.\n\nUsing a no-huddle attack almost to perfection early on, the Steelers drove deep into Kansas City territory. But they bogged down inside the 5 and Boswell made a 22-yard field goal.\n\nThe Chiefs were just as efficient on a six-play march capped by receiver Albert Wilson lining up in the backfield, then slipping uncovered into the end zone for a 5-yard score.\n\nPittsburgh's answer came on a 52-yard heave to All-Pro Brown, who somehow was covered by Houston. That led to Boswell's second field goal, a 38-yarder. He added a 36-yarder to cap a 14-play drive on which Pittsburgh again barely huddled.\n\nA clean game up until then turned to, well, turnovers, on successive series. Bud Dupree pounded Alex Smith, whose pass shot high into the air and was caught by linebacker Ryan Shazier.\n\nThe Steelers got to the Kansas City 5, where Frank Zombo leaped to deflect Roethlisberger's throw, and All-Pro safety Eric Berry — burned for 26 yards on the previously play — picked it off in the end zone.\n\nBoswell's fourth field goal, from 45 yards, made it 12-7 at the half. His 43-yarder, setting the franchise record for a postseason game and tying the league mark of five, came on Pittsburgh's first series of the second half. A 43-yarder midway in the fourth quarter gave Boswell the NFL record.\n\nIt's just about doing my job, Boswell said. Coming out here, put it through the yellow pipes. Don't really think too much. Don't think like I'm the guy or anything. I'm just doing my job and doing my one-eleventh for the team.\n\nKansas City's Cairo Santos got in on the kicking act with a 48-yarder to make it 15-10. At that point, 10 seconds from the end of the third quarter, the Chiefs were outgained 333 yards to 150.\n\nWEATHERMAN\n\nSwitching the game from noon local time to an evening kickoff to avert an ice storm had no effect on the crowd. Fans arrived early, tailgated in the rain as the worst of the storm never hit the area. But fog rolled into Arrowhead Stadium in the second quarter, obscuring some views from on high. Not that what was going on was worth watching for Chiefs fans.\n\nNOTES\n\nBell rushed for almost as many yards (101) in the first half as the Chiefs gained (106). Bell ran for 144 yards vs. Kansas City in October in his first game after a three-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy.... Boswell's four first-half field goals tied the team record for an entire playoff game. ... Chiefs All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce had a rough game, including a big drop and a 15-yard roughing penalty in the third period. He did finish with five catches for 77 yards. ... A sign of the Steelers' dominance for much of the night: Pittsburgh held the ball for 34:13, with Kansas City getting 7:06 of its possession time on its final drive.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSteelers: Head to New England for a shot at making the Super Bowl.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL

Brian Katulis and Peter Juul\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nPresident Donald Trump says Iran appears to be standing down after retaliating in a limited way to last week's U.S. strike killing Iran's top military commander, Qasem Soleimani. We will see whether that's true, at least from an overt military perspective. But we should not relax our vigilance when it comes to other types of threats to Americans and U.S. regional security partners.\n\nIran's capacity to conduct asymmetrical warfare, such as terrorist acts, targeted assassinations and cyberattacks, is far greater than its conventional military capabilities. That's where Iran is most likely to focus any additional retaliation.\n\nMaking contingency plans and bolstering our defenses against this type of retaliation will require the concerted effort of the U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security communities, and not just a resort to military tools and troop deployments. The nature of this work also requires deft diplomacy and close cooperation with a wide range of allies and security partners in the region and across the globe in the hopes of deterring further escalation of the conflict.\n\nIran's many partners in terrorism\n\nThe United States first designated Iran a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. In the decades since, Iran has cultivated a network of terrorist organizations, proxies and criminal organizations stretching from Afghanistan to West Africa and including the Western Hemisphere. This gives Iran a wide range of options in responding to Soleimani's death.\n\nNevertheless, Iran's primary strategic focus has been in its neighborhood — and it intensified efforts to build networks after U.S.-led wars removed two of Iran's chief rivals, the Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\n\nOne of Iran's key partners is Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite terrorist organization founded with Iran's support in 1982 during Israel's invasion of Lebanon. Hezbollah has served as a force multiplier for Iran in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, as both military advisers to other Iranian proxy groups and as combatants in their own right.\n\nU.S. officials have also linked Hezbollah to criminal enterprises like money laundering, human trafficking, drug smuggling and counterfeiting operations in the Western Hemisphere — including in the United States.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah just threatened the United States, saying America will pay a price for killing Soleimani. Though Hezbollah has never directly attacked the U.S. homeland, there is some evidence of attempts to position sleeper cells and develop operational capabilities in America. In June 2017, for instance, an individual was arrested in New York and charged with casing John F. Kennedy International Airport for a possible Hezbollah attack.\n\nReal-time test:Trump crisis mismanagement on full display with roll of dice on Iran, Iraq and Soleimani\n\nIran's Quds Force, a special unit in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has demonstrated its capability to use this network to carry out attacks both in the region and far from Iran, including in Europe, South America and South Asia. It even planned an attack against Saudi Arabia's ambassador in Washington, D.C., in 2011. More recently, France accused Iran of plotting a major terrorist attack in 2018.\n\nBeyond the asymmetric threats Iran poses through its terrorist network, Tehran also presents one of the most aggressive and innovative threats in the cyber realm. Iran will not seek to confront America directly and will look to take advantage of the asymmetric benefits that a cyberattack offers, so this threat will prove significant. The most likely targets will be closely associated with the U.S. government and possibly the U.S. financial sector, which Iran has previously attacked.\n\nTrump must be steadier on Iran\n\nOn both terrorism and cybersecurity, the United States will need to work closely with regional security partners and global allies to counter Iran. America has not suffered another devastating terrorist attack on the homeland since 9/11, and this is in large part due to the strong investments we've made to build the capacities and enhance the coordination of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. These institutions must advance with an evolving threat environment.\n\nThe United States should look for ways to use existing mechanisms and relationships, such as the Middle East Strategic Alliance and the 81-member Global Coalition against the Islamic State, to defend against terrorism and cyberattacks by Iran and to prevent further escalation.\n\nThis is personal:War with Iran is terrifying prospect for Americans with family in the Middle East, like me\n\nWe need to coordinate with our allies on intelligence collection, terror finance and targeted actions to keep Americans safe. We need to keep a close watch on Iran's propaganda efforts and find ways to build greater unity at home.\n\nAnd we need a more balanced and steady approach on Iran than we've seen in the past three years. We must restore trust and confidence in America's own intelligence and law enforcement institutions, not launch corrosive political inquisitions against them. We must work with our allies and partners around the world to defend against terrorism and cyberattacks, not undermine our credibility through social media bluster we're unwilling to back up.\n\nThe Trump administration's track record does not inspire confidence that it is either willing or able to take these steps. But to protect America, it must.\n\nBrian Katulis, a senior fellow for national security at the Center for American Progress and co-author of the 2008 book The Prosperity Agenda: What the World Wants from America — and What We Need in Return, is a Middle East expert who served in the Clinton White House, State Department and Defense Department.

WASHINGTON – House Democrats ramped up their defense of Obamacare on Wednesday, one of their first actions after midterm elections in which they won the House after pounding away on the issue of health care.\n\nDemocrats will vote to authorize House attorneys to oppose a challenge to the Affordable Care Act by Republican attorneys general. A Texas judge recently agreed with the attorneys general that the landmark health care law is unconstitutional.\n\nDemocrats made lowering prescription drug prices a top priority, one of the few issues on which they could find common ground with Republicans who control the Senate and White House. On another health care issue, Medicare for all, they face debate even within their own ranks on how far to go.\n\nThough prospects for legislative action are uncertain in a divided government, there is plenty going on in the courts this month that could affect people's insurance coverage.\n\nThe Trump administration's provision to make it easier for employers to exclude contraceptive coverage from insurance plans will go into effect Jan. 14 unless a judge intervenes. Courts are considering challenges to other ACA changes that the administration argued would give consumers more choices but that critics said would make insurance more expensive for those who need care.\n\nHere's a look at where things stand:\n\nObamacare challenge\n\nJudge Reed O'Connor, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled in December that the entire ACA is invalid. He said the Republican tax cut bill knocked the constitutional foundation out from under Obamacare by eliminating the penalty for not having coverage. The law, which remains intact during the appeals process, created not just the controversial Obamacare insurance plans but also many popular provisions in jeopardy such as protections for people with pre-existing conditions, an expanded drug benefit for seniors and coverage for young adults under their parents' insurance plans.\n\nHouse Democrats joined Democratic attorneys general in defending the law. University of Michigan law professors Nicholas Bagley and Richard Primus argued that the best way for Democrats to stop the latest ACA challenge is through legislation. Congress could make explicit what was implicit in the removal of the penalty for being uninsured – that the ACA does not hinge on a mandate to buy insurance.\n\nTrumpcare challenges\n\nAfter congressional Republicans failed to repeal the ACA, the Trump administration tried to write rules on its own. One would dramatically expand the ability of employers to exclude contraceptive coverage in insurance plans for religious reasons. Attorneys general from California, Pennsylvania and some other states are trying to keep the rule from going into effect Jan. 14.\n\nDemocratic attorneys general, consumer activists and others sued to stop the administration from expanding access to association health plans and to short-term coverage. The administration said consumers need alternatives to Obamacare plans, which can be expensive, especially for those who don't qualify for subsidies. Opponents said that because the alternatives have fewer consumer protections and benefits, they would siphon healthy customers out of the Obamacare market – increasing the premiums for everyone left. In a letter sent to the White House Tuesday, congressional Democrats asked for more information on the proposed short-term plans – which they argued would not be legal.\n\nPrescription drug prices\n\nFollowing through on Trump's promise to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, the administration rolled out various proposals that analyst Rachel Sachs of Washington University in St. Louis said range from radical to more modest ideas. Most remain in draft form, Sachs wrote in a piece for the policy journal Health Affairs.\n\nHouse Democrats named tackling drug prices as one of their top legislative priorities. Proposals include long-standing Democratic plans to allow Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and newer ones that would require the government to make generic medicines. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., even has a proposal that takes the same approach as a Trump administration plan – lowering prices by tying them to what other countries pay.\n\nMedicare for all\n\nA single-payer system such as Medicare for all is a popular rallying cry among liberals. Trump tried to defeat Democrats during the midterm elections by claiming it was just the beginning of the party's socialist agenda.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., faces a balancing act in letting the more liberal members of her caucus explore the idea without it becoming a political albatross for the 2020 elections. She gave the green light for hearings to be held, but she cautioned that the proposal needs to be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits.
Charles Curtis\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe funniest thing going on in sports right now is the response to the NBA's social media policy enforcement, as the league warned teams to be respectful to each other on Twitter and elsewhere.\n\nSo far, we've seen the Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks exchange compliments, while the NHL's Dallas Stars and Nashville Predators spectacularly mock the NBA's policy.\n\nThe Kings actually jumped into the NHL fray when they heard about what the Stars and Preds were up to:\n\nThe Kings took up the Stars on that offer and brought the Cleveland Indians into the conversation:\n\nNow, here's where the Kings' social media team might regret that one:\n\nThe Kings did have a pretty decent response:\n\nStill, this was the reaction to their mini-war:\n\nLast word goes to the Indians:
Berry Tramel\n\nThe Oklahoman\n\nWe won't find much consensus on the best moment of the college football bowl season.\n\nThe Liberty-Coastal Carolina, Cincinnati-Georgia and West Virginia-Army thrillers. Your favorites are determined regionally. Within a state. Within a conference.\n\nBut from coast to shining sea, we all agree on the worst moment of the bowls. The Tulsa-Mississippi State brawl after — yes, after — the Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth on New Year's Eve. One of the ugliest scenes in college athletics in years. A melee. Slugging. Kicking. Helmets ripped off heads.\n\nThe worst part? The celebration of the brawl. Mississippi State's Malik Heath took to Instagram to brag about the video that shows him kicking a fallen Tulsa player in the head. Watch how I slam his ass, Heath narrates.\n\nI don't know who started what, and I don't know who deserves the lion's share of the blame. I don't know what Tulsa and the American Conference will do. I don't know what Mississippi State and the Southeastern Conference will do. Best guess, probably not enough.\n\nBut I know that everyone involved in the NCAA must bind together and say stop. This isn't happening again.\n\nI think it's gotta come from the rules, Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said. No coach ever wants to see that happen, no administrator. And no player does either. You get into the emotions and the fire of these games, they get so heated at times.\n\nThings can get to a tipping point, and I think we've got to have very, very strong, strong rules to make sure that people are heavily discouraged from doing that.\n\nI agree, and it comes from game administration. Trash talking? Celebrations in the face of opponents? Zero-tolerance policy.\n\nWe need more Mike Defees. The now-retired Big 12 referee famously penalized every Sooner and every Longhorn before their 2019 game in Dallas. The teams had shown signs of a rumble, and Defee took a fire hose to such attitudes.\n\nEveryone in uniform received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty; any subsequent unsportsmanlike foul would mean automatic ejection, and at the coin toss, Defee told the captains, We're going to play this game with sportsmanship. Are we clear?\n\nThere's not enough clear in college football. Even Riley earlier this season defended OU safety Brendan Radley-Hiles, who has made a habit of drawing unsportsmanlike penalties with his talking and finger-pointing. Riley said there's a fine line between aggression and over-aggression. Riley is right. But that's what sports are all about. Staying on the proper side of that fine line.\n\nTruth is, we've let far too much slip. A season ago, we had an awful fight in the Nevada-Las Vegas/Nevada football game. Then a detestable brawl last winter in the Kansas State-Kansas basketball game. Now this.\n\nThe Fear of God needs to return to the landscape.\n\nTulsa coach Philip Montgomery didn't look great when after the game he talked about how the Golden Hurricane would look out for each other.\n\nThe one thing I'll say is our program, our guys, we're a team that's going to stand up for each and we're going to battle, Montgomery said. We talk about faith, family, football. Family's going to take care of family.\n\nBut Montgomery looked downright humanitarian compared to Mississippi State coach Mike Leach.\n\nThis is a football game, so we're not going to be tearing cloth over this deal, Leach said on the ESPN broadcast after the game. Somebody went to a football game and somebody got hit. There's a point where I'm not going to lose my mind over it.\n\nMaybe it's time coaches lost their jobs over it.\n\nThe game was boiling from the start. Tulsa had an unsportsmanlike penalty early, then two more later. Mississippi State followed with two unsportsmanlikes of its own, with a personal foul penalty in between. The officiating crew clearly lost control of this game, and other officiating crews noticed.\n\nIn bowl games Friday and Saturday, flags flew much quicker for trash-talking or demonstrations meant to intimidate or inflame the opponent. Too late to help the Armed Forces Bowl, but maybe that's the kind of rules to which Riley was referring. No tolerance.\n\nI look at it like targeting, Riley said. For a long time, you could argue that rule was over the top. But the one thing right now is you don't see many targeting penalties anymore. You don't see dudes getting hit in the head egregiously. They don't happen very often … You don't see many egregious ones anymore because the penalty is so, so severe. It has sent a message.\n\nI think we could have a pretty severe penalty. You've seen other leagues, I can think of the NBA specifically, really come down very, very hard on players who have left the bench. Some of the altercations that happened 10 or 15 years ago, you just don't see much of that anymore. I think you've got to make the penalty severe enough that it's a hot topic and it's something that even in the most heated moment, it's in the back of that player's mind.\n\nBingo. Make it the Defee Rule. Start every game with every player just one unsportsmanlike conduct penalty from ejection. You want to chirp at an opponent, you want to stand over a fallen foe instead of helping him up, you want to point fingers? Fine. There are street corners and parking lots where you can do it all day. Knock yourself out.\n\nBut it's not going to happen on a college football field.
Fred Wertheimer and Norman Eisen\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nProsecutors triggered a national firestorm last month when they asserted that President Donald Trump conspired with his ex-fixer, Michael Cohen, to commit campaign finance crimes involving hush money payments to two women. But the discussion has overlooked another Trump campaign finance offense — one that is even easier to prove because it occurred in plain sight.\n\nOn July 27, 2016, Trump called on Russia to find presidential Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's missing emails. Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump proclaimed. He added, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\n\nFederal campaign finance law prohibits any person from soliciting campaign contributions, defined as anything of value to be given to influence an election, from a foreign national, including a foreign government.\n\nIn asking Russia to find Clinton's emails, presidential candidate Trump violated this statutory prohibition on seeking help from a foreign country to influence an election. Trump in essence called on a foreign adversary to locate and release something that was of great value to him and his campaign.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nNo exit: America's not only trapped in Trump's legal reality show, we're paying for it\n\nTrump's lies and corruption disgrace presidential legacies of Lincoln and Washington\n\nHow House Democrats can save democracy and the rule of law: Impeach Trump ASAP\n\nThe law provides that such a solicitation is illegal regardless of whether the person soliciting the help receives anything in return. The risks of foreign intrusion in our elections are so great that even asking for help from foreigners without consummation is a crime. But in this case, on or about the same day that Trump solicited help from Russia, Russia made its first attempt to break into servers that Hillary Clinton's personal office used. That event is laid out in detail in an indictment of Russian hackers obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nTrump can hardly claim he could not have seen that coming. Suspected Russian election-related hacking was already much in evidence at the time. Nor can he plead ignorance of the law. Trump has given sworn affidavits and made other statements that he has deep understanding of campaign finance laws.\n\nTrump was warned about foreign solicitation\n\nIndeed, before his July 27, 2016, request of Russia, Trump had been put on notice that it was illegal for his presidential campaign to solicit support from foreign interests. On June 29 and July 22, 2016, watchdog groups (including one led by one of the authors) filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department, respectively, against Trump's presidential campaign committee for illegally soliciting financial support from parliamentarians in countries around the world, including Iceland, Scotland, Australia and Great Britain. Multiple news organizations had reported that Trump's campaign was violating the ban on foreign solicitations by emailing fundraising solicitations to foreign nationals. The Trump campaign did not respond to press requests for comments on the FEC complaint.\n\nThen-candidate Trump, self-described as deeply familiar with campaign finance laws and on notice that his campaign committee was illegally soliciting foreign support, nonetheless proceeded to publicly request assistance from Russia to find information to hurt Clinton and help his campaign.\n\nSome may say Trump's invitation was merely campaign rhetoric or hyperbole, which should not be criminalized. But that is to ignore the plain language of the law and its purpose: to protect the United States from the influence of foreign countries in our elections. The statute says, It shall be unlawful for … a person to solicit, accept or receive a contribution or donation … from a foreign national.\n\nIn using the word or, the statute makes plain that the act of solicitation in and of itself is a violation. The danger of Trump's words can be seen in the fact that Russia took them both seriously and literally.\n\nJustice Department says Trump can't be indicted\n\nIf this were an isolated incident, that would be one thing. But the Cohen revelations expose a pattern of campaign finance law violations by Trump, complete with a tape of him discussing the cover-up: evidence he knew what he was doing was wrong. Then there are the many other allegations of illegal conduct, including substantial evidence of obstruction of justice. The president appears to operate with blatant disdain for the nation's laws, and his alleged violation in soliciting campaign help from Russia is only one instance.\n\nThe president should not be immune from accountability for this alleged misconduct. Federal prosecutors should be free to charge him for any campaign finance offenses grounded in probable cause, including, if they see fit, the July 27 solicitation of Russia. Unfortunately, they are currently blocked from doing so by opinions from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel that a sitting president may not be indicted. We join eminent experts in disagreeing with those opinions, and this latest possible offense should be one more nail in his coffin.\n\nTrump campaign and business could be charged\n\nEven though Justice is unlikely to change its mind on charging Trump, next best options are available. The Trump campaign is legally responsible under principles of vicarious liability for the statements of its head and so could be indicted. The Russia solicitation could be included in an indictment featuring other counts, such as charging the campaign and the Trump Organization for the separate alleged hush money violations described by Cohen.\n\nNo Justice Department policy prohibits prosecutors from naming the president as an unindicted co-conspirator in such an indictment. And with a five-year statute of limitations, he could still be prosecuted for these alleged knowing and willful 2016 offenses should he fail to seek or secure re-election in 2020.\n\nCampaign finance laws are enacted to protect the American people. They do not exist for candidates to choose whether to comply with the laws or not as they see fit. No one is above the law — not an ordinary citizen and not the president of the United States. President Trump must be held accountable for his allegedly illegal activities — for his apparently knowing and willful violations of the nation's campaign finance laws.\n\nFred Wertheimer is founder and president of Democracy 21.

One year in, Trump reinvents U.S. foreign policy\n\nWith a sharp departure from years of American foreign policy, on numerous fronts, the first year of President Donald Trump's presidency has made a seismic global impact on foreign affairs not previously witnessed in the modern age.
Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE — Sloane Stephens hasn't won a match in the seven she's played since winning her first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open last September. Nevertheless, the 24-year-old is dismissing that fact as inconsequential as she approaches the start of the Australian Open.\n\nI think you have to kind of put everything in perspective, evaluate where you are, Stephens said. I think personally I had a lot of things going on. It's a new year, new season. I'm hoping not to get injured. There's tons of things to look forward to. I'm not going to dwell too much on that (the losses).\n\nFollowing her triumphant U.S. Open, Stephens spent the remainder of 2017 dealing with a knee injury, and lost all six matches played during the remainder of the season, including two at the Fed Cup final. Despite Stephens' lacking performance the U.S. increased their Fed Cup winning record to 18 titles with their 3-2 win over Belarus in Minsk.\n\nThe highlight of the 13th-seeded Stephen's autumn came off the court when she graduated with a degree in communications from Indiana University East through a discounted online program arranged with the school by the WTA.\n\nEveryone in my family has a degree. My mom has her doctorate, Stephens said. My brother is in college. I have to graduate before him because I'm better than him. I have to prove to him that I'm smarter in everything.\n\nWhile Stephens speaks of hope heading into the new year, she didn't start 2018 on a high note. She lost her first match 6-3, 6-0 to Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi at the Sydney tournament earlier this week.\n\nStephens' rise to Grand Slam champion status played out like a fairytale, which earned her the 2017 WTA Comeback Player of the Year honors. Sidelined with a foot injury for one month shy of a year, Stephens returned to the tour at Wimbledon, ranked as low as No. 957 the last week of July, and then went 15-2 in matches played through the U.S. Open.\n\nI think it's always a tough transition when you go from not playing tennis for 11 months to winning a Grand Slam, Stephens said. It's never going to be anything you expected. In terms of that, it's a little bit overwhelming.\n\nI thought winning the U.S. Open was, like, the hardest two weeks of my life. she said. To win seven matches in a row, to say that's luck? I wouldn't say that. … If it wasn't hard, then everyone could do it, right?\n\nStephens made her first big impression in the game at the 2013 Australian Open when she upset Serena Williams to reach a first major semifinal.\n\nIn a position to become the 10th player to win back-to-back titles at the U.S. and Australian Opens, Stephens will play 35th-ranked Zhang Shuai of China in the first round.\n\nStephens, who was also seeded 13th the only other time she was seeded at the Australian Open in 2014, is one of four American women with seeding distinction this year. Venus Williams is the highest-seeded player of the Americans at No. 5, Coco Vandeweghe is No. 10 and Madison Keys, who lost to Stephens in the U.S. Open final, is No. 17.\n\nThe Australian Open will definitely not have a repeat champion this year with Serena Williams remaining on maternity leave after the birth of her first child, daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September. The only past champion in the women's draw is Kerber, so there are good odds that the Australian Open will welcome a new champion in two week's time.\n\nThe 37-year-old Venus Williams arrives here as the closest thing to a defending champion, as it was she who was defeated by her already pregnant sister, Serena, in last year's final.\n\nThe oldest player in this year's draw, Williams reached the Australian Open and Wimbledon finals, and the BNP Paribas WTA Finals, but never won a title last season. This year's Australian Open has to be considered a wide-open Open, and Williams' experience, and suitable game style for the hard courts here, could possibly deliver an eighth overall Grand Slam title, and her first since Wimbledon 2008.\n\nShe's 37 years old; at her age, winning a Grand Slam would be a ridiculous achievement, especially as it would be her first Australian Open title, said Martina Navratilova, in a column she penned on the WTA's official website. Last year, Williams came so close in Melbourne, when she was the runner-up to her younger sister, and now she goes into the tournament knowing she won't have to deal with Serena, and that should put some pep in her step.\n\nThe women's game is starting the 2018 season in similar fashion to the open-door policy to the world No. 1 ranking that peppered all of last year.\n\nIn 2017, five players held the top spot — Kerber, Serena Williams, Karolina Pliskova of Czech Republic, Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza of Spain and Simona Halep of Hungary.\n\nHalep, the current No. 1, can be challenged for the top position by five players at this year's Australian Open. Former No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, who won the 2017 year-end title, as well as Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, Muguruza, reigning French Open Jelena Ostapenko, and Pliskova could all leave Melbourne Park at the top of the rankings.\n\nMORE TENNIS COVERAGE:\n\nRelated:Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic in same half of Australian Open draw\n\nName sake:Billie Jean King backs calls to rename Margaret Court Arena\n\nNo. 2:Roberto Bautista Agut beats Juan Martin del Potro to win second ASB Classic
Shannon Donnelly\n\nEach year for the past 28 years, two women have shared the spotlight as honorees at Palm Beach Atlantic University's Women of Distinction awards luncheon.\n\nThis year, that spotlight will be on only one.\n\nPBAU has announced that first lady Melania Trump is its 2020 Woman of Distinction. She will be the sole honoree at the luncheon, which honors women who have made significant contributions to the community.\n\nOur first lady, is an exquisite human being, a magnificent wife and life partner, a superb mother and an outstanding first lady, who represents us brilliantly in the United States and worldwide, said co-chairwoman Eileen Burns. Melania is a perfect example of a Woman of Distinction and we are most proud to honor her.\n\nIn her role as first lady, Trump focuses on issues affecting children.\n\nIn May 2017 she announced the launch of Be Best, her policy initiative that promotes children's social and emotional health. Its mission is to address issues facing children today by concentrating on three main pillars: Well-being, online safety, and opioid abuse.\n\nTrump has traveled across the country and internationally to highlight programs and people who are dedicated to helping children overcome these modern-day concerns.\n\nWhat is 'Be Best,' Melania Trump's initiative? And what has it accomplished?\n\nFirst ladies define the history of our country, said co-chair Frances Fisher. We are honored to recognize Mrs. Trump as a Woman of Distinction and the only first lady since Mrs. Kennedy to be a Palm Beach resident. This will be a truly memorable event.\n\nPrevious recipients of the Women of Distinction Award, which recognizes women for their charitable leadership of organizations that support the arts, education, health care and other community initiatives, are actress Nicki Harris, fashion designer Lily Pulitzer Rousseau, Autism Speaks co-founder Suzanne Wright, Palm Beach mayor Gail Coniglio, and Candy Carson, wife to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.\n\nThe 29th annual event takes place Feb. 19. Proceeds benefit a PBAU scholarship fund for female students.\n\n'Be Best':Melania Trump's anti-bullying slogan trends after the president mocked Greta Thunberg
Ira Shapiro\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nSince the 2018 elections produced a Democratic majority in the House, every discussion about impeachment has begun and ended with the assumption that the Republican-controlled Senate would brush aside any impeachment, line up behind Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and exonerate President Donald Trump. As Brookings scholar William Galston told The Washington Post last fall, There's a reason why 'Profiles in Courage' is a very short book.\n\nThis historic moment would be a good time for a new chapter. If we look at individual senators, men and women facing the most consequential decision of their careers, it seems quite possible that Trump's presidency does not rest on a strong foundation; rather, it hangs by a slim thread.\n\nJust four Republican senators will make the difference between a quick, cursory trial and calling witnesses who could turn the tide toward conviction and removal. Here are six GOP senators who might do Trump in:\n\n►Mitt Romney of Utah. The former Republican presidential nominee called Trump's pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrong and appalling. This reaction was predictable from Romney, who spoke out against Trump in 2016 and has continued to be critical. In an October interview with USA TODAY, Romney, 72, described himself as free to do entirely what I believe is absolutely right. ... And I hope that my kids down the road will say, 'Yeah, you know our dad, our grandfather, our great-grandfather was a person of integrity and honored his oath of office.'  That sounds like a man who is ready to draw a sharp contrast with Trump.\n\nMaine's independent tradition\n\n►Susan Collins of Maine. Collins disappointed many supporters and friends, including me, when she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and she faces a very tough reelection campaign this year as a result. But Collins has proved her independence in the past. She angered McConnell by backing President Barack Obama's economic stimulus in 2009 and opposing repeal of the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Collins came to Washington in 1974 to intern for then-Rep. William Cohen, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which was then considering President Richard Nixon's impeachment. She also played an active role in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999. Collins cherishes her position in Maine's long line of independent senators — above all, the iconic Margaret Chase Smith, whose statement of conscience attacking Sen. Joseph McCarthy came more than four years before the Senate and the country turned against him.\n\n►Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Murkowski's reaction to Trump's treatment of Zelensky was instantaneous: You don't hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period. She has expressed discomfort with McConnell's outspoken commitment to coordinate trial strategy with Trump. Murkowski waged an unlikely write-in campaign to win reelection to the Senate in 2010 after losing to a Tea Party extremist in a primary. She stood alone among Republicans to oppose the Kavanaugh nomination, and she joined Collins and Sen. John McCain of Arizona to block repealing the ACA. This headline from Alaska Public Media captures her fierce independence: Murkowski, true to form, breaks with GOP colleagues on ethical questions about Trump.\n\nChuck Schumer:The case for witnesses at Trump Senate impeachment trial gets stronger every day\n\nVirtually every list of potential Republican defectors starts with Romney, Collins and Murkowski. Here are another three who should keep Trump and McConnell up at night:\n\n►Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Perhaps the only person in American history who has been a governor, Cabinet member, presidential candidate and senator, Alexander is probably the most respected Republican senator. Alexander expressed dismay about the Senate' s hyperpartisanship back in 2011 by resigning from McConnell's leadership team in order to engage in more bipartisan legislating. Now, at 79 and retiring after this year, Alexander doesn't want to rile the Trump base in Tennessee. His highest priority may be to ensure that his friend, Bill Hagerty, succeeds him in the Senate. But will that really be enough to align him with Tennessee's other senator, Marsha Blackburn, an extreme conservative who is one of Trump's most ferocious defenders? Alexander began his storied career as a staffer for the great Howard Baker in 1967. He should be fully capable of finishing it with the type of courage and independence that Baker showed during Watergate and the Panama Canal treaty debate.\n\nAn agonizing choice for McSally\n\n►Richard Burr of North Carolina. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr has earned respect for working with Democrat Mark Warner to steer the committee's scrupulously bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Burr has announced that he won't seek another term in 2022. He might be reluctant to break with North Carolina's other senator, Thom Tillis, who is up for reelection and is all in with Trump. But few people know better than Burr how Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens detracts from the real steps needed to protect our national security and the integrity of our next election.\n\nSenators' choice:Trump impeachment trial could be a partisan sham or a master class in civic duty\n\n►Martha McSally of Arizona. Perhaps no one faces a more agonizing decision than McSally, appointed to the Senate to fill the late John McCain's seat shortly after she lost an election for Arizona's other Senate seat. McSally served 22 years in the Air Force, rising to the rank of colonel. She was the first American woman to fly combat missions and the first woman commander of a fighter squadron. McSally also sued the Defense Department in 2002 over its policy requiring women to wear full body covering when going off-base in Saudi Arabia. Last year, she gave stunning testimony that she had been raped by a superior officer. Given her patriotism, courage and outspoken commitment to women's rights, McSally may have less in common with Trump than any living person. Will she once again put country first, or decide she has already shown enough courage to take a pass this time?\n\nWhen the chips are down, these six Republican senators and others could prove to be knee-jerk defenders of the president, no different than Reps. Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan. But if Trump is banking on that, he could be underestimating senatorial pride.\n\nIra Shapiro, a former Senate staffer and Clinton administration trade official, is the author of Broken: Can the Senate Save Itself and the Country? and The Last Great Senate: Courage and Statesmanship in Times of Crisis.

Dequan Townsend has accepted a six-month suspension from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).\n\nThe suspension comes after Townsend (18-8 MMA, 0-1 UFC) was flagged for an in-competition urine test that detected the presence of cocaine metabolites. USADA announced the suspension Wednesday.\n\nTownsend's upcoming fight against Bevon Lewis at UFC on ESPN+ 24 on Jan. 25 will not be effected because the suspension is retroactive to the date before his June 28 UFC debut. The suspension ended Dec. 28.\n\nTownsend tested positive for bezoylecgonine (cocaine) and norfentanyl (fentanyl) metabolites. Both metabolites are prohibited in-competition and are considered Substances of Abuse under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy and the UFC Prohibited List, according to USADA.\n\nTownsend was given a reduced suspension due to his ability to prove the substance did not enhance, or wasn't intended to enhance his performance, according to USADA. Additionally, Townsend completed a drug rehabilitation program.\n\nTownsend, 33, took his UFC debut on less than one week's notice. At UFC on ESPN 3, Townsend stepped in for Justin Ledet and faced fellow newcomer Dalcha Lungiambula at light heavyweight. Townsend was finished by strikes early in Round 3.\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 24 takes place Jan. 25 at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C. The card streams on ESPN+.
AP\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Shortly after franchise quarterback Carson Wentz left the field with a torn ACL, Malcolm Jenkins gathered his teammates following a comeback win that clinched a division title. He gave an emotional speech, imploring them to believe they can win the Super Bowl without the guy who got them to that point.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are two wins away from their goal. First up is the NFC championship game Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nCarson being out of this, that sucks, Jenkins told the team in the locker room after a 43-35 win at the Los Angeles Rams on Dec. 10. But dig this, we set this up for whoever (is) in this room, that's who we ride with, man. We said, 'we all we got, we all we need.' Believe that.... We got bigger goals ... championships and that's it.\n\nWentz is the franchise quarterback and a leader by example. Jenkins, the two-time Pro Bowl safety, is the in-your-face leader. He's the first one to address the group after coach Doug Pederson gives his post-game speech.\n\nHe's embraced it and guys look forward to it, Pederson said. He's got a lot of profound messages. He speaks from the heart and he speaks truth. So that's been a positive.\n\nJenkins says he always has a purpose when he speaks.\n\nI kind of try to analyze the situation of where we are as a team, do a little bit of reflection, but make sure that it's not just an emotional response to keep everybody in perspective, he said. A lot of times I'm talking to myself to be most honest.\n\nAs the underdog Eagles (14-3) prepare to host the Vikings (14-3), Jenkins reflected on his inspirational message following Wentz's injury.\n\nKnowing that the media was getting ready to come in right after and those seeds of doubt, words of doubt were getting ready to come, I wanted to make sure there was a message of confidence and perspective before they had to actually address the media, Jenkins said. Obviously, we all hurt for Carson. It's a huge blow to the team, but in no way does it change our goals. No way does it change our demeanor. Nothing's changed, and that was kind of the message.\n\nWentz's injury was the latest and biggest blow for a team seeking its first NFL title since 1960. The Eagles lost nine-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters, versatile running back/return specialist Darren Sproles, playmaking linebacker Jordan Hicks, and special-teams captain Chris Maragos to season-ending injuries.\n\nWe always focused on the guys we had in the huddle, Jenkins said. Losing the amount of guys that we've lost and facing a lot of the adversity that we have, to have that mentality that we are sufficient, that the guys we have in this room can get it done, no matter what's in front of us, has kind of been the story line of this team. Obviously I think everybody has kind of embraced that mentality.\n\nJenkins spent his first five seasons with the New Orleans Saints and won a Super Bowl his rookie year. He joined the Eagles in free agency four years ago and has started every game, developing into one of the league's best players at his position.\n\nMalcolm is always in the right place as a safety, former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky told The Associated Press. He just takes a level of confidence away from you because you can't manipulate him, you can't get him to do what you want him to do.\n\nJenkins is not only a team leader, but has earned the respect of his peers. He's very active in the community and established The Players' Coalition to help advance players' activism efforts. Jenkins led a meeting that included NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and teammates with police, policy leaders and public defenders in Philadelphia to discuss criminal justice reform.\n\nI think that we can play a major role in changing the narrative from this argumentative, combative narrative to one of solutions, one that is aimed at bringing people together, because that's what unique about this game, Jenkins said.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi
The most prominent pro athlete in Wisconsin — Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers — has weighed in on the controversy surrounding the sportsmanship policy of the Wisconsin Interscholastic Activities Association.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN.com, Rodgers said he led the chants at his high school in Chico, Calif., when he wasn't playing. Rodgers played basketball for a time before concentrating solely on football.\n\nWhile Rodgers said last week that there is no place for racist or homophobic language, but decried the abolition of chants such as scoreboard, air ball and fundamentals. He then proceeded to clap out fun-da-men-tals in front of his locker, according to ESPN.com's Jason Wilde.\n\nRELATED: Jay Bilas trolls Wisconsin decision on chants\n\nI think we're, as a society, dying a little bit each day if we're not only dumbing down our masses but we're also limiting the things that we can say, Rodgers said in the interview.  'Air ball' and 'scoreboard,' from a chant standpoint, in 2001 when I was in the stands watching my high school basketball team, that's like the ground floor of stuff we would say. …\n\nI don't think that [high school competition] warrants censorship.

The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLike it or not, Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden and his son Hunter have been dragged into President Donald Trump's sleazy arms-for-dirt dealings with Ukraine. Biden can't control that, but he can control how he handles questions about the matter. His responses haven't been a good look.\n\nWhen an ill-informed, older man at a town hall in Iowa accused Biden of sending his son to Ukraine during the Obama administration to sell access to the president, Biden could have used the opportunity to calmly but forcefully set the record straight. Instead, he attacked the voter as a damn liar.\n\nAnd when Biden was asked whether he'd comply with a subpoena as part of Trump's impeachment trial, he could have simply declined to answer a hypothetical question. Instead, he first said that he wouldn't comply with such a subpoena, undermining the Democrats' second article of impeachment — obstruction of Congress — and giving cover to Trump administration officials who've refused to testify. Then he reversed course, potentially giving comfort to Trump loyalists trying to contrive a rigged Senate trial.\n\nSurely a former vice president, longtime senator and three-time presidential candidate can manage his message better than that.\n\nTrump actually abuses power\n\nTo be clear, Hunter Biden's involvement with a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president is in no way comparable with Trump's abuses of power. Less a scandal than a family embarrassment, it falls more into the category of Billy Carter, the ne'er-do-well brother of Jimmy Carter who hawked Billy Beer and lobbied for Libya, and of Neil Bush, the son of George H.W. Bush who got himself embroiled in the savings and loan crisis while his father was vice president.\n\nAlso to be clear, Trump will do his damnedest to make a big deal of Hunter Biden's poor judgment and to use him as a justification for his own rogue actions.\n\nJOE BIDEN:I can withstand Trump's smears and dirty tricks\n\nHunter Biden is a mixture of impressive feats and bad choices. His career as an attorney and global financier made him a plausible candidate for corporate boards even without his family name. He has also been in and out of drug rehab and was discharged from the Navy Reserves after testing positive for cocaine. If his decision to make some easy money caused his father grief, it would not have been the only time.\n\nCarrying out U.S. policy on Ukraine\n\nThe most obvious thing for the candidate to say about his son, who earned tens of thousands of dollars a month serving on the board of the ethically challenged Burisma Holdings, is that he loves his adult children but has limited control over their decisions. Any parent can relate to that.\n\nBiden could also emphasize that he had nothing to do with his son's hiring, and that as vice president he carried out official U.S. policy to press the Ukrainians to replace and remove a notoriously corrupt prosecutor.\n\nBiden would be a formidable rival for Trump because he is widely regarded as an experienced, empathetic figure who appeals to working-class voters in key battleground states.\n\nFairly or unfairly, however, questions about Ukraine are destined to dog him throughout the campaign. He should best be prepared to handle them in a straightforward, steady, no-malarkey sort of way.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Charles F. Gardner, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nAtlanta – Mike Dunleavy looks like a perfect fit for the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nJust ask the Milwaukee Bucks, who struggle against the Hawks no matter if it's Kyle Korver or Dunleavy in the lineup. The sharpshooting Korver joined Cleveland last week to provide some support for LeBron James, but Dunleavy was on target in the Hawks' 111-98 victory over the Bucks at Philips Arena on Sunday afternoon.\n\nPlaying in just his second game with the Hawks after arriving in the Korver trade, Dunleavy scored 20 points off the bench and hit 4 of 5 three-pointers. Kent Bazemore had a team-high 24 points and drilled 4 of 7 threes as the Hawks went 13 of 26 beyond the arc.\n\nWe cannot let Dunleavy come off the bench and have 20, said Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo. We did that. We didn't defend the three-point line real well. We've got to do a better job rebounding the ball, especially in the second half.\n\nAntetokounmpo led the Bucks (20-19) with 33 points, eight rebounds, six assists, three blocks and two steals, but Milwaukee dropped its third game in as many meetings with Atlanta (23-17) this season. Bucks forward Jabari Parker barely missed a triple-double with eight points, a career-high nine assists and 10 rebounds.\n\nBOX SCORE: Hawks 111, Bucks 98\n\nBucks coach Jason Kidd said before the game that defending the three-pointer would be critical, but the Bucks couldn't do it.\n\nCoach Kidd has been around this league quite some time, and he's not only a fortune-teller, he just knows, veteran guard Jason Terry said. At some point, we're going to have to understand that what he's telling us is going to come to fruition.\n\nAre we going to be ready to execute the game plan? We did not do that tonight as read the results.\n\nThe Bucks know all about Dunleavy, who played two seasons in Milwaukee (2011-'13) and shot 41.6% from three-point range while with the franchise. He moved on to Chicago for three seasons and signed as a free agent with Cleveland during the past off-season before being traded to Atlanta.\n\nIt's an easy group of guys and an easy way to play to fit in with, Dunleavy said. Obviously, I've been playing against this team for a number of years. I understand what they try to do offensively. It's been pretty seamless thus far. Defensively, still trying to figure some things out and get more comfortable. Overall, I feel pretty good for two games.\n\nThe Bucks had cut their deficit to six points in the fourth quarter, but Dunleavy and Malcolm Delaney sank back-to-back threes sandwiched around a basket by Milwaukee's Greg Monroe, pushing Atlanta's margin to 101-91 with 6:37 left. Delaney's three was wide open when Dunleavy passed up a shot and found him in the corner.\n\nIt's two games, said Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer of the 36-year-old Dunleavy. We have to be careful not to put too much into it.But I would say it's always been a belief that this would be a good place for him and a good way to play – moving and cutting.\n\nDwight Howard had 16 points and 14 rebounds, including seven offensive rebounds to give the Hawks second chances. They scored 20 second-chance points.\n\nHe can change shots; he can block shots, Kidd said of Howard. We've got to do a better job of engaging him and then being a playmaker. Or if we do miss the shot, we've got to be able to clean up and have the tip-ins go in for us.\n\nThe Bucks have a quick turnaround and will play a second straight matinee game on Monday, hosting Philadelphia (2:30 p.m. Central) as part of the league's Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration.\n\nI don't think it will be a problem, Antetokounmpo said. Tomorrow is a must-win game against Philly. We need that game. We've got to get back. The guys will get some rest. We'll meet at the arena, go through the scouting report and get ready for the game.\n\nTHREE TAKEAWAYS\n\n1. Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova was booed every time he touched the ball by the Philips Arena crowd. Hawks fans have not forgotten that Kyle Korver broke his ankle in the Eastern Conference finals two years ago on a play involving Dellavedova, then playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Dellavedova finished with just three points and three assists in 24 minutes, but he said the constant booing didn't bother him. They've got good fans here who support their team, Dellavedova said. I know they don't like me in a couple places. ... Chicago, a little bit. I just don't focus on it. I'm just trying to help the team win.\n\n2. Center Miles Plumlee got an early chance off the Bucks bench, and so did guard Rashad Vaughn. Plumlee was ineffective in 6 minutes while grabbing one rebound. Vaughn had five points on 2-of-4 shooting in 6 minutes.\n\n3. Jabari Paker just missed a triple-double but said he knew he wasn't scoring well early. He finished with eight points on 4-of-9 shooting and did not get to the foul line, meaning Atlanta bottled up his driving lanes and had Dwight Howard as a rim protector. He added a career-high nine assists and 10 rebounds. I was just trying something new, Parker said. I didn't see myself doing real well in the beginning. I wasn't effective as far as scoring but I tried to do other things out there. That (the triple-double) is the least of my worries.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTeams: Philadelphia 76ers (12-26) vs. Milwaukee Bucks (20-19).\n\nWhen: 2:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nWhere: BMO Harris Bradley Center.\n\nAbout the 76ers: Rookie Joel Embiid sat out Philadelphia's 109-93 loss to Washington on Saturday at the Verizon Center as the 76ers maintained their policy of resting him on the second night of back-to-back games. But he is expected to play Monday. Jahlil Okafor was given a rare start at center and responded with 26 points, nine rebounds and one block. 76ers coach Brett Brown said after the game he wasn't sure if Okafor or Nerlens Noel would be the primary backup for Embiid in the future. Former Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova has been a consistent scorer for the 76ers since arriving in a trade with Oklahoma City. Ilyasova has scored in double figures in 19 straight games, including an 18-point effort against the Wizards.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump revived the political battle between businesspeople and environmentalists Thursday, proposing to reduce federal regulations on construction projects, which critics said would worsen climate change.\n\nFrom day one, my administration has made fixing this regulatory nightmare a top priority, Trump said during a ceremony at the White House. And we want to build new roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, bigger, better, faster, and we want to build them at less cost.\n\nEnvironmental groups said the plan benefits corporate interests at the expense of public health.\n\nGene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said Trump's proposed changes would undercut the National Environmental Policy Act, the nation's landmark environmental law that turned 50 years old last week.\n\nThe implications for access to clean air and clean water and for public input, especially among the low-income communities and communities of color most impacted by climate change and toxic pollution, could be dire, Karpinski said.\n\nTrump impeachment:Pelosi says she'll send Senate articles of impeachment against Trump 'soon'\n\nThe plan would basically ease environmental rules for construction projects that do not have significant federal funding. It would set time limits on the length of federal reviews of these projects and would not allow regulators to assess a project's cumulative effects on climate change.\n\nThe proposals are likely to be published in the federal register this week, and they will undergo a process of public comment and hearings. The government is likely to issue final regulations in the fall.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Trump's plan means more polluters will be right there next to the water supply of our children. That's a public health issue.\n\nAt the White House, Trump said the approval process should boil down to one federal decision, rather than a series of approvals. He said the changes are designed to slash job-killing regulations and shrink endless delays in approval for necessary projects.\n\nHe called the current regulations big government at its absolute worst.\n\nPlane crash in Iran:Trump says he thinks 'something very terrible happened' to Ukraine jet that crashed in Iran\n\nTrump announced the proposal at a White House ceremony that featured invited guests, including construction workers who wore safety vests and white hard hats.\n\nMembers of the oil, gas, agriculture and trucking industries, as well as trade union groups, have long advocated for changes to environmental regulations, saying they are cumbersome and used by environmentalists to block projects.\n\nJay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, applauded the proposed changes, saying, Our hope is that these improvements will modernize infrastructure permitting for highways, bridges, power lines, and cell towers.\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act's regulations have not been updated in more than 40 years, Trump administration officials said.\n\nExclusive:Americans say Soleimani's killing made US less safe, Trump 'reckless' on Iran\n\nClimate change:The Democratic presidential candidates tell us how they would address climate change\n\nCritics said the changes will enable supporters of construction projects to discount their impact on climate change when seeking permits from the government. The results, they said, will be a worse environment with more deadly ramifications from climate change.\n\nTrump's gift to the fossil fuel industry and special interests will silence ordinary Americans while giving polluters a free pass to trash the environment, destroy public lands and kill wildlife, said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nDeregulation has been a cornerstone of Trump's presidency, and he figures to promote the issue during his reelection campaign this year.\n\nIn a statement Jan. 1 on the 50th anniversary of the National Environmental Policy Act, Trump cited complaints about regulations and previewed his proposed changes.\n\nPeople seeking permits for big projects can face significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members, Trump said.
A Florida investigative panel charged with studying the rampage that left 17 people dead at a Parkland high school last year recommended arming teachers, reigniting debate over the controversial strategy that has drawn vigorous support from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission criticized the response of school staff and the Broward County Sheriff's Office to the carnage Feb. 14.\n\nThe commission's 15 members issued a unanimously approved, 439-page preliminary report Wednesday aimed at preventing similar attacks and improving the response should they occur. The report and its recommendations were sent to the governor's office and Legislature for consideration.\n\nAll stakeholders ... should embrace the opportunity to change and make Florida schools the safest in the nation, the report says. There must be a sense of urgency – and there is not, across-the-board – in enhancing school safety.\n\nMore:Parkland survivors slam Louis C.K.\n\nMore:After Parkland shooting: A day-by-day fight over guns in America\n\nMore:Police, schools had no duty to protect Parkland victims, judge rules\n\nFlorida law allows districts to train and arm administrators and other staff. Teachers must have a military or police background to carry a firearm. The committee argued that teachers are often the first line of defense in school shootings and encouraged legislation to arm more of them.\n\nThe report recommends that the Legislature approve a measure that would allow teachers properly selected, thoroughly screened and extensively trained to carry concealed firearms on campuses for self-protection, and the protection of other staff and students in response to an active assailant incident.\n\nIn the days after the shooting, Trump suggested 20 percent of teachers should have the ability to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this, he said. Far more assets at much less cost than guards.\n\nThe state teachers union does not support arming teachers, and some law enforcement leaders balked at the proposal. Former New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called arming teachers the height of lunacy.\n\nRichard Myers, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said few police chiefs back such proposals.\n\nThe report says the Broward County school system and sheriff's office were unprepared for the attack by Nikolas Cruz, who had been expelled from the school. Sheriff's Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer, was among deputies criticized for failing to immediately confront Cruz. Sheriff Scott Israel was blamed for not requiring his force to confront active shooters.\n\nIsrael told the commission he had eliminated the policy requiring deputies to confront active shooters because he didn't want deputies charging into suicide missions.\n\nCruz, then 19, entered the building armed with a semiautomatic assault weapon, smoke grenades and a mask, authorities said. He allegedly fired more than 100 shots before the gun apparently jammed, and he walked out of the building amid the chaos.\n\nCruz was taken into custody walking through a nearby neighborhood a short time after the shooting. A grand jury indicted him on 17 counts of first-degree murder that could result in the death penalty. He is also charged with 17 counts of attempted murder.
Jessica Penne, the former Invicta FC champion and UFC title challenger, revealed a new sanction placed in her years-long case with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nPenne, who was first flagged by USADA in May 2017, has been fighting to clear her name and claims no intentional wrongdoing for the banned substance in her system. She believes the agency, which serves as the UFC's official anti-doping partner, is trying to force her into retirement.\n\nHere's what we know based on a timeline of developments.\n\n(Editor's note: This will continue to be updated as events unfold.)\n\n* * * *\n\nMay 10, 2017: Penne flagged after biological passport review\n\nPenne's saga against USADA begins when the agency announces she is the first UFC athlete flagged for potential doping violation following biological passport review.\n\nA sample collected on Mar. 20, 2017 was initially reported as negative, but a review of Penne's biological passport – which, according to the World Anti-Doping Association, is used to monitor selected biological variables over time that indirectly reveal the effects of doping rather than attempting to detect the doping substance or method itself.\n\nEssentially, a variance in the biological passport detected over time can trigger additional screening, such as a Carbon Isotope Ratio test, to determine the presence of a synthetic substance in the body, even at low levels – or if the substance, itself, can't be directly identified.\n\nJan. 5, 2018: Penne gets 18-month suspension for unspecified steroid\n\nUSADA announces Penne has accepted an 18-month suspension because she tested positive for the presence of an anabolic androgenic steroid of exogenous origin. USADA offered a statement on the situation:\n\nUnder the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, as well as the World Anti-Doping Code, an athlete's period of ineligibility for using a prohibited substance may be decreased if the athlete lacks significant fault for the anti-doping policy violation. In this instance, although Penne was not successful in her attempt to obtain a retroactive or prospective Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for DHEA after her positive test, it was determined that her degree of fault was reduced because her use of the prohibited substance was under the care of a physician. Accordingly, Penne received a corresponding reduction to 18 months from the standard two-year period of ineligibility for a non-Specified Substance under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy.\n\nJan. 10: Penne releases statement revealing new 4-year ban\n\nAfter a long run of silence regarding her case, Penne took to social media to release an emotional statement claiming she is broke, defeated and heart broken after years of battling her case.\n\nPenne said she spent thousands of dollars testing medications and supplements (most of which were 3rd party certified that the UFC PI gave me), and that the lab that handled the screens did identify banned substances in the products. While Penne assumed my name would be cleared and I could return to fighting, she says USADA officials informed her that independent testing they conducted found different results, and that they planned on handing her a second violation, which means a mandatory four-year suspension from competition.\n\nJan. 10: USADA responds to Penne's public claims\n\nHours after Penne issued her statement, USADA responds with a counter-argument about the ongoing case and claimed a disparity in the facts.\n\nGiven Jessica Penne's public statement, we can confirm her positive test for stanozolol. However, there are many factual inaccuracies and unfounded allegations in her statement, including that she has been forced out of UFC. In fact, she has exercised her right to contest her case before an independent arbitrator, per a request USADA received after she released her public statement. Under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, all athletes have the right to present the facts and circumstances during a full evidentiary hearing. We look forward to the opportunity to present the facts and evidence through this process.\n\nJan. 11: Penne launches GoFundMe for case funds\n\nThe day after the latest development in her story became public, Penne's team launched a GoFundMe campaign asking for financial assistance from the public to help support her legal battle against USADA.\n\nI am setting up this campaign on behalf of my client, Jessica Penne, a statement from her manager, Brian Butler-Au read. Jessica is a UFC strawweight who has been wrongly suspended for the last 3 years by USADA for claims that are proven invalid. She served the suspension but again has been accused of a violation in which her along with the help of the UFC have found to be a mistake. She spent all of her remaining savings on the testing of products to fight and prove her innocence which paid off (as the tests came back in her favor). She now has all of the paperwork that proves her innocence but is left in the position to have to fight USADA head on in court. This campaign is set up to help raise the money to cover the legal fees and save her career before its to (sic) late. From here (sic) team here at SuckerPunch Entertainment we thank everyone for their support and we are ready to fight this and get her back in competition.\n\nJan. 11: Manager shares document regarding contaminated medication\n\nPenne's manager, Brian Butler of SuckerPunch Entertainment, reveals an official document from independent testers KorvalLabs proving contaminated medication that was taken by Penne. He argued that should be enough evidence to exonerate Penne.
Brandon Loomis\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nArizona is closing in on a set of water conservation deals that leaders hope will prop up storage in Lake Mead and forestall painful and chaotic shortages for at least a few years.\n\nFederal water managers project a strong possibility — roughly 50-50 — that water levels in Lake Mead could drop enough in the next year or so to trigger a shortage that would curtail Arizona's take of the Colorado River through the Central Arizona Project aqueduct. The state draws about 40% of its water from the river.\n\nA deep winter snowpack like what has begun building in the Rocky Mountains this year could delay the cuts, but experts agree that the system is essentially overdrawn and bold action is necessary regardless of weather.\n\nArizona's answer is pre-emptive austerity.\n\nConservation advocates alarmed by Trump's Interior pick\n\nTogether with Nevada and California, the state is negotiating a deal called the Drought Contingency Plan. It would have Nevada and Arizona cut use of Colorado River this year and would commit California to its first-ever surrender of some of its water if the reservoir plunges more in coming years.\n\nUntil now, California's senior rights to the river have insulated it from any reductions. Now though, the states have agreed in principle to collaborate in everyone's interest.\n\nWe're all committed to a path forward to protect the lake from crashing, said Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources.\n\nThe plan is an important step but not enough in the long term, according to a new report from Western Resource Advocates titled Arizona's Water Future. As soon as the 2020s, Arizona's cities will suffer from a water shortage unless they keep ramping up their conservation and add new tools, such as an ability to store unused shares of Central Arizona Project water in Lake Mead.\n\nWe have to figure out how to thrive with less water supply, said Drew Beckwith, water policy manager at the environmental nonprofit based in Boulder, Colo.\n\nThe states have not finalized the drought plan because they first must determine internally how to distribute the cuts. Arizona is close but needs an expected infusion of federal cash to pay some farmers and tribes to temporarily reduce their share, Buschatzke said.\n\nArizona's early offering is 192,000 acre-feet of water that would remain in Lake Mead. That's enough to support a few hundred thousand households though it largely would come out of agriculture and groundwater replenishment programs; more than two-thirds of the state's water is used for agriculture.\n\nUnchecked climate change raising risks of megadrought in the Southwest\n\nAn acre-foot is a measure of the volume of water equal to a foot of water over an acre of land, a little more than 325,850 gallons. One acre-foot typically can meet the needs of a three suburban families, including watering the lawn, according to Mark Leipnik, an associate professor of geography and geology at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.\n\nArizona's idea is to keep Lake Mead from dropping to an elevation of 1,075 feet above sea level, which the states agreed back in 2007 would strip Arizona of 320,000 acre-feet of water. Without action now, that reality appears near.\n\nThe water level bounced around the 1,075-foot mark during this past summer's irrigation season but has rebounded during the cool season to almost 1,085 feet Tuesday.\n\nThough Arizona farmers, which rely exclusively on irrigation, would hurt in a cutback, failure to prevent a further 25-foot drop in the reservoir would trigger the loss of 400,000 acre-feet a year because of the 2007 agreement, and a 50-foot decline would make it 480,000, or nearly a third of the Central Arizona Project's allowance.\n\nUnder the proposed interstate plan, those losses creep higher at every level to prevent a potential total loss if the reservoir keeps plunging.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century through extended drought and overuse, the reservoir's water line has dropped more than 100 feet.\n\nSo Arizona's internal negotiations actually have sought an even more austere commitment for this year than what the three states have negotiated. It's called Drought Contingency Plan-Plus, denoting an extension of the interstate Drought Contingency Plan, and it seeks nearly 400,000 acre-feet from willing participants this year, in a regime that would spread that pain and keep some water flowing to central Arizona farmers.\n\nSome of the water savings would come from the Central Arizona Project canal operator, as it slows its groundwater replenishment deliveries. Others would come from purchases of water from Arizona tribes and farmers in Pinal County south of Phoenix.\n\nA big chunk would come from the Gila River Indian Community's agreement to store earmarked water in Lake Mead for later use.\n\nInitiatives aim to protect Salton Sea, study geothermal power\n\nPinal County's farmers are wary but pleased that the state is negotiating deals that would keep them from losing all of their surface water and reverting to groundwater pumping, said Brian Betcher, general manager of the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation & Drainage District.\n\nThere's beginning to be an understanding that it's in everybody's interest to remain above (elevation) 1,075, Betcher said. I'm going to assume we're going to get it fixed.\n\nThe Gila River Indian Community announced a deal with federal officials this week to keep 40,000 acre-feet in Lake Mead this year.\n\nOur agreement with the Department of the Interior is an essential step toward a plan for comprehensively addressing Arizona's pressing drought problem, Gila River Gov. Stephen Lewis said in a written statement.\n\nCentral Arizona Project customers such as Phoenix and Tucson understand that they'll likely face higher wholesale water rates because the aqueduct's fixed costs won't change as the amount of water sales supporting them shrinks, Buschatzke said.\n\nIt's a testament to the fact that people understand how important protecting the lake is, he said.\n\nArizona's envisioned actions alone — without help from other states — would drop the likelihood of mandated shortage to 15% next year, Buschatzke said. In combination with the interstate plan, they would hold the risk at 35% in 2019 and 2020.\n\nUltimately, the fear is that a worsening shortage could drop the reservoir below 1,025 feet. That's below the elevations where states have agreed on the consequences, and it would invite radical and unpredictable rationing from the federal Interior Department.\n\nLake Mead drops to lowest level in history\n\nArizona still needs legally binding commitments from a number of water users who have agreed in concept, but those deals appear imminent, Buschatzke said. First, water managers need $61.5 million pay some of those users for their water.\n\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey's new budget targets $6 million to the effort over three years. The Interior Department is expected to kick in $45 million though securing it may take time as President Donald Trump's administration gets situated in Washington. The rest would come from Arizona entities committed to the program.\n\nNegotiations continue, but we're on a great trajectory, Buschatzke said.\n\nFollow Brandon Loomis on Twitter: @brandonloomis\n\nKey measurements at Lake Mead\n\nThe lake that forms part of the border between Arizona and Nevada is the West's largest reservoir. It is formed by the Colorado River, whose water is divvied up among the seven states in its basin, but water from the Rockies that makes it to the lake serves Arizona, California and Nevada.\n\n• 1,229.0 feet above sea level, high water capacity during flooding\n\n• 1,225.0 feet, record high lake water level, achieved in summer 1983\n\n• 1,221.4 feet, top of spillway at Hoover Dam and maximum lake storage capacity\n\n• 1,219.6 feet, operationally full\n\n• 1,084.4 feet, Tuesday's lake level\n\n• 1,075.0 feet, water-rationing level agreed to in 2007 that would strip Arizona of 320,000 acre-feet of water a year\n\n• 1,050.0 feet, minimum elevation to generate power at Hoover Dam\n\n• 895.0 feet, lowest water outlet at Hoover Dam, considered the dead\n\nSource: National Park Service, Lakes Online
Thousands of President Donald Trump's supporters rioted after traveling to the nation's Capitol in protest of the presidential election results on Wednesday. Now, as President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration approaches, Airbnb has announced it is taking precautions against violent hate group members with a special Capitol Safety Plan.\n\nAirbnb strongly condemns last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol and the efforts to undermine our democratic process, Airbnb said in a statement Monday, provided by Airbnb spokesperson Christopher Nulty.\n\nAs a result, the home rental company announced a set of seven steps it's taking in the nation's capital as the inauguration looms.\n\nThe company plans to:\n\n1. Ban people involved in Capitol riots\n\nAs Airbnb learns through the media or law enforcement the names of individuals who have been confirmed to be responsible for violent criminal activity at the Capitol on Jan. 6, they will investigate whether the individual has an account.\n\nTo do this, Airbnb cross-references the arrest logs from the district's police department. All offenders are being banned from using the rental platform.\n\n2. Review existing reservations in the area\n\nAirbnb is reviewing reservations in the Washington, D.C., metro area.\n\nIf we confirm that any guests are associated with a hate group or otherwise not allowed on our platform for violating certain community policies prohibiting violence or engaging in criminal activity, we will cancel those reservations and ban them from Airbnb, Airbnb said.\n\n3. Make sure guests verify their identities\n\nAirbnb requires all U.S. residents to verify their identity before booking a rental. To do so, guests are required to provide a government-issued ID.\n\nThis helps prevent hate group members from hiding behind fake identities, Airbnb added.\n\n4. Administer extra security checks on guests' backgrounds\n\nAirbnb runs background checks of all U.S. users when they sign up. If any additional information surfaces under the new Capitol Safety Plan, the company plans to rerun background checks and source other publicly available databases to determine whether they should be banned.\n\n5. Potentially take legal action against any individuals planning violence, violating company policy, or if the company learns they are part of hate groups\n\nAirbnb said it will communicate to all guests booked in the Capitol region that if the company learns they or members of their party are part of hate groups, are planning violence, or violating Airbnb's policies or terms of service that the company may bring legal action against them.\n\n6. Remind hosts to reach out to crisis staff if an issue arises\n\nPeople who are members of hate groups are never welcome on Airbnb, the company said in its announcement, noting that it has taken action in the past to remove those individuals.\n\nWe are reminding our host community via email and notifications in our app that if they suspect violations of this policy, they can reach trained crisis staff by calling our Urgent Safety Line, Airbnb said.\n\n7. Offer support to Airbnb neighbors\n\nAirbnb provides a neighbor support line for neighbors in the district, Maryland and Virginia to reach the company directly with issues. The support line is staffed 24/7.\n\nWhat are hotels doing to prepare for the inauguration?\n\nWhile Airbnb is taking action before guests even arrive, hotels are taking other steps to ensure safety – some of which are being kept private.\n\nSome Hilton properties, including Capital Hilton, are in locations near the White House and other sites. Nigel Glennie, spokesperson for Hilton, explained these locations can be congregation points for both celebrations and events including protests.\n\nIt won't surprise you that our D.C. hotels continuously review their safety and security procedures, Glennie said. That said, procedures are not public.\n\nWe don't get into the specifics of our security posture publicly, but the preparation is always well informed and mindful of current events, Glennie said. The teams at these hotels are very experienced and have a long history of successfully managing through major public events.\n\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts, the vast majority of which are franchised, is putting the safety and security of guests and employees first, Rob Myers, spokesperson for Wyndham, told USA TODAY.\n\nWe have provided our hotels with additional security measures to consider, and we are encouraging them to follow guidance from local authorities, Myers said.\n\nHyatt is emphasizing COVID-19 mandates, which are enforced on hotel property. Most rioters did not wear masks on Wednesday.\n\nGuests who are not willing to comply with the policy will be asked to leave the premises or may be given the option of remaining in their guestroom for the duration of their visit, Stephen Snart, spokesperson for Hyatt, said.\n\nVacation rentals 101:What to know about vacation rental agencies vs. booking platforms
Sometimes wincing in pain and sometimes looking just fine, Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields overcame a painful hip pointer injury Monday to keep his team in a shootout of sorts before halftime against Alabama.\n\nBut it wasn't nearly enough. The Buckeyes soon buckled under Alabama's dominant offense, rendering Fields largely irrelevant in a 52-24 loss at the College Football Playoff national championship game in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nFields completed 17 of 33 passes for 194 yards and one touchdown, just 10 days after sustaining such a hard hit to his side against Clemson that many wondered whether he had broken his ribs. Fields' father told ESPN before the game Monday at Hard Rock Stadium that his son was diagnosed with a hip pointer.\n\nFor him to go out there and play today really shows his toughness and how much he loves his brothers, Ohio State coach Ryan Day said afterward. He still took some shots on that hip. He was not 100 percent tonight. He was working through it and made some really good throws, made some gutsy plays, kept us in the game there for a while, but he's an unbelievable player, and I'm going to miss him.\n\nFields said afterward that he wasn't able to practice during the early part of last week and kind of struggled. At one point in the second quarter Monday, Fields was slow to get up off the field, gritted his teeth and touched his hip in pain. But he also directed the Buckeyes (7-1) to two touchdowns in their first four possessions and steered his team to the end. He faced heavy pressure from Alabama (13-0) throughout and rushed six times for 67 yards.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm glad I was able to play, and we didn't get the job done, Fields said after the game. But of course I could have been healthier. But I was healthy enough. I was able to be out there.\n\nHis health had been a mystery all week after the injury in the second quarter of his last game, a 49-28 win against Clemson in the national semifinal Jan. 1. That's when Clemson linebacker James Skalski barreled into Fields' right-side rib and hip area with his helmet on a tackle that was flagged for illegal targeting, causing Skalski's ejection from the game.\n\nThe blow also knocked Fields out of the game for one play before he returned to throw four more touchdown passes, including two bombs of 56 and 45 yards.\n\nIn the Clemson game, Fields completed 22 of 28 passes for 385 yards and six touchdown passes despite the injury. Fields, a transfer from Georgia, said after that game that an injection helped him get back on the field.\n\nI took like a shot or two in the (medical) tent and just ran back out there, he said Jan. 1. But I mean it's pretty much my whole right torso that's messed up, a little bit of my hip.\n\nFields also said after that game that he felt pain after every throw. But the specific nature of his injury was kept secret by Day, who cited team policy about not disclosing injuries. Day said medical decisions were handled by the medical staff.\n\nOn Thursday, Fields said he had full trust in the trainers here at Ohio State and (team doctor James) Borchers.\n\nI wasn't, you know, I guess hesitant on taking anything that they would give me, but I was just trying to do whatever I could do to get back on the field, he said then. I think those guys handled it the way I would have wanted it to be handled.\n\nHe predicted Thursday, I'll be good come Monday night.\n\nHe was, just not good enough to do what he did against Clemson.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

Jorge Reina Schement\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nI shoveled the snow from my sidewalk recently, and that got me thinking about masks, the pandemic, and the power of networks.\n\nSnow shoveling causes my muscles to scream and my back to shout the loudest, but I do it to make walking safe for anyone who passes in front of my house. Up and down the street, my neighbors come out early with shovels and snow blowers to clear their walks, and even clear the sidewalks for our elderly residents. The fact that this happens each time it snows poses an important question of civic responsibility. Why should I shovel my sidewalk?\n\nIf each of us acted in our own selfish interest, we would not shovel, and many of us would suffer few consequences, even when local laws require it. For the most part, leaving snow on the sidewalks would only inconvenience regular walkers — those with dogs, and anyone forced to walk on a snowy street with cars. Still, if I adhered to a strict code of individualistic self-interest and freedom to act as I want, my convenience would come before that of my neighbors. After all, it helps me very little if the only cleared sidewalk is my own, so why should I shovel?\n\nCommunity benefit and self-interest\n\nInstead, I engage another kind of self-interest. I shovel my own walk for the benefit of neighbors and strangers. My actions appear altruistic, but my reward does not just result from doing good. The benefit comes from the power of networks.\n\nThe value of my cleared sidewalk can only be realized if my neighbors agree with me and also shovel their own walks. Whatever small benefit I gain from a tidy stretch of sidewalk in front of my house grows when my neighbors choose to shovel their sidewalks and connect them into a network of cleared sidewalks. The neighborhood achieves safe and walkable sidewalks because we all inconvenience our individual selves for the collective benefit of our community. Together, we gain freedom from the isolation of a snow storm, and from the danger of sharing the street with cars.\n\nIn my field of telecommunications, we call such actions network externalities. The greater the number of people connected in a telecommunications network, the greater the value of that network to all of the members, because they each get to connect with more people and benefit from the outcomes of those connections. Plus, every time someone joins the network, the value of the network goes up for the rest of us. And, so it is with snowy sidewalks.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine rollout:Trump, Health and Human Services are throwing away their shot\n\nEach one of us who shovels our own sidewalk joins the network of snow shovelers; and, by doing so, increases the value of the network by adding one more cleared sidewalk. The value of a single cleared sidewalk is small, but the cumulative effect to the neighborhood network is large. As with telecommunications networks, the greater the number of cleared sidewalks in the network, the greater the value to all of us because the network benefits from our individual actions.\n\nThe network effect on COVID\n\nAfter a large snowfall in December, my neighbors and I showed up to shovel wearing masks, and taking extra precautions for each other's safety. In fact, masking up to confront the COVID virus offers the same dynamic that takes place when we collectively shovel. The greater the number of people who join the network of individuals wearing masks, the greater the protection offered by mask wearing. Likewise, the greater the number of people who join the network of vaccination recipients, the greater the protection offered by vaccines. The power of networks resides in the balance between the freedom to act as an individual and the freedom from harm offered by collective participation.\n\nHHS chief:COVID-19 vaccination rates will increase\n\nSo, the next time it snows and I trudge out with my shovel to clear a stretch of sidewalk, I will remind myself that I am better off by taking an individual act on behalf of my neighbors. And, when I wear my mask, and line up for my vaccine, I will remember that when we pull together in the same direction, we all go to a better place.\n\nJorge Reina Schement is a Distinguished Professor of Communication Policy and Latino Studies at the School of Communication & Information at Rutgers University.
James Jay Carafano\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nFor many in Washington, the debate over funding for a wall between Mexico and the United States is a purely partisan skirmish. Underneath, however, is a real issue: securing the border.\n\nUnregulated migration would be a strategic disaster, not just for the U.S., but for the entire Western Hemisphere.\n\nCanada, for example, has one of the most-disciplined and level-headed migration systems in the world. Yet it has had to deal with spillover from our chaos, as asylum-seekers drift north. For the first time in a long time, a growing number of Canadians are fretting over immigration and border policies.\n\nOUR VIEW:Destructive, inane shutdown drags on after talks hit a wall\n\nCanada isn't alone. Mexico has a problem as well, with massive illegal border crossing on its southern border; human trafficking fueling the criminal cartels; and warehousing the caravans headed to the United States.\n\nIn Central America, unscrupulous politicians cheerlead for caravans to undermine their own governments. Meanwhile, Venezuelans pour into other countries, like the fragile democracy that is Colombia, threatening their stability by forcing them to host massive illegal populations.\n\nOnce the world figures out that borders in the Western Hemisphere mean nothing, the flood that might turn toward the West could reach into the millions, if not the tens of millions.\n\nThe bottom line is that while our political parties squabble over border funding — not unlike the crew and passengers debating the color scheme in the smoking lounge as the ship goes down — America's enemies could weaponize illegal migration. If this isn't stopped in its tracks, then the immigration problems in Europe may well pale in comparison.\n\nThere is never a good time for a desperate fight. But sensible border security is worth it. Time for both sides to put the politics aside and come up with solutions that deal with the magnitude of the impending problem.\n\nJames Jay Carafano is vice president of the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNow that the Iran nuclear deal has been implemented, it is likely to be tested in many ways, starting almost immediately.\n\nWork remains on details of sanctions relief and nuclear monitoring, while businessmen and diplomats in the United States and the West will seek to expand ties with Iran without running afoul of U.S. law. And how Iranians and Americans react to perceived slights or violations could cause problems going forward.\n\nThere are lots of tests for the (the nuclear deal) down the road, said Daryl Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. It's going to be important for everyone, especially political leaders, to distinguish between serious breaches of the agreement … and mundane ones.\n\nThe U.S. and Iran will continue to disagree on ballistic missiles, terrorism and other issues that could potentially also unravel the nuclear deal, he said.\n\nHere are some areas where Iranian and American policies could continue to conflict and a look at what happens next:\n\nBallistic missiles\n\nThe first test came Sunday, when the United States imposed new sanctions on 11 individuals and companies involved in Iran's ballistic missile program. The sanctions were in response to last year's missile test by Iran.\n\nWe will continue to enforce these sanctions vigorously, President Obama said Sunday. We are going to remain vigilant about it.\n\nIran has said its ballistic missiles are a justified part of its national defense.\n\nU.S. sanctions Iran's ballistic missile program\n\nKeeping Iran's nuclear program peaceful\n\nThe United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has several important tasks that require Iranian cooperation, said David Albright, a former weapons inspector and president of the Institute for Science and International Security.\n\nIran has to file a complete declaration of its nuclear program, which could raise new questions about its past nuclear weapons work, which the IAEA has to certify has ended. The agency issued a report in December saying it found no evidence of nuclear weapons work in Iran past 2011. Proving those activities have ended would mean going to suspected nuclear sites controlled by the military, Albright said.\n\nThe problem: Iran's policy is you can't go, Albright said.\n\nPolicing sensitive technology\n\nThe nuclear deal created a system to control Iran's purchase of dual-use goods that could be used for either peaceful nuclear purposes or for banned nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles. The added layer of bureaucracy analyzes proposed purchases and technology transfers from all countries, supposedly directed at Iranian companies in such fields as semi-conductors, automotive, machine tools and aviation.\n\nThe worry is that, like in the past, Iran will use civilian companies to buy equipment for its illicit ballistic missile and arms programs, Albright said.\n\nHe said a December test of this procurement method failed, and such a program has never been done on this scale anywhere.\n\nKimball said the true test of the system will come when it goes live.\n\nSanctions relief and getting back to business\n\nIran now has access to some $100 billion in assets that had been frozen by international sanctions over its nuclear program. Much of that money is tied up in foreign debt. For the remaining $50 billion or so, the U.S. Treasury has to provide a financial path to Iran for bankers in China, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey without violating the U.S. sanctions that still remain.\n\nInternational sanctions against Iran lifted in landmark nuke deal\n\nJust because you have sanctions relief doesn't mean these banks are going to be keen on doing financial transactions with Iran, said Mark Dubowitz, a sanctions expert and director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nPractically speaking I don't think there's going to be a gold rush into Iran, Dubowitz said.\n\nDiplomacy without full relations\n\nDiplomacy will proceed with great caution, said Robert Einhorn, a former nuclear negotiator with Iran who served as the State Department's special adviser for non-proliferation and arms control.\n\nIran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has decreed that Iranian diplomats should not engage one-on-one with the United States. He also said the nuclear deal should not lead to a new era of cooperation with the United States.\n\nThe nuclear negotiations opened channels of communications between the nations' top diplomats. That was evident last week, when Iran released 10 U.S. sailors a day after they strayed into Iranian waters, and Saturday when four U.S.-Iranian citizens were released from Iranian prisons in exchange for seven Iranians in the U.S. serving sentences or facing charges for sanctions violations.\n\nFirst Take: Iran lays out welcome mat with prisoners' release\n\nNavigational error caused Navy boats to stray into Iranian waters\n\nThere will be contacts on areas where interests converge or could converge, but it's not going to lead to improvement in any time soon in the relationship, Einhorn said.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIran's brief detention of 10 U.S. sailors is the latest incident to spark growing tensions between the United States and the Islamic Republic in the wake of a nuclear deal that President Obama hoped would improve relations between the two estranged nations.\n\nIran seized the sailors and their two small U.S. Navy boats Tuesday after the vessels drifted into Iranian waters. They were released Wednesday.\n\nHere are five other issues that have put the two countries in conflict:\n\nBallistic missile tests\n\nLast month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ordered the country's defense minister to expedite Iran's ballistic missile program in response to planned U.S. sanctions on Iranian defense companies. We have never negotiated regarding our defense capabilities including our missile program & will not accept any restrictions in this regard, Rouhani said on Twitter. He added: If the US continues its illegitimate interference w/ Iran's right to defend itself a new program will be devised to enhance missile capabilities. The United States considers the tests to be hostile actions that are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nFiring rockets near ships:\n\nThe U.S. military released a video Saturday showing what it said is an Iranian military vessel firing several unguided rockets near, but not at, the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, other warships and commercial craft on Dec. 26 in the Strait of Hormuz. The images show what appears to be an Iranian Revolutionary Guards vessel firing rockets from about 1,500 yards, or less than a mile. Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, a spokesman for the Navy's 5th Fleet, said Iran's actions were unsafe, unprofessional and inconsistent with international maritime law.\n\nSupreme Court case on frozen assets:\n\nSupreme Court justices in Washington heard arguments Wednesday that hundreds of victims of Iranian-sponsored terrorism and surviving family members should win access to about $2 billion in frozen assets of Iran's central bank. Among them are relatives of 173 of the 241 servicemen killed in the 1983 bombing of a Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. It was carried out by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, a close Iranian-ally, but federal courts in the United States held Iran responsible. Now the high court must decide if Congress overstepped its bounds by passing a law specifically designed to resolve the standoff over the frozen assets.\n\nContinued U.S. sanctions:\n\nIran could gain relief from international sanctions starting as early as this week after meeting all the requirements under its nuclear deal with world powers. However, most U.S. sanctions will remain until Iran takes additional steps to implement the deal, which was reached in July. International investors, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies and foreign banks are waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department on what they will be allowed to do in Iran without breaking U.S. law, said Patrick Clawson, director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Members of Congress have been pushing to impose new sanctions over Iran's recent missile tests.\n\nImprisonment of American citizens:\n\nJason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter with dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, has been sitting in an Iranian prison since 2014 on charges that include espionage. He was convicted and sentenced to a prison term but Iranian authorities did not provide details of the verdict. Douglas Jehl, the newspaper's foreign editor, called Rezaian's imprisonment an injustice and a sham. Iran also is holding two other Americans with dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship. Saeed Abedini, a Muslim convert to Christianity, was arrested in 2012 while helping to establish house churches in Iran, and former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death on spying charges after being arrested in 2011 while visiting his grandmothers in Tehran. Former FBI agent Robert Levinson was taken hostage in 2007 on Iran's Kish Island and has since disappeared. The FBI says he was there as a private investigator, but his family said he was working for the CIA. The U.S. government is seeking the release of the detainees and information on Levinson's whereabouts.
Gallery Liz Carmouche def. Jennifer Maia at UFC Fight Night 133: Best photos view 7 images\n\nUFC flyweight Jennifer Maia is benched for six months after accepting a suspension for a contaminated supplement.\n\nThe UFC's anti-doping partner, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), today announced Maia's punishment after an out-of-competition test conducted Aug. 16 came back positive for a cocktail of banned substances.\n\nMaia's (15-5-1 MMA, 0-1 UFC) suspension is retroactive to Aug. 31, meaning she'll be eligible to return in early March.\n\nThe positive test that halted Maia's career revealed the presence of furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide and the thiazide metabolite 4-amino-6-chloro-1, 3-benzenedisulfonamide (ACB). They are specified substances in the class of diuretics and masking agents and carry a one-year suspension for first-time offenders.\n\nA subsequent investigation traced the substances to a dietary supplement Maia was using at the time of her test. None of the substances found in her sample were advertised on the supplement label. USADA determined her ingestion was accidental and issued a reduced sanction of six months while also putting the product she took on a list of high-risk supplements.\n\nMaia is still subject to random drug testing per USADA rules.\n\nTainted supplements have been at the center of several UFC anti-doping cases, though selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have been a far more common culprit than the substances found in Maia's system. USADA has tried to ban SARMs with U.S. lawmakers to shut off supplement contamination cases.\n\nMaia, 30, made her octagon debut at UFC Fight Night 133 against onetime bantamweight title challenger Liz Carmouche. She lost a unanimous decision that snapped a six-fight winning streak on the regional circuit, including three straight wins in Invicta FC.\n\nBelow is USADA's full statement:\n\nColorado Springs, Colo. (January 15, 2019) – USADA announced today that Jennifer Maia, of Curitiba, Brazil, has accepted a six-month sanction for a violation of the UFC® Anti-Doping Policy after testing positive for prohibited substances from a contaminated dietary supplement. Maia, 30, tested positive for furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, and the thiazide metabolite 4-amino-6-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide (ACB), following an out-of-competition test conducted on August 16, 2018. These substances are Specified Substances in the class of Diuretics and Masking Agents and are prohibited at all times under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, which has adopted the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List. During an investigation into the circumstances of her case, opened and sealed containers of a dietary supplement she was using at the time of the August 16, 2018 sample collection, and that she declared on her doping control form, were sent to the WADA-accredited laboratory in Brazil for analysis. Although no prohibited substances were listed on the supplement label, the analysis revealed that both contained the prohibited substances for which Maia tested positive. Accordingly, this product has been added to the High Risk List of supplements maintained on USADA's online dietary supplement safety education and awareness resource – Supplement 411 (www.Supplement411.org). Further, USADA reminds athletes that dietary supplement products marketed for weight loss carry significant risk to contain prohibited prescription medications, such as diuretics. Under the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, as well as the World Anti-Doping Code, the determination that an athlete's positive test was caused by a contaminated product may result in a reduced sanction. The sanction for a doping offense resulting from the use of a contaminated product ranges from a reprimand and no period of ineligibility to a two-year period of ineligibility. Maia's six-month period of ineligibility began on August 31, 2018, the date on which she was provisionally suspended from competition. Pursuant to the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, all UFC athletes serving a period of ineligibility for an anti-doping policy violation are required to continue to make themselves available for testing to receive credit for time completed under their sanction. USADA conducts the year-round, independent anti-doping program for all UFC athletes. USADA is an independent, non-profit, non-governmental agency whose sole mission is to preserve the integrity of competition, inspire true sport, and protect the rights of clean athletes. In an effort to aid UFC athletes, as well as their support team members, in understanding the rules applicable to them, USADA provides comprehensive instruction on the UFC Anti-Doping Program website (https://UFC.USADA.org) regarding the testing process and prohibited substances, how to obtain permission to use a necessary medication, and the risks and dangers of taking supplements as well as performance-enhancing and recreational drugs. In addition, the agency manages a drug reference hotline, Drug Reference Online (https://UFC.GlobalDRO.com), conducts educational sessions, and proactively distributes a multitude of educational materials, such as the Prohibited List, easy-reference wallet cards, and periodic athlete alerts. Along with education and testing, robust anti-doping programs enable investigations stemming from tips and whistleblowers. USADA makes available a number of ways to report the abuse of performance-enhancing drugs in sport in an effort to protect clean athletes and promote clean competition. Any tip can be reported using the USADA Play Clean Tip Center, by email at playclean@usada.org, by phone at 1 877-Play Clean (1-877-752-9253), or by mail.\n\nFor more on the UFC's upcoming schedule, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.
WASHINGTON – The breach on the Capitol building by a mob of pro-Trump supporters Wednesday was compared to a banana republic, and described repeatedly as un-American.\n\nThe protesters shattered windows, vandalized the Capitol building, stalked the halls waving Confederate flags, required Vice President Mike Pence to be taken to a secure location, and forced hundreds of lawmakers, staff, and reporters to either evacuate or shelter-in-place.\n\nHowever, the violent attempt to stop the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral victory was unsuccessful after Congress reconvened once the building was secured, and the Electoral College votes were counted.\n\nThere will be an inauguration in two weeks, where Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will emerge as the new administration.\n\nHere is a look at a tumultuous day through some of the people who were there.\n\n'Damage our republic forever'\n\nBefore the breach, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., slammed the GOP lawmakers who were planning on objecting to the certification.\n\nThe voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken, McConnell said from Senate floor. If we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever.\n\nIf this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral. We'd never see the whole nation accept an election again, he stated. He continued: It would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise American voters and overrule the courts and the states on this thin basis. And I will not pretend such a vote would be a harmless protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing.\n\n'Massive security failure'\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-CO., called the breach a massive security failure and I think an awful lot of people should lose their jobs over this.\n\nMore:What happened in D.C. today? How a Trump mob stormed the Capitol forcing Washington into lockdown\n\nCapitol Hill police were overwhelmed by the slew of Trump supporters who climbed the walls, rushed up the steps, and broke windows.\n\nProtesters were then shown leaving the Capitol through the front door.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, called the security a failure.\n\nA photo of Crow comforting Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., while taking cover as the protesters disrupted the joint session of Congress went viral Wednesday.\n\n'We love you'\n\nAs his supporters were wreaking havoc on the Capitol, President Donald Trump responded via tweet, and posted a video.\n\nIn it, Trump told them that we love you and you're very special, while repeating the erroneous claims the election was stolen. He told them then to go home.\n\nThe video, and a few additional tweets, resulted in his Twitter account being locked for twelve hours. His Facebook and Instagram accounts were also locked.\n\nMore:Twitter, Facebook and Instagram lock President Trump's accounts for 24 hours after posts with policy 'violations'\n\n'Disgraceful and un-American'\n\nFollowing the breach, several of the Republican lawmakers who had been planning to object decided to change their mind, citing the seriousness of the breach and the division plaguing the country.\n\nIndiana Sen. Mike Braun said it was the mob storming the Capitol that caused his reversal, saying, when today's events unfolded, I could not dignify it even by withholding something I objected to.\n\nMore:The members of Congress who were planning to object to Joe Biden's Electoral College win\n\nSens. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Steve Daines of Montana joined in that sentiment.\n\nA few House members concurred. Washington state Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers stated: called it disgraceful and un-American and said she has decided I will vote to uphold the Electoral College results and I encourage Donald Trump to condemn and put an end to this madness.\n\n'Gather due to a selfish man's injured pride'\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah., who has repeatedly criticized Trump in the past, slammed the president during a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nNow we gather due to a selfish man's injured pride and the outrage of supporters who he had deliberately misinformed for the past two months, Romney said.\n\nHe continued: What happened here today was an insurrection incited by the President of the United States.\n\n'The match was lit by Donald Trump and his most ardent enablers'\n\nAll the living former presidents condemned the violence at the Capitol, with a few directly naming Trump.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said History will rightly remember today's violence that was incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of a great dishonor and shame for our country.\n\n'Sickening and heartbreaking': All former presidents condemn violence at capitol\n\nPresident Bill Clinton named Trump explicitly, stating: The assault was fueled by more than four years of poison politics spreading deliberate misinformation, sowing distrust in our system, and pitting Americans against one another. The match was lit by Donald Trump and his most ardent enablers, including many in Congress, to overturn the results of an election he lost.\n\nPresident George W. Bush, the only living former Republican president, released a statement stating he and former First Lady Laura Bush are watching the scenes of mayhem unfolding at the seat of our Nation's government in disbelief and dismay.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter said he was troubled by the violence at the U.S. Capitol today.\n\n'I will keep the oath I made'\n\nPence, who was presiding over the joint session of Congress, called it a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol.\n\nDefying his boss,Pence said Wednesday only lawmakers can decide whether to accept or reject the Electoral College votes won by Biden.\n\n'I will keep the oath I made': Pence defies Trump, says he won't block Congress from affirming Biden's win\n\nPence's decision to abide by the rules as he presides over Congress' formal acceptance of the votes was a rare deviance from the staunch loyalty he's shown President Donald Trump over the past four years.\n\nAnd it earned him a quick rebuke. Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump has falsely asserted that Pence, in his constitutional role as president of the Senate, can change the votes.
The Iranian Parliament approved a bill Tuesday designating the entire U.S. military and Pentagon terrorist organizations after the killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq.\n\nLawmakers also backed a motion allocating $220 million to the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corp's Quds Force to take revenge for Soleimani's death in a drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe U.S. action has threatened to spill over into outright military confrontation between Tehran and Washington, though both sides insist they don't want war. Trump has sought a maximum pressure policy on Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear activities, ballistic missile program and support for militant groups.\n\nIran's new legislation was unanimously approved by 223 lawmakers, according to Iranian state media. Last year, the nation's Supreme National Security Council had designated U.S. Central Command, the U.S. military's Middle East command unit, a terrorist group. That came in response to the Trump administration's labeling of the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization after Washington exited a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and reimposed economic sanctions.\n\nIran-U.S. tensions reach new heights: Iranian Americans aren't mourning Gen. Qasem Soleimani. They're glad he's dead. But, now what?\n\nSoleimani headed the Quds Force, an elite wing of the Revolutionary Guard that orchestrated Iran's ties to non-state armed groups in the region such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq, with whom Soleimani was holding meetings when he was killed in a U.S. strike near Baghdad's main airport Friday.\n\nSeparately, Iranian state TV reported that at least 56 people were killed and 213 injured in a stampede that erupted at a funeral procession Tuesday for the slain general in Soleimani's hometown of Kerman, in southeastern Iran. A procession in Tehran on Monday drew more than 1 million people in Iran's capital, crowding main thoroughfares and side streets. Emergency services in Kerman blamed high levels of congestion and overcrowding for the tragedy.\n\nSoleimani's burial was later delayed because of the huge crowds.\n\nAuthorities did not say when the funeral and burial would resume.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the U.S. State Department or White House to Iran's parliamentary resolution. Washington considered Soleimani a terrorist responsible for hundreds of American soldiers' deaths in Iraq, largely because the organization he headed trained Iraqi militant groups to target U.S.-led coalition forces with improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Soleimani also oversaw Iran's sophisticated foreign intelligence and security apparatus.\n\nTragedy in Iran:Stampede at Qasem Soleimani's funeral kills at least 56
AP\n\nSYDNEY (AP) — Football Federation Australia is placing a lot of faith in the weather bureau, moving two days before the scheduled kick off to postpone a weekend match because of forecast hot temperatures.\n\nThe FFA on Thursday said the A-League match late Saturday afternoon at Newcastle, north of Sydney, between the Jets and Melbourne Victory would be moved to Monday evening at the same stadium.\n\nIt said New South Wales state was expected to experience extreme heat-wave conditions on the weekend and that the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, which considers temperature, humidity, wind speed and the angle of the sun, would be 34 Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) at match time.\n\nThe FFA Heat Policy states that matches should be postponed if the WBGT exceeds 28 C (82 F).\n\nToday's forecast leaves no doubt that the conditions on Saturday in Newcastle will be significantly above the thresholds we have in place, Greg O'Rourke, head of the A-League, said. Taking into consideration the obvious player welfare concerns, as well as the need to give players, teams and fans the best possible opportunity to plan for the match, moving the match to Monday night is the only decision we could make.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: The top academic officer at Auburn University is facing a no-confidence vote this week by faculty members over lingering dissatisfaction with his handling of class scheduling around the coronavirus pandemic. The Opelika-Auburn News reports the University Senate is scheduled to meet Tuesday to address complaints against Provost Bill Hardgrave, who is being defended by President Jay Gouge. More than 500 faculty members met in a virtual gathering in November to discuss their concerns about Hardgrave and his insistence on returning to primarily in-person classes in the spring. Economics professor Mike Stern said Wednesday that his concerns still haven't been adequately addressed. Hardgrave and other officials need to better assess teaching spaces and how to follow health guidelines about social distancing, he said. I volunteered to teach face-to-face in the fall and spring (of the 2020-21 school year) and they promised it would be safe, Stern said. Then, they did the opposite.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The usual transportation difficulties in rural Alaska have presented unique obstacles for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, officials said. Dozens of remote villages lack hospitals and road connections, while ultracold freezers required for storage of specific varieties of the vaccine are essentially nonexistent, Alaska Public Media reports. Tribal health care providers responded by mobilizing a massive effort delivering thousands of doses to remote areas. Providers airlifted vaccine to villages using a fleet of chartered planes, while the medicine also was delivered over choppy seas on a water taxi. Some clinicians were shuttled around villages on sleds pulled behind snowmachines. Dr. Ellen Hodges encountered the unforeseen difficulty of Alaska being too cold in some places to vaccinate front-line health care workers. It became immediately apparent that the vaccine was going to freeze in the metal part of the needle, said Hodges, who contended with subzero temperatures on a remote Southwest Alaska airport tarmac. Hodges ultimately kept doses tucked in her shirt until they were injected.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: No individuals in the Phoenix metropolitan area's 12 largest cities have been cited for violating mask mandates. The laws, which have been in place for six months to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, have not been cited at all by Tucson and Flagstaff law enforcement. The Phoenix area police and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office have cited or referred fewer than 75 businesses out of more than 3,500 total complaints. The city of Scottsdale has cited the most businesses, followed by Tempe and Phoenix. Avondale, Buckeye, Glendale, Goodyear, Peoria and Surprise have also not cited any person or business for violating mandates. The Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health has received more than 400 complaints related to workplace safety as a result of potential violations of state orders, but the agency has not cited any employers to date as of Monday. Meanwhile, the state has among the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the country, and some Phoenix metro hospitals have begun to refuse emergency transports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of active coronavirus cases in the state remained above 27,000 on Sunday after hitting a record the day earlier. A state health official has said the record-high number of active cases is likely to signal that hospitalizations will increase in coming days. The Arkansas Health Department's count of active cases was at 27,492 on Sunday, a decline by 330 from a record high of 27,822 on Saturday. Arkansas reported 3,330 new confirmed and probable cases of the coronavirus Sunday, though Gov. Asa Hutchinson said more than 2,000 of those cases were from late reporting months ago. Regardless, they reflect how this virus impacts all of us, Hutchinson wrote on Twitter. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University say there were 1,253.5 new cases per 100,000 people in Arkansas over the past two weeks, which ranks sixth in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 148 people in Arkansas tested positive in the past week. The state's hospitalizations Sunday were at 1,340. The state reported 33 more deaths, bringing the death toll to 4,043.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state's coronavirus catastrophe reached a staggering new level Monday as Johns Hopkins University data showed California has recorded more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic started. Deaths have exploded since a COVID-19 surge began in October. It took the state six months to record its first 10,000 deaths. But in barely a month, the total rose from 20,000 to 30,000. Over the weekend, state officials reported a two-day record of 1,163 deaths. Hospitalizations also have exploded, and many hospitals are stretched to the limit. Over the weekend, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said the virus's immense spread reflected unsafe things people did during the holidays, making any activity outside a household much more risky. This is just not the time to go to the shopping mall or to a friend's house to watch a basketball or football game, Ferrer said. Meanwhile, the county announced it will stop using Curative COVID-19 tests at pop-up testing sites after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert that the test could produce false negatives. And the city announced Sunday that its huge COVID-19 testing site at Dodger Stadium will be transformed into a vaccination center by the week's end.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Despite some closures due to the pandemic and price increases, state parks recorded a nearly 23% increase in visitors in 2020, with some data from November and December still yet to be logged. The 18.3 million visitors Colorado state parks have reported were up from the 14.8 million total in 2019, The Gazette reports. The record figure is about 53% higher than the agency's 2013-14 fiscal year, when 11.9 million visitors were counted at the 41 state parks. At Castlewood Canyon, there were a total of 263,744 visitors through November, up more than 56% from a then-record 2017. Lake Pueblo recorded the most visitors with a record 2.7 million people registered from January through October. The state's other most popular parks were Chatfield, which logged 2.1 million visitors through October, and Cherry Creek State Park, which is expected to log more than 2 million visitors for the first time in its history.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz is under quarantine after a member of her staff tested positive for the coronavirus. Contact tracing is underway, and all members of Bysiewicz's staff who had been in close contact with the unidentified staffer will also quarantine, said her chief of staff, Adam Joseph. Bysiewicz tested negative Thursday and will work remotely while self-isolating, Joseph said. This is the first known case of coronavirus within her office. The staffer who tested positive has not exhibited any symptoms and is at home in isolation.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A county library employee who went above and beyond the call of duty during the COVID-19 pandemic has landed a prestigious honor from Sussex County government. Kristin Cooper, assistant director at South Coastal Library in Bethany Beach, is the county's 2020 Employee of the Year, as selected by the Shining Star Employee Recognition Committee. Cooper was selected from a pool of seven candidates, all quarterly winners or notable honorable mentions, from the past year. She was an honorable mention in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual honor was announced by Karen Brewington, Sussex County's human resource director, during last week's Sussex County Council meeting. Brewington said Cooper was unanimously chosen by the committee because she went above and beyond to keep the community engaged, strengthened and hopeful during such unprecedented times of COVID. Cooper was lauded for, among other things, her efforts to keep library patrons connected through virtual resources and programs. As the 2020 honoree, she receives a one-week vacation bonus.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Public Schools is gearing up to return some students to the classroom next month, and teachers have already received their assignments via email, WUSA-TV reports. When the term starts Feb. 1, teachers will either remain virtual or be assigned to in-person learning, according to the emails. Educators who cannot or will not return to the classroom can apply for leave either through the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Family and Medical Leave Act, DCPS said in a statement. Parents are expected to find out this week if their child meets the high-need criteria for an in-person seat, according to DCPS. Vaccinations for DCPS staff are expected to begin this month. A December survey from the school district showed parents almost evenly split over whether they want to send their children back to school for in-person learning in the new year.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state's coronavirus cases remain at record highs, with more than 11,000 new cases reported Monday, along with 163 deaths. The Florida Department of Health reported 11,576 new cases and said the seven-day average for the state is about 15,000 per day. That is about 40% higher that the previous peak of 11,000 reached in July. There were 7,650 people hospitalized in Florida with COVID-19 on Monday morning, a jump of about 150 from Sunday. The state has reported approximately 140 coronavirus deaths per day over the past week – the weekly average peaked at 183 per day in August but had fallen to 40 in November before the latest rise began. Increases in the death rate usually follow jumps in cases by about a month. For comparison, heart disease and cancer, the state's two largest causes of death by far, each kill an average of about 125 Floridians per day. The jumps in cases and deaths come as the state tries to roll out its vaccination program. Gov. Ron DeSantis has emphasized immunizing those 65 and older, front-line medical workers and nursing home patients.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state's plan to expand access to a COVID-19 vaccine to people over 65 got off to a rocky start Monday, with the websites of at least two public health districts crashing and other districts reporting overwhelming demand for appointments. The state was already struggling with its vaccine rollout before the latest woes. The Coastal Health District, which includes Savannah, stopped scheduling appointments after an overwhelming response from residents ages 65 and older interested in COVID-19 vaccination, the district said in a news release. The district – one of 18 in the state – said health officials in the eight counties it covers have enough requests to schedule appointments through February and, in some cases, into March. We know people are frustrated because the process is moving more slowly than they would like, and if we could vaccinate everyone today, we'd do that, Lawton Davis, the district's health director, said in a statement. But your health departments are stretched thin and doing what they can to move forward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state's doctor shortage has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, and experts say the chances of a rebound hinge on Hawaii's ability to help doctors stay in business. More than 400 doctors say COVID-19 has forced them to close their practices, reduce hours or switch to telehealth services, Hawaii Public Radio reports. That brings the state's overall doctor shortage to more than 1,000, according to the latest Hawaii Physician Workforce Assessment released by the University of Hawaii's John A. Burns School of Medicine. So what it means is that if you need a doctor urgently, you might die because you might not be able to access that, said Dr. Kelley Withy, director of the Hawaii and Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center at the Honolulu medical school. And if you need a specialist chronically to help you manage your condition, you may have to travel to get to that specialist, and it may be by air travel, which of course is especially difficult right now. The shortage is greater in the communities beyond Oahu, said Dr. Elizabeth Ann Ignacio, an intervention radiologist on Maui. Hawaii has more than 10,000 licensed doctors, but only about 3,200 are active, Ignacio said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Monday described 2020 like a damaging and deadly tornado but said Idaho is strong heading into the new year with strong finances and a COVID-19 vaccine now available. The Republican governor's state of the state speech is considered the kickoff to the legislative session and is usually heavy on budget matters. He usually gives the speech to a joint session in the House of Representatives attended by all 35 senators and 70 representatives, as well as members of the Idaho Supreme Court and other statewide elected office holders. But his speech Monday was delivered remotely to avoid spreading the virus. He spent much of it talking about the coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 residents, and he asked for a moment of silence for those who died. He also championed front-line health care workers and the challenges they've faced.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools students began their return to the classroom Monday as school doors opened to thousands of pre-kindergarten and some special education students. The nation's third-largest district, with about 355,000 students, plans a gradual return to in-person instruction after going remote last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. It is our city's first day of embarking on our path to returning to in-person learning, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a Southwest Side elementary school, where students wore face coverings, and desks had sneeze guard barriers. Nearly 40% of eligible students, about 77,000, expressed interest in returning, with about 6,000 students in pre-kindergarten and special education expected Monday. The Chicago Teachers Union has opposed reopening over safety concerns. Union officials claim the district hasn't done enough to protect teachers from COVID-19, proposing to continue distance learning until teachers are vaccinated. District officials argue distance learning doesn't work well for all, particularly many Black and Latino students who make up the majority of the district. The district's safety plan includes purchasing classroom air purifiers and a testing program.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state has identified a case of a new coronavirus strain, first seen in the United Kingdom, that spreads more easily. The new variant, which is not thought to carry a higher risk of severe disease or death, is behind England's latest lockdown. Like other states, Indiana has been monitoring testing samples to determine whether this variant is circulating. Indiana Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratories confirmed the presence of the strain in the state, health officials said Monday. It's common for viruses to mutate, and we are seeing that occur with COVID-19, State Health Commissioner Dr. Kris Box said in a statement. Because this strain of the virus can be transmitted more easily, it's more important than ever that Hoosiers continue to wear their masks, practice social distancing, maintain good hygiene and get vaccinated when they are eligible.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: New clinical trials began last week at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for a COVID-19 vaccine that officials there hope will be even more viable for global distribution. To really get (COVID-19) under control, we need the world vaccinated, said Dr. Patricia Winokur, executive dean at the University of Iowa's Carver College of Medicine and principal investigator for the UI site of the clinical drug trial. UIHC began enrolling participants in the Novavax trial last Monday, and Winokur said it's still accepting more. Winokur estimated 30,000 individuals would be enrolled at sites across the country, all told. So far, roughly a sixth of those spots have already been filled. While the Novavax vaccine – like Pfizer's and Moderna's – will require two doses, Winokur said she expects it could be easier to distribute around the world because of the temperature at which the vaccine is stored. While early data suggests Novavax can be stored at refrigerator temperature, the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at close to -100 degrees Fahrenheit to remain effective, and Moderna's must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas State and Washburn universities will begin the spring semester online as the coronavirus pandemic rages. The plan is for the first two weeks to be virtual at Kansas State, but it isn't clear when in-person learning will resume at Washburn. Dr. JuliAnn Mazachek, vice president of academic affairs at Washburn, said in a statement that the decision about classes will be reviewed weekly and that the university will return to face-to-face classes as soon as possible. Kansas State said in a statement that the goal was to mitigate continued spread of COVID-19. As we anticipate a surge in positive cases as people return to our campuses, this action will help us keep safety protocols in place, said Richard Myers, Kansas State's president.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House of Representatives will form a committee to consider a petition to impeach Gov. Andy Beshear over his COVID-19-related orders. Speaker of the House David Osborne, R-Prospect, said under law the House doesn't have a choice but to take action after receiving the petition, which includes multiple allegations that the governor violated both the state and U.S. constitutions in a series of executive orders responding to the pandemic. Osborne said Saturday that he hadn't read the petition yet and didn't know if the accusations were serious, but for someone to propose undoing an election of a state executive ... it's a very, very serious accusation. Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, said the action is silly and completely unjustified, and the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled every step the governor has taken is legal. The petition referenced steps the governor took after declaring a state of emergency in March, including ordering nonessential businesses to close to in-person traffic, instituting a travel ban, ordering churches to close to in-person services and expanding voting procedures to allow mail-in voting during the 2020 elections.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families are eligible for a 15% boost in their food stamp benefits through June, under a federal coronavirus aid package passed by Congress. The state said any increases due to people receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program started being transferred to benefit cards Friday. The latest federal coronavirus legislation didn't expand eligibility for food stamps. But The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that state officials said several key provisions will increase SNAP's reach. Shavana Howard, an assistant secretary for the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, said the program will no longer count federal extended unemployment benefits as income, which previously put SNAP out of reach for 44,165 applicants between March and July and ousted 2,185 households receiving benefits. Howard said many students who also did not qualify for food stamps because a portion of their parents' income was counted against them will qualify this time. Hunger has soared in Louisiana since the onset of the pandemic, and the problem worsened as the state was hit with storm after storm during a record 2020 hurricane season.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Legislature will consider a proposal that would require insurance companies to cover COVID-19 tests and immunizations and waive any co-payments related to them. Senate President Troy Jackson and Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau, who are both Democrats, unveiled the COVID-19 Patient Bill of Rights on Monday. The proposal will be the first bill of the new session of the Maine Legislature, Democratic leaders said. Lawmakers were sworn in last month. Jackson said the proposal is about making sure patients around the state maintain access to critical health care services during the pandemic. The COVID-19 Patient Bill of Rights brings us closer to the end of this crisis and the hold COVID-19 has had over our lives, he said. The proposal also includes provisions that ease requirements for telehealth visits. And it's designed to allow residents to get larger supplies of their prescriptions to reduce the number of visits to a pharmacy. The Maine Legislature Office of the Presiding Officers said the proposal is about making sure nothing prevents Mainers from getting the health care they need to protect themselves, their families and loved ones from this serious virus.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, lawmakers will gather for their annual legislative session this week to focus largely on helping the state recover from the pandemic and to take up policing reforms. Gov. Larry Hogan announced a $1 billion COVID-19 relief plan Monday that will require legislative approval. It includes tax relief and payments of up to $450 for individuals and $750 for families in need who have claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit. Hogan also is proposing ending local and state income taxes on unemployment benefits. The plan includes $300 million in tax relief to help Maryland restaurants and small businesses by allowing them to keep up to $12,000 of sales tax over the next four months. On Wednesday, senators will convene for the first day of the 90-day session behind transparent enclosures that have been built around their desks. In the House, a quorum of delegates will convene in the House chamber, while others will gather in a nearby office building and participate remotely. The Capitol will be closed to the public for the session, as delegates who are immune-compromised will sit socially distanced in the gallery where members of the public usually sit.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Thousands of police officers, firefighters and other first responders in the state were scheduled to get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccines Monday. About 60 sites have been set up around the state to vaccinate an estimated 45,000 people over several weeks, state officials said. The city of Worcester has turned its senior center into a mass vaccination site for first responders from the city as well as the surrounding communities of Shrewsbury, Millbury, Leicester, Holden, Grafton and West Boylston. To make sure there are enough qualified people to administer the vaccines, students in UMass Medical School's Graduate School of Nursing spent Saturday training more than 160 medical school students in intermuscular injection. With COVID, we haven't really been able to do that much recently, so having an opportunity like this is great for me to actually learn a skill, medical student Charles Feinberg said. It's also fun to be a part of ending this pandemic that has ravaged our country. The state so far has limited vaccinations to medical professionals and nursing home residents.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state is ready to buy 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses directly from the manufacturer, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Monday, in a move she says would help the state ramp up its vaccination efforts. It comes as county health departments and hospital systems say the unpredictable and inadequate supply of vaccines has kept them from getting shots into arms. The request coincides with the state drastically expanding eligibility for the vaccine against the disease caused by the coronavirus. Although all Michiganders 65 and older – along with teachers, police officers and many more first responders – are eligible to receive the vaccine, a litany of challenges at every level of government means it will likely be some time before people seeking an appointment are actually injected. Whitmer sent a letter to Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, asking for permission to buy the doses from Pfizer. Currently, federal health officials coordinate the delivery of doses to every state in the country.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Bars and restaurants were permitted to resume indoor service with capacity limits Monday as COVID-19 cases and deaths across the state continue to fall. The Minnesota Department of Health on Monday reported 980 new infections and four deaths, marking the second time since October that single-day cases dipped below 1,000 and the first time since early November that the state reported single-digit deaths. The state's totals now sit at 437,552 cases and 5,711 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Deaths and hospitalizations continue to decline, with the seven-day average of daily deaths dropping from 42.43 on Dec. 27 to 39.57 deaths per day Sunday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 numbered about 686 as of Sunday, including 141 in intensive care. Restrictions on bars and restaurants imposed by Gov. Tim Walz in the fall had generated sharp pushback, with some bars and restaurants defiantly reopening in recent weeks, risking fines and losses of their liquor licenses. The state has gone to court against several violators.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: The mayor says he won't seek reelection this year, citing demands the coronavirus pandemic has placed on his day job as a physician. Dr. Steve Demetropoulos made the announcement on his Facebook page, WLOX-TV reports. Thank you for all of your support and words of encouragement while I have been in office, Demetropoulos said in a posted video. I will continue to work hard on your behalf until my term ends. For decades, Demetropoulos has worked as a physician and emergency medical director at Singing River Health Services. He was elected mayor of Pascagoula last year in a special election to fill the unexpired term of Dane Maxwell, who left to take office a state public service commissioner.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson began a new term in office Monday with an inaugural ceremony marking the start of Missouri's bicentennial celebration but without a traditional party because of coronavirus precautions. The Republican governor was sworn in at a midday event on the grounds of the recently refurbished Capitol, with church bells ringing and artillery guns firing a salute – just as they have for past governors. He swore on a Bible given to him by his wife, and a B2 bomber flew low over the Capitol after Parson took the oath. He said he would work to provide the tools needed for doctors and nurses, law enforcement officers, farmers and teachers and said his job is to make life better for every Missourian. I will care for the unborn to the elderly, the rich to the poor, regardless of the color of your skin, he said. State officials hope that by August enough people will have been vaccinated against COVID-19 to safely hold a more elaborate celebration. It would coincide with the 200th anniversary of Missouri's official admittance to the United States on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: New data released by the Montana Food Bank Network shows more than 40% of respondents to a survey needed food assistance for the first time in their lives since the coronavirus pandemic began. While in 2019 only 1 in every 10 Montana residents needed food assistance from a pantry in the Montana Food Bank Network, in 2020, that figure could jump at least 29%, the Missoulian reports. The number of people receiving food assistance for the first time after the COVID crisis was pretty astounding, said Lorriane Burhop, the chief policy officer of the Montana Food Bank Network. The survey conducted from June to July garnered 917 responses across 30 counties in the state. The report said 70% of adults lost income or were furloughed as a result of the economic fallout from the pandemic. Burhop said that reveals how many people were making ends meet, but the loss of just one or two paychecks all of a sudden pushes those households into crisis, and they need to turn to a local food pantry for help.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state appears to have avoided a post-Christmas spike in coronavirus cases that many had feared, although it's not entirely clear why, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday. It may be because people followed virus safety guidelines warning against attending holiday gatherings, Ricketts said during a news conference. I think a lot of Nebraskans made modifications to their holiday get-togethers, he said. I'd also say there's also a lot of we don't know about this virus. The Republican governor said the decision not to impose a statewide lockdown may also have played a role because it helped avoid pandemic fatigue that leads some people to break the recommendations. Other states, such as California, have reported large increases in cases in December. We tried to strike a balance in Nebraska, Ricketts said. Nebraska has imposed restrictions on crowd sizes and public spaces but has never imposed a stay-at-home order or a statewide mask mandate. The state saw a sharp increase in virus hospitalizations in mid-November, raising concerns about bed space and burnout among hospital workers. The numbers have since declined, although public health officials say it's important for residents to continue following social distancing safety guidelines.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has surpassed 250,000 coronavirus cases as of Monday morning, according to recent data from the Nevada Health Response COVID dashboard. Nevada Health Response reported 1,866 new COVID-19 cases Monday. In December, the Department of Health and Human Services first reported more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases, a little over seven weeks after the diagnosis of its 100,000th case Oct. 30. There have also been a total of 3,500 COVID-19-related deaths as of Monday morning. The 14-day test positivity rate is at 21.1%, significantly higher than the World Health Organization's recommended 5% for economic reopening. Health officials are expecting to see the full impact of the New Year's Eve related exposure and testing in the coming days, said Julia Peek, deputy administrator of Community Health Service, in a press conference Monday morning.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state's failure to provide home health care services to qualifying elderly and disabled people puts them at risk of ending up in nursing homes that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a lawsuit filed against health officials Monday. The lawsuit was filed by New Hampshire Legal Assistance, Disability Rights Center-New Hampshire, AARP Foundation and the Nixon Peabody law office on behalf of four people enrolled in a Medicaid waiver program, called Choices for Independence, meant to help participants stay in their homes. When CFI participants are deprived of the community-based long-term care that the state concedes they need and are entitled to, they face grave health risks, AARP Foundation Senior Attorney M. Geron Gadd said in a statement. Failure to properly administer the CFI Waiver not only deprives participants of their right to live as they choose, but also greatly increases their chances of exposure to COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Pamela Phelan, litigation director for the disability rights group, said the plaintiffs are one crisis away from unnecessary institutionalization.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state opened its second mass testing site for administering the COVID-19 vaccine Monday. Gov. Phil Murphy and Senate President Steve Sweeney, both Democrats, toured the facility at Rowan College in Gloucester County. A similar site opened Friday at a mall in Rockaway, Morris County. The sites, which are designed to vaccinate more than 2,000 people a day, are open now just for health care workers, police and fire officials. More than 100,000 doses of the vaccine of the roughly 400,000 the state has received have been set aside for long-term care staff and residents. Murphy also said Monday that more than 200,000 people have been vaccinated in the state so far, double the number from a week ago. There are also 200 sites at pharmacies, hospitals and urgent cares across the state that are dispensing the vaccine as well, but Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the state has greater demand than supply of the shot. We're asking for your patience as we await a larger supply, she said. More than 1 million people have signed up for the vaccine on the state's preregistration site, she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Public Education Department is working with school districts and internet providers to expand broadband access in rural areas struggling with remote learning, according to lawyers for the state. In a response filed in court last week, the lawyers also said school funding hasn't been cut since the pandemic started. The filing comes after plaintiffs in a landmark education lawsuit argued that the state's attempts to provide internet access and learning devices were woefully insufficient. In a motion filed in December, the plaintiffs asked state District Judge Matthew Wilson to order the state to connect more children to online learning by immediately identifying students who lack laptops or tablets and providing internet vouchers for at-risk households. With in-person learning currently off limits, the inability to access remote classes has been a challenge for many rural and low-income students, particularly Native American children living on tribal lands. Court documents show the Public Education Department distributed about 6,200 laptops and 700 residential hot spots, all of which went to tribal communities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers are rushing to sign up for late-night COVID-19 vaccination slots as the city ramps up efforts to get people inoculated against the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. Midnight-to-4 a.m. appointments at the two 24-hour vaccination sites the city has set up so far were quickly snapped up, de Blasio said at his daily coronavirus briefing. So you can see New Yorkers are going to take advantage of this, the mayor said. The city that never sleeps, people are immediately grabbing those opportunities to get vaccinated. More sites are being set up around the city, with the goal of administering 1 million doses this month, he said. De Blasio said the city is speeding up vaccinations, with more than 160 sites now open. He said nearly 101,800 shots were administered last week – about as many as the total from mid-December, when the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use, through early January. State officials also announced new vaccination sites Monday, including one at the the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the Manhattan facility that was used as a field hospital last spring, and one at Jones Beach on Long Island.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Reports of sexual assaults against children in Asheville and Buncombe County rose sharply in 2020, and some experts attribute the increase to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a new state mandatory reporting law. The Buncombe County Sheriff's Office had 35 sexual assault reports involving minors in 2019, which jumped to 65 reports through mid-December of 2020, an 86% increase, said spokesman Aaron Sarver. The Asheville Police Department reported a 55% increase, with 29 cases of sexual assaults on a juvenile in 2019 and 45 through mid-December, said spokeswoman Christina Hallingse. The new law is resulting in more reports, and we are thankful to have it in place, Sheriff's Detective Sgt. Bryon Crisp said. But some experts fear the law has gone largely unnoticed, since it started gaining momentum just as COVID-19 hit and was mostly focused on the removal of the consent aspect of sexual assault. School personnel are our No. 1 reporters, and if not for COVID and school being out for parts of this year, the numbers would likely have been higher, Crisp said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state's COVID-19 update released Monday showed no deaths for a third straight day – a mark that hasn't been seen in nearly six months, although health officials noted that virus reports are typically sporadic over the weekend. The two previous days of no fatalities did not change the state's death toll ranking of sixth-highest per capita in the country at about about 178 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project. A total of 1,352 North Dakotans have died from complications due to the coronavirus. Health officials have confirmed 16 deaths this month, after 272 on December and 494 in November. I'm cautiously optimistic, state Health Department spokeswoman Nicole Peske said. Typically we do have a lag in reporting from over the weekend, so we'll see what tomorrow brings. The state reported 121 new positive cases since Sunday, for a total of 94,830 cases since the start of the pandemic. The tracking project ranks that 48th in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 454 people in North Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Another 7,892 coronavirus cases were confirmed Monday – more than the three-week average of 7,410 new cases reported per day, according to the Ohio Department of Health. An additional 75 COVID-19 deaths were reported. So far, the virus has killed 9,702 Ohioans, state data shows. The pandemic has hit older Ohioans particularly hard, with 93% of deaths occurring in people age 60 and older, according to the state. The seven-day average positive test rate remained at 14% Saturday, the most recent day for which data is available. As the vaccine rollout continues, 304,976 Ohioans have received at least their first of two doses, marking an increase of 8,367 over the previous 24 hours. About 2.6% of Ohio's 11.7 million residents have been vaccinated so far, according to the state. By Monday, 219 more Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19, less than the three-week average. There were 4,236 Ohioans hospitalized with the virus Monday, including 1,033 in intensive care units and 632 on ventilators, according to the health department.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Revenue collections for the calendar year 2020 declined by 3.8% as the pandemic swept the state, Treasurer Randy McDaniel said Friday. Oklahoma collected nearly $13.2 billion in taxes and fees for the year, $520.9 million less than the previous year. The state's economy declined in 2020, McDaniel said in a statement. Hopefully, we will see improvement in the months ahead as the (COVID-19) vaccine becomes widely available. December collections of $1.16 billion were 0.4% below December 2019, an improvement from the 2% decline in year-to-year numbers reported in November, the treasurer reported. Tax collections on hard-hit oil and gas production for the year fell the most, down $396.3 million, or 38.6%, to a total of $630.1 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two men are accused of converting for personal use more than $2.2 million in loans meant to help small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. Andrew Aaron Lloyd, 50, of Lebanon, and Russell A. Schort, 38, of Myrtle Creek, are charged with wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in federal court in Eugene, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The FBI investigated after receiving information that the men fraudulently obtained Paycheck Protection Program loans. Between April 7 and May 8, financial records showed both applied for and received at least three loan payments using three different entities, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. Lloyd is accused of transferring at least $1.8 million from the loans to a personal online brokerage account and buying securities, the complaint says. His investments increased in value over several months and became worth over $10 million at the time of their seizure, according to prosecutors.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will soon begin vaccinating people 75 years and older and essential workers like police officers, grocery store clerks and teachers, the state health secretary said Monday. Pennsylvania remains focused on giving the COVID-19 vaccine to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities – a group that numbers about 1 million – but is making plans to move to the next stage of its vaccination plan, Dr. Rachel Levine said at a media briefing. She was not more specific about the timing but said that second group, dubbed 1B, will be eligible to receive the vaccine before everyone in the first group has been inoculated. Phase 1B of the state's coronavirus vaccination plan includes people 75 and older as well as front-line essential workers, a huge and diverse group that includes clergy, first responders, prison guards, school staff, and food, manufacturing, postal, public transportation and grocery store workers. Some providers are already vaccinating people in the second group when they don't have someone in the first group readily available to receive it. Levine said that's OK. We don't want any vaccine wasted, she said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is paying more than three-quarters of a million dollars to help Rhode Island College deal with a $10 million deficit brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. New York-based Alvarez & Marsal was hired by the state Council on Postsecondary Education on Dec. 14 and will earn $76,000 a week until its contract expires Feb. 28, The Boston Globe reports. The need for this analysis stems from operational and financial challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated structural issues at the college, according to the contract. The school announced last summer that the deficit would lead to executive pay cuts, layoffs and a hiring freeze. Council Chairman Tim DelGiudice defended the contract, saying the board is concerned about the magnitude of the deficit at RIC, and the consultant is getting paid fairly. Democratic State Rep. William O'Brien called the contract absolutely ridiculous and said the Legislature struggled to find an extra $600,000 for the school in the last budget. The money should have been spent on student scholarships, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state will let people ages 70 and older schedule appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine starting Wednesday. Officials said Monday that they were confident the majority of people in the state's earliest phase who wanted to be vaccinated – health care workers and those living and working in long-term care facilities – had already received their shots or scheduled appointments. Because we've seen a dramatic acceleration in vaccine usage and appointments in the last week, we have decided to speed things up again, Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. We know that those 70 and older are at the greatest risk of dying from COVID-19. Making sure they have expedited access to the vaccine will help save lives. Officials estimate about 627,800 South Carolinians are 70 or older, and many have already received the vaccine because they were eligible earlier. Those who meet the age requirement are now eligible regardless of health status or preexisting conditions. Across the state, more than two-thirds of COVID-19 deaths have been among people ages 70 and older.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state is seeing coronavirus infections level off at a time many of its counterparts are experiencing their worst weekly death tolls yet. The South Dakota Department of Health announced 181 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday and 5,102 active cases. No new deaths were reported, with the total number of South Dakotans killed by the disease remaining at 1,585. Hospitalizations statewide increased by five to 242, with data showing just more than 41% of hospital beds and just fewer than 43% of adult intensive care unit beds available. And as many states are stumbling to enact vaccination plans, South Dakota came out of the gate hard, following the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization for two mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. At one point last week, more South Dakotans had received vaccinations as a percentage of the population than in any other state, according to tracking done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Monday, 45,667 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered to 38,360 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee is urging seniors who contract COVID-19 to ask their health care providers about certain drugs that could prevent them from getting so sick that they wind up in the hospital. Lee told reporters Friday that monoclonal antibodies are available and very effective, especially for people who are 65 or older and have underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to the virus. He said many people do not ask their health care providers about the treatment option. He said the drugs are effective when someone becomes sick but has not deteriorated enough to be hospitalized. State Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said the therapeutics are 85% to 95% effective at preventing progression to severe disease. We have not used our entire inventory, nowhere close to that, Piercey said. And so we really are trying to get the word out to seek treatment early once you test positive.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic has left a nearly $1 billion deficit in the state budget as the nation's energy capital remains hampered by a slow recovery and a half-million fewer jobs than a year ago. The forecast Monday by state officials is far brighter than bleaker projections last summer, when Republican Comptroller Glenn Hegar estimated the shortfall could be four times as worse. Still, the deficit could result in cuts to state services as the GOP-controlled Legislature returns to work Tuesday. Lawmakers are coming back to the Capitol at a moment when spread of the virus has never been worse in Texas. More than 13,000 patients with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in Texas is more than 23,000. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has kept some business restrictions in place but has ruled out more lockdowns. Hegar said the hospitality sector has been hardest-hit during the pandemic. He said a rebound in oil prices and production substantially improved the economic outlook in Texas from just a few months ago.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox presented his first budget proposal Monday, focusing on pandemic relief and further developing rural infrastructure. Cox, a Republican, stressed the importance of equity as he unveiled the proposed $21.7 billion budget from his administration's new rural affairs office at Southern Utah University in Cedar City. The proposal would allocate at least $250 million toward fighting the coronavirus pandemic and $125 million on rural infrastructure, including expanding broadband access and electric vehicle charging stations. It was critical that everyone in Utah felt like they were represented in this budget proposal, and certainly rural is a big piece of that, Cox told reporters during a virtual briefing. The budget also includes a boost in education funding for higher education and K-12 schools, as well as spending for rural schools. Cox said he also supports putting $112 million toward providing $1,500 bonuses for all teachers in the state, a measure that has already been endorsed by state lawmakers. The governor's proposal will be considered by the Legislature during its upcoming session, which starts next week.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: As officials work to gauge the impact of the recent holidays on the state's COVID-19 trends, residents are once again prohibited from having gatherings among multiple households. Gov. Phil Scott had loosened restrictions to allow Vermonters to gather with one trusted household between Dec. 23 and Jan. 2. While we're providing a narrow path to very small holiday gatherings, we'd rather you not do it at all, Scott said at the time. But we've improved our numbers in Vermont, all other prevention measures will remain in place, and we understand that mental health has to be considered alongside physical health. Vermont saw some higher coronavirus case numbers last week. On Jan. 6-7, new cases exceeded 200 each day. During the rest of the week, they did not drop below 100 a day, according to Health Department data. Before last week, cases for most days stayed below 100. The teams are not finding evidence that significant outbreaks have occurred related to the types of gatherings that were allowed for the holidays and far more evidence of isolated cases related to community prevalence, Levine said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers are set to start this year's legislative session focused on COVID-19 relief efforts and legalizing marijuana. The 2021 session will kick off Wednesday, with legislators meeting away from the Capitol as the state continues to wrestle with the impacts of a global pandemic that's shut down schools, closed businesses and left more than 5,000 Virginians dead in the past 10 months, including a state senator. The House of Delegates plans to meet remotely, while the Senate will meet at a large conference center near the Capitol. This will be the second regular legislative session controlled by Democrats since they won control of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation in 2019. Republicans, upset that the House is meeting remotely and that lawmakers held an extended special session last year, have signaled they will limit what's normally a 45-day session to only 30 days. Democrats can extend the the number of legislative working days by having Gov. Ralph Northam call a special session. State Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg said a top priority will be ensuring that schools have robust funding, including money for extra counselors, to help teachers deal with the fallout from the coronavirus once students return to the classroom.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: One person has died in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak at a hotel where more than 200 homeless are sheltered, according to King County officials. A post-mortem coronavirus test found that the person was positive, according to the King County Medical Examiner, the Seattle Times reports. There have only been four deaths of COVID-19 among people staying in shelters, according to a King County online dashboard. The Renton Red Lion experienced an outbreak of 35 cases last month among its homeless guests and housed staff, in the middle of a spike in cases at homeless shelters, housing facilities and day programs across the county. It's the most seen since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic at any of the hotels the county is using to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among homeless people. The Red Lion Hotel in Renton was opened by the county to keep them out of crowded bunk-bed or mats-on-the-ground shelters where officials feared COVID-19 could spread like wildfire.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new peak in confirmed coronavirus cases and a record 206 COVID-19-related deaths last week. Health workers also administered nearly 40,000 vaccine shots, doubling the pace of vaccinations. As the pandemic hits new deadly peaks, the state is now up to 92,070 vaccine doses administered. It closed the week leading the nation on number of doses per 100,000 residents. It next plans a big push to vaccinate teachers ahead of Gov. Jim Justice's goal to restart in-person education at as many schools as possible Jan. 19. A record 7,888 positive cases were reported last week, up 4% from the previous week. West Virginia has set weekly virus records in eight of the past 11 weeks. We're getting close to really making some real headway with this terrible killer, Justice said Monday. Urging residents to wear masks and get tested, he told them to just help yourself and help your loved ones. Meanwhile, Justice announced that high school basketball practices can start Feb. 15 for counties that have in-person classes. Games can begin on March 3, three months after the season originally was supposed to start.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Police and firefighters will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine starting Jan. 18, state health officials said Monday, while Gov. Tony Evers estimated that members of the general public won't be vaccinated until June. Evers renewed his call for faster distribution of the vaccine from the federal government Monday, and state Republicans introduced a new, scaled-back response bill and scheduled it for a vote Tuesday. While Evers laid blame at the federal government for slow distribution of the vaccine, Republicans amped up their criticism of the midterm Democrat for not acting urgently enough. U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, a Republican from Janesville, accused Evers of having a stunning lack of urgency in getting people the life-saving help they need. For now, Wisconsin is focused on vaccinating more than 500,000 health care workers and nursing home residents. As of Monday, 151,502 people had been vaccinated, the state said. Assisted living residents were to be vaccinated starting in two weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Campgrounds at Grand Teton National Park are expected to begin using an online reservation system later this month. Campgrounds on the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway will also begin taking reservations online beginning Jan. 26, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Campgrounds in the park near Jackson previously operated on a first-come, first-served basis, the National Park Service said in a statement. The change to an advanced reservation system is expected to make accessing the campgrounds and the park easier by allowing visitors to plan their camping experiences without worrying about securing campsites. The system is also expected to mitigate traffic congestion and eliminate long lines. Members of the public had requested a reservation system for the campgrounds, parks service Public Affairs Officer Denise Germann said. People would come before the break of dawn waiting for someone to leave or wait in line for hours, Germann said. Grand Teton National Park recorded more than 3 million recreational visitors in 2019, the park service website said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
The lyrics from a song by a Scottish folk-rock band that was popular several decades ago might seem like an unusual and absurdly specific cultural frame through which to view the tensions that have engulfed the United States and Iran in recent times.\n\nBut for Iraqis, as evidenced by their social media posts, protesters and statements and testimony from humanitarian aid groups, religious figures and political analysts, the 1973 Stealers Wheel song, Stuck in the Middle with You, makes a kind of perfect sense.\n\nEver since the Trump administration exited the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, reimposing sanctions and pursuing a maximum pressure policy on Tehran that has left the country economically and diplomatically isolated – culminating this week with an Iranian missile attack on two bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops after the Pentagon killed a top Iranian commander in a drone strike there – Iraq has been at the center of an intensifying tug of war between Tehran and Washington, according to Osamah Khalil, a historian of U.S. foreign relations and the Middle East at Syracuse University.\n\nIraq has become a battleground for American and Iranian influence, he said.\n\nAnalysis:Trump backs away from war with Iran but it's not over\n\nSome of this vying for clout is plain to see.\n\nAn American defense contractor was killed in a rocket attack on U.S. troops in late December in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. Washington blamed an Iranian-backed group for the assault.\n\nThe U.S. hit back with airstrikes along the Iraq-Syria border that killed 25 fighters from Kataeb Hezbollah, a non-state armed militia that is part of the Iraq-based Popular Mobilization Forces, supported by Iran.\n\nShortly afterward, angry crowds of pro-Iranian demonstrators stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, chanting Death to America. Washington said the siege was orchestrated by Iran's Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who the Pentagon subsequently killed in the drone strike near a Baghdad airport along with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces.\n\nFour members of Iraq's military were wounded Sunday in a rocket attack targeting an air base just north of Baghdad where American trainers were present until recently, Iraqi security officials said.\n\nPoll:Americans say Soleimani's killing made US less safe, Trump 'reckless' on Iran\n\n#Iran wants the #US out of #Iraq/The US wants Iran out of Iraq/How about we (Iraqis) leave, we might be bothering them, tweeted Hayder Al-Shakeri, summing up the exasperation that some Iraqis feel. According to his online and social media profiles, Al-Shakeri is from Baghdad and works in development, helping to coordinate regional cooperation programs across Arab states. He could not be reached for an interview.\n\nAnother twitter user, @mendlusi, shared a video by an Iraqi journalist that appeared to show an Iraqi man in Baghdad crying over the pain that Iraqis have suffered at the hands of the government, foreign governments and militias.\n\nOver the last few months, more than 400 Iraqis have been killed and almost 20,000 injured, according to the United Nations, in protests in Baghdad and cities across Iraq.\n\nAmong their demands: an end to widespread corruption that has precipitated a dysfunctional economy, rampant unemployment and ineffective governance.\n\nThey also want to see a halt to the outsize influence of Iraq's armed Shiite militia groups, such as the Popular Mobilization Forces, that are closely aligned with Iran. Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who has already resigned and is in a caretaker role, was due to meet with Soleimani on the day the Iranian commander was killed in the U.S. drone strike, according to Mahdi's own admissions to his country's parliament.\n\nAfter Soleimani's killing, Mahdi, a Shiite who has close ties to Iran, led and won a non-binding vote in Iraq's parliament that called for U.S. troops to be expelled from Iraq. On Friday, Mahdi asked U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to start formulating a plan for the U.S. withdrawal of troops. The Trump administration rebuffed the idea and warned Iraq it could lose access to its central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York if it expels American troops from the region, according to the a report.\n\nAmerica is a force for good in the Middle East, said Morgan Ortagus, spokesperson for the State Department. Our military presence in Iraq is to continue the fight against (the Islamic State terror group) and as the Secretary has said, we are committed to protecting Americans, Iraqis and our coalition partners, she said.\n\nStill, thousands of Iraqi rallied across the country Friday in anti-government protests where they also chanted criticisms of both the U.S. and Iran.\n\nIraq has been suffering from proxy wars for decades; they have torn our country apart, said Bashar Matti Warda, a Chaldean Catholic cleric and the current Archbishop of Erbil, in Kurdish Iraq. Chaldean Catholicism which originates in the Church of the East, is a form of Christianity that is found in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and other places in the region.\n\nSajad Jiyad, managing director of Al-Bayan Center, a Baghdad-based public policy think tank that focuses on issues related to Iraq and region, said that Iraq does not want to be in one camp or the other. Iran will always be our neighbor. But we recognize that the U.S. is a superpower.\n\nJiyad said that prior to the implementation of the Trump administration's maximum pressure Iran policy his country was not as caught in the middle between Tehran and Washington and that anti-Americanism has increased.\n\nOur politics has also taken on a strong anti-American voice, he added, referring to the vote in Iraq's parliament to try to push American forces out of the country.\n\nWhile the war in Iraq officially ended in 2011, when former President Barack Obama ordered the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops, 17 years after the U.S. invasion that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein, Iraq remains in a fragile state.\n\nAbout 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops have been redeployed to the country to combat the Islamic State terror organization, an extremist Sunni group that capitalized on the chaos unleashed in Iraq by the U.S. invasion and, later, the civil war in neighboring Syria.\n\nAcross the broader Middle East region, the U.S. has more than 62,00 troops deployed in various countries ranging from NATO member Turkey to the tiny Gulf state Bahrain.\n\nIraq and Iran share almost 900 miles of borders and Iraq is heavily dependent on Iran for its energy supply. The many armed militias in Iraq are often closer to Iran than to the Iraqi government – making it potentially perilous to alienate Tehran. A U.S. withdrawal could pave the way for a resurgence of the Islamic State group.\n\n'The world is watching': Trump tweets in support of Iran protests\n\nIt would be a gift to ISIS, Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, using an acronym for the terror organization.\n\nWashington's current with Iran crisis has put Iraq in the eye of the storm at the worst possible moment, said Abbas Kadhim, head of the Atlantic Council's Iraq initiative and a former Iraqi diplomat.\n\nThe current prime minister is on his way out of office, and the current government is operating with truncated authorities, Kadhim noted at a foreign policy forum in Washington on Thursday. The population is divided, and leaders are struggling to chart a path forward amid a political crisis.\n\nNow they're dealing with a cycle of confrontation between the U.S. and Iran that has left Iraq torn between two key allies, he said.\n\nAndres Gonzalez Rodriguez, the Iraq country director for Oxfam, the humanitarian group, said in an emailed statement that due to the recent uptick in Iran-U.S.-related frictions in Iraq we have had to suspend work in three locations where we were delivering cash aid to people in need of help. If we have to continue the suspension for a few weeks more, 100,000 of the most vulnerable people will be affected.\n\nRodriguez said Oxfam, whose aid reaches over a million people in Iraq, specializes in water and sanitation, emergency food, cash and gender programs and protection work.\n\nEarly on Wednesday local time, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles at bases in Iraq hosting American and other foreign troops, in what appears to have been a carefully calibrated response to the killing of Soleimani. No one was killed in the strikes.\n\nIran's strike:A loud warning shot and an offer to de-escalate, sources say\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Iran appears to be standing down and suggested the U.S. and Iran could work toward a new nuclear deal while cooperating against militants. Few foreign affairs experts see that as a likely outcome of the increased frictions.\n\nMore:Trump warns Iran but says US 'ready to embrace peace with all who seek it'\n\nJiyad, of the Al-Bayan Center, said that Iraq understands that the U.S. can be a helpful partner in the region in terms of fighting the Islamic State terror group, but we don't want to be part of a political game where we are either pro-Iran or pro-U.S. The most important thing for us is to keep good relations with all countries.\n\nStill, for Saeed Jamil al-Hadidiyah, 59, and his family, who live on a farm where they work as sheepherders near where one of the missiles that Iran fired on a base in Kurdish Iraq landed, such political arguments are meaningless.\n\nWe don't understand why Iran is attacking us. What did we do to them, he said Thursday as he showed USA TODAY the damage sustained to his house.\n\nThe missile landed about 1,600 feet from the home he shares with 14 other members of his extended family. The youngest is a 6-month-old baby. None were injured in the attack but the home sustained damage to the roof and some windows were shattered .\n\nWe know there's tensions between Iran and the U.S. but why are they shooting at us?\n\nContributing: Younes Mohammad in Erbil, Iraq
Lilly Ledbetter\n\nThe first bill President Obama signed into law his first year in office was, to my great pride, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. During his final year in office, it is my hope that we can witness a new spate of progress on equal pay for women.\n\nThe act that bears my name was a step forward for women, families, and the bedrock American values of fairness and equality. Yet on its seven-year anniversary, we still have a gender gap on wages. State legislators and advocates from around the country are launching a week of action to draw attention to that gap and how it can be closed.\n\nWhen I learned that I had been paid significantly less than my male counterparts at the Goodyear plant in Gadsen, Ala., I filed a federal civil rights lawsuit. Yet in its 2007 Ledbetter v. Goodyear ruling, the Supreme Court ruled against me because I filed my challenge long after the 180-day statute of limitations had ended. Because of the way the law was written, it didn't matter that I was unaware of the wage discrimination during that time window.\n\nTwo years later, my namesake law restored basic fairness and protections against pay discrimination by clarifying that the wronged employee has 180 days to challenge any paycheck that reflects unequal pay for equal work – not just the first one. This was a major win for women and, I hoped, a precursor of additional progress towards closing the wage gap.\n\nUnfortunately, women still make just 79 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, while African-American women make only 60 cents for every dollar white men make and Latina women make only 55 cents. Today, two of every three American women are the sole or equal breadwinners in their families. Yet the workplace and many public policies still haven't caught up with today's America. It's time that finally changed.\n\nTo root out pay discrimination, Congress should pass the long-overdue Paycheck Fairness Act, updating and strengthening our equal pay laws. In the meantime, however, state legislatures present some of the greatest opportunities to advance the cause of equal pay.\n\nThis week, lawmakers in more than 20 states are introducing and highlighting proposals that could help close the wage gap. While equal pay laws are on the books in 46 states and the District of Columbia, in almost every state there is more work to do to ensure that pay discrimination is relegated to the past.\n\nAmong the policy ideas under discussion at the state level are measures that would ensure women are paid as much as men when their job duties are largely the same; bolster salary transparency by, for instance, ending employer rules that prevent workers from sharing pay information with one another; prohibit employers from requiring a job candidate to provide salary history, as reliance on past salary can mean pay discrimination is carried forward from job to job; and require that employers list a salary range in job postings, so women can avoid selling themselves short in salary negotiations.\n\nStates are also exploring policies to strengthen enforcement and increase penalties when companies do discriminate. These policies would empower state labor commissioners and regulatory agencies to better enforce the equal pay laws on the books. Keeping the price of discrimination high is a powerful incentive for employers to prevent pay discrimination from happening in the first place.\n\nNone of these proposals standing alone will end the wage gap. But taken together, they provide a comprehensive approach that will produce meaningful advances toward ending pay discrimination. Achieving that long-awaited goal and closing the wage gap would be a win for women and an economic boon for the country as a whole, pumping nearly $450 billion into the American economy.\n\nDuring that bill signing ceremony on Jan. 29, 2009, Obama called the new law only the beginning and said that it's up to us to continue this work. It's time to live up to those hopeful words and take the next steps in our long march towards equal pay for equal work.\n\nLilly Ledbetter was the plaintiff in the discrimination case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and the name on the first bill President Obama signed into law.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

COLUMBUS, Ohio – For more than a year, Gov. Mike DeWine warned GOP Ohio lawmakers: Don't send me any gun bills until you deal with the plan I introduced after the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019.\n\nOn Monday he caved.\n\nHe signed into law a controversial stand your ground measure that the Republican-dominated legislature approved last month after declining to give the governor's proposals serious consideration.\n\n​I am very disappointed, however, that the legislature did not include in this bill the essential provisions that I proposed to make it harder for dangerous criminals to illegally possess and use guns, said DeWine, citing one element of his plan, in a news release about why he signed the measure.\n\nDeWine's proposal after Dayton shooting:Despite 'do something' cry, gun legislation still stalled\n\nDayton Mayor Nan Whaley also was disappointed — in DeWine, whose proposal she vocally supported even though she didn't think it went far enough.\n\nGov. DeWine came to our city and stood on stage for a vigil for our murdered friends and neighbors and then told us he stood with our community in our fight against gun violence. Now it seems he does not. Gov. DeWine has made clear he opposes this dangerous policy, but he once again folded to the extreme elements of his own party, she said in a statement on Twitter.\n\nThe NRA supported the decision.\n\nCrimes can happen quickly and without warning. Most victims have a split second to react with the best course of action for their survival. By signing SB 175, Gov. DeWine ensures the law favors victims and not criminals, said John Weber, state director for the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, in a statement.\n\nWhile DeWine never overtly threatened to veto gun bills, he made clear his priorities.\n\nIn a year-end interview, DeWine told The Dispatch in December 2019, I've kind of made a resolution that I am not going to get into other issues that are related to guns, and I don't think the legislature should, until we pass this (his plan).\n\nWe're focused every single day on passing STRONG Ohio, and that's what I am going to do. That's the commitment I made to the people of Dayton and the people of Ohio, DeWine said of the 4 shooting four months earlier that claimed nine lives in Dayton. I believe that next year we'll see the legislature pass our STRONG Ohio bill and there will be a ceremony where I am signing the bill into law.\n\nHe echoed those remarks in a 2020 year-end interview.\n\nI've made it very clear, I think, many times going back months that I felt that before the legislature took up other gun bills that they really should focus on what we have sent them, where we know there are things that will absolutely save lives, protect children, protect families, DeWine said shortly before Christmas.\n\nBut Monday he said, I have always believed that it is vital that law-abiding citizens have the right to legally protect themselves when confronted with a life-threatening situation. While campaigning for governor, I expressed my support for removing the ambiguity in Ohio's self-defense law, and Senate Bill 175 accomplishes this goal. That is why I have signed this bill today.\n\nThe governor had until midnight to sign SB 175, veto it, or let the law changes take effect without adding his signature. With his signature, the law changes will take effect in 90 days.\n\nAs originally introduced, SB 175 granted civil immunity to churches, synagogues, mosques and other nonprofit when defensive shootings occur on their premises.\n\nThe initial bill passed the Ohio Senate a year ago on a unanimous vote. But the Ohio House added language expanding the locations where residents have no duty to attempt to retreat before using a firearm in self defense.\n\nIf a person is in danger of grievous bodily harm or worried about his or her life to the point where they need to use a firearm to defend themselves, very clearly this removes the duty to retreat, just as if you were in your home or in your car, Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, said during the floor debate on the legislation.\n\nThe final bill passed on split votes, with many Republicans supporting and Democrats and a handful of Republicans in opposition. During the final floor debate, Sen. Hearcel Craig, D-Columbus, said the bill would inevitably lead to more deadly confrontations and sometimes-violent deaths.\n\nLegislative action:Ohio Senate sends 'Stand your ground' gun law to Gov. Mike DeWine\n\nThe governor rolled out a comprehensive package of gun reforms in the days following a mass shooting in Dayton, when a gunman killed nine people and injured more than two dozen others.\n\nThe legislature declined to vote on any of those changes, even after repeated calls to address gun violence from DeWine during regular coronavirus briefings.\n\nDeWine urged incoming lawmakers, who were taking their oaths of office Monday, to act on other gun law changes, including expanded information and alerts in background checks for firearm purchases and increased penalties for the illegal possession, purchase and sale of guns.\n\nEveryone who cares about these issues knows that the provisions I am requesting in no way infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens to own firearms, DeWine said in his statement after signing SB 175. They know what I am asking for is to make it harder for guns to get into the hands of criminals. These provisions will save lives. These provisions need to become law.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation with the General Assembly, I have signed Senate Bill 175. I look forward to working with members of the legislature in the future to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and to protect the rights of citizens who follow the law.\n\nColumbus gun rule debate:Divided Ohio Supreme Court kicks out groups' suit on 'bump stocks'\n\nDemocrats had urged DeWine to veto the controversial measure. They and gun control advocates sharply criticized the governor.\n\nContributing: Anna Staver\n\nFollow Marc Kovac on Twitter: @OhioCapitalBlog
AP\n\nSYDNEY (AP) — The big question in the A-League is one that Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold doesn't want to discuss much: the prospect of an unbeaten season.\n\nSydney won its 14th game along with five draws in 19 matches to remain the class of the A-League this season. It stretched its first-place lead to 12 points over the Melbourne Victory with a 3-1 win Thursday over the Wellington Phoenix.\n\nI haven't really wanted us to talk about being invincible ... going undefeated, Arnold said. But the boys are so motivated to win every game. They don't get carried away with themselves, and they fight hard for each other.\n\nThere are eight regular-season rounds left in the season.\n\nSydney got off to a quick start on Thursday, going ahead on Rhyan Grant's goal in the third minute. Bobo made is 2-0 before Alex Rodriguez scored Wellington's only goal in the 31st.\n\nMilos Ninkovic scored the only goal of the second half in the 54th minute before a Sydney Football Stadium crowd of just 8,380. The field was in poor condition after last weekend's Sydney Sevens rugby tournament.\n\nSydney has scored a league-high 41 goals this season.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Football Federation Australia said a late Saturday afternoon match scheduled at Newcastle, north of Sydney, between the Jets and Melbourne Victory would be postponed until Monday evening at the same stadium because of warm weather.\n\nIt said New South Wales state was expected to experience extreme heat-wave conditions on the weekend and that the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, which considers temperature, humidity, wind speed and the angle of the sun, would be 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit) at match time.\n\nThe FFA Heat Policy states that matches should be postponed if the WBGT exceeds 28 degrees C (82 degrees F).
Associated Press\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts played catch-up all season.\n\nNow they'll be doing it for a few more months.\n\nAfter going 8-8, sliding down another peg in the AFC South and missing the postseason in consecutive years for the first time in almost two decades, the Colts must figure out what went wrong, how to fix it and how they can get back to the playoffs.\n\nThe transformation will start with an attitude adjustment.\n\nI think we just have to hold ourselves to an extremely high standard, and we have to every day devote ourselves to hitting that goal, said kicker Adam Vinatieri, who owns four Super Bowl rings. It's easy to get complacent if you're not striving to get better every single day.\n\nBut the Colts have been regressing.\n\nAfter starting his coaching tenure with three straight 11-5 records and three straight playoff appearances, Chuck Pagano has gone 8-8 each of the last two seasons. Indy was eliminated from playoff contention on the final day of the 2015 season and with one game left in 2016.\n\nNo one in this locker room ever accepts losing as the norm or as OK, quarterback Andrew Luck said. That's absolutely not the fact here, nor will it ever be with the Irsay family running this organization. I know that for a fact.\n\nSo what needs to change?\n\nThe immediate focus in Indy has been on the fates of Pagano, who was scheduled to meet with team owner Jim Irsay on Monday, and general manager Ryan Grigson. Antsy fans are clamoring for either or both to be fired.\n\nPagano and Grigson are under contract through the 2019 season and there has been no word, so far, from Irsay.\n\nClearly, things have not worked out the way Irsay envisioned.\n\nPagano was hired to fix the defense, which has been ranked 20th or lower four times in five years, including 30th this season.\n\nAnd with Luck relatively healthy in 2016, many figured Indy would recapture the division crown. Instead, the Colts lost their first two games, never got above .500 and blew a chance to take control of the AFC South race with a second straight December loss at home to Houston.\n\nI take full responsibility for all of this stuff, Pagano said. I think we've got to be better. Have to be better.\n\nAnd with about $60 million expected to be available in free agency, they need to spend wisely.\n\nHere are some things to watch during the offseason:\n\nHELPING LUCK: Luck had a career-high completion percentage (63.5 percent) and only threw one more interception (13) in 15 starts than he did in seven games in 2015. He had the league champion in yards receiving (T.Y. Hilton) and finally worked with a 1,000-yard rusher (Frank Gore). Yet the Colts still needed a season-ending win just to avoid a losing season. Obviously, the Colts need to spend the bulk of their money — and draft picks — on defense. But they also need to put more pieces around Luck.\n\nNEED FOR SPEED: Four outside linebackers could become unrestricted free agents — Erik Walden, Trent Cole, Akeem Ayers and Chris Carter — and 35-year-old Robert Mathis is retiring. Walden led the team with 11 sacks and at age 31 could be too expensive to re-sign. Mathis was second with five. The rest of the team had 17. So finding a young, dominant pass rusher must be a top priority.\n\nLINE DANCE: While the Colts allowed 44 sacks this season, there were promising signs from their young offensive line in November and December. Center Ryan Kelly looks like a long-term anchor and two other rookies, swingman Joe Haeg and tackle Le'Raven Clark, played well when given a chance. Indy still needs to see more consistency and more growth, but the Colts should feel better about this group heading into the offseason than they did a year ago.\n\nCOST CUTTING: Indy needs to get younger on defense and could save some cash in the process. By releasing three players — 33-year-old linebacker D'Qwell Jackson, 30-year-old defensive tackle Art Jones and 29-year-old cornerback Patrick Robinson — the Colts could save roughly $13.2 million. Jones and Robinson battled injuries all season and have not lived up to the billing. Jackson was suspended for the final four games for violating the league's performance-enhancing substance policy.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL .
Wall Street measures success in portfolio profits, and by that quantitative measure President Trump gets high marks from investors for his first year in office.\n\nThe numbers tell a positive story.\n\nStocks have risen sharply since Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017. The U.S. stock market, according to Wilshire, has posted a paper gain of $5.9 trillion. The Dow Jones industrial average has rallied 31.5%, the third-best gain in a president's first year in office and well above the 12.5% average since 1900, Bespoke Investment Group says. And 401(k) investors have seen a $10,000 investment in the Dow grow to roughly $13,150.\n\nRegardless of anyone's political opinion of Trump, you can't argue with results, says Tom Essaye, a trader and founder of The Sevens Report, a Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., newsletter that delivers key market intelligence at 7 a.m. before trading begins.\n\nTrump's style may turn off some, but his pro-business policies have boosted his following on Wall Street.\n\nWhen I look at my 401(k) how can I not give Trump an A+ grade, says Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. Forget personalities, look at the results.\n\nMore:Dow jumps 323 points, closes above 26,000 for first time in its 121-year history\n\nMore:Why January matters to stock investors with 401(k) accounts\n\nMore:Why January matters to stock investors with 401(k) accounts\n\nThe presidents with better gains than Trump in their first year in office were Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was in charge when the Dow rallied 96.1% in the one-year period beginning on March 4, 1933, when the market was rebounding from the Great Depression; and Barack Obama, who saw the Dow rally 33.4% in the year after he took office on Jan. 20, 2009, when stocks first began to recover from the meltdown caused by the 2008 financial crisis, Bespoke data show.\n\nTrump, of course, can't take all the credit for the stock market's good fortune. He entered office with equities already eight years into the second-longest bull market in history. His move into the Oval Office also came at a time when economies in most of the world were growing at the same time for the first time in a decade, a phenomenon referred to as synchronized global growth, says Bill Hornbarger, chief investment officer at Moneta Group, a money management firm in Clayton, Missouri.\n\nStill, Hornbarger and other Wall Street pros say the so-called Trump Effect on markets has been real, and that the president deserves recognition for unleashing so-called animal spirits, a term used to describe investors and CEOs willingness to take risks and make moves to grow their wealth and businesses.\n\nTrump's biggest market-moving move so far has been a major overhaul of the nation's tax code. The tax cut has kicked the market into a higher gear, says Paul Hickey, a co-founder at Bespoke Investment Group. In December he signed off on a major corporate tax cut that investors say was long needed to boost the competitiveness and profitability of U.S. companies and speed up the pace of economic growth. The president has also cut back on regulations and so-called red tape, which he says were hampering businesses.\n\nSo what exactly is the Trump Effect and what makes the nation's 45th president so friendly to markets?\n\nBUSINESS 'CHEERLEADER IN CHIEF'\n\nBusiness has found a friend in Trump, someone willing to reduce many of the obstacles that held back their growth.\n\nTrump helped inject confidence into the business community, Essaye says. He has taken on the role of business cheerleader-in-chief.\n\nCEO confidence in business conditions in the next six months is at a six-year high, according to a quarterly outlook released in December by The Business Roundtable.\n\nPRO-BUSINESS APPROACH\n\nThe adversarial relationship between Washington and business that developed after the financial crisis has given way to a pro-business approach, says Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments and a veteran Wall Street policy analyst.\n\nThe president has switched the dial on Capitol Hill from an anti-business attitude to a business-friendly one. Trump has ushered in a new climate, says Valliere, who dubs the new Trump mantra: Anti-regulation. Pro-stimulus.\n\nMARKET MOOD SHIFTER\n\nTrump has brightened the mood of investors, consumers and business leaders with his continual emphasis on getting the economy moving again and helping American workers get ahead, says Bittles.\n\nHis largest influence, says Bittles, has been psychological.\n\nTrump has brought back confidence, Bittles adds, and that is what is needed for businesses to invest and consumers to spend. American companies are on the move and becoming very aggressive, he says, because the economy has finally moved out of first gear under Trump.\n\nApple, he points out, just announced giant expansion plans, and Walmart, the nation's biggest employer, is giving its workers raises and bonuses.\n\nConsumer confidence is at its highest level in 17 years. CEOs are optimistic about the future. And workers are benefiting from the corporate tax windfall as a growing number of employers pay out one-time bonuses, boost wages and expand their businesses in the U.S.\n\nThere has been an atmospheric change, says Tom Block, a Washington policy analyst at New York-based investment research firm FundStrat Global Advisors.\n\nSo can Trump's positive impact on markets continue?\n\nOne risk is if Democrats gain control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate in the mid-term elections later this year, ending Republicans' stranglehold on power in Congress, says Fundstrat's Block.\n\nAnother potential negative for investors, says Valliere, is Trump's protectionist trade views, which has generated concerns about a potential trade war with China and a potential U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, the nation's current trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.\n\nRight now, though — for the market — the policy positives outweigh any negatives.\n\nIf Trump's policies help boost GDP growth, corporate earnings and the lives of workers as predicted, then yes markets can continue to thrive, says Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington, D.C. firm that specializes in the investment implications of government actions.\n\nIs the rally sustainable? We'd say yes, Gabriel says.
UFC fighters who use marijuana now can rest a little more easily under the new change to the promotion's anti-doping policy.\n\nAthletes who test positive for carboxy-THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, will no longer be punished by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency under the UFC's anti-doping policy, it was announced Thursday.\n\nPositive tests for carboxy-THC, regardless of levels, will not be considered violations to the policy unless additional evidence exists that an athlete used it intentionally for performance-enhancing purposes.\n\nAlthough the change in policy does not directly affect regulations by state athletic commissions, it's an improvement in the reduction of potential regulatory consequences fighters may face for the use of marijuana.\n\nThat's a huge relief to UFC fighters, some of whom took to Twitter to share their reactions.\n\nYou can check those out below:
Jessica Feierman and Jenny Lutz\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nAt age 15, Eddie Ellis was sent to a juvenile detention center and held in solitary confinement. According to Ellis, The average day was a miserable day. I tried to work out. I tried to exercise. I always felt sad. I just wanted to lie down and be to myself. ... It was one of the breaking points for me as a young person.\n\nTwo laws passed by Congress last year — the First Step Act and the reauthorized Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act — will help ensure that no other young people go through the agony Ellis experienced. But the strict prohibition on solitary only applies to youth in federal custody. To fully solve the problem, states must follow suit and pass laws to end solitary confinement of youth.\n\nEllis, now 43, is the coordinator of the Incarcerated Children's Advocacy Network at the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth. He has spent years as a mentor and motivational speaker talking with youth and adults about how their choices affect others and how to rebuild and repair relationships.\n\nHis path to success wasn't easy.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nCOLUMN:The death penalty goes against the teachings of Jesus\n\nCOMMUNITY CALLS:As Fla.'s former inmates regain voting rights, lessons of forgiveness must resonate\n\nNEWSLETTER:Pelosi, BLM and more of our fresh takes on policing this week.Sign up today.\n\nThe judge ultimately dismissed the charge of armed robbery against Ellis, but his detention had a devastating impact. When he left the juvenile facility, Ellis said, the depression became tenfold. I really didn't have any energy to think about doing right. I just didn't care. … I wanted to rail against the system.\n\nIt took a long time for Ellis to get his life back on track. He eventually returned to prison on a manslaughter charge. He experienced years of anger, depression and anxiety.\n\nEllis is not alone.\n\nResearch shows that solitary confinement can cause rage and frustration, leading youth who experience it to act out. And thousands of juveniles are subjected to solitary confinement every year. Almost half of all secure juvenile facilities in America use isolation to control behavior.\n\nA child in solitary confinement spends hours, days, weeks or even months isolated in a cell. A typical solitary cell is smaller than a parking space and contains nothing but a bed, a sink and a toilet. Children in solitary don't attend school; they often don't receive counseling, family contact or treatment.\n\nNot surprisingly, these conditions are profoundly destructive, leading a significant number of young people to cut themselves, engage in other forms of self-harm, or take their own lives.\n\nIn addition to depression and anxiety, solitary can also cause sleeplessness and long lasting trauma. Isolation is harmful for anyone, but particularly for adolescents whose ongoing development depends on social interaction. And it doesn't work. In fact, decreased reliance on solitary is linked to increased facility safety.\n\nPOLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media\n\nYouth have been placed in solitary for actions as insignificant as talking back, moving too fast, or taking candy off a shelf. Others have spent months in solitary because they are at risk of self-harm, even though solitary exacerbates mental health problems and suicidality. Many youth held in adult jails are placed in solitary to keep them separate from adult inmates for their own safety.\n\nIn keeping with the recommendations of justice, mental health and medical experts, the First Step act prohibits federal facilities from using solitary as punishment and permits solitary only when youth behavior poses a risk of immediate physical harm that cannot otherwise be de-escalated. Youth must be released as soon as they are calm and always within three hours.\n\nThe Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act incentivizes states to implement similar reforms. The act requires states to collect and report data to the federal government on restraints and isolation, shedding light on what is too often a hidden problem. It also requires states to describe their strategies to reduce isolation, and provides federal training to support these goals.\n\nCritically, the juvenile justice act prohibits states from holding youth in adult jails, except in narrow circumstances. This will make a huge dent in the use of solitary confinement.\n\nSome jails hold 100 percent of youth in solitary to protect them from adult inmates, according to Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe time is right to stop solitary for kids.\n\nEllis was able to get beyond his childhood experiences. He has been out of prison for 12 years and is now married with children.\n\nBut he cautions that isolating youth risks permanent damage: You may be really destroying these kids emotionally and mentally before they have a chance to mature as people. Some of these kids may not be able to recover.\n\nRather than isolating young people, we should create opportunities for them to learn positive skills and maintain the critical relationships that they need to grow and thrive.\n\nThe new federal laws, with broad bipartisan support, are models for state lawmakers. Some states have already acted to end solitary for juveniles. The rest must follow.\n\nJessica Feierman is the senior managing director for the Juvenile Law Center. Jenny Lutz is the director of Stop Solitary for Kids Campaign at the Center for Children's Law and Policy.
In a sign of Iraq's mounting anger over a U.S. drone attack that killed Iran's top general, Qasem Soleimani, as well as an Iraqi leader of Tehran-backed militias, Iraq's Parliament on Sunday voted to expel U.S. military forces from the country.\n\nThe development came as Iran said it was all but abandoning the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that the Trump administration exited in May 2018. Since the U.S. withdrawal from the accord, tensions with Iran have steadily increased.\n\nIraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi told lawmakers that a timetable for the withdrawal of all foreign troops, including U.S. ones, was required for the sake of our national sovereignty. About 5,000 American troops are in various parts of Iraq.\n\nMahdi described the strike authorized by President Donald Trump as a political assassination and said it was time for American troops to leave.\n\nIran official on Soleimani killing:'The response for a military action is military action'\n\nThe resolution was supported by a majority of about 180 lawmakers present in Parliament, according to Iraqi media. It was backed by most Shiite members of parliament, who hold a majority of seats. Many Sunni and Kurdish legislators did not show up for the session, likely because they oppose the initiative.\n\nTensions rising\n\nThe vote came two days after Soleimani was killed inside Iraq, dramatically ratcheting up tensions between Washington, and Tehran and Baghdad. It was not immediately clear to what extent the resolution would be implemented. It is nonbinding. The resolution specifically calls for ending an agreement in which Washington sent troops to Iraq more than four years ago to help in the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nAhead of the vote, U.S.-led coalition forces battling the remnants of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria announced a pause in operations precipitated by the need to protect U.S. and coalition troops on bases in Iraq. Iran's leadership has vowed revenge for Soleimani's killing and signaled it may target U.S. military personnel in the region.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened severe revenge.\n\nIran moving away from nuclear accord\n\nIran said Sunday it is ceasing to abide by all operational restrictions on its enrichment of uranium, part of the terms of the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.\n\nThe move marks the fifth and final time Iran has moved away from the accord, and effectively marks the end of the deal for Tehran, although it said it would return to full compliance with the accord if the U.S. lifts its sanctions against it.\n\nHeightened tensions:Trump defends Soleimani killing in formal notice to Congress\n\nThe U.S. action against Soleimani, Iran's de facto second most powerful figure who oversaw a vast network of pro-Iran militant groups from Iraq to Yemen, has drawn strong criticism from key U.S. allies and foreign policy experts, who believe it will destabilize an already tense and volatile region struggling to overcome decades of sectarianism, political strife, corruption and economic mismanagement.\n\nTrump's move has created a more dangerous world, Amelie de Montchalin, France's deputy minister for foreign affairs, told French radio over the weekend.\n\nWhite House goes on media offensive\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted that if Iran attacks any American assets to avenge Soleimani, the U.S. has identified 52 targets across the Islamic Republic that WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. Some are important to Iran & Iranian culture, Trump wrote on Twitter, apparently drawing Iran's rich cultural sites into the tensions.\n\nHackers set sights on the US:DHS website hacked with pro-Iranian messages, image of bloodied Trump\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the strike against Soleimani, during an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. He said Washington would have been culpably negligent if it didn't launch the attack and that he was 100% certain America was safer because of the strike. He also said the Trump administration is prepared for an Iranian response. It may be that there's a little noise here in the interim, that the Iranians make a choice to respond, he said. I hope that they don't.\n\nU.S. vs. Iran:Anti-war protesters organize around US following killing of Iran general\n\nAsked about the Iraqi Parliament's vote on Fox News Sunday, the U.S.'s top diplomat said that we are confident the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the anti-terror campaign. And we'll continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe. Pompeo added: We'll have to take a look at what we do when the Iraqi leadership and government makes a decision, but the American people should know we'll make the right decision. We will take actions that frankly the previous administration refused to take to do just that.\n\nIran mourns Soleimani\n\nSoleimani's body was returned to Iran early Sunday for a funeral and burial in his hometown, Kerman, in central Iran. Hundreds of thousands of mourners took to the streets across the nation to pay their respects to a figure who is widely hailed as a war hero in Iran, but who the Trump administration labeled a terrorist.\n\nSoleimani presided over Iran's foreign military and intelligence operations going back two decades. During this time, the State Department says he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans and for numerous attacks on U.S. military installations.\n\nContributing: William Cummings and Courtney Subramanian
ABU DHABI – The UFC's anti-doping policy will no longer punish athletes for positive tests for carboxy-THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.\n\nUFC and U.S. Anti-Doping Agency officials on Thursday announced significant modifications in the handling of cannabis and its naturally occurring cannabinoid compounds.\n\nIn short, positive tests for carboxy-THC, regardless of levels, will no longer be considered violations to the policy unless additional evidence exists that an athlete used it intentionally for performance-enhancing purposes.\n\nWhile we want to continue to prevent athletes from competing under the influence of marijuana, we have learned that blood and/or urine levels of carboxy-THC have little-to-no scientific correlation to impairment, UFC senior vice president of athlete health and performance Jeff Novitzky said in a statement. THC is fat soluble, meaning that once ingested, it is stored in fatty tissues and organs in the body and can be released back into the blood or urine, sometimes long after ingestion.\n\nNovitzky said athletes will still not be allowed to compete under the influence of marijuana, but that the UFC and USADA will rely on visual evidence of impairment and cognitive behavioral tests to make such determinations rather that any sort of blood level detection, which can often indicate usage well outside of the competition window.\n\nThe bottom line is that in regards to marijuana, we care about what an athlete consumed the day of a fight, not days or weeks before a fight, which has often been the case in our historic positive THC cases, Novitzky said.\n\nNovitzky said he believes the change in policy is simply the latest by the promotion to maintain anti-doping guidelines that are thorough but maintain a sense of fairness for the athletes who must abide by the policy, which was first instituted in 2015.\n\nBased on my informal discussion with athletes, there's a significant number of percentage of athletes that choose to use marijuana, many for legitimate reasons outside of recreational, Novitzky said. Many use it for pain control, anti-anxiety, to sleep, in lieu of more dangerous, more addictive drugs, so hopefully this being the first step to opening that up so that an athlete on Wednesday night of fight week instead of going to a Vicodin because their knee hurts and they can't sleep can use a little bit of cannabis and get to sleep and have that pain control. It has no affect whatsoever on a competition on Saturday night, so it's the right move, and I'm really excited about this revision and that specific policy change.\n\nIt is important to note that the change in USADA policy does not directly affect regulations by state athletic commissions, so athletes do not have carte blanche with marijuana use following the announcement. However, Novitzky is hopeful that the change to UFC policy can ultimately pave the way for similar moves at the state level.\n\nI would caution everybody to temper their enthusiasm about this because we still have the commission factor here, but we are actively working on that, Novitzky told MMA Junkie. We are educating, informing, lobbying them, and I hope not too far in the near future that we can get uniformity across all the rules as it relates to marijuana because I think it would certainly be a benefit to the athletes.\n\nAdditional changes to the UFC's anti-doping Policy announced include the removal of phyto cannabinoids often found in various CBD products, as well as the addition of Informed Choice as an approved dietary supplement certifier for UFC athletes.
Thomas Maresca\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nSEOUL — When North and South Korea meet Tuesday for the first time in two years, both sides hope the talks will lead to improved relations beyond next month's Winter Olympics near here.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. and South Korean leaders vowed that the dialogue won't weaken their hard stance against the North's burgeoning nuclear and missile programs.\n\nThe will to enhance North-South relations must be backed up not by words, but by practical actions to foster inter-Korean reconciliation and unity, and reunification, the North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in an editorial Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe two Koreas will meet in the border village of Panmunjom, located in the Demilitarized Zone that has divided the Korean Peninsula since a war ended in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty.\n\nNorth Korea alerted the South over the weekend that it will send its veteran negotiator on inter-Korean relations, Ri Son Gwon, to lead its five-person delegation to the meeting. Ri has represented Pyongyang for cross-border military talks since 2006.\n\n\n\nThe meeting will discuss the North's potential participation in the Winter Olympics being held Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as well as ways to ease the tensions after several months of provocative missile launches by the North and the isolated country's sixth nuclear test in September.\n\n\n\nBoth sides appear to hope that the Olympics can be a platform for improving relations between the neighbors.\n\nMore:Kim Jong Un's purported birthday is no holiday in North Korea\n\nMore:China clamps down on North Korea trade as part of U.N. sanctions\n\nNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said in a New Year's Day address that the Olympics would be a good occasion to show the greatness of the Korean people and suggested that Pyongyang was willing to send a delegation to the Games.\n\n\n\nChang Ung, North Korea's representative to the International Olympic Committee, told reporters at Beijing's international airport on Saturday that his country is likely to participate in the Winter Games, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.\n\nNorth Korea would likely send figure skating pair Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik to the Games. They captured a bronze medal last February at the Asian Winter Games in Japan.\n\n\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae In has repeatedly said he wants the Pyeongchang Olympics to be a means for re-engagement and conflict resolution with the North.\n\n\n\nI will strive to make the Pyeongchang Olympics the 'Peace Olympics' and furthermore to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue so that this can be a year when peace is cultivated on the Korean Peninsula, Moon said Friday.\n\n\n\nMoon also said he wouldn't take a soft stance with the North and vowed to strengthen South Korea's military. I won't be weak-kneed or just focus on dialogue, as we did in the past, Moon said.\n\nThe remarks were seen as way to placate conservatives in South Korea, who are skeptical of talks with the North.\n\nCritics in South Korea have expressed concern that the North will use the Olympics as a way to skirt international sanctions and try to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.\n\nThe United States agreed to South Korea's request to delay joint military exercises during the Winter Games last week during a phone call between President Trump and Moon.\n\nThe two leaders agreed to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against North Korea and to not repeat mistakes of the past, the White House said.\n\nTrump said over the weekend that he supported North Korean participation in the Olympics and hoped the talks would extend further.\n\nI would love to see them take it beyond the Olympics, he said. And at the appropriate time, we'll get involved, Trump added, while at the Camp David presidential retreat Saturday.\n\nTrump said he would be willing to speak directly with Kim, but doubled down on his tough talk against North Korea's communist leader.\n\nHe knows I'm not messing around, not even a little bit, Trump said.\n\nNikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Trump's comments didn't indicate a change in policy. There is no turnaround, she said Sunday on ABC's This Week.\n\nWhat he has basically said is, 'yes, there could be a time where we talk to North Korea, but a lot of things have to happen before that actually takes place. They have to stop testing. They have to be willing to talk about banning their nuclear weapons.' ... What we're trying to do is make sure we don't repeat what's happened the last 25 years, she said.\n\nTuesday's agenda in sorting out matters related to the Olympics includes whether the North's delegation would travel to the Games by land and whether the two Koreas will march under a unified Korean flag during the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nAlso at stake are the costs of accommodations and other expenses. The International Olympic Committee has said it is willing to cover North Korea's costs if Pyongyang takes part in the Games, but some have questioned whether that would violate United Nations sanctions imposed on the North for its missile and nuclear tests.\n\nSouth Korea's unification minister, Cho Myoung Gyon, hoped the discussion of the Olympics paves the way for better ties.\n\nIt is good that the resumption of inter-Korean talks could set the tone for an improvement in ties between the two Koreas, and better relations could become a small catalyst for helping resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, he told reporters Friday.
Bob Goodlatte\n\nRecent news stories have shined a spotlight on presidential power grabs.The Supreme Court has decided to hear a case challenging President Obama's unilateral rewrite of our nation's immigration laws. And a federal judge recently declared that Obama cannot assert executive privilege to prevent Congress from reviewing documents pertaining to Operation Fast and Furious, which allowed firearms to walk across the U.S.-Mexico border into the hands of criminals.\n\nPresidents going beyond their constitutional authority is nothing new, and it's imperative that Congress fix this to restore our system of government. This week, the House Judiciary Committee will vote to launch a task force to examine the historic increase in presidential power and executive overreach, which is distorting the system of checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution is clear: It is the role of Congress to make laws, the judiciary to interpret the laws, and the president to enforce the laws. This system was wisely set in place by the founders well over 200 years ago because they knew firsthand that the concentration of power was a threat to individual liberty and the rule of law. As James Madison eloquently wrote in Federalist No. 47: The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\n\nIn recent decades, however, presidents of both parties have aggrandized their power and usurped Congress to legislate from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. For example, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush abused their prosecutorial discretion authority to provide executive legalization to tens of thousands of unlawful immigrants. Executive overreach has accelerated at an alarming rate under the Obama administration. Obama has failed on numerous occasions to enforce acts of Congress that he disagrees with for policy reasons and has also stretched his authority to put in place policies Congress has refused to enact. He has delayed the Obamacare employer mandate unilaterally, essentially stopped the enforcement of our immigration laws, provided quasi-legal status to unlawful immigrants, and released terrorists from Guantanamo Bay without notifying Congress as required by law, just to name a few examples.\n\nThere are many reasons that this should be concerning to the American people. When a president fails to follow statutory mandates or prohibitions, he reverses the votes of the people's duly elected representatives in Congress. And when the president unilaterally refuses to enforce parts of statutes he himself signed into law, he makes a mockery of our system of government and avoids accountability. If this practice is allowed to continue, no longer would presidential candidates running for reelection have to stand on their records, because they could sign one bill into law, and enforce another version of it in practice, and thereby avoid responsibility for their actions at politically opportune times.\n\nThe Constitution affords Congress several remedies to counter the executive branch's power plays, such as the power of the purse. However, the rapid acceleration of executive overreach warrants a deeper congressional review of this threat to the separation of powers and its checks and balances. Just last year, a federal judge indicated the Obama administration had used federal funds that weren't appropriated by Congress to fund Obamacare. When the president does that, the power of the purse wielded by Congress is empty and other remedies are needed.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee's specialized task force will study the growing problem of executive overreach and will also look for solutions to prevent the executive branch from continuing to exceed its constitutional authority. It will be part of the task force's mission to study the impact the increase in presidential power has had on the ability of Congress to conduct oversight of the executive branch, the lack of transparency that furthers unchecked executive power, and the constitutional requirement of the president to faithfully execute the law.\n\nAdditionally, the task force will review the tools at the disposal of Congress to restore the proper balance of powers and hold the executive branch accountable. It will also make recommendations where there are deficiencies, including legislative solutions.\n\nPreventing the executive branch from overstepping the boundaries of its constitutional authority is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is an American issue that touches the very core of the constitutional design of our government. The separation of powers and its checks and balances are designed to protect individual liberty and we must ensure that it is preserved for future generations.\n\nRep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.To read more columns like this, go to the Opinion front page.
Anthony Scaramucci\n\nPresident Trump delivered a historically productive first year in the White House, following through on campaign promises to deliver real change in Washington.\n\nTrump's approval ratings, like his pre-election poll numbers, are not an accurate representation of his true popularity. Media bias and sampling errors prevent the figures from having any credibility.\n\nDemocrats have tried to create palace intrigue and stoke culture wars to deflect from their own lack of policy solutions for the middle class, but the silent majority is still not fooled.\n\nOUR VIEW: A year later, Trump has made his own 'American carnage'\n\nPresident Trump doesn't talk or govern like a politician. He won the election because of his lack of political correctness. He says what most Americans are really thinking, and his policy victories speak for themselves:\n\n•He oversaw the greatest middle-class tax cuts since President Reagan, which have already resulted in billions of dollars worth of employee bonuses and wage increases.\n\n•He eliminated 22 regulations for every new one created, putting the U.S. economy on track to grow 3% this year for the first time in 13 years and pushing the stock market to all time highs, surging 42% since his election.\n\n•He installed a widely respected originalist in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court.\n\n•He drove ISIS to the brink of total destruction.\n\n•He reset our trade and diplomatic relationships to put American interests first.\n\n•He pressured North Korea into engaging in substantive talks with the South.\n\n•He is close to finalizing sweeping bipartisan immigration reform.\n\nThe anti-Trump movement has thrown the kitchen sink at the president in an effort to distract from his historic policy achievements. Unable to gain any traction, the desperate mob has now resorted to making baseless accusations about mental instability.\n\nAs the positive effects of tax reform and deregulation hit the wallets of even more Americans, President Trump's true approval rating will climb even higher. After eight successful years in office, his legacy will be about empowering working-class families and restoring the American dream.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci is a former White House communications director and the founder of investment firm SkyBridge Capital.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.
Corrections & clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the government agency that had custody of the two migrant children who died in December. It also now clarifies a misstatement from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The children died while in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody.\n\nIn a response to President Donald Trump's Oval Office address on border security, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, said that some immigrant women and children are acting more in an American tradition than this president is right now.\n\nOcasio-Cortez ripped the president and his immigration policies as anti-American as she appeared on Rachel Maddow's show on MSNBC Tuesday night.\n\nThose women and children trying to come here with nothing but the shirts on their back to create an opportunity and provide for this nation are acting more in an American tradition than this president is right now, the new Congresswoman said.\n\nDuring his address, Trump again called for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and spoke about what he says is a humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.\n\nIn her remarks to Maddow, Ocasio-Cortez also decried some of Trump's actions as violations of human rights, citing the so-called zero tolerance family separation policy and deaths of migrants in U.S. custody.\n\nMore:Trump speech: Read the full Oval Office address\n\nMore:During Trump's speech on border security, here's what happened at the border in Texas\n\nHe talked about what happened the day after Christmas? The day of Christmas, a child died in ICE custody, Ocasio-Cortez said. (The 8-year-old Guatemalan boy who died was in fact in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody, not ICE custody.)\n\nIn his speech, Trump also referenced a police officer in California who was killed on Dec. 26 by a man who was living in the country illegally. Paulo Virgen Mendoza was arrested and accused of killing Ronil Singh of Newman Police Department.\n\nTrump emphasized humanitarian issues in an apparent appeal to Democrats during the speech, but he also spent several minutes discussing what he said was a crime problem stemming from migrants entering the country illegally\n\nIn a televised response, Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said Trump is using fear to try and achieve his wall at the expense of people who rely on government services.\n\nMore:Trump speech: Democrats blast president for 'malice' and 'fear' in his border wall appeal\n\nMore:Trump speech: Twitter pokes fun of Schumer, Pelosi 'hostage tape,' 'American Gothic' vibe\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, has pushed for progressive policies since her campaign and called for the abolition of ICE.\n\nEarlier this week, she said there was no question that Trump is racist, a point she doubled down on Twitter Tuesday before her Maddow appearance.\n\nContributing: Michael Collins, David Jackson, John Fritze, Bart Jansen and Ledyard King, USA TODAY.

Football recruits nationwide can sign a National Letter of Intent on Wednesday, but what does the document say? Here are 10 things to know.\n\n1. It is not mandatory that a prospect sign a letter of intent\n\nBy signing a players agrees to attend the school listed for one academic year, and the school agrees to award him athletic financial aid for one academic year. A player can sign a financial aid agreement and get basically the same assurance of a scholarship as he would with the letter of intent, but the player does not have to forfeit his ability to go elsewhere without being released by the school. For the letter of intent to be valid, it must be signed by the player and his parents/guardian.\n\nRELATED: More previews of National Signing Day\n\n2. More than the letter of intent\n\nAt the time of signing the letter of intent, a player must receive a written offer of athletic financial aid for the academic year. A player and his parents/guardian must also sign the financial aid agreement. That documentation specifies the terms, conditions and amount of the athletics aid award. That document is also often accompanied by a document from the conference that outlines conference policies regarding the NLI and grant.\n\n3. Penalty for not attending for a full year\n\nThe full year covers two semesters or three quarters as a full-time student. Just spending the season with the team does not count as fulfilling the initial terms. If a player leaves a school and enrolls in another school, he cannot play until he fulfills one full year at the second school. By leaving in less than a year, the athlete also forfeits a year of eligibility in all sports.\n\n4. Players sign with a college, not a coach\n\nIf the coach for whom the athlete expected to play leaves the school, he is still bound to the letter of intent until released. I understand it is not uncommon for a coach to leave his or her position, the document states. And though that is what's on paper, listen to virtually every recruit and they all talk about the relationships they have formed with coaches during the process.\n\n5. No guarantee of playing time\n\nThere is no mention of playing time in the letter of intent. The letter of intent guarantees a player financial aid, not that he will start or even see the field.\n\n6. Once a players sign, recruiting is over\n\nThe NLI specifically bans players who signed from contact with other institutions, and other schools are obligated to respect my signing and shall cease contact with me and my family members after my siging this NLI, which includes me and my family not initiating contact with athletic staffs at other institutions. The responsbility is on the player to notify the other coach that he has signed.\n\n7. Player has to qualify academically for the NLI to apply\n\nThe letter of intent is voided if the school notifies the player in writing that he has been denied admission or fails to provide notice of admission before the start of classes in the fall semester. The player is obligated to go through the admission process and provide documents, etc., like all students. The player also must meet NCAA initial eligibility requirements and is responsible for enrolling with the NCAA Eligibility Center. The letter of intent is voided if a player is an academic non-qualifier.\n\n8. The coach can't be there\n\nA coach or representative of a school cannot hand-deliver the paperwork off campus or be present off campus when the player signs. And despite all those fax machines, the document can be returned electronically and an electronic signature is allowed.\n\n9. Quitting or not enrolling\n\nTerms of the letter intent remain in place if a player quits the team or if a player never enrolls in the school that he signed with.\n\n10. How do you get out?\n\nThe document directs players to the NLI web site to request a release and review the policies. The letter notes that the NLI Policy and Review Committee is authorized to issue interpretations, settle disputes and consider appeals. That decision can be appealed to the NLI Appeals Committee, whose decision is final and binding.
On a September afternoon more than six years ago, Robert Michel, a consumer finance executive, tried to navigate the grinding gridlock that suddenly appeared on the narrow streets of Fort Lee near the George Washington Bridge.\n\nWhat Michel did not realize was that he was trapped in what came to be known as Bridgegate — the bizarre plot to punish Fort Lee's Democratic mayor with traffic jams because he refused to endorse the reelection of Republican Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nThis Tuesday in Washington, the U.S. Supreme Court will try to navigate a vexing question that still lingers from Bridgegate: Does manufacturing traffic jams for political payback constitute a federal crime?\n\nThat the controversy over traffic on Fort Lee's streets has moved to the nation's highest court is the latest turn in the Bridgegate saga. The scandal unraveled Christie's presidential ambitions in 2016. It also painted a shocking portrait of the brass-knuckle underbelly of New Jersey politics.\n\n'I thought this was over'\n\nBut the Bridgegate case's advancement to the Supreme Court leaves motorists like Michel confused.\n\nDoesn't the Supreme Court have better things to do? he asked from his office at the Empire State Building in Manhattan. I thought this was over and done with and finished.\n\nMichel still has painful memories of the bumper-to-bumper cars and trucks he battled in Fort Lee during several rush-hour mornings and afternoons in September 2013.\n\nIt was just jammed up all over the place, he said. Traffic was backed up forever.\n\nAlthough the Bridgegate case has become legally complex, the scheme itself was relatively simple. After Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich declined to endorse Christie's reelection in 2013, close allies of the governor cooked up a payback plan: to embarrass the mayor by causing traffic jams on his borough's streets.\n\nJust after dawn on Monday, Sept. 9, 2013 — the first day of public school classes in Fort Lee — workers from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were ordered to block two of the three access lanes from Fort Lee to the George Washington Bridge. The Port Authority did not warn Fort Lee police or Sokolich. Later, the Port Authority tried to cast the lane changes as part of a traffic study.\n\nNo matter. The impact was immediate and devastating.\n\nWith only one lane — and one tollbooth — linking Fort Lee to the world's busiest bridge, thousands of cars and trucks were immobilized on the borough's streets.\n\nFor hours, traffic was a nightmare. Ambulances and firetrucks were delayed. Buses carrying students were late to school. Police could not respond to emergencies. Thousands of ordinary commuters were late for work.\n\nWhat about Wildstein?\n\nThe architect of this scheme was David Wildstein, a brash Republican operative and a Christie appointee at the Port Authority.\n\nFor years, Wildstein cultivated a reputation for playing political dirty tricks on opponents. He bragged that he once stole a suit coat from Sen. Frank Lautenberg just before the senator was to walk on stage for a debate.\n\nAt the Port Authority, Wildstein saw a chance to build a bigger profile. He later admitted he orchestrated the traffic jams to impress Christie and gain a spot on the governor's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nBut Christie's hopes for the White House vanished after the traffic scheme was revealed by NorthJersey.com and other media outlets. Republicans nominated Donald Trump.\n\nChristie denied he knew of Wildstein's traffic caper, but he could not escape criticism that his bombastic attacks on opponents created an atmosphere that led to Bridgegate. Christie left office in January 2018 as one of the least popular governors in New Jersey history.\n\nWildstein later cooperated with federal prosecutors who targeted two of Christie's close allies:Bridget Anne Kelly of Ramsey, the governor's deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a former state legislator who was tapped by Christie's to be the Port Authority's deputy executive director.\n\nLeft untouched by federal investigators were Christie and his staff, some of whom are believed to be on a list of unindicted co-conspirators that has been kept under seal by a federal judge.\n\nKelly, who is not related to this columnist, sent the now-infamous email to Wildstein in August 2013 that gave the go-ahead for the plot: Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\n\nAfter the email was made public five months later on NorthJersey.com, Wildstein offered to cooperate with federal authorities.\n\nIn 2016, Kelly and Baroni were convicted of fraud, conspiracy, mail fraud and violating the civil rights of motorists after a six-week federal trial in Newark and sentenced to prison. Wildstein, who testified against them and now runs a website on New Jersey politics, cut a deal with prosecutors and received probation after pleading guilty to two conspiracy charges.\n\nWhat the high court will consider\n\nA federal appellate court later threw out the civil rights convictions against Kelly and Baroni but left the fraud convictions for the Supreme Court to ponder.\n\nBaroni, 48, began serving his 18-month prison term last spring, but he was set free after the Supreme Court announced in June that it would consider the case.\n\nBoth Kelly, 47, who was sentenced to 13 months behind bars, and Baroni remain free on bail as they await a Supreme Court decision on their case. Tuesday's hearing — only one hour long — is their last chance to escape prison.\n\nBaroni declined to comment, as did Wildstein, now 58. But Kelly said in several interviews in recent weeks that she is hoping to be vindicated.\n\nA single mother of four, Kelly has long argued that she was duped by Wildstein into thinking that the plan to realign access lanes to the George Washington Bridge was really a Port Authority traffic study. She also said that Christie approved the plan, along with several other high-ranking members of his administration.\n\nI've been waiting and waiting for the truth to be told, said Kelly, who has struggled financially and personally since her conviction.\n\nI want my life back, she added. I want my kids to have their lives back.\n\nOne of her principal regrets, she said, was her attempt to be humorous when she dashed off her time for some traffic problems email to Wildstein.\n\nI regret the words that I used, she said. And I regret believing that the person who received it would interpret it otherwise than for what it was meant.\n\nKelly said a large contingent of relatives and friends, including her children — Mary Kate, 23; Conor, 19; Liam,16, and Anne Marie, 13 — plan to join her at the Supreme Court. Baroni is also expected to bring a group of relatives and friends.\n\nWhat they will likely hear at the court are legal arguments that are far different from those at the contentious trial in Newark.\n\nThat trial focused on who was telling the truth and whether Christie should have been indicted. As the Supreme Court considers the case, its focus will likely be much different. The high court must consider whether prosecutors overstepped by charging Kelly and Baroni with fraud.\n\nKelly's attorney, Yaakov Roth, said the Bridgegate caper may have been bad politics — but it was not a federal crime.\n\nRoth's entry into the case is significant. He is a noted Supreme Court litigator, a former clerk for now-deceased Justice Antonin Scalia and a partner at Jones Day, a law firm with ties to conservative figures on the court and elsewhere in the federal judiciary.\n\nRoth opted to take up Kelly's case free of charge because he said he believed that her conviction was part of a trend in which aggressive prosecutors used federal statutes to ensnare public officials in political misdeeds.\n\nAnalysis:New Jersey didn't see crime spike after its 2014 bail reform. Will New York be the same?\n\nLooking back:In the 2010s, NJ couldn't shake its reputation as home for crooked politicians\n\nBergen:You can't fight City Hall — or can you? This guy did, and it cost Teaneck nearly $40,000\n\nIn his brief to the Supreme Court, Roth accused federal prosecutors in Newark of applying vague federal criminal laws — in this case, fraud statutes — to impose standards of good government.\n\nRoth claims the federal prosecutors essentially looked to the politics behind the Bridgegate plan — to punish Fort Lee's mayor — to file criminal charges. In his brief to the Supreme Court, Roth wrote that such a precedent was dangerous — and unconstitutional — because it could give prosecutors the opportunity to turn the political motives of government officials into possible crimes.\n\nTaken seriously, it would allow any federal, state, or local official to be indicted based on nothing more than the (ubiquitous) allegation that she lied in claiming to act in the public interest, Roth wrote. Consider a cabinet secretary who appoints a friend to a public post, declaring him to be best-qualified. Or a deputy mayor who orders pothole repair to reward her boss' political base, justifying it on neutral policy grounds.\n\nRoth wrote that federal prosecutors would then have a playbook for how to prosecute political adversaries that transforms the federal judiciary into a Ministry of Truth for every public official in the nation.\n\nLawyers for the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, who are opposing Roth at the high court, plan to argue that the fraud laws were appropriate in the Bridgegate case because Kelly and Baroni misused federally funded Port Authority property to carry out a political scheme.\n\nThe Solicitor General's Office did not respond to a request for comment. Baroni's chief attorney, Michael Levy, also declined to comment.\n\nBesides the legal arguments by lawyers for Baroni, Kelly and the prosecution, other voices have weighed in. Additional briefs were filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island.\n\nWhitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for the court to uphold the convictions against Kelly and Baroni. Otherwise, Whitehouse said, the Supreme Court could strip prosecutors of their power to investigate political corruption.\n\nThe jury box stands as a potent bulwark against tides of public corruption and improper influence, Whitehouse wrote.\n\nThe association of defense lawyers countered by calling the Bridgegate convictions of Kelly and Baroni the latest example of prosecutorial overreach.\n\nIn yet another brief, attorneys for former Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell, a Republican whose bribery conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court in 2016, also criticized the convictions of Kelly and Baroni on grounds that they did not commit fraud.\n\nOne issue that will likely not emerge in Supreme Court arguments but nonetheless lingers as part of Bridgegate's legacy is whether Christie should have been targeted for prosecution.\n\nKelly's lawyers have long contended that federal prosecutors failed to thoroughly investigate Christie because he was a U.S. attorney in Newark before becoming governor.\n\nWe have a big factual dispute as to what took place, said Michael Critchley, who was Kelly's chief defense lawyer at her Newark trial. Our position is that the traffic plot was done at the behest of Chris Christie.\n\nAssemblyman John Wisniewski — a Democrat from Sayreville who led a legislative investigation into Bridgegate with state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Teaneck — said he believed that Christie should even have been investigated for tampering with evidence. Wisniewski pointed to reports that Christie deleted a series of text messages from his cellphone as a prime reason to question him.\n\nWisniewski also wondered why federal investigators never ordered Christie to turn over his cellphone. Under withering criticism over Bridgegate, Christie gave his cellphone to his attorney at the time, Christopher Wray, who now heads the FBI.\n\nNo matter how the Supreme Court rules, Bridgegate will likely still hold a place in history as an example of politics gone bad.\n\nIt was so brazenly stupid, Weinberg said. My initial reaction was that this was a group of frat boys and frat girls gone wild. In hindsight, I was right.\n\nMike Kelly is an award-winning columnist for NorthJersey.com.\n\nEmail: kellym@northjersey.com Twitter: @mikekellycolumn
Elizabeth Armstrong Moore\n\nNewser staff\n\n(NEWSER) – When the mother of a 16-year-old high school student posted material from her daughter's school assignment to Facebook this week, she had to clarify to friends that it wasn't a hoax or prank.\n\nJenn Oxborrow tells the Salt Lake Tribune that in her daughter's adult roles and financial literacy class, which Utah requires students to take for high school graduation, the teacher handed out homework as part of the Purposes of Dating section.\n\nThe handouts — pulled from a state database that teachers can upload material to — instructed the Highland High School students to go on a $5 date, and offered a list of advice from the opposite sex that the handout noted students should try and follow.\n\nOn the girls' sheet: If you think you're too fat, keep it to yourself, and eat the food you order; don't waste his money.\n\nThe boys, meanwhile, were told to say what you're going to order at a restaurant so she will have a guide in ordering.\n\nA rep for the Utah Board of Education says all materials in the Purposes of Dating section have now been removed: They're inappropriate.\n\nPrincipal Chris Jenson acknowledges that there's no doubt there is gender bias in the materials, while Oxborrow, who the East Idaho News reports is a therapist, accused the state of evidence-based misogyny and says the material puts our kids at risk at a time when they're sorting out their identities.\n\nOxborrow's daughter, Lucy Mulligan, tells the Guardian she found the whole thing so bizarre.

A.J. Perez\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nSuspended Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon has applied to be reinstated by the NFL.\n\nA person with knowledge of Gordon's actions confirmed to USA TODAY that Gordon has taken the formal step of seeking reinstatement. The person asked to remain anonymous because Gordon has not made his intentions public. ESPN was the first to report the move.\n\nThe league banned Gordon for at least one season last February after Gordon violated the league's substance abuse policy a third time.\n\nGordon had already served two suspensions for violating the league's drug policy when the NFL announced the latest violation on Feb. 3.

Amazon vendors doubled prices last year on 136 products considered essential for consumers, health providers and small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new report.\n\nThe U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund report released Thursday analyzed prices of 750 essential supplies such as toilet paper, pulse oximeters and hand sanitizers sold over the online retail site from Dec. 1, 2019, through Dec. 1, 2020.\n\nSellers of 409 products raised prices more than 20% over the past year, according to the report, and 136 items doubled in price.\n\nU.S. PIRG officials acknowledged price increases can be inevitable when demand spikes, but they said states should enact or enforce price-gouging laws, and the online retailer should take aggressive steps to protect consumers.\n\nAmazon has done a lot to combat price gouging on their site, said Grace Brombach, a U.S. PIRG Education Fund consumer watchdog associate who wrote the report. We just believe that it is such a massive online marketplace, that they need to be doing more.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said sellers set their own prices, but the online site has a long-standing policy against price gouging and monitors listings 24/7 for violations. In 2020, Amazon blocked or removed 39 million offers and suspended more than 13,000 accounts for attempted price gouging, the spokesperson said.\n\nWe work hard to provide customers with low prices, vast selection and fast delivery, the company spokesperson said.\n\nCoronavirus price gouging: 33 top cops demand action from Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, Facebook and Walmart\n\nGouge much? Purell for $149, face masks for $20: Coronavirus price hikes make everyone mad\n\n'I was floored': Coronavirus test prices charged by some hospitals and labs stun consumers, spur questions\n\nIn March, a group of 33 attorneys general demanded online retailers such as Amazon, Craigslist, eBay, Facebook and Walmart crack down on price gouging for critical supplies such as hand sanitizer and disinfectants.\n\nThe U.S. PIRG report focused exclusively on Amazon because it's the largest online retailer and has vowed to combat price gouging, Brombach said. Using data from the price-tracking tool Keepa, the report compared prices on 50 listings in 15 categories that people would consider essentials during the pandemic, she said.\n\nConsumers have been frustrated by periodic shortages of household staples such as toilet paper, paper towels, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer, and the report shows pricing varied widely in those categories.\n\nOne seller this year charged $109.99 for a 36-roll package of toilet paper – a price hike of $79.04 from a year ago. About one in three sellers increased toilet paper prices more than 20%.\n\nPatio heaters, snapped up by restaurants for outside dining and families to safely distance outside, had the 10 largest price hikes by percentage. Another sought-after item, surgical gloves, had comparatively modest price increases – only 16% of vendors raised prices 20% or more.\n\nOur biggest suggestion to consumers is to shop around and make sure that they are getting the best deal possible, Brombach said.\n\nBrombach said an increasing number of consumers are registering pricing complaints with state attorneys general. The report highlights price gouging laws in California, Colorado and Massachusetts. In all, 37 states have laws to combat price gouging during state or national emergencies, according to the report.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in March, forbidding monthly price increases of more than 10% on food, consumer goods and medical supplies. Exceptions include increased costs for labor or material.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced charges against an Alameda County grocery store owner for hiking prices on food items as much as 200% and a Los Angeles pharmacist for N95 mask prices.\n\nThe Online Merchants Guild sued to block Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's efforts to investigate and prosecute suspected price gouging by online vendors. The trade association argued a state can't enforce price-gouging laws against an online retailer that operates and sets prices in multiple states.\n\nA federal judge issued a preliminary injunction halting Kentucky's price-gouging enforcement against the online vendors. A bipartisan group of more than 30 attorneys general backed Kentucky's efforts and appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.
John Barrasso\n\nAmericans deserve clean air and water. They also deserve clear rules from Washington.\n\nThat is why Andrew Wheeler is the right person to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. President Donald Trump's nominee has received bipartisan praise for his fairness and respect for the environment, the agency and the law.\n\nSince July, Mr. Wheeler has served as acting administrator. Under his leadership, EPA has issued commonsense policy regulations to protect our environment, while still allowing America's economy to grow.\n\nOUR VIEW:Trump keeps failing to drain the swamp\n\nOverreaching regulations such as the so-called Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule would have damaged our economy and cost Americans jobs with minimal benefit to the environment.\n\nThese regulations weren't just bad policy, they were illegal. With Andrew Wheeler in charge, the agency has worked with states to draft commonsense replacement rules that protect the environment, follow the law and are simpler to understand.\n\nMr. Wheeler is also leading EPA's efforts to keep families safe at home. For example, an initiative to limit children's exposure to lead has become an agency priority under his leadership.\n\nHe has spent decades working on environmental policy. Long before his time in leadership at the EPA, he served as a staff member at the agency. He has hands-on experience working in the department he will now lead.\n\nHe knows the legislative process from his time as staff director of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He was also a consultant for energy and environmental clients in the private sector.\n\nPresident Trump made the right pick when he nominated Andrew Wheeler. He will be an outstanding administrator at the EPA.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., is chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.

Ledyard King\n\nTallahassee Democrat\n\nWASHINGTON – In a sudden about-face, the Trump administration has decided to exclude Florida from its plan to expand offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced the decision Tuesday evening after meeting with Florida Gov. Rick Scott at Tallahassee International Airport.\n\nScott had joined with a bipartisan group of state officials in blasting the administration's plan unveiled last week to open up Florida waters — a part of the largest single expansion of off-shore drilling activity ever proposed.\n\nPresident Trump has directed me to rebuild our offshore oil and gas program in a manner that supports our national energy policy and also takes into consideration the local and state voice, Zinke said in a statement released by his office. I support the governor's position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver. As a result of discussion with Governor Scott and his leadership, I am removing Florida from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms.\n\nMore:Trump moves to vastly expand offshore drilling, Scott wants Florida left out\n\nPresident Trump to roll back Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling regulations\n\nSen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said the decision to remove Florida so quickly after it had been included in an energy-development plan that was months in the making smacked of political gamesmanship. Scott is expected to challenge Sen. Bill Nelson, a long-time drilling foe, later this year in what would be one of the nation's most hotly contested Senate races.\n\nI have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. But now, suddenly, Secretary Zinke announces plans to drill off Florida's coast and four days later agrees to 'take Florida off the table'? I don't believe it, Nelson said in a statement. This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott, who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career. We shouldn't be playing politics with the future of Florida.\n\nThe drilling proposal, announced last week, includes 47 potential lease sales in 25 of the 26 planning areas — 19 sales off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Pacific region, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, and nine in the Atlantic region.\n\nThe five-year plan, covering 2019 to 2024, was initiated by the America First Offshore Energy Strategy directive President Trump signed in April that could eventually open up Arctic waters and millions of coastal acres off U.S. shores to oil and gas drilling.\n\nOur country is blessed with incredible natural resources including abundant offshore oil and natural gas resources, but the federal government has kept 94 percent of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production, Trump said at the time. This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions in wealth.\n\nWhen he announced the five-year plan last week, Zinke said his agency would work with states and members of Congress who represent potential drilling areas to allay concerns. But the move already was getting pushback from a number of Florida officials including Scott, a Trump confidante, who said he would oppose drilling off Florida's coasts where tourism and coastal military installations are important to the state's economy.\n\nAfter meeting with Zinke Tuesday, Scott issued a statement headlined Gov. Scott Fought to Protect Florida's Coastline.\n\nBy removing Florida from consideration, we can now focus on how we can further protect our environment, including our proposal for record funding for the Everglades, our springs, our beaches and our state parks, Scott said. I will never stop fighting for Florida's environment and our pristine coastline.\n\nPolls suggest Floridians are increasingly opposed to off-shore drilling.\n\nThe annual University of South Florida-Nielsen Sunshine State Survey showed 44 percent support for the activity in 2014 with 39 percent opposed. In 2016, 47 percent opposed off-shore drilling compared to 32 percent who supported it.\n\nSierra Club Florida Director Frank Jackalone decried Zinke's decision as a purely political move to aid the ambitions of Rick Scott.\n\nHad Zinke cared about the wishes of coastal communities or how drilling off their coasts will affect them, he would have proposed a plan that shrinks drilling even further, not proposed expanding operations to nearly every corner of our waters, Jackalone said in a statement. Floridians won't put up with politicians who support offshore drilling because an oil spill on our beaches would wreck our economy and destroy what people love most about our state.
Adam Shell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAfter Wednesday's wild ride and sizable stock market reversal that limited losses, Wall Street rebounded Thursday with the Dow rising triple digits after oil jumped 5% and European stocks rallied on ECB stimulus talk.\n\nThe Dow ended up 116 points, or 0.7%, to 15,882.48. Climbing 0.5% was the S&P 500, up nearly 10 points to 1868.98. Practically even for the day was the Nasdaq composite, up a fractional 0.01% to 4472.06.\n\nStarbucks hits earnings; outlook disappoints\n\nStocks got a boost as the head of the European Central Bank said it will review its monetary policy stance in March.\n\nThe comments from ECB President Mario Draghi could mean more stimulus is on the way to combat slow growth and worsening inflation in the eurozone.\n\nWall Street kicked off Thursday debating if yesterday's big drop and late-day comeback -- the Dow Jones industrial average was down 565 points before trimming its losses to 249 points -- was a sign of a short-term selling climax that could pave the way -- finally -- for a market bounce. The general consensus on Wall Street is that, if anything, the market has suffered enough pain at the start of the new year to at least mount a counter-trend rally soon. However, there's also a sense that the final low in this correction has not yet been put in.\n\nLooking for signs of stocks' final washout as fear, panic spike\n\nThe rally was were helped by a rise in oil prices as U.S. benchmark crude jumped about 5% to almost $30 a barrel.\n\nStocks in Europe got a lift from comments this morning from Draghi when he said that the outlook for inflation in the eurozone was significantly lower, and that, as a result, the ECB would revisit its policy again in March. In December, the ECB pushed a key borrowing rate further into negative territory and extended the duration of its bond-buying program. Markets, however, did not respond positively, as they felt Draghi did not go far enough.\n\nStocks have been in the vice grip of the Big 3 worries: plunging oil prices, slowing growth in China and uncertainty over Federal Reserve interest rate policy.\n\nInvestors fear a global recession, and are pricing in some of that negative scenario, even though the U.S. job market remains strong, consumers are still spending and the economy is still delivering modest growth.\n\nDavos 2016: Highlights of our coverage\n\nHeading into today's trading session, the pain meter was hard to ignore. The Dow was down 9.5% in 2016, the S&P 500 was off 9%, and the Nasdaq composite was down 10.7%. All three U.S. stock indexes are officially in correction territory, defined as a drop of 10% or more.\n\nIn Europe, shares got a boost from Draghi's comments. The broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 2.1%. Shares fell in Asia, following yesterday's selloff in the U.S. Japan's Nikkei fell 2.4%, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was off 1.8% and the Shanghai composite index in mainland China fell 3.2%.\n\nAdam Shell on Twitter: @adamshell.
Bill Loveless\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nWhen it comes to putting the best foot forward in difficult times, Harold Hamm does so as surely as anyone in the U.S. oil industry.\n\nSince oil prices began spiraling down last year, the CEO of Continental Resources has predicted a recovery sooner than many analysts would venture, and he's sticking to that point of view even now as the cost of a barrel of crude has sunk to 12-year lows.\n\nThe worst is over, I believe, Hamm said the other day as oil markets struggled to take account of the escalation in tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran and turmoil in the Chinese economy.\n\nLate selloff puts stock indexes in correction\n\nIn fact, Hamm stood by predictions he made to CNBC during the holidays that oil prices will begin to recover in the first half of 2016, returning to levels of $40 to $50 a barrel, as supply and demand come into balance.\n\nI'm not picking a bottom here. Who knows what it would be, Hamm said of oil prices. But the lower it goes, the shorter time it will be there. That's the way it works.\n\nOn the face of it, Hamm's outlook appears especially bullish, considering that Brent, the international benchmark for oil prices, and West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. marker, both plunged below $35 a barrel last week.\n\nBut he says he's all the more confident of a recovery since Congress lifted 40-year-old restrictions on exports of oil from the U.S. to other countries last month.\n\nThere's a new world order now for oil markets, he said in an interview. Even though we could export oil up to 1975, it's different now. The big game changer is that we have the resource that we didn't have then. We have the supply due to the horizontal drilling that nobody anticipated earlier.\n\nThe combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has enabled U.S. producers like Continental Resources to squeeze oil from tight shale formations in Texas, North Dakota and other states that were all but impenetrable until a few years ago. The breakthroughs in technology drove domestic oil production to 9.6 million barrels a day last April, the highest level since 1970.\n\nThe surge in U.S. oil production has begun to taper off, however, thanks to the downturn in prices. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that production will continue to decline through September, ending the year at an average of 8.8 million barrels a day, compared to 9.3 million barrels a day in 2015.\n\nWhether oil prices will rise much at that point, and stick, is subject to all kinds of speculation. But regardless, Hamm said he's certain that freeing U.S. oil companies to compete in world markets will make a big difference.\n\nWe're certainly on a level playing field in the world of competition now, said Hamm, whose Oklahoma City-based company is one of the biggest shale oil producers in the country. It's not a panacea but it's certainly something to build on.\n\n2016 Investment Roundtable\n\n#MARKETS16: Stock picks | Shocks to watch | Questions | Bull or bear? | Rocky start\n\nIn fact, Hamm said the new policy is already paying off for producers, as WTI prices approached or exceeded Brent prices in recent days, and NuStar Energy and ConocoPhillips shipped a cargo of crude from the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas to Europe, the first to go abroad under the new policy.\n\nWe'll be in the mix at some point, Hamm said of Continental Resources. But it's a go now. We're beginning to see it take off rather quickly because we've got premium quality light sweet crude that refineries need, primarily in Europe and other places.\n\nHis first overseas customer?\n\nWatch for a deal between Continental Resources and SK Group, South Korea's largest oil refiner.\n\nI'm not going to tell company secrets, but I can certainly tell you that one of the first calls of congratulations that I got (after Congress acted) came from our friends at SK Group, he said.\n\nBill Loveless – @bill_loveless on Twitter – is a veteran energy journalist and podcast host in Washington.

If the pace of COVID-19 vaccine delivery into people's arms stays the way it has been for the past few weeks, it could take years rather than months to vaccinate Americans, and the outbreak will continue to dominate lives.\n\nFederal officials overestimated the speed at which vaccines could be given, making delivery a disappointment in an otherwise successful vaccine development effort.\n\nDoses have been distributed behind the government's initial schedule – 15 million, instead of the 20 million doses promised to be delivered by the end of 2020. About 70% of those doses are sitting on pharmacy shelves, according to government data, and only about 14% of doses destined for nursing home residents and caregivers have been injected.\n\nAlthough vaccination is off to a rough start, it's not too late to turn the situation around, according to experts such as Kelly Moore, deputy director of the Immunization Action Coalition, an education and advocacy group.\n\nTo do so will require a host of improvements, including more money, additional staffing and greater experience with vaccines that have been shown to be safe and effective but not so easy to use.\n\nAbout 200,000 doses are being given a day. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said vaccinators should soon be able to deliver 1 million a day.\n\nThere were a lot of aspirational goals set by federal officials about how many vaccines could be delivered how quickly, Moore said. The delivery of a box of vaccine to a clinic door is the easiest part of the process.\n\n'Bizarre, disorganized': Wisconsin behind most of Midwest on COVID-19 vaccinations; some health care workers say they're in the dark\n\nChicago has delivered 95% of the vaccine it's received, but at the current rate of delivery, it would take a year to a year-and-a-half to vaccinate the city's residents, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday.\n\nThat is unacceptable, she said. The federal government must absolutely, 100% step up.\n\nChicago has built infrastructure to deliver the vaccine, Lightfoot said, but needs more doses. The federal government has to step up, finally, and do a better job at protecting American lives from this terrible virus.\n\nOperation Warp Speed, the federal program tasked with developing and delivering COVID-19 vaccines, promised to vaccinate 20 million Americans in December.\n\nThree weeks after shipping began, the program has distributed 15 million doses to hospitals and nursing home providers, but only 4.5 million people have gotten the first of the two-shot regimen. That means 30% of available doses have been used.\n\nAmong nursing home residents and caregivers, 365,000 shots have been delivered out of more than 2.5 million distributed – a 14% usage rate.\n\nThe numbers may be somewhat better than they appear because of a lag in reporting, but there's no question that fewer shots are being given than was planned or expected.\n\nFederal officials have focused on getting the vaccine onto hospital shelves, but to get them off the shelves requires an enormous human element, Moore said.\n\nThere are always bugs when you translate from paper to practice, she said, and federal plans didn't give enough consideration to the need for scheduling and organizing clinics, educating patients and caregivers and resolving the small problems that crop up.\n\nHospital workers and public health officials are exhausted after 11 months of fighting the virus.\n\nAnd now they're being asked to ramp up the most ambitious vaccine program the country has ever seen, said Dr. Howard Koh, a former assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and now a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe protocols for this vaccine are different from those for the seasonal flu vaccine, for which a nurse can wheel a cart through hospital hallways, delivering shot after shot.\n\nPeople who receive a COVID-19 vaccine have to be watched for 15 minutes to ensure they don't have an allergic reaction. This requires hospitals to set aside space and personnel – both of which are at a premium.\n\nThe process is further slowed as caregivers have to think about who should or shouldn't be vaccinated.\n\nAll of those things are just part of the not-unexpected challenges we face in implementing such a complex program with a new vaccine based on a new platform in the midst of the height of the pandemic with exhausted health care workers who are at the end of their rope after all the work they've been doing for the past year, Moore said.\n\nBy the time there is enough vaccine to distribute outside hospitals and other care facilities to the broader community, vaccinators will have worked out some of the kinks in the system, she said.\n\nIt may get easier to vaccinate large numbers of people when shots can be delivered at neighborhood pharmacies and health care facilities.\n\nCVS is ready to deliver vaccine at all 10,000 of its pharmacies nationwide and expects to be able to give 20 million to 25 million doses a month once enough vaccine is available.\n\nWe're ready to go once the government authorizes wider distribution, said Mike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesperson.\n\nFrustrating front-line experience\n\nDr. Steven Wolf said his experience last weekend illustrates many of the challenges facing vaccinators.\n\nWolf, who co-runs neurology services for YAI, a New York-based support organization for people with autism, Down syndrome and other conditions, came in over his vacation to vaccinate patients and the staff members who care for them.\n\nI was envisioning that we were going to get them in and out fast, Wolf said, but the process was horribly terrible.\n\nIt took 52 clicks on each person's digital medical record before the patient was ready to receive a shot. That was after YAI had managed to get consent forms signed by family members and guardians for those who couldn't sign for themselves.\n\nIt was just freaking endless, Wolf said of the paperwork.\n\nHe and two others were able to vaccinate 40 people in three hours, far fewer than he anticipated.\n\nTen caregivers refused to receive the vaccine. Some wanted to talk it over with family members. Others wanted more people to go first, while some repeated conspiracy theories about the vaccine.\n\nWolf said he considers himself a pretty persuasive person, and he was armed with lots of facts about the minor side effects and major benefits of the vaccine, but he said he and his colleagues couldn't persuade those 10 to get vaccinated.\n\nWe talk people into medication and surgery and all these other things, and we could not convince these 10 that this is what you've got to do to take care of yourself, he said. I came home so frustrated.\n\nPolls: Show increasing trust in COVID-19 vaccine after months of decline\n\nLack of money, focus and leadership\n\nAlthough Congress allocated $8 billion for vaccine distribution, Koh, the former federal health official, said it's not enough and should have arrived months ago.\n\nThis is a field that has been under-resourced and overlooked for far too long, Koh said.\n\nKoh, who was commissioner of public health for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during 9/11 and the anthrax scare in 2001, said officials promised then never to be caught off guard again by a public health emergency, but that resolve didn't last.\n\nHe criticized the lack of federal leadership and politicization of public health, saying state and local governments should collaborate, not go it alone.\n\nA crisis like this should be bipartisan, nonpartisan, one government response, he said, but that's not what's happened.\n\nMoore lives in Tennessee, which has eight neighboring states each with different policies. In Bristol, Tennessee, police officers have to wait until health care workers are vaccinated, while officers across the border in Bristol, Virginia, are allowed to line up.\n\nDifferent standards could mean vaccinators will hesitate to make sure they're not making a mistake, and recipients will be more likely to pass on the vaccine, thinking they're not a priority.\n\nThere's no right way to prioritize who should get the vaccine first, second and third, Moore said, but having each state choose its own path is too confusing. The right way to do this is to pick one way, she said.\n\nThese problems are all solvable, Moore said, and it's realistic to think they will be fixed within the next month, and the number of vaccinations will reach 1 million a day nationwide, as Fauci suggested.\n\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams, speaking on NBC News' Today show, agreed that the state delivery systems have been uneven, some distributing 75% or more of available doses and others not even 25%.\n\nHe said there would be more money to help out, more locations will soon be added to provide vaccinations and more people will be eligible to get the vaccine. Your headline today really should be 'Surgeon General tells states and governors to move quickly to other priority groups,' he said.\n\nThe bottom line is that everyone wants vaccinations to move faster, said Nancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association. Vaccines provide the chance to get beyond COVID-19 as a force in our lives.\n\nIt is the great opportunity and the great hope, Foster said. No one wants to see it moving slowly.\n\nContributing: Grace Hauck\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Nate Davis\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter a few final plot twists in Week 17, the NFL playoff field is set. And though conventional thinking is already emerging heading into postseason, you never know what will happen once the Super Bowl tournament unfolds.\n\nHere is some pushback on five overreactions entering the playoffs:\n\nPeyton Manning will save the Broncos\n\nHe came out of the bullpen Sunday for the first time in his 18-year NFL career, and the result could not have been better for the Denver Broncos, who emerged with home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut let's not book them for a trip to Santa Clara, Calif., just yet. Manning clearly gave Denver and its fans an emotional lift. But let's not forget he completed five of nine passes for 69 yards – hardly sublime numbers. Manning's ability to hand off beat the San Diego Chargers, whose 27th-ranked rush defense was ground up for 212 yards by Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson.\n\nNo matter how spry the five-time MVP is feeling -- and the bye week should further heal him -- he can only hope to regain rhythm with the starters in practice and obviously still won't be more mobile or have a better arm than Brock Osweiler in two weeks. And is the Broncos' sometimes transparent O-line really going to stop J.J. Watt, Justin Houston or Cam Heyward when one of them shows up in the divisional round? Finally, the specter of Manning's 11-13 playoff record -- and he's 2-5 in his last seven postseason games – still hangs over him.\n\nIf we could re-seed the NFL playoff teams: Seattle, Pittsburgh would benefit greatly\n\nNow that Pittsburgh is in, AFC should beware\n\nMinus a brief interlude after Week 16's upset loss to the lowly Baltimore Ravens jeopardized their playoff viability, the Pittsburgh Steelers have widely been considered the AFC team no one would want to face in January. But is that really still true?\n\nRB DeAngelo Williams went down with an ankle injury in Week 17, and his availability for Saturday is unclear. We saw what happened exactly a year ago when Le'Veon Bell -- Williams was signed as his insurance policy -- was injured in the regular-season finale. Pittsburgh was reduced from offensive juggernaut to an unbalanced and predictable outfit that went one and done in postseason.\n\nAnd though they're likely to draw Cincinnati Bengals backup QB AJ McCarron, who struggled against Pittsburgh in a 33-20 Week 14 loss at Paul Brown Stadium (McCarron's first substantial NFL action), let's not forget that in their most recent outings, Steelers were beaten by Ryan Mallett -- after his crash course with the Baltimore playbook -- and struggled for three-plus quarters to put away the smoldering Cleveland Browns and third-string QB Austin Davis.\n\nNFL coaching carousel: Breaking down every hire\n\nArizona has been exposed\n\nWith a shot at the NFC's No. 1 seed Sunday, the Arizona Cardinals were manhandled at home by the scalding Seattle Seahawks. Uh oh?\n\nThere's no sugarcoating the fact Bruce Arians' offense laid its biggest egg of the season in a 36-6 loss that represented the team's fewest points and yards (232) this season. But let's not just write off that nine-game winning streak Arizona owned beforehand, which included a win at CenturyLink Field. Though the season-ending knee injury to DB Tyrann Mathieu remains a blow, the Cardinals have no glaring weakness. And perhaps a heaping helping of humble pie in Week 17 is just the fuel Arians needed to stoke a team that might have become a bit complacent.\n\nNFC wild-card matchup previews\n\nThe Redskins aren't going anywhere\n\nThe NFC East has been a punchline all season. The Washington Redskins emerged as the only team in the division with a winning record at a not-so-impressive 9-7. But take them lightly at your peril.\n\nThe 'Skins are on fire, winners of four in a row and averaging nearly 33 points during that stretch. They also open postseason at FedEx Field, where they were 6-2 in 2015. And though it seems a sacrilegious thought, Kirk Cousins (12 TDs, 1 INT in the last four games) has been a better quarterback than Aaron Rodgers (5 TDs, 3 INTs) in the final quarter of the season. And a matchup with Rodgers' listing Green Bay Packers seems far more promising than welcoming the Seahawks.\n\nAFC wild-card matchup previews: Chiefs at Texans, Steelers at Bengals\n\nThe Vikings should have rolled over\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings brought home the NFC North crown, snapping Green Bay's four-year stranglehold on the division, by beating the Pack on Sunday night. But did Minnesota lose by winning?\n\nA loss to the struggling Packers would have meant a theoretically winnable rematch at Lambeau Field in the wild-card round. Instead, the Vikings will host the Seahawks, who thrashed them 38-7 at TCF Bank Stadium in Week 13. The Vikings were thoroughly outclassed that day. But second-year QB Teddy Bridgewater has been much improved since. NFL rushing champion Adrian Peterson is unlikely to be limited to eight carries or 18 yards again. A healthier but still underappreciated Minnesota defense won't sleep on Seahawks WR Doug Baldwin. And big picture, the Vikings weren't (and aren't) Super Bowl frontrunners anyway, so you can bet coach Mike Zimmer is relishing the challenge of playing the NFC's bullies and seeing how his up-and-coming team responds in this crucible.\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 17

Just 125 inches to go to break the record!\n\nYerdon, an unabashed snow lover, lives in Redfield, N.Y., a heavily forested, sparsely populated town that is about 90 miles east-northeast of Rochester.\n\nIn winter, though, it's worlds away.\n\nRedfield sits atop the Tug Hill Plateau — the snowiest place in New York and, in many winters, the snowiest place in the eastern United States. Its only real rival is the Keweenaw Peninsula in far-northern Michigan, research shows.\n\nBoth lie in the heart of lake effect snow country, where whiteouts and huge drifts are commonplace.\n\nThis winter, Redfield is the hand's down leader in snowfall, with 5 feet more than any other observation point on the Great Lakes.\n\nIt's in line, then, to win the inaugural Gold Snowdrift Award, which the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle has devised to honor the snowiest place in the Great Lakes region.\n\nYerdon, who has been the official National Weather Service observer in Redfield for more than two decades, wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nIt's a cozy time of year, she said. I try to put a positive spin on it and delight in seeing the 'fun' side of it once the hard work is done.\n\nJust as the Keweenaw Peninsula gets much of its snow from Lake Superior, Tug Hill owes its thick wintry blanket to Lake Ontario.\n\n► Related: 10 great places to try snowshoeing for the first time\n\nHuge bands of lake effect snow whip up over the lakes each winter, blow ashore and dump their load on the uplands in Oswego, Lewis and neighboring counties. Storms, sometimes accompanied by thunder and lightning, can last for days. Snowfalls of 2 feet, 3 feet and more are common.\n\nYes, Rochester is one of America's snowiest big cities, but nothing like Redfield.\n\nI've been going up there to see the snow every year since I was in college — the last 15 or 16 years. This year was about the highest I've seen up there, said Jon Hitchcock, a weather service meteorologist who attended the State University of New York at Oswego. I measured 64 inches on the ground in Redfield. It was pretty impressive.\n\nOther spots in Tug Hill often get more snow than Redfield. But this winter, winds have been from just the right direction to bury the place.\n\nThe crossroads in Redfield where Yerdon lives had 309 inches and counting by Monday evening. The next highest totals on the Great Lakes are about 236 inches in Houghton, Mich., and 230 inches in Osceola, a Lewis County town 6 miles east of Redfield, according Democrat and Chronicle research.\n\nAverage winter snowfall in Redfield is 288 inches. The record there, which Yerdon yearns to see broken this winter, is 424.5 inches.\n\nA good portion of Redfield's snow fell in one epic dose earlier this month. Between Feb. 1 and Feb. 4, a lake effect storm deposited 71 inches. By Feb. 10, a total of 122 inches had fallen.\n\nThat's 10 feet in 10 days.\n\n► Related: Deadly snowstorm pounds Northeast, snarling flights and shuttering schools\n\nLiving in an area that receives such large amounts of lake effect can be very exciting as well as exhausting, Yerdon said. Shoveling and plowing are done daily, sometime multiple times per day during big storms. The key is to keep up with it.\n\nYou never plan to get out and do too much away from home because if you get out of your driveway, it might snow enough while you're gone so you can't get back in, she said.\n\nLake effect snow is created when air passes over relatively warm water, picking up moisture as it goes. The longer the stretch of open water, or the fetch as it's known, the more moisture is wicked up to form snow.\n\nWinter often brings strong, persistent winds from the southwest, west or northwest. When they pass over the longest fetches of water, you get the Great Lakes snowbelts on the southern and eastern shores of Lake Superior, and on the eastern and southeastern shores of Huron, Erie and Ontario.\n\nNot all snowbelts are equal, though.\n\n► Related: What is thundersnow?\n\nThe areas south of Buffalo that lie at the downwind end of Lake Erie can get enormous snowfalls — but Erie freezes solid most winters, cutting the lake effect season short. The snowiest spots there average less than 200 inches annually.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Lake Huron ices over, too. That plus a shorter fetch limits the snowiest parts of Canada's Great Lakes shoreline to an average of about 150 inches per winter.\n\nParts of Lake Superior remain open during most winters, and Lake Ontario rarely freezes. That helps explain why Keewenaw and Tug Hill get so much snow.\n\nIn addition, both areas are elevated hundreds of feet above water level, which enhances snowfall.\n\nIn Keewenaw, they're as proud of their snow as folks in Tug Hill.\n\nWe're up at the top of the list, said Steve Jurmu, a photographer who lives near the base of the Keewenaw Peninsula and runs a website that celebrates the Upper Peninsula. We get those winds from Canada. We usually see snowflakes in September. This year we saw some Oct. 8, Jurmu said.\n\n► Related: Winter car accidents are a deadly weather hazard\n\nIt's been a normal winter. We're probably going to hit the 300 inch-mark, he said drolly.\n\nRedfield is already there, and Yerdon couldn't be happier.\n\nOur winters have been known to stretch into mid-April or longer, so there is still plenty of time to add to this total and possibly break a record, she said. We can do this.\n\nFollow Steve Orr on Twitter: @SOrr1\n\nFor the record\n\nNew York's eye-popping snowfall record of 466.7 inches — that's almost 39 feet — was set in the notoriously harsh winter of 1976-77.\n\nThe record book shows the mark was set in Hooker, a name etched in the minds of all Empire State snow lovers.\n\nBut it wasn't set in Hooker at all.\n\nToday Hooker is only a flyspeck, but it once was a populated settlement in the southwestern part of Montague, a town in Lewis County. A volunteer who lived there began measuring snowfall and other parameters for the weather service more than a century ago.\n\nEventually, that person stopped his or her work, but after a time, someone else nearby took up the task. Weather service policy is to retain to name of the observation point even if it moves a few miles, so the data continued to be recorded under Hooker.\n\nBy the winter of 1976-77, the person submitting snowfall reports for Hooker actually lived 4 miles from the original spot, in the northern part of Montague, weather service officials in Buffalo say.\n\nBy rights, Montague's name should be in the record book.\n\nHooker, by the way, has moved again. The person who measures snow under that name resides near the Lewis County village of Copenhagen, a dozen miles north of where the Hooker measurements were originally made.
Vice President Mike Pence will attend the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, even as President Donald Trump intends to skip it.\n\nThe decision came a day after Trump announced he would decline to watch his successor sworn-in, breaking with more than 150 years of tradition. A source familiar with the decision speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed Pence's expected attendance.\n\nPence is facing considerable blowback from some Trump supporters – and significant praise from others – for defying the president's demand that he somehow reject the results of the election as Congress met Wednesday to count Electoral College votes and formalized Biden's win. Despite Trump's protestations, Pence noted he had no power to reject the votes.\n\nBiden dismissed Trump's decision not to attend the inauguration, telling reporters on Friday that it was one of the few things he and I ever agreed on. But of Pence, Biden said that he was welcome to come and that he'd be honored to have him there.\n\nTrump will be the first sitting president to decline to attend an inauguration of his successor since 1869, when President Andrew Johnson stayed in the White House while Ulysses S. Grant was sworn in as the 18th president.\n\n– John Fritze\n\n'I don't care if it's one hour left, let's impeach him,' Clyburn says of Trump\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., said Saturday that as long as President Donald Trump is in office, he should be impeached over the riot in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nI don't care if it's one hour left, let's impeach him, Clyburn said in an interview with USA TODAY. Trump has 11 days left in office before President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20.\n\nHouse Democrats said Saturday that they will introduce an article of impeachment Monday, charging Trump with inciting insurrection at the Capitol, for the riot Wednesday that caused five people to die, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in a letter that the Senate couldn't hold a trial before Trump's term ends on Jan. 20 at noon.\n\nI don't think that the House should predicate what it's doing based upon whether or not there's a possibility of a conviction,'' he said. Has he committed impeachable offenses? Yes, he has.\n\nClyburn pointed to the Georgia telephone call where Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse his loss to Biden in Georgia and Trump's Wednesday speech, saying there should be two articles of impeachment for each offense.\n\nHe said it's like saying I saw this guy shoot someone, but I'm not going to indict him because I don't think he can get convicted. We heard this man ... , he said, referring to Trump's taped call.\n\nClyburn said it will be up to senators to act.\n\nIf they don't convict him, that's on them, but I think it would be on us if we did not impeach him.\n\n— Rebecca Morin and Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nTrump to visit U.S.-Mexico border to laud border wall\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is expected to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday to highlight his administration's work on the border wall, the White House said Saturday.\n\nTrump will travel to the town of Alamo, Texas. He will mark the completion of 400 miles of border wall and his administration's efforts to reform what the White House described as the nation's broken immigration system.\n\nTrump's campaign for the presidency in 2016 focused extensively on the president's desire to construct a border wall. He also promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but it has been paid for by U.S. taxpayers.\n\nWhile most of the wall went up in areas that had smaller barriers, the government has built hundreds of miles of fencing as high as 30 feet in a short amount of time – most of it this year.\n\nThe visit will likely be the president's first public appearance since he addressed supporters on Wednesday, riling up a crowd that later staged a violent siege of the U.S. Capitol. He is anxious to highlight accomplishments as his presidency winds down.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats in the House are pushing for an impeachment vote next week and are planning to formally introduce their proposal Monday with a vote possible by Wednesday.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nToomey: Trump has 'committed impeachable offenses'\n\nRepublican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania said Saturday that President Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses.\n\nI do think the president committed impeachable offenses, Toomey said during an interview on Fox News.\n\nIn regards to the articles of impeachment, Toomey shared concerns about whether the House would completely politicize something.\n\nBut I don't know what is going to land on the Senate floor – if anything, he added.\n\nToomey, who opposed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, has previously said he will not seek re-election in 2022.\n\nAn article of impeachment will be introduced Monday, House Democrats said Saturday. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said in a letter that the Senate couldn't hold a trial before Trump's term ends on Jan. 20 at noon.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nKentucky Rep. Thomas Massie says 'Trump is at fault' for deadly riot\n\nRepublican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky criticized President Donald Trump and blamed him for inciting the riot on Jan. 6 that led to the seize of the Capitol.\n\nI think Trump is at fault here, Massie told The Dispatch. I watched almost all of his speech. I felt like it was inevitable.\n\nThe Kentucky representative also said that Trump, among others, misled his supporters.\n\nPeople did mislead the folks that came here, and Trump was among them, Massie said. He insinuated that states wanted their electors thrown out, which was not true. I kept a spreadsheet of every document every state produced, and in no case did a majority of any legislature even put their name on the letter.\n\nMassie, who was publicly against the efforts to contest the 2020 election results, also said that some of his colleagues believed Trump's claims while others did not but feared the ramifications of not backing the president.\n\nThere were a whole host of my colleagues who were just frankly terrified of the base that Trump had misled. It was much easier to go along than to explain to them that Trump was misleading them, Massie said.\n\n– Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nHouse Democrats to introduce article of impeachment Monday\n\nHouse Democrats said Saturday they will introduce an article of impeachment on Monday to charge President Donald Trump for a second time before the end of his term Jan. 20, although the prospects for a Senate trial or conviction are unclear.\n\nReps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland are members of the Judiciary Committee coordinating the effort. The three were also leaders of Trump's previous impeachment in late 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nCicilline drafted the latest article charging Trump with inciting insurrection at the Capitol, for the riot Wednesday. The effort has 180 co-sponsors in a chamber where 218 votes could approve an article of impeachment.\n\nThe article charges Trump with foreseeably encouraging violence at the Capitol, where rioters rampaged through the building, a rioter was shot to death, and a police officer died from wounds from the melee. The article charged that Trump repeatedly sought to decertify the election of President-elect Joe Biden, whose Electoral College victory was confirmed early Thursday after the riot.\n\nThe article said if Trump acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has circulated a letter showing that the Senate couldn't possibly hold a trial before Trump's term ends at noon Jan. 20.\n\nThe Senate will meet next in pro forma session on Jan. 19. Even if the chamber received an article of impeachment by then, the next step it could take under its rules would be at 1 p.m. Jan. 20, according to McConnell's memo.\n\nBut advocates of impeachment have argued it is worth pursuing because a conviction could prevent Trump from ever holding federal office again. The House article suggests that Trump's punishment warrants removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States. But the Senate would decide what punishment to mete out only after at least a two-thirds majority voted to convict Trump.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump of the previous impeachment in February 2019 when only one Republican – Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah – voted with Democrats in the minority to convict him. A two-thirds majority is required for conviction in a chamber likely to be evenly divided with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nEx-Capitol chief: Feds should add interim leadership to help with inaugural plan\n\nWith the inauguration looming, a former U.S. Capitol police chief said authorities should consider adding interim leadership to a besieged department reeling from a cascade of security failures that left five dead, including one officer, in Wednesday's stunning breach of the Capitol.\n\nTerrance Gainer, who headed the department for four years in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, said more experience is needed as the agency contends with an avalanche of questions about its failed response to Wednesday's riot, preparations for President-elect Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration and the mourning of fallen officer Brian Sicknick.\n\nThe department only has so much bandwidth, Gainer said. More experience might make sense for everybody.\n\nWithin 24 hours of the assault, Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund announced his resignation, part of a clean sweep of Capitol Hill law enforcement officials that included the House and Senate sergeants at arms.\n\nThe departure of all three officials leaves only one permanent member of the Capitol Police Board – the architect of the Capitol – which oversees the 2,300 member U.S. Capitol Police Department.\n\nThe Secret Service leads preparations for inaugural security, one of the country's most challenging security operations, but Capitol police are an integral part of the plan as the heart of the ceremony is staged at the Capitol.\n\nOnly days ago, some in the mob that stormed the Capitol used the temporary bleachers recently-erected to accommodate inaugural guests to gain entrance to the building.\n\nThere is going to be a lot of time spent answering questions about what went wrong, and there should be, Gainer said. There also is a lot more to do, including the large task of preparing for the inauguration.\n\nBiden has voiced confidence in security for the inauguration, citing the Secret Service's lead role on Friday.\n\nA totally different entity is in charge of the inauguration than it was in charge of protecting the capitol, the Secret Service. I have great confidence in the Secret Service, Biden told reporters at The Queen theater in Wilmington, Delaware. I have great confidence in their ability to make sure that the inauguration goes off safely, and goes off without a hitch.\n\nEarlier this week, the Secret Service said plans have been in the works for more than a year to include all possible contingencies at every level.\n\nYet Gainer said Wednesday's security breakdowns remain difficult to comprehend.\n\nThe former chief said Sund once served as his chief of staff and formerly headed the Special Operations Division at D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, the unit that manages major special events in the city.\n\nIt's so hard to understand how this happened, given the experience, Gainer said.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nGOP attorneys general group sent robocall promoting Capitol march\n\nAn arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association sent out a robocall encouraging people to join the pro-Trump march to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, which eventually turned into a deadly riot.\n\nThe march to save America is tomorrow in Washington, D.C. at the eclipse in President Park, the robocall from the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a fundraising arm of the Republican Attorney General Association said. At (1 p.m.) we will march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal. We are hoping patriots like you will join us to continue the fight to protect the integrity of our election.\n\nWatchdog group Documented posted audio of the call.\n\nSeveral Republican attorneys general have condemned the call, saying it was sent out without their knowledge, including Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, who oversees the RLDF.\n\nI was unaware of unauthorized decisions made by RLDF staff with regard to this week's rally, Marshall said in a statement. Despite currently transitioning into my role as the newly-elected chairman of RLDF, it is unacceptable that I was neither consulted about nor informed of those decisions. I have directed an internal review of this matter.\n\nMarshall also condemned the violence in his statement, saying, Those who chose to engage in violence and anarchy should and will be held accountable under the law.\n\nA spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is also Chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association, said he had no knowledge or involvement in this decision.\n\nAttorneys Generals Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Aaron Ford of Nevada, the co-chairs of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, criticized Republican attorneys general and the RLFD for the robocall, saying that they have no legal or moral ground on which to stand here: The organization paid for robocalls to recruit attendees in a Jan. 8 statement.\n\nThe DAGA co-chairs also stated that It is not enough for Republican Attorneys General to denounce the violence at the Capitol; they must publicly distance themselves from the Republican Attorneys General Association and its leadership.\n\n– Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nPentagon appoints panel to scrub Confederate names and symbols\n\nActing Defense Secretary Christopher Miller appointed a four-member commission on Friday to change the names of military bases that venerate Confederate generals.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last month vetoed the legislation that directed Miller to name the panel charged with ridding the military of Confederate idolatry. Congress, for the first time in his presidency, overrode Trump's veto by commanding majorities and approved the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nOne of Trump's principal complaints with the act was the provision to scrub the names of Confederate generals from military installations.\n\nThe United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars, Trump tweeted in June. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations. Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!\n\nRidding the armed forces of honors – such as streets and barracks named for Confederate General Robert E. Lee – has taken on new urgency within the Pentagon in the last year. Each of the services has moved to ban the display of symbols such as the Confederate Battle Flag, acknowledging that their racist association is offensive and incompatible with the diversity of their forces.\n\nThere are 10 military installations across the south from Fort Bragg in North Carolina to Fort Hood in Texas that bear the names of generals for the Confederacy who committed treason by fighting against the United States to preserve slavery.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nN. Korea threatens to build more nukes\n\nSEOUL, South Korea – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to expand his nuclear arsenal as he disclosed a list of high-tech weapons systems under development, saying the fate of relations with the United States depends on whether it abandons its hostile policy, state media reported Saturday.\n\nKim's comments during a key meeting of the ruling party this week were seen as applying pressure on the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has called Kim a thug and has criticized his summits with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying the key to establishing new relations between (North Korea) and the United States is whether the United States withdraws its hostile policy.\n\nKim said he won't use his nuclear weapons first unless threatened. He also suggested he is open to dialogue if Washington is too, but stressed North Korea must further strengthen its military and nuclear capability to cope with intensifying U.S. hostility.\n\nHe again called the U.S. his country's main enemy.\n\nWhoever takes office in the U.S., its basic nature and hostile policy will never change, he said.\n\nBiden, who will take office on Jan. 20, is unlikely to hold direct meetings with Kim unless the North Korean leader takes significant denuclearization steps.\n\n– Hyung-Jin Kim, The Associated Press
Melanie Balakit\n\nThe Tennessean\n\nNASHVILLE — Reactions came swiftly to comments made by school board member Beth Burgos on proposed revisions to the dress code policy Tuesday night at Williamson County Schools' monthly meeting.\n\nCleavage can be one of the main distractions in a learning environment, especially for male students, said Burgos, a family physician. The notion is based on scientific fact, she said.\n\nThe school board is revising the district dress code to make it more inclusive and gender-neutral.\n\nBut for some parents, discussion on tank tops and cleavage promotes the idea that females are responsible for the focus of male students.\n\nS.D. high school dress code unfairly targets girls, students and parents say\n\nI was angry. Now I'm just sad — to say she has science to back up her sexist remarks, said parent Kim Sarubbi, who raised concerns over the dress code late last year.\n\nMy husband is also a doctor. The first thing he did when he found out about her comments was find tons of research that supports the reverse of what she's saying — how interactions and experiences shape people's mind and what they believe to be their reality, Sarubbi said.\n\nShe added: Males should be responsible for their reactions, however they're not being held responsible or held to the same standards. Overwhelmingly, girls are being dress coded.\n\nDress code crackdown: N.Y. school hands out 200 detentions\n\nProposed revisions will prohibit students from showing skin from the midriff to mid-thigh. It'll also require students who wear leggings to wear an opaque top that covers the buttocks and genitalia.\n\nWhile the revised policy sets a minimum width for tank top straps, it does not mention cleavage.\n\nBurgos said the revised dress code can promote appropriate dress without shaming females.\n\nBurgos read an email she sent to a constituent Tuesday night at a school board meeting.\n\nHere's part of Burgos' email:\n\nWe as a board are committed to providing a safe and learning-focused school climate as free from distractions as possible. It is our intent to clarify through policy what is considered appropriate for students to wear to school in order to help achieve this goal.\n\nWe are early in the process and met for the first reading of the policy revision last Thursday night. Dr. Looney had met and received feedback from several shareholder groups prior to our meeting.\n\nHe was asked the question if our school administrators had any concerns with the revisions in the policy. He explained that they in fact did have two concerns: cleavage and tank tops.\n\nI agree that we needed to further address these issues. Especially the issue of cleavage because I do believe it can be one of the main distractions in a learning environment, especially for male students.\n\nMy comments have been misunderstood and misconstrued. I am not a sexist nor am I relieving males of responsibilities for their thoughts or actions. My comments were based on medical fact and directed to the gender differences that exist in male and female brains when presented with visual sexual stimuli.\n\nAs a medical doctor I can tell you that it's neuroscientific fact that male and female brains are different. It's widely acknowledged in the medical field that there are definite gender differences in brain activation and audio visual sexual stimulation. Studies have been done using functional MRIs that confirm a difference in brain activity when visually presented with certain stimuli.\n\nIt has been proven that men are more prone to physical attraction whereas women are more affected by the environment and emotions related to a sexual partner. This difference has been confirmed by scientific studies, even on adolescent brains.\n\nWhen adolescent boys were studied with functional MRIs, brain activity was very high in response to visual sexual stimuli. This was not the case for adolescent girls.\n\nSo you see my comments are not meant to be degrading in any way towards our female students. Nor do I hold male students in low regard. It is important, however, to keep these neuroscientific facts in mind when developing dress codes and when teaching our students about appropriate dress in the classroom.\n\nIt is never okay to say that a woman deserves to be raped because of what she's wearing. It is all together another thing to teach our young ladies the sexual response that occurs in a male's brain when he sees part of the female body exposed.\n\nWith that knowledge, I believe our female students would want to be more aware of how their dress could potentially distract their male counterparts and be willing to promote a learning focused school environment by dressing accordingly. This can and will be done in a way that does not shame our female students.\n\nWilliamson County Director of Schools Mike Looney said he sought to revise the district dress code after a parent claimed a school's dress code unfairly targeted female students.\n\nLooney said he has not reflected on Burgos' comments, but was thankful for the diversity of opinions on the school board.\n\nI'm absolutely confident as we continue this journey towards a more perfect dress code, we'll come up with language that people by and large will find acceptable, he said.\n\nI would encourage everybody to let this process run its course, and continue to give input, he said.\n\nAlthough not directed solely toward female students, school board member Dan Cash said the district policy should have minimum length requirements for pants, shorts and skirts. Proposed revisions say all bottoms must hit at least mid-thigh.\n\nThe school board will review the policy several times before a final vote. The board approved the first reading of the revisions Tuesday night.\n\nFollow Melanie Balakit on Twitter: @MelanieBalakit
WASHINGTON — Where is Mike Pence?\n\nAs Washington absorbed, dissected and speculated about a new tell-all book on the Trump administration, one main character has been missing from the dishy details about top aides and confidants at war with each other while deriding the intelligence of the commander in chief.\n\nVice President Pence runs a tight-knit operation, and his — and his aides' — lips apparently remained sealed around author Michael Wolff.\n\nLittle leaked out of the Pence side of the White House, Wolff wrote in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\n\nWolff calls Pence a cipher, a smiling presence either resisting his own obvious power or unable to seize it.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has called the book complete fantasy and just full of tabloid gossip.\n\nPence's spokeswoman said the vice president is focused on promoting the president's agenda.\n\nWe are not focusing at all on a fictional book written by a gossip columnist masquerading as a journalist, press secretary Alyssa Farah said in a statement.\n\nPence's relative absence from the book has been noted on social media.\n\nAn Indiana Republican who knows Pence has a positive view on why Pence is largely absent from the book.\n\nMy takeaway from Wolff excerpts is what isn't said: When everyone else in the West Wing is busy fighting amongst themselves, where is Mike Pence? He was busy stocking administration with Hoosiers and ideological allies, trying to ensure long term success of conservative policy, tweeted Trevor Foughty, a former spokesman for the Indiana Republican Party.\n\nWhat Wolff does include about Pence is likely to continue the debate over how he has been able to stay largely unscathed by the chaos and dysfunction in the White House, particularly in its early months. Is Pence canny enough to navigate the roiling waters, or is his profile low because he's a non-entity?\n\nWolff offers this favorable assessment from Katie Walsh, a former deputy chief of staff to Trump, who saw the vice president's office as a point of calm in the storm. Pence's aides returned calls quickly, accomplished tasks easily, liked each other and were dedicated to eliminating as much friction as possible around the vice president, according to the book.\n\nPence himself, Wolff wrote, used extreme self-effacement to solve the riddle of how to serve as the junior partner to a president who could not tolerate any kind of comparisons.\n\nPence, Walsh is quoted as saying, is not dumb. (Walsh has said she did not make statements in the book attributed to her.)\n\nWhile Pence's stay-in-the-shadows approach may work with Trump, his extreme submissiveness struck some as suspicious, Wolff wrote in a section on how the Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner faction in the White House viewed Pence.\n\nThose allied with former chief of staff Reince Priebus liked that Pence was one of the few West Wing figures who treated Priebus as if he actually was chief of staff. Yet, Wolff adds this dig from that side: Pence often seemed like a mere staffer, the ever present note taker in so many meetings.\n\nAnd the third competing faction in the early White House — Steve Bannon, the chief strategist who the White House says gave Wolff access to the administration — had only contempt for Pence, according to the book.\n\nPence is like the husband in Ozzie and Harriet, a nonevent, the book quotes one Bannonite saying.\n\nAfter Bannon observed a hapless Pence, in a lot of wrong meetings regarding the Russia investigation, he helped to bring Nick Ayers in as Pence's chief of staff and get Pence — our fallback guy — out around the world to look like a vice president.\n\nAlthough many saw him as a vice president who might well assume the presidency someday, he was also perceived as the weakest vice president in decades, Wolff wrote, and, in organizational terms, an empty suit who was useless in the daily effort to help restrain the president and stabilize the West Wing.\n\nA note: Wolff himself said that the details in the book are in conflict with one another and that many are baldly untrue. In some cases, he said the reader would be allowed to judge the versions told to him. For other details, he settled on a version of events I believe to be true.
AP\n\nBOSTON (AP) — Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy calls President Donald Trump's travel ban scary and mentioned Japanese internment and Hitler's treatment of Jews while criticizing the policy.\n\nThe order temporarily suspends immigration from seven majority Muslim countries. On Monday in Boston, Van Gundy told reporters: It's starting to get really, really scary stuff now. We're getting into the days of, now we're judging people by their religion — trying to keep Muslims out.\n\nHe added: We're getting back to the days of, you know, putting the Japanese in relocation camps, and Hitler registering the Jews.\n\nThe Pistons play at Boston on Monday night.
WASHINGTON — World leaders and diplomats see President Trump as unpredictable — and that's not a bad thing for U.S. foreign policy, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Sunday.\n\nHaley said on ABC's This Week that leaders around the world are absolutely glued to Trump's tweets.\n\nBut they see him as unpredictable, she said. That's probably the overwhelming feeling that I see.\n\nAnd that has benefits, she said.\n\nI think they don't know what the U.S. is going to do at any given time, and so for that reason they're getting much more cautious and they're paying attention to how they work with us, she said. So, you know, we've got a ways to go, but it's not a bad thing, it's really not.\n\nHaley said the prospect of nuclear war with North Korea is a very dangerous situation and she defended Trump's tweet taunting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un over who has more nuclear power.\n\nWe want to always remind them we can destroy you too, so be very cautious and careful with your words and what you do, she said. I know it's something that makes people nervous but if we didn't do it, we would be in a more dangerous...\n\nAs for Trump's tweet, she said, I think that he always has to keep Kim on his toes. It's very important that we don't ever let him get so arrogant that he doesn't realize the reality of what would happen if he started a nuclear war.
Johnny C. Taylor Jr.\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, is tackling your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.\n\nThe questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers below have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHave a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you'd like me to answer? Submit it here.\n\nQuestion: My office will not be reopening for the foreseeable future. Before we shut down, the office gym was popular among employees. Since it's no longer open, how can my company provide more health and wellness benefits? What are some examples? – Anonymous\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr.: Your question is spot on. A major part of creating a positive workplace culture is ensuring employers are supporting their workers both physically and mentally.\n\nAs we welcome a new year, there are several things employers can do to provide health and wellness benefits – and the good news is, they are likely already in place. After all, 58% of organizations offered general wellness programs in 2019.\n\nHow to work out in 2021:Some back at the gym, but many use fitness apps, online classes\n\nStep one is to look at your health insurance and employee assistance programs. Even in these strange times, I imagine there are plenty of virtual wellness options to choose from. While you mentioned your office gym is closed, employee assistance programs may offer exercise and wellness classes like virtual boot camps or yoga as well as cooking and nutrition classes.\n\nIf you and your colleagues are missing the office camaraderie, like so many of us are, you could also suggest fun, health-focused activities like a step contest or a healthy cooking competition.\n\nGoing further, I cannot highlight the importance of access to mental health services enough. Employee assistance programs often include resources that connect employees with a provider for their mental and emotional health needs. With 41% of workers feeling burned out as a result of the pandemic, these resources can help employees navigate these incredibly challenging times through additional psychological services.\n\nIf your employer doesn't – or can't – provide such a program, ask your HR team if they can compile resources and information from your local health department to share with employees.\n\nIf you really want to make your health and wellness program unique to your workforce, survey those who know it best: employees. An employee poll can reveal what sparks their interest.\n\nI'm willing to bet you'll get plenty of responses to help you determine the kind of benefits best suited for them. Some may even have recommendations and referrals you might have overlooked.\n\nWhatever you decide, don't forget to measure their engagement to help you refine your program throughout the year. Good luck on what I'm certain will be the start of a healthy journey for your organization!\n\nInformational interview:How do I ask for one without sounding awkward? Ask HR\n\nDiscrimination:Is my workplace being ageist? Ask HR\n\nQ: Our company policy is that everyone must wear a mask while in the building, even at your desk. I have one supervisor who pulls his mask off while at his desk and has his nose uncovered when walking through the office. As the HR Manager, I have spoken to him about the need for the personal protective equipment. This seems to only last as long as HR is in the vicinity. How should I handle this situation? – Anonymous\n\nTaylor.: The answer is in your question – it's your company's policy to wear a mask when inside the workplace. Unless there is a legitimate health or safety reason, or a sincerely held religious belief, everyone at the worksite should comply.\n\nAs an HR Manager, you know this: Organizations must provide a reasonably safe environment for their workforce. But we can't create a hazard-free workspace if there's no follow-through. The policy is therule for a reason, and if employees aren't getting the message, employers may need to reinforce measures to ensure a healthy worksite, up to and including disciplinary measures.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says employers can mandate employees to wear masks or other protective clothing, such as gloves and gowns, during a pandemic – something many employers are considering. In fact, 86% of organizations are implementing or considering the required use of personal protective equipment.\n\nMasks are also recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and certain states and municipalities have their own mask requirement laws.\n\nThere are, of course, exceptions to the rule. Accommodations may be necessary under the American with Disabilities Act for employees with disabilities or sincerely held religious beliefs that prevent them from wearing a mask.\n\nIt sounds like you've already taken the steps to speak to this employee. Continue to respectfully, but firmly, stress the importance of wearing a mask at the worksite. It's not just a single employee that could be impacted, but the entire organization. The HR team can continue to communicate your company's policy on masks through emails, signs around the office, and verbally during meetings.\n\nYou mention that this person is a supervisor, but supervisors must lead by example. When leaders refuse to wear masks, it sends a message to the whole team that it might be acceptable when that's not the reality of your company.\n\nMay your team remain safe in the new year!
A newly elected state lawmaker from South Florida wants Palm Beach County to take on President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club for its New Year's Eve bash, at which many patrons and performers were seen without masks.\n\nState Rep. Omari Hardy, D-Lake Worth Beach, wrote a letter Friday evening to Todd Bonlarron, assistant county administrator for Palm Beach County, asking whether the county will take action against the private club for violating a countywide mandatory mask policy.\n\nI recognize that the President is a powerful person and that his business, Mar-a-Lago is a daunting target for enforcement, Hardy wrote in an email that included a link to a Twitter post from the party that showed people without masks. But as far as I know, the law still applies to the President and to his business.\n\nHardy was a Lake Worth Beach City commissioner before resigning and being elected to the Florida state House in November.\n\nIn case you missed it: Mar-a-Lago New Year's part goes on without Trump\n\nAnd: Neighbors to Trump: You're not welcome here\n\nTrump left South Florida on Dec. 31, before that evening's Mar-a-Lago event, which featured performers Vanilla Ice and members of the Beach Boys.\n\nA message left Sunday morning for Mar-a-Lago Managing Director Bernd Lembcke was not immediately returned.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis extended an executive order last month that bans local governments from enforcing mask mandates with fines against individuals, but some counties and municipalities are trying to sidestep the rule.\n\nAccording to a Sarasota Herald-Tribune story last month, the city of Tampa, as well as Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, said they would issue $500 fines to business that allow customers to go maskless.\n\nPalm Beach County Administrator Verdenia Baker recently responded to concerns about a mostly maskless gathering of 2,000 high school and college students at the Palm Beach County Convention Center for Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit.\n\nShe said the group, which is pro-Trump, had oversold the event, but an event spokesman said that wasn't true.\n\nThe Town of Palm Beach issued an alert in late December asking people to be cautious on New Year's Eve and to abide by the county's mask mandate.\n\nTown Council President Maggie Zeidman said at the time she was concerned that some organizations and clubs had chosen to go ahead with their New Year's Eve plans.\n\nI think that's all going to come back and bite us eventually. People know the message: wearing masks, not congregating with people you don't live with, keeping a distance from others, wash your hands and don't touch your face. So it's either they don't want to believe it can happen to them, or they reject the concept of the pandemic altogether, Zeidman said.\n\nHardy doesn't mention the Turning Point event in his letter, but said he is concerned about the Mar-a-Lago staff and the people they encounter — and presumably might infect — after the event.\n\nIt is for them that we should see to it that our mask order is enforced and that potential super-spreader events like this are kept form happening, Hardy said.\n\nFollow Kimberly Miller on Twitter @Kmillerweather
Mark Cussen\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nIf you've been working for a couple of decades or more, then you're probably thinking about the day when you'll be able to clock out for the last time and start living life on your own terms. Retirement represents a huge change in your lifestyle and your financial situation, so if you want to enjoy it to the fullest, you'll need to do some serious planning and saving before you make the leap.\n\nIf you're near the finish line and thinking of retiring within the next five years, then first make sure you can answer yes to the three questions below.\n\n1. Are your retirement savings on track?\n\nIf you have been saving diligently for many years and have reaped the growth of the stock market over that time, then you should have a sizable balance saved in your retirement accounts. If your savings are minimal or nonexistent, then you will probably need to continue working for more than five years -- and ramp up your retirement savings as well.\n\nSo how do you know when you have enough money saved up? Start by figuring out how much annual income you'll need in retirement (for most people, it's about 70% to 80% of their pre-retirement income). Then subtract the yearly income you expect to receive from Social Security (you can get an estimate by creating an account at SSA.gov), a pension, or any other income source besides your retirement savings. What remains is the amount of income your retirement savings will have to provide. If you have enough money saved up to provide that income for as long as you expect to live, then you're in pretty good shape. For context, if you plan to retire around age 65, many experts say your savings should be sufficient to provide at least 25 years' worth of income.\n\nIt is wise to enlist the help of a financial planner when estimating your future income needs, as planners can take all of your financial information and plug it into a sophisticated program that incorporates historical market returns and other factors such as your tax bracket, Social Security and pension benefits, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.\n\n2. Is your portfolio allocated correctly?\n\nIf you are nearing retirement and your portfolio is invested almost exclusively in stocks, then it's probably time to start moving some of that money into safer alternatives such as bonds or annuities. Stocks can provide a greater rate of growth over time, but they can also result in large losses when a bear market hits. And this is something that you can't afford if you plan to retire in five years, as it may take longer than that to recoup your losses (as many investors have discovered since the bear market in 2008). A good rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 110, turn the result into a percentage, and allocate at least that much of your portfolio to bonds and similarly safe investments. For example, if you're 65, then you should have at least 45% of your portfolio invested in safer investments.\n\nThat said, no matter your age, you'll want at least 25% of your portfolio in equities in order to maintain a hedge against inflation.\n\n3. Are you prepared to pay for long-term care expenses?\n\nAlthough this issue won't likely arise in the next five years, it is still something you need to prepare for before you retire. Long-term care expenses can devastate even the best-laid retirement plans if you lack insurance coverage or dedicated funds to pay for them. Although the cost of long-term care can vary considerably depending upon the level of care you need and where you live, it can easily cost $50,000 to $100,000 a year or more.And the average stay in a nursing home generally lasts about two-and-a-half years.\n\nOne of the latest innovations in the life insurance industry is the introduction of policies that have accelerated benefit riders allowing the policy holder to access some or all of the death benefit in order to pay for expenses related to disability or long-term care. This can be a more economical way to insure yourself against the high cost of this form of care.\n\nThese are just some of the questions you'll need to be able to answer if you would like to retire in the next five years. If you are unsure of whether you are prepared to retire in the next five years, find a financial advisor who can provide you with advice on when you can safely retire and what you need to do to prepare.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

But a handful of little-known Social Security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $15,834 more... each year!

China isn't the only Asian country challenging America's status as the world's largest economy.\n\nBy 2030, the U.S. will fall to third place behind China and India in a ranking of the leading global economies, while Indonesia rises to fourth place, according to a report this week by London-based Standard Chartered Bank. The study measures gross domestic product after adjusting for lower consumer prices and a lower standard of living in emerging markets such as China.\n\nBy that measure, known as purchasing power parity, China passed the U.S. as the world's biggest economy in 2014, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF says China could top the U.S. even under the more conventional comparison that looks at nominal GDP by 2030.\n\nThe reshuffling of the world's economic superpowers is already reverberating in the U.S. It's at least partly behind President Trumps' trade war with China. And China's growing economic impact is increasingly affecting the earnings of American companies like Apple, as well as the broader stock market and economy.\n\nChina's rising economic and geopolitical influence poses important challenges to U.S. global dominance, says Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and former head of the IMF's China division.\n\nBy 2030, seven of the world's top 10 economies will be emerging markets — China, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Egypt and Russia. That's up from four that were emerging markets in 2010 and a projected six in 2020, the Standard Chartered report says.\n\nSince 2010, the share of global GDP made up by the U.S., the euro area and Japan has fallen from 51 percent to 46 percent while the share comprised by Asia has risen from 20 percent to 28 percent.\n\nBy 2030, those developed countries' portion of GDP will fall to 40 percent while Asia's will increase to 35 percent.\n\nMore:Government workers tighten belts, brace for first missing paychecks during shutdown\n\nMore:Businesses offer furlough freebies, shutdown specials and assistance to federal workers\n\nMore:From California to New York, states are raising minimum wages in 2019 for 17 million workers\n\nSimply put, each country's share of global GDP will begin to align with its population, the study says. For years, the U.S. effectively punched above its weight – using better worker productivity, or output, to churn out more products and services than larger countries.\n\nBut the emerging markets are now investing more in factory machines and other labor-saving technology, allowing them to catch up. That's largely because of a fast-growing middle-class and a massive migration of residents to cities in the developing countries, the report says. By 2030, 5.4 billion people will be middle-class, up from 3 billion in 2015, with Asia's share of that group widening from 46 percent to 65 percent, according to Standard Chartered and the Brookings Institution. The size of the middle class in the U.S. and Europe is expected to be roughly stable.\n\nMeanwhile, two-thirds of the world population will live in cities by 2030, up from 52 percent in 2010, the study says, citing the United Nations.\n\nChina's growing economic power is part of the reason Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports in a bid to narrow the nation's trade gap with China, the report says.\n\nAnd Apple this month lowered its earnings forecast because of falling sales in China amid the country's recent economic slowdown, an announcement that sent the broader market plunging.\n\nYet Trump's retreat from global alliances – highlighted by his withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- has emboldened China to take a bigger role on the world political and economic stage. It has become a major investor in infrastructure in Africa, Central Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\n\nThe recent U.S. retreat from multilateralism, and from international engagement more broadly, has given China more room to expand its influence, Prasad says.
MADISON, Wis. — It happens every day: Emergency clinicians administer life-saving care to patients suffering from opioid overdoses.\n\nNow physicians, counselors and agencies in Wisconsin are considering anti-addiction drugs as a first response in emergency rooms. Most emergency clinicians want to expand such medication-assisted treatment (or MAT), according to Wisconsin's chapter of American College of Emergency Physicians.\n\nIt weighs on you driving home after a night shift and someone didn't make it, knowing society could have intervened and helped, said Bobby Redwood, an emergency and preventive medicine physician.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment is a proven method for successfully treating substance abuse disorders by combining anti-craving medicines such as buprenorphine or methadone with supportive counseling and behavioral therapy.\n\nAnti-addiction drugs such as buprenorphine, a narcotic also referred to as suboxone, can diminish withdrawal symptoms for a patient in detox — an otherwise uncomfortable and challenging experience.\n\nA lot of the work we're doing is figuring out: What does a community need to become buprenorphine ready and medication-assisted treatment ready? said Redwood, a former president of American College of Emergency Physicians's Wisconsin chapter.\n\nMore overdoses than ever\n\nMore people died nationwide of drug overdoses in 2017 than ever before — a staggering 10 percent increase in deaths compared to 2016. A high concentration of those deaths occurred in mid-Atlantic states and Midwestern ones like Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin saw a 35 percent increase in fatal opioid overdoses between 2015 and 2016. Emergency department visits for overdoses were the highest in the nation, with an astounding 109 percent increase between 2016 and 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut tough obstacles and many miles often separate those suffering with opioid addiction from reaching outpatient programs that provide medication-assisted treatment or a clinician who can prescribe buprenorphine.\n\nFor those vulnerable and in underserved areas, the ER is often the only access to health care, said Gail D'Onofrio, a professor of emergency medicine at Yale School of Medicine, in a statement.\n\nD'Onofrio and her team received a grant of nearly $820,000 last year to develop a way for ERs to administer buprenorphine and overcome bureaucratic and medical barriers to implementation.\n\nIn a landmark study in 2015, D'Onofrio found patients who started on buprenorphine out of the emergency room were twice as likely to stick with treatment — and therefore twice as likely to avoid overdose —compared to those who received only references to local clinics.\n\nMore:Opioids kill kids, too – through accidental overdose, suicide and homicide\n\nToo few clinicians\n\nWisconsin also has a significant shortage of substance abuse disorder counselors, which has resulted in treatment programs and clinics unable to fill jobs, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent research organization.\n\nPrior to 2017, only physicians could prescribe buprenorphine and similar MAT drugs.\n\nTo close this gap, Gov. Scott Walker signed a measure into law allowing physician assistants and nurse practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine if they completed additional training.\n\nOpponents of medication-assisted treatment point to the controversy of treating drug addiction with other drugs. Critics say MAT focuses on substituting one drug for another rather than advocating abstinence and that anti-addiction drugs have potential for abuse.\n\nAs a schedule 3 drug, there is a fairly low chance people will become addicted to buprenorphine, according to Toni Simonson, executive director of HSHS Western Wisconsin and Prevea Behavioral Care.\n\nIt's different than prescribing for pain, Simonson said. It's prescribing for addiction.\n\nPhysician assistants and nurse practitioners have a unique opportunity to identify people with substance abuse disorders who come into their primary care offices or emergency rooms, according to Sam Spencer, a PA working in addiction medicine.\n\nThere's a lot of little towns and physician assistants in the ER who understand addiction and want to do the best for their patients, which is starting them on suboxone, Spencer said.\n\nAlthough some states are experimenting with buprenorphine as an emergency service, implementing something similar in Wisconsin may take longer.\n\nTo administer medication-assisted treatment, emergency departments must follow clinical protocols to ensure patients receive the behavioral or counseling component of treatment.\n\nOn its own, buprenorphine is not as effective at treating addiction if a patient can't follow up with a behavioral health counselor.\n\nI think a lot of our workforce feels hamstrung because they don't have those behavioral health and primary care follow up resources, said Redwood, the emergency and preventive medicine physician.\n\nNot because they're not motivated, but because it doesn't exist in their county.\n\nEmergency room providers are also concerned that incorporating addiction services could draw more people detoxing to an already crowded ER.\n\nMore:Nurse prescribed 'colossal' amount of opioids, kept license, state says\n\nOne idea: Require a follow-up\n\nMelissa Malloy, PA at Waukesha Memorial Hospital and an ardent supporter of such treatment, says it can take hours to treat patients in withdrawal, which fills up beds needed by patients suffering heart attacks or strokes.\n\nIn general, we try everything we can to keep people out of the ER, Malloy said. Because we see so many non-emergent situations in the ER and, truth be told, opioid withdrawal isn't a life-threatening issue.\n\nMalloy suggests ER providers adopt a policy requiring patients to follow up with an addictionologist for further MAT within a set number of days to discourage coming back to the ER for additional prescriptions.\n\nIn December, the ER at ProHealth Oconomowoc Memorial Hospital did just that.\n\nA patient in withdrawal at Oconomowoc's ER was assessed and started on medication-assisted treatment with a dose of suboxone. He was referred to a program at Rogers Memorial Hospital the next day.\n\nThough other hospitals may operate on the similar model, there is currently no cohesive state-wide plan for implementing MAT.\n\nRedwood cites the need to secure funding and create a unified strategy.\n\nOur workforce is ready and willing and anxious to adapt a statewide plan, he said.\n\nMore:More teens vape, but binge drinking and opioid use are down
AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Some weary players sat shirtless on changeovers, ice-filled towels draped around their necks. Others retreated to any bit of shade they could find on court and sought treatment for blistered feet and heat stress.\n\nTemperatures soared to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) as the start of an expected heat wave hit the Australian Open on Thursday, bringing misery to players unfortunate enough to have their matches scheduled during the day session and keeping many spectators away.\n\nI didn't expect to play this kind of match, a thoroughly exhausted Juan Martin del Potro said after beating Karen Khachanov in a nearly four-hour, second-round match. I prefer to watch on TV. Or stay on the beach, drinking some beer.\n\nScorching temperatures are common at the Australian Open — so much so the tournament has an extreme heat policy that allows for the referee to close the roofs on the three main show courts and suspend play on the outer courts when temperatures surpass 40 Celsius.\n\nMatches weren't halted Thursday as the highs stayed just below 40 Celsius for much of the day, but that doesn't mean the heat didn't cause issues for the players.\n\nGael Monfils, for one, staggered through a good portion of his second-round match against Novak Djokovic, bending over repeatedly to catch his breath between points and at one stage returning to the comfort of his shaded chair without even attempting to return Djokovic's serve.\n\nAfterwards, he called the conditions risky for the players, especially with the new rule restricting the time between points to 25 seconds.\n\nI get super dizzy. I think I have a small heat stroke for 40 minutes, said Monfils, who is considered one of the fittest players on tour. At that time, the officials have to make a move. Maybe wait a little bit, whatever, five minutes between the set. Maybe they have to do small adjustment.\n\nDjokovic agreed, describing the conditions brutal and some of the toughest he's ever played in.\n\nThere are certain days where you just have to, as a tournament supervisor, recognize that you might need to give players few extra hours until (the temperature) comes down, he said. I understand there is a factor of tickets. If you don't play matches, people will be unhappy.\n\nBut he said the conditions were at the point where it becomes a danger in terms of health.\n\nThere were no retirements due to the heat on Day 4, however, and some players were even unfazed by the conditions.\n\nTaiwan's Hsieh Su-wei saw the heat as a benefit in her second-round upset of Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza.\n\nI know the weather is going to be a little bit tough today, she said. I was thinking, 'Ah, I'm from Asia. I maybe can handle it better than other girls.'\n\nMuguruza did have to stop at one point to wrap her feet to prevent blistering from the hot court.\n\nI think the surface of the court, I don't know how much heat, (but) it's terrible, she said. Very, very hot.\n\nAs for recovery, nearly every player mentioned taking an ice bath, but Hsieh had a different approach. Acupuncture, she said. Not my favorite ... but it helps a lot. And also do the massage. And eat some nice food.\n\nWith the weather expected to be hotter on Friday, with highs of 42 Celsius (108 Fahrenheit) in the forecast, Monfils had a message for players scheduled to be on court.\n\nHonestly, good luck for the, players, he said. Just be smart. If you have to give up, you know, it's not a shame.
CHICAGO – Bodycam videos released by a local activist Tuesday show how a Chicago police officer drove into a woman more than a year ago, knocking her to the ground and crushing her leg beneath the SUV for more than eight minutes as she bled in the street.\n\nThe incident happened the night of Nov. 13, 2019 in the city's South Shore neighborhood. Resident Martina Standley, 32, suffered a traumatic head injury and severe leg injury, according to her attorney, Andrew Stroth.\n\nAccording to local reports at the time, witnesses said Standley had been taunting the officers, who drove toward her.\n\nThe videos begin without audio as the police SUV pulls up to a sidewalk and pauses. Standley can be seen approaching the right-hand side of the vehicle, from the sidewalk. Standley appears to touch the car, and the driver appears to start the vehicle. Standley falls down out of view, and the driver stops the car and walks around to the other side.\n\nGirl aint nobody hit you like that, the driver says as he looks down at Standley, who lies motionless on the road, her leg under the front right tire and blood pooling around her head. The officer begins exclaiming in curses and yells, Squad can I get an EMS over here.\n\nAnjanette Young:Chicago lawyers attempted to block release of video showing police handcuffing innocent, naked woman\n\nBodycam video from a second officer in the vehicle appears to show the first officer pace near Standley, periodically prodding her. Several more police vehicles arrive, and officers block off the area with caution tape. Officers tell Standley to remain still and tell her that an ambulance is on the way.\n\nStandley was rushed to the University of Chicago Medical Center in critical condition. She spent time in the ICU and was transferred to a rehabilitation research hospital.\n\nPeople said it was like the sound of a gunshot – her head smashed on the ground, Stroth said. To this day, a year and several months later, she's still undergoing therapy and treatment for her injury. Martina Standley will never be the same person she was prior to this accident. She hasn't been able to go to work. She's still getting rehab. And that's due, we believe, to the head trauma.\n\nStroth filed suit against the city and the two officers involved within days of the incident and received the bodycam videos in September. The case is in discovery, and Standley was expected to give her deposition next week, Stroth said.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, community organizer William Calloway – who along with independent journalists led the push to get Chicago officials to release the video of the police shooting of Laquan McDonald – filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the videos. He received them in November, when a Cook County judge ordered the department to satisfy the request.\n\nThe incident took place in my community, our neighborhood of South Shore. I was getting conflicting reports, so I took it upon myself to file the request, Calloway said. It took about a year. The City of Chicago did make us fight for the release of the bodycam video. It wasn't something they willfully did. They claimed a four-year exemption that did not meet the criteria, and the judge agreed with us.\n\nThe Civilian Office of Police Accountability, the police department's civilian oversight agency, opened an investigation into the incident on Nov. 21, 2019. The agency initially determined that Standley approached the officers in their vehicle and that the officers were not engaged in police action and the incident did not involve a use of force, meaning the video was not authorized for release under city policy, the agency said in a statement.\n\nStroth, however, argues the officers did use force. An officer with the Chicago Police Department weaponized his 4,700 pound patrol vehicle and ran over Martina Standley, an unarmed and innocent 32-year-old Black woman, he said.\n\nThe COPA investigation is ongoing. The officers involved in the incident remain on full-duty status while the investigation continues, the Chicago Police Department said, offering no further comment.\n\nAsked about the incident in a press conference Tuesday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was unfamiliar with the matter.\n\nThe video release Tuesday comes as Lightfoot's administration faces scrutiny for its handling of a February 2019 police raid at the home of Anjanette Young, an innocent social worker who had just returned home from work and undressed when police officers executing a search warrant entered the wrong home and handcuffed her. Last month, city lawyers attempted to stop the release of bodycam video of the incident.\n\nLightfoot has faced criticism for her changing narratives around what she knew about the Young case and when. She had a private meeting with Young last week and said she had apologized to her.\n\nSimilar to the Anjanette Young case, it took the City of Chicago several months to release the video evidence, Stroth said. It's imperative that Mayor Lightfoot, Supt. David Brown and the Law Department take steps to make sure videos are released in a timely fashion and that Chicago police officers are trained to value the sanctity of life.\n\nStroth said Standley wanted people to see the video of the incident so that the officers involved would be held responsible.
Ilan Berman\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy, it's already clear that one of the biggest differences between the outgoing Trump administration and the incoming Biden team will be Iran. In contrast to the current U.S. policy of maximum pressure toward the Islamic Republic, President-elect Joe Biden and his advisers have already promised a more conciliatory approach centered around a revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.\n\nBut what about Iran's role as the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism? That's a title the Iranian regime has held since the U.S. government began formally keeping track of terrorist trends since 1984. Nevertheless, American attention to the issue has waxed and waned over the years in tandem with the priorities of successive administrations in Washington. The present White House, though, sees it as a major issue — and, in its final days in office, is working to make sure that the next one does as well.\n\nIran's ongoing relationship with al-Qaida\n\nThat was the broader context behind Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's Tuesday address at the National Press Club, in which the Trump administration's top diplomat outlined the deep and ongoing connections between Iran and al-Qaida. These connections, Pompeo contended, reflect a partnership that has provided strategic benefits to both parties and has been a major reason behind al-Qaida's continued relevance in recent years.\n\nOver the past half-decade, he noted, Iran's notorious Ministry of Intelligence and Security as well as its feared clerical army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have provided safe haven and logistical support to the Bin Laden network, and as a result the group's leadership has now become centralized in the Islamic Republic. Indeed, it was precisely this arrangement that made it possible for al-Qaida's second-in-command, Abu Muhammad al-Masri, to gain sanctuary in Tehran, where he was targeted and killed last August, ostensibly by Israeli operatives.\n\nMiddle East:Biden's Defense pick is no civilian. But maybe he could help us leave the Middle East.\n\nThe end result is nothing short of a game changer in counterterrorism terms. For American allies in the region, who could be targeted by Iran and al-Qaida working in tandem, the implications of this development are undoubtedly dire. But the Iran-al-Qaida partnership also represents a danger to the nascent normalization wave between Israel and the Arab states — the momentum of which could be blunted if al-Qaida, with Iranian backing, takes serious steps to destabilize the region anew.\n\nShiite and Sunni radicals work together\n\nAt bottom, though, the contention outlined by Pompeo is hardly new. For years, counterterrorism experts have questioned the conventional wisdom that Shiite and Sunni radicals simply cannot and do not cooperate. As proof that the opposite is true, they have pointed to things like past collusion between al-Qaida and Lebanon's terrorist powerhouse, Hezbollah, as well as Shiite Iran's longstanding sponsorship of Hamas, the Islamist group that serves as the Palestinian branch of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood movement.\n\nYet the idea that Iran doesn't make common cause with Sunni extremists has proved to be a stubborn one and still holds sway in many corners — much to the detriment of a proper understanding of Iranian regime behavior. In the wake of Pompeo's presentation, which included reference to official intelligence assessments as well as publicly known instances of Iran-al-Qaida cooperation, that fiction should become more difficult to sustain.\n\nBiden and the Middle East:Joe Biden should go slow on Afghanistan. We need patience in this peace process.\n\nThe main thrust of the presentation, however, was undoubtedly political. The revelations put forth by Pompeo create some hard choices for the Biden camp. Short of simply disregarding these connections, the new White House will be at pains to explain why it remains eager to restart negotiations with Iran — and how it can do so without empowering precisely this sort of continued rogue behavior on Tehran's part.\n\nWe ignore this Iran-al-Qaida nexus at our own peril, Pompeo urged. We need to acknowledge it. We must confront it. Indeed, we must defeat it.\n\nIt's clear, though, that such an effort is no longer within the power of the Trump administration to prosecute. The onus now falls to its successor to tell us whether it will — and, if so, how.\n\nIlan Berman is senior vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council. Follow him on Twitter: @ilanberman
Heidi M. Przybyla\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Former Senate majority leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., received the Congressional Gold Medal Wednesday in recognition of the former presidential candidate's service as a soldier, legislator and statesman.\n\nDuring a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, Dole was presented Congress' highest civilian honor by President Trump, Vice President Pence and Senate and House leaders.\n\nHe has never stopped earning his place in the pages of American history, said Trump, citing Dole's grievous injuries sustained in World War II that required numerous surgeries. He knows about grit and learned the values of loyalty, integrity, faith and hard work.\n\nI am extremely honored to accept this great honor, said Dole, speaking from a wheelchair. His wife, Elizabeth Dole, also a former U.S. senator, then read a prepared speech that emphasized taking the long view of American leadership, including the need for compromise.\n\nEvery politician accepts the need for compromise from time to time. This is how the American Republic was built, Dole said, also giving a nod to veterans buried at Arlington Cemetery who spoke many tongues and practiced many faiths but sacrificed their lives together in defense of American democracy.\n\nDole, 94, was the only former GOP presidential nominee to endorse Trump during his 2016 campaign.\n\nDole served 35 years in Congress, mostly in the Senate, where he served as Republican leader for nearly 11 years. He was the Republican Party's 1996 presidential nominee, losing to then-president Bill Clinton. He later joined with his former Senate Democratic rival Tom Daschle to help found the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.\n\nFew Americans have demonstrated the kind of courage that Bob Dole has, said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the second-ranking House Democrat.\n\nHoyer cited valor for bravery displayed on the battlefields of World War II and Dole's conviction in standing up for his beliefs as a legislator. Dole was permanently wounded by German machine gun fire in April 1945 and never recovered the use of his right arm. He later helped enact the Americans with Disabilities Act, in the face of opposition of some within his party.\n\nBob Dole always stood by what is just and what is right. He was a resounding voice for the hungry and he was a resounding voice for those with disabilities, said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nBecause of you, America is much better.\n\nMore:Bob Dole: 'Trump's going to make a great president'
USA TODAY\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, is expected to leave his job at the Justice Department after the expected confirmation of William Barr as attorney general.\n\nMueller investigation once again in jeopardy\n\nBy Paul Seamus Ryan\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's plan to resign from the Justice Department, after expected Senate confirmation this month of President Donald Trump's attorney general nominee William Barr, adds new urgency to the need for Congress to take steps to protect special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nFor nearly two years, Rosenstein has filled a critically important role at the Justice Department: overseeing and safeguarding the independence of Mueller's investigation of Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election — and possible obstruction of the investigation by Trump.\n\nWe believe Trump has interfered with and obstructed the Russia investigation since its inception. The investigation was initially overseen by former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump abruptly fired in May 2017. Trump also criticized and eventually fired former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation due to his own role on the Trump campaign and numerous meetings with Russian officials during the campaign. Since Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel, Trump has relentlessly criticized Rosenstein for allowing the investigation to continue.\n\nTalker:Donald Trump's credibility put to the test, yet again\n\nSign-up for Today's Talker newsletter here\n\nNow, Trump has nominated Barr to be our nation's next attorney general. Last year, Barr sent an unsolicited memo to Rosenstein at the Justice Department criticizing Mueller's investigation into whether Trump unlawfully obstructed justice when he fired Comey.\n\nWith Mueller's strongest defender out of the way and Barr installed as attorney general, Trump may finally succeed in firing Mueller and shutting down an investigation that has produced nearly three dozen criminal indictments or guilty pleas and multiple convictions.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order and public faith in the U.S. democratic process with a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\n\nMueller's investigation of those attacks must be allowed to continue, following the evidence wherever it leads. The American people are entitled to answers and accountability. A bipartisan group of senators is reintroducing legislation to protect the Mueller investigation — legislation that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked last year. Americans are closely watching how Congress will respond to the pending threats to the Mueller investigation with Barr's nomination and Rosenstein's departure.\n\nWith the 2020 presidential election on the horizon, we must put country before party to hold accountable those who undermined the 2016 election and to protect the integrity of our future elections. No less than our democracy is at stake.\n\nPaul Seamus Ryan is the vice president of policy and litigation for Common Cause. You can follow him on Twitter: @ThePaulSRyan.\n\nWhat others are saying\n\nRep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., Twitter: Thank you Rod Rosenstein for appointing special counsel Robert Mueller, for protecting his independence, and for holding onto your job until those who are not in the president's party gained control of congressional subpoena power. History will remember you well.\n\nAndrew Prokop, Vox: Ordinarily, Jeff Sessions's departure would mean Rosenstein would become acting attorney general to replace him. But President Donald Trump used an obscure law to bypass the Justice Department's line of succession and install Matt Whitaker in the post. Whitaker was Sessions' chief of staff, but the White House viewed him as loyal because of his past public criticisms of Mueller. What's happened since has remained mysterious. Whitaker announced he would not recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller probe. But from what we can tell, the Mueller probe appears to be continuing.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., CNN: William Barr was sending freelance memos to the Trump administration making a case to undercut the Mueller investigation. So the deep concern will be if he comes in and Rosenstein is gone, is this just a preface to either undercutting the investigation or trying to keep the results of it hidden from the American public?\n\nWhat our readers are saying\n\nIn William Barr, the Justice Department finally has a strong leader that will make the decisions — something it didn't have with Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein knows he's now powerless and his role now will be as chief coffee maker — his time has passed.\n\n— Barry VanTrees\n\nAnother President Donald Trump appointee who has had enough. I understand that the shop that makes office nameplates for Trump appointees can't keep up.\n\n— Walt Stasinski\n\nOne step closer to Trump having special counsel Robert Mueller fired. Trump is setting himself up for a constitutional confrontation if he does so. Rosenstein: another reputation tarnished or ruined by Trump.\n\n— Joe Doerger\n\nGood news. Nothing will prevent or even delay Rosenstein from explaining everything to the House intelligence Committee's ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\n— Lawrence Berg\n\nTo join the conversations about topics on USA TODAY or provide feedback to this newsletter, email jrivera@usatoday.com, comment on Facebook, or use #tellusatoday on Twitter.
After months of debates on Medicare for All and taxes on billionaires, the Democratic presidential primary has been upended by questions on Iran, foreign policy and who is best fit to lead the country in a time of crisis.\n\nTwo of the race's leading candidates are seizing on that shift.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who built their campaigns appealing to opposite ends of the Democratic voter spectrum, sharpened their focus on world affairs after a U.S. airstrike killed top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq.\n\nThe killing inflamed tensions with Iran and Iraq and raised worries about whether the United States is again on the brink of a war in the Middle East.\n\nDuring campaign stops in Iowa over the weekend, Biden and Sanders criticized President Donald Trump for the airstrike. Both spent several days canvassing the state that will kick off the Democratic primary with the first-in-the-nation caucuses in 27 days.\n\nBefore the airstrike, 33% of voters rated foreign policy as an important issue affecting their choice for president, according to a poll by Suffolk University/USA TODAY in December. It ranked below the economy, health care, immigration and gun control but ahead of impeachment and climate change.\n\nBiden delivered a special address Tuesday in New York on the situation with Iran. Standing in front of American flags, Biden said the airstrike proved Trump to be dangerously incompetent. He accused the president of a haphazard decision process and a reckless disregard of the consequences that would surely follow. He added that Trump has failed to provide a sober-minded explanation for the airstrike, which he said has put the U.S. and Iran on a collision course.\n\nJoe Biden:The 2020 candidate shares his views on foreign policy, the economy and more\n\nAll we've heard from this administration is shifting explanations, evasive answers, repeated assertions of an imminent threat without the necessary evidence to support that conclusion, he said in a nearly 20-minute speech.\n\nThe only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy, Biden said.\n\nSanders, an independent from Vermont, has increasingly gone on the attack against Biden, calling his record weak and placing foreign policy atop his critique.\n\nJoe Biden voted and helped lead the effort for the war in Iraq – the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country, Sanders said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night.\n\nHow Biden, Sanders approach the Iran question\n\nFor Biden, the tension in the Middle East provides a chance to play up his foreign policy experience, both as vice president and as a longtime member and former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A poll by CNN in October found 56% of Democratic voters said Biden is best equipped to handle foreign policy.\n\nSpeaking to caucusgoers at a hotel Sunday in Grinnell, Iowa, Biden argued that the killing of Soleimani turned the Iranian military leader into a hero. He pointed to the thousands of mourners packing the streets of Iran.\n\nThey expect literally hundreds of thousands of supporters who were initially opposed to the government in Tehran now solidified around the leadership in Tehran, Biden said.\n\nMore:Campaigning in Iowa, Joe Biden predicts Iranian dominance in the Middle East after Soleimani's death, Iraqi vote\n\nBiden said Iran is in the driver's seat in the Middle East, noting the Iraqi parliament's vote to remove U.S. forces from the nation. He said Iran will speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon. He predicted Iranian leaders will become more popular in their own country as its citizens rally behind them after the attack.\n\nThis is a crisis totally of Donald Trump's making, Biden said.\n\nBernie Sanders:The 2020 candidate shares his views on foreign policy, climate change and more\n\nSanders, who has long run on an anti-war platform, used the Iran question to remind Democrats about his vote in the Senate against the war in Iraq. That's in contrast to Biden, whose record on the conflict could make him vulnerable among the more liberal wing of the party.\n\nSince October, Sanders has separated himself in polls from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the other top Democrat in the liberal lane, solidifying himself in second in recent national polls behind Biden. He overcome a heart attack that month and pundits who had written off his campaign. If the Democratic primary is as drawn out as it was in 2016, Sanders could set up his foreign policy differences with Biden as an issue for the months ahead as both men battle for votes.\n\nSaturday, Sanders opened a campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa, by calling for immediate congressional action to stop Trump from launching a war with Iran.\n\nOur founding fathers gave the responsibility over war not to the president but to Congress, Sanders said. That is very clear in the Constitution. And in my view, Congress must, must act in the face of a president who has shown time and time again that he cannot be relied upon to tell us the truth or to make well thought out decisions.\n\nMore:Bernie Sanders, campaigning in Iowa, says 'if Congress wants to go to war, let Congress have the guts to vote for war'\n\nThe day before, Sanders gave his first public statement on the killing of Soleimani, which he called an assassination and a dangerous escalation. He told a crowd in Anamosa, Iowa, that Trump promised to end endless wars, but tragically, his actions now put us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.\n\nI have consistently opposed this dangerous path to war with Iran. But we need to do more than just stop the potential of a war. We need to firmly commit to ending the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, in an orderly manner, not through a tweet.\n\nWhat do voters say?\n\nKenn Bowen, 69, a Sanders supporter from Iowa City, applauded the senator's remarks: He made no bones about it. He's against it, and he thinks this is wrong.\n\nI've seen the cost of war, both in money and lives, said Bowen, wearing a Vietnam veteran hat and a denim vest with a peace logo sewn on the back. He said he's worried that a war with Iran would spiral and pull in other world powers, such as China and Russia.\n\nBiden supporter Richard Marsh of Cedar Falls, Iowa, cited the former vice president's foreign policy experience as one reason for his support. Marsh, who was at Biden's headquarters in Waterloo on Saturday morning, said Biden's connections with other world leaders will create more stable relations in areas such as the Middle East.\n\nMarsh said he's worried the United States is on a path toward another war and believes Biden would not have ordered the strike that killed Soleimani.\n\nHe would have sat down and talked to them, Marsh said.\n\nMore:Timeline: How tensions escalated with Iran since Trump withdrew US from nuclear deal\n\nThe White House said the president ordered the strike because Soleimani plotted attacks that endangered American troops and officials.\n\nThe Trump campaign said in a statement Monday that the president is cleaning up Joe Biden's Iran's mess.\n\nOn Sunday, Iran effectively backed out of a nuclear deal with world powers, saying it would no longer abide by operational restrictions on its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration withdrew from the agreement, which was negotiated by President Barack Obama, in May 2018.\n\nHostilities between Tehran and Washington have escalated since Trump's withdrawal. The Trump administration blames Iran for a series of provocations in the region.\n\nIraq's parliament voted to expel the U.S. military from the country, prompting Trump to threaten deep sanctions against Iraq on Sunday.\n\nMore:Iran abandons commitments to nuclear deal after Gen. Qasem Soleimani killing\n\nWhat other leading Democratic candidates say\n\nOther Democrats, including Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, slammed Trump's airstrike before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nWarren, campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, said she questions the Trump administration's justification for the strike. She said the United States is not safer than it was a week ago.\n\nImmediately after they announced that they had killed this general, they had multiple different stories on why – they couldn't keep their story straight, she said. They pointed in all different directions, and now the president has taken us to the brink of war.\n\nWarren, who also called the airstrike an assassination, said the United States needs a president who is calm and steady-handed and who understands the importance of de-escalating and getting out of conflict – not someone who moves us closer and closer to the brink.\n\nTrump's tweets about attacks don't count as congressional notice, Warren says in Iowa\n\nButtigieg, who served as a naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan, said on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Monday that he has no interest in keeping or adding ground troops in Iraq and that the United States should not have invaded Iraq in the first place.\n\nHe said Soleimani has blood on his hands and was a bad actor in the region, but he questioned whether the Trump administration had a plan.\n\nWhat we've seen here is no evidence that there's been proper consultation with Congress, and more importantly and more dangerously, no evidence that they've really thought about the consequences.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; Nick Coltrain, Tyler Jett and Kim Norvell, Des Moines Register\n\nReach Joey Garrison and on Twitter @joeygarrison.
Jessica Guynn\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Facebook is cracking down on private gun sales.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Calif., company said late Friday it will ban users from coordinating private sales of firearms on the social network and on mobile app Instagram. The ban does not apply to licensed gun dealers for purchases completed off Facebook.\n\nPresident Obama and state attorneys general have increased pressure on Facebook to tighten restrictions on firearms because of the proliferation of posts that offer guns for sale, often without background checks.\n\nFacebook and Instagram users will no longer be able to offer or coordinate the private sale of firearms, gun parts and ammunition, the company said. That brings firearms in line with Facebook's ban on the private sales of marijuana, pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs.\n\nUsers can't buy and sell guns on Facebook itself but gun enthusiasts often connect there and sometimes make arrangements to buy, sell and trade guns.\n\nIn March 2014, Facebook took steps to limit sales of firearms including blocking minors from seeing posts about gun sales and trades and by requiring Facebook pages primarily used to promote the private sale of regulated goods and services to include language that reminds users to comply with laws and regulation.\n\nAt the time, an investigation by the technology blog VentureBeat found that adults and children were connecting on Facebook pages devoted to guns to buy, sell and trade firearms, sometimes in violation of federal and state gun laws.\n\nFederal law enforcement sources told VentureBeat that Facebook, Instagram and other social media services were emerging threats for unlawful gun transactions in the United States.\n\nMoms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had stepped up their demands for changes to Facebook's policies after gun arrests were tied to sales of guns facilitated through Facebook.\n\nOver the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another. We are continuing to develop, test, and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution, Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of product policy, said in an emailed statement.\n\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn@jguynn
Following the death of top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani on Jan. 3, a number of unverified and false posts have spread widely on the internet.\n\nThe surge of traffic resulting from Soleimani's death mixed with worries of a potential war caused the U.S. Selective Service's website to go down.\n\nThe agency tweeted Jan.3: Due to the spread of misinformation, our website is experiencing high traffic volumes at this time.\n\nSince the news of Soleimani's death, we've compiled a list of some of the false news that has appeared across social media and the web.\n\n1. Trump didn't tweet about the draft\n\nA screenshot of a tweet from President Donald Trump circulated widely on Facebook and Twitter indicating the start of a draft.\n\nThe tweet is fake. Trump has made no mention of a draft in connection to conflicts with Iran.\n\n2. Fraudulent texts of U.S. Army request to enter the military draft\n\nAfter a U.S. drone strike killed Soleimani, speculation about a potential war rose. Soon after, images of alleged text messages were shared on the web of what appeared to be official requests from the U.S. Army to enter the draft.\n\nIn a tweet Jan. 8, the U.S. Army noted the messages were fraudulent.\n\nFact check: The U.S. Army is NOT contacting anyone regarding the draft. If you are receiving texts, phone calls or direct messages about a military draft, they are not official communications from the U.S. Army\n\nCyberwar with Iran:How vulnerable is America?\n\nRead Trump's remarks on Iran:'Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.'\n\n3. A doctored photo of President Barack Obama shaking hands with Hassan Rouhani\n\nA photo of former President Barack Obama shaking hands with Hassan Rouhani was tweeted by U.S. Rep, Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., on Jan. 6.\n\nThe world is a better place without these guys in power, Gosar wrote.\n\nThe image is a doctored photo from a 2015 ad associated with a super PAC in support of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.. The original image, reported by the New York Times, was taken in 2011 and shows Obama shaking hands with then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Bali.\n\n4. Outdated images claiming Iranian attacks\n\nThese images spread as some people on Twitter unwittingly shared the dated images, which apparently were originally posted with a Jan. 8 story by Iranian news agency, IRNA.\n\nThis shared photo claimed to capture recent Iranian attacks on Ayn al Assad, an Iraqi Armed Forces and United States armed forces base in Iraq's Anbar province, but is actually a photo from Nov. 14, cited by a Google reverse search, that captures flames from Israeli missiles that struck in Gaza, not Iraq.\n\nThis image was perceived to be the first of the Sepah ballistic missile launch from Iran. In reality, this image is of smoke trails from ballistic missiles launched by Iran toward Syria on Oct. 1, 2018, according to a Google reverse search.\n\n5. Resurfaced fake tweet from Rep. Rashida Tlaib\n\nEarly last year, a social media post spread widely claiming Rep. Rashida Tlaib tweeted on Jan. 4: Americans have spent decades raping and pillaging my people. What goes around comes around. #FridayFeeling. The tweet was exposed to be a hoax.\n\nThe fake post has since resurfaced in a viral meme including a screenshot of the fake tweet with a social media user stating Tliab is anti-american and should not be in office. The meme also noted at the bottom: This was her comment on the Protesters Siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iraqi.\n\nFacebook has since flagged the post as false information.
Jesse Yomtov\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nUSA TODAY Sports is counting down the top 24 candidates on the 2018 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in advance of the Jan. 24 election results. The countdown is based on voting by our power rankings panel, which includes five Hall voters.\n\nNo. 18: Manny Ramirez\n\nRamirez's career speaks for itself. He was one of the most feared sluggers and greatest run-producers in the history of baseball. There's absolutely no arguing this.\n\nFrom 1995-2008, Ramirez batted .317 with a 1.013 OPS and 1,660 RBI, the most in baseball over that stretch. He won two World Series titles with the Boston Red Sox and his Manny Being Manny persona made him one of the more beloved players for fans everywhere.\n\nThat brings us to the elephant in the room and what will ultimately keep Ramirez out of the Hall of Fame for the foreseeable future: He tested positive twice for banned substances, once in 2009 and again in 2011.\n\nHALL COUNTDOWN\n\nThe case for: With Cleveland in the 1990s, Ramirez was a key cog of some of the game's most prolific offenses. His 165 RBI in 1999 were the most in a single season in more than 60 years.\n\nDays after Alex Rodriguez signed his 10-year, $252 million contract following the 2000 season, Ramirez signed a mega-deal of his own – $160 million with the Red Sox. It may have been the greatest free agent signing of all time, as Ramirez earned every single penny during his eight seasons in Boston.\n\nHis .996 career OPS is eighth in history. He ranks 16th all time with 1,122 extra-base hits,19th with 1,831 RBI and 15th in home runs with 555. Ramirez is seventh in career WAR among left fielders, trailing five Hall of Famers, Barry Bonds and Pete Rose.\n\nThe case against: While others have been excluded from the Hall of Fame based on the assumption of PED-usage, voters actually have the concrete proof that Ramirez violated the league's policy. Other than Rafael Palmeiro, Ramirez is the only player – up to this point – with real Hall credentials to be suspended under MLB's drug policy, which began in 2004.\n\nX-factors: In his first year on the ballot, Ramirez got 23.8% of the vote – an encouraging sign at first glance, considering that Palmeiro only received 11.5% in his debut on the ballot back in 2011. However, Ramirez's initial showing is on par with the 23.5% for Mark McGwire's first year. McGwire's support tapered off over his time on the ballot, finishing with 12.3% in his final year.\n\nIt's certainly possible that Ramirez will trend upwards in coming years, seeing as Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens have each gained about 17 points of support since 2013. Still, that could very well be the ceiling for both of them.\n\nConsensus: As great as he was, the two positive tests for performance-enhancers effectively wreck Ramirez's candidacy. Time will tell whether voters can forgive and forget, but don't expect that in the near future.\n\nGallery: 2018 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot
The Editorial Board\n\nYou're reading Our View, one of two perspectives in Today's Debate. For the Opposing View, read Cabinet picks are missed chance for change.\n\nSome presidents hire teams of rivals. President-elect Joe Biden is assembling a team of retreads. And thank goodness for that.\n\nBiden completed his Cabinet nominations two days after the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob — a tragic and all too appropriate coda to the Trump era. Boring is the new thrilling, CNN commentator Van Jones said a few days after Biden won the election. As President Donald Trump incites his supporters to violence and becomes increasingly erratic in his final days, not to mention making history as the first president to be impeached twice, boring is still an elusive goal.\n\nBut Biden holds out promise for duller days ahead. And by dull, we mean steady, professional and aligned with American values.\n\nExperience and expertise\n\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of experience and expertise, both in policy areas and in the workings of government, for the team that will confront the floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall havoc inflicted by Trump and his administration. Biden's nominees not only know what they're doing, some of them have literally done it before.\n\nAgriculture Secretary-designate Tom Vilsack and Surgeon General-designate Vivek Murthy held the same jobs in the Obama administration. Biden's secretary of State pick Antony Blinken and secretary of Homeland Security choice Alejandro Mayorkas were deputy secretaries in those departments during the Obama years.\n\nAttorney General nominee Merrick Garland, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, will return to the Justice Department, where he supervised several high-profile cases during the Clinton era. Michael Regan, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, would head the Environmental Protection Agency, where he previously served under the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations.\n\nSome of Biden's picks have never been part of an administration, but they make sense. Education Secretary nominee Miguel Cardona, a former public school teacher, principal and assistant superintendent of schools, has been Connecticut's education commissioner through the COVID-19 crisis. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, Biden's Labor secretary nominee, joined a union at age 21 and as mayor fought for labor causes such as the $15 minimum wage and paid family leave. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, the Commerce secretary nominee, led her state out of one of the nation's worst unemployment crises and earlier had founded the first venture capital firm in her state.\n\nTrump's scattershot Cabinet\n\nNone of this should be noteworthy, and yet it is, because it is such a stark departure from Trump's scattershot Cabinet selection criteria: Do well on Fox News? Look like a statesman? Pledge loyalty? Eager to weaken and disrupt their agency? Never met an Obama policy they wanted to keep?\n\nThis is how you end up with an oil CEO as secretary of State, a neurosurgeon as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, an acting director of national intelligence with no national intelligence background, an Education secretary with little knowledge of (and seemingly even less interest in) public education, and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director who seemed to forget for months that his primary, most essential job was to convey clear, science-based information and guidance on COVID-19 to states, the health sector and the public.\n\nDemocrats might want to remind their Republican colleagues of all this when they go after nominees such as Transportation Secretary designate Pete Buttigieg. The 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, served in the military, was a McKinsey management consultant and ran a creditable race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. That background stacks up nicely against Team Trump's John McEntee, 30, the presidential personnel director in charge of purging officials deemed disloyal, fired by the administration in 2018 for online gambling but brought back last year, and James Bacon, the college senior he hired as his director of operations.\n\nLike most of his Cabinet appointees, the White House staff Biden has chosen is also squarely in the category of been there, done that — starting with incoming chief of staff Ron Klain, who was vice presidential chief of staff for both Al Gore and Joe Biden, and later served as President Barack Obama's Ebola response coordinator.\n\nOne reason you need old hands is the old hands know where the old bodies might be buried, Biden said last month. He himself, at age 78, with decades of service in the Senate and as Obama's vice president, is the old hand in chief. By giving him the Democratic nomination and electing him president, voters made clear what they wanted.\n\nProgressives are dismayed by some of Biden's nominees, particularly the corporate business they did between stints in government. But as Trump continues to ignore a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans — and stokes the lies and violence that led to terror, gunfire, vandalism and death at the Capitol — Biden's focus on experience is not surprising.\n\nThere will be a time for fresh faces. Now is not that time.\n\n— By commentary editor Jill Lawrence on behalf of the Editorial Board.
Analysis: Gun Policy Now Election Issue\n\nA George Washington University faculty member sees the president's announcement on gun policy as just the first wedge in what may become a tricky issue for both Republicans and Democrats in 2016 general election. (Jan 5)
Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNASHUA, N.H. — Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders tangled in a fierce debate Thursday over the definition of a progressive and the direction of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn their first head-to-head debate — just five days before the New Hampshire primary — Clinton accused Sanders of waging an artful smear against her by criticizing contributions Wall Street bankers and others have contributed to her campaign and the super PAC supporting her, challenging him to cite a vote she had changed to advance their interests.\n\nSanders countered that contributions by powerful interests had corrupted the political system and shaped government policy in countless ways, from the deregulation of financial institutions in the 1990s to the expensive cost of drugs today.\n\nStanding side-by-side on a stage at the University of New Hampshire at Durham, the two were more combative and sometimes slashing toward one another than in their previous four debates, which had included long-shot contenders now out of the race. The tone reflected the high stakes and the nearing primary — and the conclusion that both campaigns have enough money and enough support to wage an extended battle for the nomination.\n\nClinton to Sanders: 'End the very artful smear'\n\nFifth Democratic debate: Highlights from New Hampshire\n\nThey projected fundamentally different approaches to what they agreed were mutual goals.\n\nClinton argued for pragmatism. A progressive is someone who makes progress; that's what I intend to do, she said, saying Sanders' proposals for Medicare for All and free college tuition were just not achievable.\n\nSanders called for a political revolution that would include major changes in national priorities and in the Democratic Party.\n\nThe debate, hosted by MSNBC, centered in part on a dispute that has been brewing on the campaign trail: Sanders' charge that Clinton wasn't a real progressive. Clinton argued that Sanders had cast himself as the self-proclaimed gatekeeper who determined who was a progressive, using a definition that would exclude even President Obama and Vice President Biden.\n\nProgressive enough? Clinton pushes back against Sanders\n\nIf we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was 'progressive' to vote against the Brady Bill five times, she said, raising Sanders' opposition to some gun laws popular with Democratic voters.\n\nSecretary Clinton does represent the establishment, Sanders replied. I represent ordinary, working Americans.\n\nAgain and again, he hammered his attack on the power of Wall Street and big banks. That issue continued to put Clinton on the defensive, including over $675,000 she received for three speeches to Goldman Sachs after resigning as secretary of State. Asked whether she would release the transcripts of those speeches she said she was willing to look into it but didn't commit to doing so.\n\nClinton says she'll 'look into' releasing paid speech transcripts\n\nTop takeaways from N.H. Democratic debate\n\nOn another controversy that dogs her, she insisted she was 100% confident that an ongoing FBI investigation into her exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of State wouldn't create problems for her. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever, saying with obvious exasperation that the dispute had reached a level of absurdity.\n\nBoth candidates agreed that the federal government should intervene to help Flint, Mich., deal with an environmental crisis that has polluted its drinking water with lead.\n\nThey did close on a friendly note. Clinton declined a question about whether she would consider Sanders as a running mate, but she did say that, if she won the nomination, the first person she would call to discuss the direction of the Democratic Party would be her current rival.\n\nOn our worst days, Sanders responded, I think it's fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.\n\nOn that, at least, they shook hands.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren added to her public comments about the U.S.-ordered airstrike that killed Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani after she was pressed by The View co-host Meghan McCain to acknowledge him as a terrorist.\n\nOf course he was, Warren said after a tense back-and-forth with McCain, who asked the question multiple times.\n\nThe Democratic top-tier presidential hopeful addressed recent criticism that her message on the Soleimani killing ordered by President Donald Trump appeared to have changed, because she referred to him once as a murderer and then later as a government official who was assassinated. Both are true, Warren said Tuesday.\n\nSoleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans, Warren tweeted after news of the airstrike surfaced. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.\n\nWarren on the issues:The 2020 candidate shares her views on foreign policy, climate change, health care and more\n\nIn a later tweet, Warren said that Trump had escalated tensions with Iran. Now he's assassinated a senior foreign military official. He's been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office—but the American people won't stand for it.\n\nI believe you respect the military and you respect our troops, McCain told Warren before reciting the multiple public statements. I don't understand the flip-flop. I don't understand why it was so hard to call him a terrorist.\n\nThis isn't a change. They're true, Warren said. The question is, what is the response that the president of the United States should make, and what advances the interests of the United States of America.\n\nMcCain interrupted to ask Warren whether Soleimani was a terrorist.\n\nHe's part of a group that's been designated--, Warren said before being interrupted.\n\nBut is he a terrorist? McCain interjected. Warren began giving the same response, when McCain again said, So he's not a terrorist?\n\nOf course he is, Warren said. He's part of a group that our federal government has designated as a terrorist. The question, though, is what's the right response? And the response that Donald Trump has picked is the most incendiary and has moved us to the edge of war.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also a 2020 contender, used the word assassination to refer to Soleimani's killing in a statement. But another 2020 Democrat, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, called that characterization outrageous.\n\nThis is a guy who had an awful lot of American blood on his hands, Bloomberg said in response to Sanders' statement.\n\nCandidates respond:2020 presidential contenders react to killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani\n\nTrump ordered the killing of the influential Iranian figure late last week, which the Defense Department labeled a defensive action, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained it as preventing an imminent threat against American diplomats and soldiers.\n\nWarren has questioned the president's timing for the strike, suggesting it is a reasonable question to ask whether Trump is trying to distract from impeachment in an interview with CNN on Sunday. People are asking, why in this moment? Warren said.\n\nThe president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he's deeply upset about that, she said.\n\nElection 2020:As Soleimani killing jolts presidential race, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders seize the moment\n\nMy take on this is, Soleimani was a bad guy, but the question is, what's the right response? Warren said on The View.\n\nWarren also hit Trump for his tweet suggesting the United States would target Iranian cultural sites if the regime retaliated for Soleimani's killing. It would be a war crime if the United States did that, Warren said.\n\nThe president has since backed off that statement, saying Tuesday, I like to obey the law.\n\nBut think of it: They kill our people, they blow up our people and then we have to be very gentle with their cultural institutions. But I'm OK with it, Trump said.\n\nHe has moved us close to the edge of war. He's put our country on the edge of going to war. We know that the Iranians are going to respond, Warren said. The job of the president of the United States is to keep America safe, to have a coherent, long-term strategy, not to make compulsive decisions.\n\nMore:Trump backs off threat to attack Iranian cultural sites amid rising tensions after Soleimani death
Ray Locker\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe rapidly unfolding saga of President Trump and the connections between the Russian government, Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Trump administration involves a series of political operatives, government officials and diplomats worthy of a John le Carré novel. Here are some of the key players.\n\nPaul Manafort\n\nManafort, Trump's former campaign manager, represented the former leader of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, when the longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin ran Ukraine. A longtime lobbyist in Washington and international political consultant, Manafort signed on to run Trump's campaign but left in August following disclosures that his name surfaced in secret ledgers kept by the Yanukovych government that showed he was paid $12.7 million. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Manafort spoke last year to Russian intelligence officials in telephone calls that were monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, Manafort denied any contact with Russian officials, either directly or indirectly.\n\nMichael Flynn\n\nThe recently departed national security adviser worked for the state-owned Russia Today after he was fired by former president Barack Obama as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He advocated for closer relations with Russia. In 2015, Flynn traveled to Moscow to speak at the 10th anniversary gala for Russia Today in an event also attended by Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid for the visit, which — if not approved by the secretaries of Defense and State — would violate federal law. He has not said how much he was paid or whether it was approved.\n\nHis downfall started when U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a telephone call from Flynn to Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, in which the two discussed new sanctions to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration.\n\nRussia Today was identified in an intelligence assessment as one of the Kremlin's top purveyors of propaganda and misinformation in the 2016 presidential election, leading to a heightened sensitivity over Flynn's participation in the event, which Flynn said was arranged by a speaker's bureau. House Democrats have called for an investigation into those connections.\n\nCarter Page\n\nPage, who runs an investment company called Global Energy Capital, was named as an early foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He was accused last year by former Senate minority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., of being a conduit between Trump and the Russian government, which Page denied. Last year, Page gave a speech in which he accused the U.S. government of having a hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change toward Russia and other former Soviet republics.\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nThe president of Russia has been the source of fascination for Trump for years. During the 2016 election, both Trump and Vice President Pence, then the governor of Indiana, praised Putin's leadership style in contrast to Obama's.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied that Putin had anything to do with the Russian-led hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails, which spawned a series of leaks from the website WikiLeaks during the final weeks of the 2016 general election campaign. WikiLeaks published multiple emails from John Podesta, a longtime associate of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, that cast Clinton and the campaign in a negative light.\n\nSergey Kislyak\n\nKislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, received a telephone call from Flynn last December in which the two men discussed new sanctions that were to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration. The Obama administration also expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the United States for their alleged role in interfering with the U.S. elections, a move that was expected to bring a Russian response. Instead, Putin elected to do nothing. On March 1, the Washington Post reported that then-Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a Trump campaign surrogate and now attorney general, met twice with Kislyak in 2016 but told the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings that he had not. On March 2, Sessions recused himself from any involvement in whatever investigations the FBI and Justice Department were conducting into the Russian role in the elections.\n\nContributing: Gregory Korte\n\nRead more:\n\nRussian ambassador Sergey Kislyak leaves trail of U.S. election meddling\n\nDonald Trump's ties to Russia go back 30 years\n\nTrump denies Russia 'conspiracy theories'\n\nDemocrats press for Trump-Russia probes on all fronts\n\nThe first 100 days of the Trump presidency
Benjamin H. Friedman\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe reckless decision to kill Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, along with several other Iraqi and Iranian officials, cannot be undone. But it can be an impetus for the belated exit of U.S. forces from Iraq, who may still avoid needless trouble.\n\nIraq's parliament passed a resolution calling for the U.S. military forces (along with other foreign units) to be expelled. Washington should accept the invitation.\n\nEven critics of killing Soleimani note he was a murderer, who had U.S. blood on his hands. While this is true, it's largely beside the point. U.S. foreign policy does not exist to dispense global justice by punishing the wicked. It exists to serve U.S. security and prosperity, and protect our liberties here at home. Talk of justice distracts from consideration of consequences. Soleimani's death is likely to lead to bad ones, possibly including broader war, especially if we insist on leaving relatively small numbers of forces nearby to absorb the trouble this week's strike set off.\n\nSoleimani was not a rogue outlaw, but a military official of a sovereign government we were not at war with, making his killing an assassination. His actions, however evil, served Iranian policy. Even Iranians with no love for his ilk now bridle with nationalist outrage. Iranians rally around the flag, too. Adding to the outrage will be Saturday's news the U.S. strike was a long-planned punitive measure aimed at punishing Iran for actions taken by the Kataeb Hezbollah militias it supports in Iraq — and not a means to stop an imminent attack on U.S. forces as Trump administration officials claimed.\n\nAn Iran with nuclear weapons is a real, frightening possibility\n\nIran is unlikely to directly attack U.S. forces, given the consequences. But they are now substantially more likely to resume their nuclear weapons program. That is not only because of the political boost U.S. action has given to hardliners there, but also because of President Donald Trump's bellicosity. Subjecting Iranians to taunts and threats to destroy their cultural heritage — with U.S. forces stationed around them in Iraq and Afghanistan — reminds them of their weakness and the deterrent value of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe more direct consequences are likely to take place in Iraq, where the Iran-linked Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) militias are likely to escalate their attacks on U.S. military forces and other personnel. That could spark a broader conflict with Iran, given the Trump administration's belligerence.\n\nU.S. forces should have left Iraq already. Once the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group's caliphate was defeated, the U.S. military mission in Iraq became murky. And as the Trump administration pulled out of Iran deal and ratcheted up economic pressure on Iran over the last several years, U.S. forces became a magnet for trouble, more bait for a disastrous war with Iran than a means to U.S. security.\n\nThe right decision:Donald Trump showed restraint, then resolve, in killing of Iran's Qassem Soleimani\n\nWith the drone strike, which killed not only Soleimani but Mahdi al Muhandis, Deputy Commander of Iraq's PMF and several of his colleagues, stationing U.S. forces in Iraq became even less tenable. The PMF forces are a collection of Shi'ite militias, officially but in fact loosely subordinated to the Iraqi government, that include as many as 500,000 fighters by some estimates. Many of those militiamen, who recently and quite brutally helped fight IS, as did Soleimani, are now likely to turn on the U.S. forces — especially if they are kept in Iraq in the face of Iraqi demands they go. Whatever their quality, the militias manpower makes them a formidable threat.\n\nThe people of Iraq don't and will not want us there\n\nPopular anger against the United States in Iraq, not only from the drone strike, but the airstrikes days before, which Iraq's government opposed — not to mention to the botched occupation and civil war it set off — is inescapable now. That makes it difficult for any Iraqi government to back the U.S. force presence or work energetically to suppress renewed Shi'ite resistance to U.S. forces.\n\nViolence directed against U.S. forces in Iraq is not likely limited to there. Trump officials insist they will blame militias attacks on Iran, even when it's not clear they are doing Tehran's bidding. However unintentionally, they have created a circumstance where U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria face increased attacks, which might then draw them into war with Iran. That is the policy that has brought us to this precipice. No U.S. security goal justifies that risk.\n\nThis is personal:War with Iran is terrifying prospect for Americans with family in the Middle East, like me\n\nThe idea that U.S. forces have to remain in Iraq to defeat the remnant of IS ignores the evident will of Iraqis to do that themselves, the historical lesson that U.S. forces have helped spark rather than quell renewed insurgency, and the ability to return to strike IS in extremis. Continuing the mission would be a bad idea, even if didn't risk a massive and utterly counterproductive war with Iran.\n\nRather than send more U.S. forces to the region where they will join in vulnerability with those already there, the United States should remove its forces from Iraq and begin exiting the broader region. As the events of the last two weeks underline, the smattering of U.S. forces in the region are not accomplishing anything useful, but are enough to pull the United States into another needless war.\n\nBenjamin H.

Kathleen Hopkins\n\nAsbury Park (N.J.) Press\n\nTOMS RIVER, N.J. — An Ocean County jury has rendered a $10.1 million verdict against a drunken driver who killed Ocean Gate Police Officer Jason Marles in a fiery crash on Thanksgiving Day 2010.\n\nThe jury on Friday held Erick P. Uzcategui, 36, of Manchester solely responsible for the death of Marles, 32, of Point Pleasant Beach, a nine-year veteran of the Ocean Gate police force. It awarded the $10.1 million to Marles' estate, according to Scott Kenneally and William V. Kelly, attorneys for the estate.\n\nThe money will be held in trust for Marles' two children, who were ages 4 and 5 when their father was killed, Kelly said. The children are now 9 and 11.\n\n'Affluenza' teen locked up in Texas juvenile center\n\nThe jury found no responsibility on behalf of Bamboo Bar, a Seaside Heights tavern also named in the civil suit filed on behalf of the Marles estate by Kenneally and Kelly of the Toms River law firm Starkey, Kelly, Kenneally, Cunningham and Turnbach.\n\nAt the civil trial, Kelly and Kenneally failed to convince the jury that Uzcategui was served alcohol at Bamboo while already visibly intoxicated before he got into the crash that killed Marles.\n\nThe verdict was announced Friday after an eight-day trial before Superior Court Judge Arnold B. Goldman.\n\nWe are gratified that the jury recognized the devastating loss suffered by the Marles family, although, unfortunately, nothing can bring Jason back,'' said Kelly.\n\nWe hope that the trial can bring some closure to the family and serve as a testament to the tremendous impact that Jason had during his life on everyone who met him,'' Kenneally said.\n\nUzcategui was driving a loaner vehicle owned by Hunterdon BMW when the crash occurred, according to Kenneally. The dealership had a substantial insurance policy on it, Kenneally said.\n\nUzcategui was tried in 2014 and convicted of vehicular homicide in the death of Marles. He is serving an eight-year prison term in Southern State Correctional Facility in Delmont, Cumberland County.\n\nAt the 2014 criminal trial before Superior Court Judge James M. Blaney, Assistant Ocean County Prosecutor Patrick Sheehan produced evidence that Uzcategui was impaired by alcohol and cocaine when he crashed his BMW sport-utility vehicle into Marles' off-duty Jeep Grand Cherokee in the northbound lanes of the Garden State Parkway in Toms River on Nov. 25, 2010. The impact sent the officer's vehicle spinning and crashing into a guardrail before it overturned and burst into flames.\n\nMarles, who was on his way home from an overtime shift looking for drunken drivers, immediately perished in the accident, which occurred at 3:22 a.m. at mile marker 83.3 on the Parkway. Kenneally and Kelly said he suffered massive head and chest injuries.\n\nUzcategui told authorities after the crash that he had consumed four or five drinks and some cocaine beforehand. His blood-alcohol level was 0.155, or almost double the legal limit for driving of 0.08, almost two hours after the crash, according to Kenneally. At Uzcategui's criminal trial, an expert for the state testified his blood-alcohol level would have been about 0.185 at the time of the accident.\n\nMarles' mother, Patricia Engrassia, and stepfather, Joseph Engrassia, a Seaside Heights detective, were among a number of witnesses who testified at the civil trial about Marles' life and the devastation caused by his death, according to Kenneally and Kelly.\n\nThey really want to express their gratitude to the jury,'' Kenneally said on behalf of the Engrassias. The verdict impacted them greatly.''​\n\nThe jury awarded $5,082,275 for Marles' pain and suffering and $5 million for economic damages to his estate, they said.\n\nFollow Kathleen Hopkins on Twitter: @Khopkinsapp
President-elect Joe Biden will nominate longtime diplomat William Burns to serve as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the transition committee said in a news release.\n\nBurns, a career diplomat who served in the Middle East and Russia, will inherit the country's premier intelligence agency as national security and espionage from rival nations such as China, Iran and Russia are of chief concern to the incoming Biden administration.\n\nThe Biden transition team touted Burns as well-prepared for the challenge, noting he has the experience and skill to marshal efforts across government and around the world to ensure the CIA is positioned to protect the American people.\n\nBurns shares my profound belief that intelligence must be apolitical and that the dedicated intelligence professionals serving our nation deserve our gratitude and respect, Biden said in a statement.\n\nAmbassador Burns will bring the knowledge, judgment, and perspective we need to prevent and confront threats before they can reach our shores, he continued.\n\nA national security expert with decades of experience serving under Democratic and Republican presidents, Ambassador Bill Burns has a deep understanding of the global threats and challenges facing our country, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said in a statement.\n\nHe will lead the CIA with independence and integrity, always honoring our nation's intelligence professionals, she assured.\n\nBurns left the U.S. Foreign Service in 2014 after 33 years of working in diplomacy under Democratic and Republican administrations. Burns served as the deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration, only the second career diplomat to serve in the position.\n\nBurns was ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008, the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs from 2001-2005 and the ambassador to Jordan from 1998 to 2001.\n\nMerrick Garland:Biden's pick for attorney general\n\nMost recently, Burns was president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank with a focus on foreign policy and international affairs.\n\nBiden selected Burns over a field of career intelligence officials, several of whom had come under scrutiny from some Democrats for their involvement in controversial espionage and torture programs in their careers.\n\nMichael Morell, former acting director of the CIA, and David Cohen, a former senior Treasury Department official who served as deputy CIA director under President Barack Obama, were also reportedly under consideration.\n\nSome of Burns' writings, as a diplomat and scholar, may shed light on his approach to intelligence. He has been an outspoken critic of Trump-era foreign policy and reflected in his published writings of the shortcomings of past administrations.\n\nWe highlighted the deep sectarian fault lines in Iraq. ... We emphasized the dangers of civil unrest and looting if the Iraqi military and security institutions collapsed. ... We noted the likelihood that ... Iran could wind up as a major beneficiary, Burns presciently warned in 2002 in a memo titled Perfect Storm about the possible outcome of U.S. intervention in Iraq.\n\nDespite the notable accomplishment of the Iran nuclear deal, adjusting the terms of our engagement was harder than Obama had anticipated, Burns wrote in The Atlantic in 2019.\n\nWhile we saw the Arab Spring as a window of opportunity and the Iran agreement as a demonstration of the value of hard-nosed diplomacy, most of our friends saw them as existential dangers. They continually exaggerated our ability to affect events, and we did the same, he argued.\n\nBurns has identified intelligence as a key part of American foreign policy going forward, noting it must be used in concert with diplomacy and military force, as well as economic and cultural soft power.\n\nFor better or worse, we will never again enjoy the monopoly we once had – or imagined we had – in foreign policymaking and execution. We have to come to terms with that, Burns said in 2019 in an interview with the American Foreign Service Association.\n\nBut State ought to be the conductor of the foreign policy orchestra. That means bringing together the soft power of ideas, economic incentives and sanctions, intelligence-gathering and covert action, military assistance and the threat of force to achieve policy aims, Burns said.
Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe bus industry complained Thursday that a prohibition against motorcoaches and charter buses at D.C. Metro stations for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration is extremely disappointing and unnecessary.\n\nMore than 100,000 people are expected to arrive in the capital on buses for the inauguration Jan. 20, according to the American Bus Association, which represents 800 companies, two-thirds of all motorcoaches on the road.\n\nPeter Pantuso, the association's CEO, said the prohibition would exacerbate congestion and security risks and frustrate travelers pouring into the city. The prohibition for Jan. 19 to 21 is a change from past policy, he said.\n\nThe decision to prohibit motorcoach access to all Metrorail facilities, without any coordination with the industry or the traveling public, is extremely disappointing and unnecessary, Pantuso wrote Thursday to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority CEO Paul Wiedefeld. This also is yet another missed opportunity for WMATA to prioritize customer service.\n\nThe D.C. inaugural planning committee announced its transportation plan with road closures Jan. 6. The plan anticipated that 1,500 private buses would bring 100,000 people to inaugural events during the three-day period.\n\nThe motorcoaches and charter buses were required to obtain a parking permit for $175 from the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles and to reserve parking in advance on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nThe only charter-bus parking available is at RFK Stadium, which is adjacent to a subway station. Travelers could also walk or take shuttle buses from the lot, according to the city's plan. The stadium is about 2 miles from the U.S. Capitol, according to Google Maps.\n\nCharter buses will not be able to park and/or drop off passengers at any Metro station in Washington D.C., Virginia or Maryland, the plan said. Parking is only available at RFK Stadium and must be reserved in advance.\n\nWMATA referred questions about the inauguration to D.C. police. And police referred questions to the city Department of Transportation, which didn't immediately respond to a call seeking comment.
United Airlines is joining other carriers in tightening its policies on emotional support animals.\n\nStarting Jan. 7, the animals will not be able to travel on flight more than eight hours long.\n\nIn a statement, the airline said it has seen an increase in the number of on-board incidents with the animals, many of which are not used to spending a long time in the cabin of an aircraft.\n\nUnited also will not accept kittens or puppies younger than four months as emotional support animals, in-cabin pets or service animals.\n\nAnimals under the age of four months typically have not received the necessary vaccinations that help ensure the safety of our employees and customers, the airline said.\n\nSpirit Airlines cracks down on comfort animals\n\nUnited joins Delta Air Lines and Spirit Airlines in setting more restrictions on emotional support animals. Those two airlines require at least 48 hours' notice to bring an emotional support or psychiatric service animal on a flight. They also require more documentation.\n\nUnited implemented similar policies on March 1.\n\nPreviously, airlines have been more accommodating to such pets, only requiring that a passenger provided a letter from a licensed mental health professional to an airport agent on the day of travel.\n\nCritics have said that mental health professionals have given out such letters too freely.\n\nPassengers must pay a fee for in-cabin pets. But United does not charge for emotional support or service animals.\n\nUnited is also limiting the acceptance of emotional support animals to dogs and cats. Acceptable service animals will now be limited to dogs, cats and miniature horses.\n\nThe airline will honor reservations made prior to today under the previous policy with the approved documentation.
Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhen most of us start planning for retirement, we think about things like what our living costs will be and how much money we'll have access to. Many of us, in fact, get so focused on how much we are or aren't saving that we fail to make one critical move: creating a will or living trust.\n\nIn a recent Caring.com study, 58% of American adults admitted to not having either type of crucial document in place. Even scarier, among adults with children under the age of 18, that figure climbed to 64% of folks without a formal estate plan.\n\nNow the good news is that older Americans are more likely to have a will or trust than their younger counterparts. Here's how the data breaks down:\n\nAge Group 18 to 36 Percentage of People With a Will or Trust 22% 37 to 52 36% 53 to 71 60% 72 and older 81%\n\nData source: Caring.com.\n\nThough it's not surprising to see that almost 80% of younger Americans don't have a will, it's an attitude that can hurt Millennials as easily as it can folks 20 or 30 years their senior. And while you might think you have plenty of time to draw up a will, or that not having one isn't such a big deal, it's a mistake that could be far costlier than you might imagine.\n\nExcuses, excuses\n\nIt's easy enough to come up with a reason for not putting together an estate plan. Among those surveyed by Caring.com, the most common excuses for neglecting a will or trust were not having enough assets or just not getting around to it. And then there's the reason some of us don't want to share out loud: Contemplating mortality can be a disturbing process, and many people can't bring themselves to sit down and face it.\n\nBut if you don't create a formal will or trust, there's no guarantee that your wishes will be carried out once you pass. And even if you don't have a ton in the way of assets, that can still cause the loved ones you leave behind an undue dose of anguish during an already trying time.\n\nWhy have a will?\n\nOne of the most significant arguments for having a will is that without one, there's no telling what might happen to your minor children once you're no longer around. But if you do create a will, you'll be able to appoint a guardian for your children so you know they'll be well taken care of.\n\nA will can also help ensure that your assets are distributed equitably among your heirs. Furthermore, if you die without a will, your assets will be distributed based on the laws of your state – laws that won't necessarily match your actual wishes. For example, the laws of your state might dictate that in the absence of a will, your assets will automatically be divided among your children. But if you'd rather leave a chunk of cash to your nieces and nephews, your desired beneficiaries might never see that money if there's no will to spell that out.\n\nLook at trusts as well\n\nIn addition to creating a will, you might also consider establishing a trust, the exact type of which will depend on your specific needs and level of assets. While trusts can be costly to set up, in many circumstances, the benefits they offer far outweigh the expense.\n\nA revocable living trust, for example, gives you the flexibility to manage your assets during your lifetime while ensuring that your wishes are carried out once you pass. These trusts also allow you to avoid the costly, time-consuming process that is probate. Irrevocable trusts offer less flexibility during your lifetime, but they can be a smart solution for larger estates.\n\nBecause there are several trust fund options to choose from, your best bet is to sit down with an estate planning attorney and get help identifying the one that's right for you. Keep in mind that without a trust, you could subject your heirs to a larger estate tax bill than is necessary. Though most Americans don't have to worry about estate taxes, they're a concern among wealthy families looking to preserve more of their assets for future generations.\n\nThat said, you don't need to be wealthy to establish a trust, and you certainly don't need to be wealthy to create a will. Even if you have few assets and no dependents, it still pays to set up an estate plan -- if not for your own sake, then for that of the people who are most important to you.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

USA TODAY\n\nPresident Obama announced executive actions to address gun violence on Tuesday. The plan includes clarifying who is a gun dealer required to run checks on buyers, as well as hiring more FBI analysts to conduct the checks. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nAnd how, exactly, would these measures make it harder for criminals to arm themselves? In the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Adam Lanza killed his mom, took her guns to a gun-free zone and killed a bunch of kids.\n\n— Kurt Smith\n\nPresident Obama has demonstrated the true compassion and care of a great leader. He knows what it means to be with grief-stricken families and communities that have been torn apart by gun violence.\n\n— Ken Kornfeld\n\nThese measures assume the criminals use weapons that they, themselves, buy.\n\n— Jack Muth\n\nWhat astonishes me is how callous, cold and indifferent some people are to gun-related violence. It's so easy to politicize and explain away all these senseless deaths.\n\nI challenge everyone to offer some sage wisdom or creative ideas on how to decrease the obvious problem we have with gun-related deaths in this country. Think about it, and spare me those cheap shots taken at President Obama and the establishment.\n\n— Michael Anthony Shea\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nPresident Obama has no right to go over the head of Congress on gun legislation. Also, if he is going to bring someone to the White House who has been hurt by gun violence, then do the same for families who lost loved ones because of illegal immigration, such as the family of Kate Steinle. She was fatally shot in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. This policy, which protects undocumented immigrants, led to her death. The president is a poor excuse for a leader of all Americans. Instead, he stands for just the ones whose political views resemble his.\n\nGarry Allyn DeManty; Stockton, Calif.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nObama takes small steps on guns: Our view\n\nWe asked what our followers thought about President Obama taking executive actions on guns. Comments from Twitter are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nAmericans should be tired of talk and no action each time a mass shooting kills children.\n\n— @christeelove1\n\nIt is progress in the absence of action. Many support more gun control, but the gun lobby does not, and so Congress does not.\n\n— @realericg\n\nThis is an overreach. More gun laws won't stop the violence.\n\n— @bshelton77\n\nThe Boston Marathon bombers didn't need guns. Guns don't kill people, people kill people.\n\n— @MichaelMar54\n\nThe GOP refuses to understand that universal background checks do not equal taking guns away.\n\n— @jetsjets\n\nObama is circumventing the legislature. He refuses to accept checks and balances.\n\n— @edwewers\n\nBackground checks are fine, but many crimes result from illegally acquired weapons. Criminals don't care!\n\n— @scurvemond\n\nFor more discussions, follow @USATOpinion or #tellusatoday.
Thousands of demonstrators in cities across Iran faced tear gas and accused security forces of firing live ammunition as police aggressively countered intensifying protests prompted by the downing of a Ukrainian commercial jet.\n\nThe New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran posted video of crowds fleeing tear gas clouds in Tehran's Freedom Square on Sunday night. Another video showed a bloodied woman saying she had been hit with a bullet fired by police.\n\nDemonstrators shouted anti-government slogans including: They are lying that our enemy is America. Our enemy is right here!\n\nGen. Hossein Rahimi, denied claims his officers opened fire, saying only that tear gas was fired in some areas. The claims come after security forces were accused of opening fire on demonstrators during protests over fuel price increases in November, when hundreds reportedly died in clashes with police.\n\nPolice treated people who had gathered with patience and tolerance, Rahimi told Iranian media.\n\nStill, the size of the protests paled compared to the millions who turned out to mourn the death of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, viewed as a terrorist by the U.S., who was killed in a drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump in Iraq 10 days ago. Those crowds shouted hate-filled slogans aimed at the U.S. and Trump. Since Saturday, however, the protests have targeted the Iranian military, the government and even Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nTug of war: In Trump vs. Tehran: Iraqis caught in the middle\n\nUkraine International Airlines Flight 752 had just taken off Wednesday from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport bound for Kiev, Ukraine, when it exploded, killing all 176 aboard. Eighty-two of the victims were Iranians.\n\nAs the nation mourned, Iranian officials quickly blamed the tragedy on a technical failure, a story they stuck with until Friday.\n\nAli Rabiei, a government spokesman, insisted that was when Iran's civilian officials learned the plane had been shot down by Iran's Revolutionary Guard.\n\nWe did not lie, Rabiei said. He also said the U.S. shared in the blame because its aggressive tactics had the military on edge.\n\nAmir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Aerospace Force of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, said that when he heard his forces downed the plane, he wished he were dead.\n\nHajizadeh said Iran's air defense systems had been put on the highest level of readiness for a possible cruise missile attack. He said the operator manning the system had called for a halt in flights in the region.\n\nThe air defense system incorrectly detected the plane as an incoming cruise missile, and the operator called for orders. But the communication network failed, he said. Hajizadeh said the operator then took the wrong decision of firing on the perceived threat.\n\nFor a lifetime, we put our life on the line for the people, and today we put our honor on the line for God and face the cameras in such difficult circumstances, he said.\n\nIranian leaders have tried to spread the blame to Trump for his threats of military reprisals. Tensions between the nations have been on the rise since the Trump administration exited the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, reimposing sanctions and pursuing a maximum pressure policy on Tehran.\n\nThe Iranian press provided some coverage of the protests. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that up to 1,000 people were protesting at various points in the capital. Protests also were reported in other cities.\n\nThe Iranian news media gave better play, however, to students who gathered in front of the British embassy on Sunday chanting death to Britain and the British Embassy should be closed.\n\nBritish Ambassador to Tehran Robert Macaire had been briefly detained during a protest in front of the Amir Kabir University in downtown Tehran. Fars said he had been provoking tens of protesters upset with how the government handled the crash.
